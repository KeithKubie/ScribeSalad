00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Good evening, excuse me for a little delay 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.649
 people are praying for the technicians to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.120
 who accompanied developer barbosa a 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.380
 time ago the structure a little 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.269
 different 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.610
 to substitute an Argentine for the miner 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 the exchange started well 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 where are people have watched 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 Live 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 is however in galt today after editing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 video is also recording 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.010
 available on channel 2 of sailing through the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.539
 extension can watch by page 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 ibge will also link to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 over there 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 well this is an event that is was inspired 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.219
 in the event that is done in the United States 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.670
 event is actually a personal program 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.500
 Do what you do is the tomato and they 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.149
 analyze the applications we have 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.559
 some applications that brazil when the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.969
 collective goes to the attack 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.770
 He has done a review plate. I have not seen it. 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 no one to publish anything like politics 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360
 provided that it is not Finnish 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.350
 against the terms of use of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.750
 playstation 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 You can play, if you want, right? 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.309
 It is clear that it has good applications 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.589
 bad the good the bad has the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 love in every way but we 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 has a currency of exchange, we can 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.380
 speak as soon as part of the future ne 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.570
 the application can be feature must 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.460
 go through a few attempts to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 According to some online games, you have to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.350
 have some kind of review we do 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.390
 Review in Brazil, we can not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 of many people and a way that he 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.820
 found to do this for more 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.220
 people 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.110
 is to pick up some applications and do this 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 review captive challenge playing some 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.570
 points that will serve the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 developers 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.720
 It's not today's pink today. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.590
 in partnership with ctg são paulo 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.630
 Is anyone there? 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 São Paulo is suffering by helping to film 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 what a hugo cheer is and we make editing that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.630
 consecutive that you submit to that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.909
 page there between the applications there 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 usually how the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.740
 google team we even choose 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.030
 the applications and do the review there 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.390
 featuring is also powered marine 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.100
 android developer advocate is based 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.810
 here in Sao Paulo 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.520
 you may have seen some maybe more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.989
 I hope you have seen one of the videos 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 something I produce that are the videos 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.440
 technical and android 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.280
 I think some news may come 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 for me there 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.950
 but as it is a very cocoa plan were the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.470
 three applications that we have selected 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.260
 the first one was the brandsclub né 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.090
 that the part with the pension of the own 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.190
 tok shop then accompanies the largest club 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 from Brazil wherever you are and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.709
 pay attention to the renowned brands with 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.330
 90% of the survey compares the high 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.459
 in 4.2 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.500
 everyone has recently 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.810
 have on the internet watching later 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.090
 See you want to get the qr code for 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.300
 lead straight to the store 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.420
 another who has already chosen the sounds does not 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.190
 certain names once same with you or 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.200
 custom music you 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.640
 may want country with your style o 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.430
 corinthians buy a ranking with the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.370
 most heard on each artist's albums 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.050
 said digital media assessment 4.8 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.560
 it is also the educational qr code of today is the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.440
 the team died because I lost what 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.660
 Can you manage finances? 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.390
 personal finance of the company's day 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.890
 web in a simple intelligent way 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.410
 protected with high security and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.440
 reliability 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.970
 language technology rating 4.9 good 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.860
 beans that the three applications are 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.880
 very well rated however with notes 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.010
 above 4,541 already has a requirement that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.470
 to be prominent in place torque 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.860
 is the minimum will have evaluation above 4 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.570
 It's a must have at least 11 people 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.380
 that reviewed application does not have to have 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.160
 note 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.750
 at least above 4 and there is the whole 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.690
 guy issue from there and we will 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.810
 discuss a little bit of each application 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.100
 good first people do not start with 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.720
 brandsclub staff to invite 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.079
 someone who has been writing here 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.079
 for me here please, everybody then there 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.570
 already known by the wife of 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.420
 sail for vans 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.640
 go ahead and that's July in the face of 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.730
 with those adriana is one thing 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.260
 stay comfortable, the sound is coming and going 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.570
 It's good to talk a little bit about the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.710
 application of patients than the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.320
 application that works the most it's a 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.340
 club club is actually 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.500
 an e-commerce based flash and 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.450
 mails then we have campaigns 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.310
 campaigns last a while 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.080
 Mother Ana says 5 to 6 days and the user 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.640
 you can go in there and navigate within 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.260
 shopping campaigns 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.600
 this is basically what it was thought of 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.640
 first for web after was employee 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.280
 had an android that exactly it already 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.650
 there was a good time to travel a few years 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.690
 that's where we invested in the application 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.190
 It's the following I'll stay here, I'll do it. 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.740
 a documentary we can combat a 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.690
 Talk about the app then July 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.360
 come on the code you can practice 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.610
 same cup only then just to remind myself 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.870
 I'll make some comments that maybe 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.040
 we can continue I will not repeat the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.320
 same things 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.780
 And today is the idea today was more 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.490
 to focus on which standards of 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.260
 android development and also in 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.490
 navigation that when we noticed 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.020
 many applications but they have 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.979
 sin a little bit this part of 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.530
 navigation 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.450
 It's good the first thing we do. 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.560
 Seeing there looks that focuses on the application 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.560
 to have an express looking screen 

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:48.170
 and it does not only have to come out of the 

00:10:51.380 --> 00:11:02.810
 accident is that the client software is 

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:21.510
 call the ex's staff and went riding 

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.130
 who knows how to do it live is who does not know 

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:28.350
 does this in fact is Flemish color in the 

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.120
 use of it is sure have to wear the veil 

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.019
 phenomenon but the drama that is living 

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.610
 here my orders navigation area 

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:38.699
 My account is that 80 of the problems 

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.440
 the campaigns in my orders are areas of the 

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:41.910
 application you can not at least 

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.709
 name of another hidden 

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.420
 if I do not go on the menu I do not know what it requires 

00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:46.949
 your part of my requests, right? 

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.310
 in this part that we recommend using 

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:52.740
 would be an example navigation dollar is that 

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.110
 she is the same as him - including the 

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.190
 left to right and that's more 

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.709
 intuitive 

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.870
 the staff use or you can use this 

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:02.519
 the same theme, the pilot has to 

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.320
 example may confuse the electrons you 

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:07.079
 click down the list of circles by 

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.269
 example tripoli campaigns my requests 

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:14.100
 My account would be nice 

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:16.680
 ok, good shopping cart 

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.569
 the shopping cart and obviously I 

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.399
 I will not choose the people of the clear 

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:24.839
 What do you guys have a shopping cart? 

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:27.899
 because the shopping cart is almost 

00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:31.230
 100% mobile commerce applications 

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:32.579
 the guys put net with bruno put and 

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.620
 That's when you ask me, man. 

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:36.600
 purchase is an important item of your 

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.180
 its obvious functionality is that it 

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:43.800
 now you will finalize the purchase but one 

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:48.000
 shopping cart is the understand me action 

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.880
 they say it's not an indication if I call there 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 upon 

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.310
 neighborhood action I do not have an item 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.290
 action that is there does not have a thing 

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.760
 wrong there you are the more the car is 

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.190
 important because you have to see how many 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.650
 items there are cool you can use then 

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.990
 there in the bishan drug an area my cart 

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.490
 the same way but there is no action 

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.980
 you may have to action for example would be 

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.440
 cool up to an action if I do 

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.670
 to finish the check out there 

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.040
 would be an item 

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.710
 but it's something that also leaves me 

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.210
 I put it in my cart and show it 

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.890
 this message is not 

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.320
 in fact we recommend that you guys 

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:26.410
 have no one to use in the modal area 

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.000
 because this causes user frustration and 

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.060
 besides being a visiting club that finishes 

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.370
 by locking the user interface 

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.800
 better shape or leave blank screen even 

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.990
 technician entered such an empty screen or when 

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.880
 the cart icon has nothing 

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.500
 disables it puts in a color 

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.510
 different to inform the user not to 

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.690
 You come here because you are. 

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.700
 enabled but avoid this type of 

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.260
 dallas situation but it's not just for 

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.300
 cart not for any kind of down 

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.520
 try is good without trying to avoid because 

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.680
 what hangs a few users 

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.130
 it was a bit complicated 

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.440
 this is a case a little more 

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.630
 it's a different one because we have 

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.220
 a matter of the car is shared 

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:10.390
 from a and b and the products they have stock 

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.000
 this online stock 

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:16.030
 So we end up having to do the 

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.840
 call and this is the service message 

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.910
 not cool 

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.160
 The idea is cool and if you can do it in 

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:24.040
 if he considers it but does not show it 

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:26.260
 for example put mother puts interface 

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.050
 and placed a message on the screen 

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.030
 same car under your control is empty 

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.430
 keep shopping but not 

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:36.100
 block and will i am so you show the 

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.840
 and the screen has 11 brands and also 

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.790
 plus an empty cart anyway 

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.230
 car was empty total gets cooler 

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:45.010
 from what looks like a modal 

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:47.080
 besides that you are using a cellphone in this 

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.060
 case but on the tablet to be more 

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.890
 comfortable and also the entire map of 

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.720
 navigation bell because of a warning 

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.400
 decision by a notice on the screen itself will 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.110
 stay cool too 

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.760
 well this part here is a message that 

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.390
 I took from their application but that 

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.880
 people find this 

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.320
 in 90% of today's educational 

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.290
 developed with assets of high 

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.110
 personal quality because I put this 

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:14.390
 reason the slide there like that android that 

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:18.260
 including gains in critical lines 

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:20.960
 android because this looking screen 

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:24.140
 so you getting a goose feather 

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.850
 on top is but if you look just like this you 

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:30.410
 can distinguish if an android ep is not 

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:32.300
 an android ep are not otherwise looks like an ep 

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.950
 android it no longer fall into the category 

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.170
 after giving a highlight with the captive 

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:39.350
 since I do not know mainly 

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:41.480
 with the elements here you can get the 

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.550
 google play app is from google 

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.130
 plus on youtube we have the options of 

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.380
 menu navigation drug for example but 

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.090
 Do not have this little set of 

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.450
 there is more like the user knows that will have 

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.500
 that clicking good if a list of actions to 

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.570
 my account 

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.310
 obviously I'm going to click on this list 

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.080
 I'm not going to give an instruction 

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.940
 a little set 19 click here 

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.530
 I looked that I know what they want in my 

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.810
 on the streets I know I'm going to apply 

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.710
 my machines one more indication 

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.650
 for that 

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:15.650
 another thing is the button to exit the account 

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:17.450
 This is an action should be where I 

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.910
 I have quite the neighborhood action button 

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:22.460
 only because it is a pattern that facilitates 

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.530
 very user and I got you 

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.240
 started implementation and gave a 

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.250
 stop then I'm on the way 

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.160
 using that will not at least 30 only 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.720
 you're not using it, just need to hit the 

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.000
 part of d 

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.610
 this screen here is to place an icon in the 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.280
 left with the same tire I called 

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.870
 Ground is already nice here on my account. 

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.470
 It would be wrong, I know I'm going to 

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:47.840
 side of the icon globe is 

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.210
 it's already on the right track what I hit 

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:54.080
 on the action barnabe key 

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:56.240
 that up, something else, you too 

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.400
 here, too, neither am I - the 

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.860
 android they are very similar to 

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.240
 android platform they are not the 

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.320
 platform 

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.420
 I can not customize can customize 

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.890
 but something that is closer 

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.330
 gives u 

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.820
 so I stay close to what the 

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.569
 platform or if you really innovate 

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.399
 a certain control 

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.919
 because it has found a new environment is not 

00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:24.269
 against innovation or come on man either 

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:28.740
 Something is going wrong with that. 

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:31.049
 This is a logout because someone has 

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:36.110
 the notion why I put this slide 

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:36.110
 with the little boy there is no kick 

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:43.080
 This is how it comes out, but I 

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.320
 I have information, I have to inform 

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.059
 What I'm going to pay out erases because this is 

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.009
 expected in a new captive that I have 

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:51.450
 credit card information or I can 

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:52.769
 I really hope you're cool. 

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.450
 You do not save anything so it's a 

00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:57.509
 expected behavior 

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.159
 This is what we recommend only. 

00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:00.779
 they were very educated if very 

00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:02.700
 specific you will logout 

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:04.649
 this may imply that you have to 

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.360
 pay 100 reais to me if it was any 

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:09.899
 Such a mountain thing has a fine 

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.490
 because the affirmation is legal to know your 

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.960
 account we will pay for all 

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.909
 credit card security 

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.110
 excellent I already hoped that you 

00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:18.360
 do this when I leave 

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.580
 application but the message to that 

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.840
 If I still want to leave, I still want to leave. 

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.899
 that old personal story in the face of 

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.700
 mask that did not want any 

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:29.370
 easier to be unwilling 

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.049
 really wanted to quit the app is 

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.429
 64 more to exit the application 

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:36.419
 true, right? 

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:39.240
 so he left he left but he paid 

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:41.580
 card where not after the pgm-fi guy 

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.409
 could new card and know that you do not 

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.179
 save his card of what to do 

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:47.909
 because as it is known the card 

00:18:45.179 --> 00:18:53.730
 we who see this information then left 

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:58.440
 erased it was just remembering that he 

00:18:53.730 --> 00:19:02.370
 make a good wish july some 

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:06.480
 Quiet and peaceful quiet commentary 

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:08.009
 I just wanted to share the whole 

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.519
 staff in charge goes there 

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:16.409
 playing at the rate will also pass the team 

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:21.419
 from samuel in karachi 

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:23.309
 I left so joy adrenaline is a 

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:27.090
 thing is not a disease but represents a 

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:28.950
 personal blow is with those who accompany the 

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.560
 responsible for lex 

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.720
 the brandsclub we are aware of 

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.200
 some changes 

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.420
 We have to do what we think. 

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.040
 we tried to change you see a service 

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.460
 google down there just for being 

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.690
 a lot about it is and ends up that part 

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.130
 and we end up leaving a 

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.370
 bit back and such but you know it is 

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:54.720
 very important but our pilot there already 

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:57.060
 also it will be this change also 

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.530
 by entities the key of the city for 

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.480
 example 

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:02.700
 I think this is a great company. 

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.620
 which is well known and yet 

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.920
 attended an event here at the 

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.540
 application evaluation live you 

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.580
 value can only participate with the 

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.520
 community of the genre is how you 

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.590
 they think that the really cool guy is the 

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.930
 The fee also came to help the 

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.370
 hexa to defend itself but we try 

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.780
 always very close also with the part 

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.700
 of development 

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.680
 We know it's no good just to 

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.450
 creation and send the images to 

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.610
 galera do has accompanied the tv has 

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.200
 that read the messages have to see everything 

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.020
 This has to have more how it works. 

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.880
 even from thing codes to 

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.620
 make everyone's life easier is not 

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.090
 very good approach that you like 

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.760
 a lot of people try to participate in everyone 

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.650
 events here, and when people 

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.290
 can see the videos of the most ever 

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.940
 accompanying and have to take advantage of 

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.040
 enjoy even who knows it is difficult 

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.720
 rely on this help has a material 

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.090
 internet has all that but there are some 

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:57.600
 things that are getting higher have debts 

00:20:54.090 --> 00:21:01.310
 that we take all doubts about 

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.310
 to the stage with staff in favor 

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:08.390
 good if a little on the microphone side because 

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.390
 like this 

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:13.080
 good, the idea is to realize the 

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.730
 application from now on I will 

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.200
 talk a little more and get another 

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.270
 aspect our next the next 

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.010
 invited here but what I wanted 

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.610
 show enough discipline through 

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:26.280
 mainly the part of 

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.940
 adherence to navigation and adhesion edson 

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.190
 Pub 

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.190
 We want everyone to use the 

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:35.400
 action goes again everyone a great 

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:38.280
 goes to the applications in general is a 

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.530
 good practice the site a bar because the two 

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.470
 one reason why the current one is 

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:45.420
 using android there then theoretically 

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.429
 We like training him for you guys. 

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.500
 guy picks up the app he already saw max one 

00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:51.510
 bar there he already knows he has to be 

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.360
 there an icon frame he knows that if he 

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:55.679
 to get him back to navigation he is already 

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.110
 used to it 

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:59.880
 it is additionally facilitates modifications 

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:03.809
 have support there and now you can 

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.970
 use it save code is and a 

00:22:03.809 --> 00:22:08.760
 second reason is the lens passionately 

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:12.720
 and facilitated and the second reason for 

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.880
 It's a wiki, but it's sharper. 

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.280
 integrates easy it saves for example 

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.100
 pixels on your screen with you 

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.420
 and that they had left the app you 

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.300
 take a botton I have to 

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.940
 Promises 4048 pixels 50 pixels 

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.400
 height and remove this place there in a healthy 

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.290
 another 50 pixels on my screen to 

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.210
 put more local content but I do not know 

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.230
 put some because it's a better promotion 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.250
 like this 

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.160
 besides we try to do everything 

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:40.530
 interface that will help you 

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.390
 designers designers is curious 

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.820
 there is also more space in the cast of the movie 

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:47.700
 chico xavier a long time ago people 

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.570
 I quarreled that I had only 128 by 128 

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.990
 pixels 

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:54.570
 today these 960 screens have a 

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:56.730
 Wonderful, man, but then finally 

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.980
 idea a little bit of it now in the 

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:01.940
 personal sounds can come here can come 

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.940
 for thoughts only 

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.810
 Let's show another aspect a 

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.010
 Let's talk a little bit about the 

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:14.670
 application for people presents band plays 

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:16.800
 and it's not my name is fernando is the sound is 

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.990
 a social music network where 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.020
 people wanted instead of a profile 

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:24.510
 They create a kind of radio and it's 

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.400
 subscribe songs playlists music 

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:28.350
 share things about music 

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.810
 this app the android version this 

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.420
 social network only more summarized without 

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:36.150
 part of the social network even in it you go 

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.430
 stay on the cadastrá playlists is register 

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.600
 their songs and listen to them online more 

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.610
 in front of us we think about putting 

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.380
 part of listening offline as well 

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.910
 synchronization but for now the on 

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:47.280
 cool line 

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.290
 well I got the app I liked 

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.150
 some things we will use 

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:53.340
 navigation drug started some 

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.380
 elements we are going to take a look at 

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:58.320
 There are people who can eat a little. 

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:00.450
 Good, I liked it 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.400
 the login screen church had connecting 

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:05.220
 with google plus is for me only had one 

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:08.190
 little more up releases tomorrow start 

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:10.530
 to give a slightly greater emphasis but 

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.230
 legal point multiple positive accounts 

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:15.630
 do not know that only she prefers to use that 

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:18.360
 she suddenly has 14% social 

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:20.070
 trust another and take advantage of the 

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.900
 talk about it because it made me some 

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.490
 search launch google plus and 

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.190
 overwhelming majority always faithful place 

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.610
 while google than the service but 

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.880
 there is only one small difference 

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.920
 beauty 

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.630
 if I have you I want 

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.550
 already existing I can have a little in 

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:38.370
 doubt which is so but if you do not have 

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.650
 a user I can use the networks 

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:43.260
 even though I already logged into the 

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.070
 with and a half before I can now a network 

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.860
 Social 

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:49.410
 and then maybe this last part here 

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.030
 instead of entering and registering 

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.250
 you can create an example service 

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.590
 place with your account sounds for example and 

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.390
 do not split into two actions like enter 

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.460
 existing account register 

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.560
 why you can do for every 

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.960
 click there to display a second screen 

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.200
 where then his mail and if not 

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:10.320
 had returned 404 entered 3 1 200 in 

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.360
 200 that would codes and save folder 

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.430
 but believe in the mail and password 

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.510
 and so I thought it looked beautiful 

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.850
 screens have a 

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.900
 It's cool from the blue and the title. 

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.050
 right 

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.730
 then a first of them in is the one of the 

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.890
 I do not need to touch the boat. 

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.830
 your login yet but I would trade 

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.660
 this part with a little confusing you 

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:33.300
 have an account the post of new place as 

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.880
 I eat google plus for example 

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:37.500
 are just one is much more than they are 

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.880
 now here's one more tip than in the 

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.060
 time to conquer talk now to laine 

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:46.380
 until it's really cool there, okay? 

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:48.540
 well here I thought I put it 

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.250
 here is what I missed 

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.200
 you have a big screen and it was done 

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.830
 no nexus four aces that shock 

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.660
 this is a reasonable screen and still 

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.790
 little of that crow né to another player this 

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.530
 he stayed under the play bar 

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:04.140
 maybe you can do a test for 

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:05.820
 you avoid those first screen or 

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.920
 so we can leave it a little clearer 

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.470
 which depends on a smaller screen that has 

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.330
 more content and some why it ends 

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.520
 covering the last playlist 

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:17.250
 the last part the user may not know 

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.870
 that had content down then it is 

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.590
 cool the others are playing heard 

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.210
 pg 

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:23.700
 the guy knows he can go to the side 

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:26.640
 for the key the pgp is excellent 

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:29.880
 We are now seeing here in a bar. 

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.770
 There you are, I selected the top right now. 

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.180
 It looks cool and I'm going to give it 

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.890
 a very interesting and uniform look 

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.300
 already looking like an android app if 

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.460
 look here you already know that the application 

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.340
 android, do not doubt the web 

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:45.690
 html5 apps is on android we know 

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:49.350
 which is in fact android but there by the part 

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.940
 and what's cool you can with 

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.710
 good platform thing you can integrate 

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.570
 search with your app as your 

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.270
 own phone with the probable everything 

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.520
 more but you click on the search that is 

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.680
 happening tonight show bar cool 

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:05.040
 It's a ball show, I'm going to find one. 

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.130
 test what it is a new screen 

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.680
 which one would be ideal now you use this 

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.420
 same as you did only one main screen 

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.250
 Let's start a new one that had to 

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.480
 doing so makes it likely to search the 

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.250
 own main screen 

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.960
 because there you avoid stacking 

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.690
 understood 

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.060
 That was one of the things I would give to you guys. 

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.860
 see a new transition screen have been 

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.159
 tablet after she can play the 

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:32.499
 more title ok 

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:34.899
 another thing in relation to navigation 

00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:35.919
 I never said that the service started well. 

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:39.220
 to plumb 

00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:41.049
 but there it is a pity to see gay chan 

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.779
 But there's a strange thing I'm in 

00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:47.049
 first screen and appeared an up navigated 

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:48.340
 calls you back to where you 

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:50.049
 because how I got even revenge 

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.909
 navigate personnel when that 

00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:53.649
 Minor signal therein 

00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:55.629
 who is taking the user to the screen 

00:27:53.649 --> 00:27:56.950
 and hierarchically prior to that which 

00:27:55.629 --> 00:27:59.289
 you are 

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.999
 do not confuse this with coming back many 

00:27:59.289 --> 00:28:03.070
 Sometimes he has it, he comes back to 

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:05.769
 screen but for now that is not 

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.720
 a back because we are going to an example of the 

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:10.119
 our brandsclub framework send a 

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.820
 email with a certain promotion was that the 

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:15.730
 clickon and half it opens right on the page 

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.409
 showing me if I press 

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:21.580
 come back this time where I go 

00:28:17.409 --> 00:28:24.700
 back in the middle because I'm going to 

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.440
 to the way your squeeze it piaí 

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.509
 cool and brings me the list of campaigns by 

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.970
 example is that I just finished an application 

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:33.509
 of you and where you're just taking 

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.509
 a game on 

00:28:33.639 --> 00:28:40.119
 so look at the drug since it tends to 

00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:43.470
 wrong on that damn screen 

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:46.330
 in fact the use of the icon is wrong 

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:49.149
 including a little video that we did 

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:52.029
 about alexandra neno in the debate 

00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:54.519
 when you have the icon for april drug 

00:28:52.029 --> 00:28:56.139
 and eighty-three stripes actually the op 

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:57.669
 What could we do because the night is 

00:28:56.139 --> 00:28:59.769
 when you have a screen to go back 

00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:02.499
 so in that initial screen you did 

00:28:59.769 --> 00:29:04.179
 almost all right 

00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:06.850
 Let me, I should have wanted those 

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:09.190
 three, and then you know you can open the 

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:11.830
 menu and also that you managed to 

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.519
 activate from what I understand you want 

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.289
 come back 

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:17.200
 he wants to go back to the login screen there 

00:29:14.289 --> 00:29:20.559
 when I wanted at least there is a menu 

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:23.080
 so your guy the goal is a 

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:25.179
 bit wrong at that point more time 

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.519
 For me, this land, too. 

00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:32.350
 Maybe I already mentioned the brandsclub 

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:34.480
 had also spoken in the personal settlers 

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:37.720
 forget the little personal 

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.669
 poetinha list android sold only one 

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.140
 Little finger he is not cause set list 

00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:44.780
 android do not use 

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:46.940
 This is 11 platforms here. 

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.120
 I understand market share but anyway 

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:52.970
 so let's get it right so let's go 

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:55.310
 I put there bidders analyst of davy 9 leaving 

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.320
 I already know that you opened click and do 

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.750
 some white action but no navigation 

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.370
 has used to be in doubt that I do 

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:06.800
 here he does not know what to click there 

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:08.150
 And opening the bon rock was a little something I 

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.420
 I think I'm on the way, it's okay. 

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:13.040
 application is observation I did not put the 

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.560
 law be aware of the size of the cycle 

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.600
 play under the player 

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.480
 You have to remember that you have to talk - 

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.790
 a size of 50-50 pixels per 50 kits 

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.040
 on the buttons people do not have to have a 

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.990
 carrot then the guy aim the button there 

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.100
 so make an icon that is a bit 

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.320
 more confortable 

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.630
 Yes, but you want to comment? 

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.550
 some note was dinner ourselves 

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:41.150
 only that 

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:43.670
 thank you, thanks, the bridge staff opened 

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:45.620
 a good audience question with sunshine 

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.240
 we have not been there for a long time so 

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.700
 We lost a big club that I 

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.760
 I got it already that I had a great mark 

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.260
 I enjoyed the sun and showed more screens 

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.630
 doing some things were still going on here 

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.680
 I did not comment because I did not compete in 

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.910
 same things 

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.970
 We've already seen a little action 

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:04.430
 neighborhood new life ii leaving hertha is 

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.650
 is a very interesting resource that you 

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:08.120
 also know space on the same screen 

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.550
 way 

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.490
 so now without going too personal 

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:19.910
 gift that will come here we will do well 

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:22.550
 staff can also pick up a 

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.270
 bit to the people of the application 

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.830
 where the idea came 

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.870
 I found it very interesting concept is that 

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:38.000
 You go to the web first a little bit. 

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:40.100
 for us it reads in a control scheme 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.800
 double entry financial 

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.480
 we did all the engineering in the system 

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.400
 the account becomes easy for the user 

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.700
 input to information input 

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.770
 recording expenses and revenues was 

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:54.410
 it is a very complex engineering by 

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.850
 behind the ept demand we got it 

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:58.520
 arrive at the registration fee 

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:01.280
 I wish a field could only enter us 

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.650
 did this because of the digital keyboard 

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:07.039
 value and easier 

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:09.020
 and then we can see a lot of 

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:11.780
 information and can discover the 

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:14.030
 accounts for him to take the heavy lifting 

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.590
 in the guy's hand, right? 

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.870
 for that we took a step further 

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:19.730
 which is the step taken he discovered afterwards 

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.730
 go on the web with fig confirms the 

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:24.950
 launch 

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:29.500
 so this is a platform that has a 

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:29.500
 bargain made with 80 points 

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:37.700
 we made a rap five script guards 

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:40.490
 also can not only integrate 

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:43.370
 It's cool what I selected educational is that 

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.380
 I found it simple because that's how I feel. 

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.240
 a problem is a problem with an always 

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.120
 tries to launch the expenses any 

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:52.760
 indicative and always said this is because 

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.919
 I start well after I forget and I 

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.659
 so it's very complicated to enter 

00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:59.360
 I like some points they had to 

00:32:56.659 --> 00:33:02.210
 idea of ​​being very simple but maybe the 

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.130
 over simplicity sacrifices some 

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:06.500
 points and you can not escape 

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.020
 a glance you stop here is good 

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.510
 The first screen I found very interesting is 

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:15.080
 the first time it shows up a stone 

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:17.330
 only the first time, that's not good at all 

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.440
 a detail that she is really very 

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.770
 simple 

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.900
 maybe it's cool to put a chance with 

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.090
 She's going to say cool with the action. 

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:30.500
 icon there with the educational name does not have 

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:31.520
 problems when you made the complaint 

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.190
 its implementation 

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.650
 only this idea of ​​using the icon 

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:38.210
 on top of it we can 

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.700
 every day in a way that this role in 

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:43.070
 layout that she uses a library of ours 

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:46.850
 use a sherlock, there's no problem 

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:49.850
 but here it is cool for example that and if 

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:51.950
 start talking google something else 

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.179
 click the icon does nothing on the link né 

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.270
 if you lose some of the power of information 

00:33:53.179 --> 00:33:58.850
 of taking the site also depends on 

00:33:56.270 --> 00:34:02.659
 wipe the clip already the site already 

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:05.450
 interesting to have a direct action there 

00:34:02.659 --> 00:34:07.909
 What worries you is that you do not have a 

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.139
 use in-app privacy 

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:11.419
 so for example 

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:14.750
 at the time very good but use can 

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:17.119
 ask these guys I'm going too and 

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.710
 mail to them I'll talk when I spend 

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.929
 and I do not know that they do this 

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:23.029
 information I do not know what they do 

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:25.039
 if they will save these servers will go 

00:34:23.029 --> 00:34:27.169
 To use this to make offer 

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:29.119
 service that has six United States already 

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:31.519
 heard and should have a lot going 

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:33.349
 diverting them from their expenses and 

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:37.069
 approved to spend less on this. 

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:38.510
 was eating too much out I do not know what now 

00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:43.129
 Just think of food, that's what I think. 

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:45.289
 with me and then you do it and I do not know 

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:47.779
 so the application goal idea is legal but 

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:50.389
 Who are these guys going to do with the 

00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:52.429
 information that we have a lot of 

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.929
 The concern with this is so 

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.750
 google plus you sign in 

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:59.299
 show there the executive will do it 

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.039
 Can you do it like this? 

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:02.900
 I got you to put a term of use 

00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:04.279
 I see topical term 

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.109
 I think it's more transparent for 

00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:08.599
 user so give me a little fear that 

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:10.549
 have a table start but who are these 

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:12.859
 guys from the store that came with them 

00:35:10.549 --> 00:35:16.490
 they want information right? 

00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:18.049
 but beauty is cool and there's a lot 

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.450
 simple, maybe it's working a 

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:22.789
 little more than working as a lecturer 

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.480
 next a bar of humanity a little on the 

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:27.109
 river ae 

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.420
 On this screen, it's okay. 

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:33.559
 When I thought it cool, you did well. 

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:35.690
 direct used kate usa's own 

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:39.319
 Android and there did not need to fill a 

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:41.119
 Fantastic form maybe change this 

00:35:39.319 --> 00:35:43.460
 here because this type of access it goes 

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:45.799
 have to be published soon it will 

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.319
 google plus is being changed 

00:35:45.799 --> 00:35:50.000
 so I'd have the clos 

00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:52.339
 it will already show that screen the 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.640
 and if this application wants to have access 

00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:56.779
 of the most is a screen partners will create a 

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.880
 step over 

00:35:56.779 --> 00:36:00.710
 Only who is going to say if this account goes there? 

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.960
 be that google plus screen 

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:05.059
 the sound personnel also the athletes can 

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.940
 look at their captive make with bingo 

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:09.289
 plus in this pattern but who has seen 

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.529
 That's when I wanted to take a look. 

00:36:09.289 --> 00:36:14.779
 vanunu developer.apple.com yesterday is fine 

00:36:12.529 --> 00:36:16.940
 easy to do the same with android but yes 

00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:19.309
 I already liked it, it's easier already. 

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.720
 type my email and a password 

00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:24.190
 Yeah, but I'm not going to show it to you. 

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.300
 anyone who does not know the application shows a 

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.430
 bit of flow is very interesting 

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.950
 between the value né 

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.740
 and it was a description I came to 

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.890
 work with enrollment scheme already 

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.890
 you receive it 

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:41.950
 actually when you do not have a die 

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:44.140
 released on dvd players are then the people 

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:46.840
 makes a place consultant with your chin 

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:49.180
 you have in the region and set the tags 

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.190
 you type for what it looks like 

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:56.320
 restaurant large companies oranges 

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:58.750
 this way but it's cool so this is cool 

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.099
 already facilitates a little expensive digital what 

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:02.260
 I felt the way I did not speak a little bit 

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:03.849
 she gave the power even though I saw 

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.220
 applications and wanted to keep it that way 

00:37:03.849 --> 00:37:09.130
 suddenly allow with the most 

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:12.220
 a subcategory or something like that 

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:14.920
 Okay, something that I found kind of 

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.780
 It's strange that I launch it. 

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.359
 my part behind what I threw 

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.609
 but keep open maybe elliott and 

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:23.830
 Finished Release - Collected 

00:37:21.609 --> 00:37:25.599
 autocomplete because I want to see if 

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.400
 gets released the right amount do not know 

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:32.380
 that I cashed no amount that I released 

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.690
 there so innocent and that the focus was 

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:37.089
 But I also know if the father you 

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.800
 come back to how the budget he 

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:41.230
 will collect that I do not know if it launched 

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.609
 certain and released the value would be taken until 

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.920
 I just talked to him and he just 

00:37:42.609 --> 00:37:45.760
 right order then it got a little simple 

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.730
 too much 

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.170
 This show, what I said here is just for 

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.390
 who does not know the process doing here 

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:55.359
 it's the web interface 

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:57.160
 I thought it was cool because I got in there. 

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:59.530
 got the user in the same way and already 

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:02.859
 showed that I had released this I thought 

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:05.859
 week cure using home apps is 

00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:08.020
 a financial study and has no report 

00:38:05.859 --> 00:38:10.480
 do not have anything, there's nothing in here 

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:13.030
 that I do here I understood I'm not going to 

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.150
 site or girlfriend is missing a 

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:18.730
 little more than perhaps explained the 

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.040
 first expense first moves 

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:22.720
 law at the time with the most 

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.140
 translucent and puts it so you can 

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.240
 visit such site and verify your account 

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.310
 in the first century after leaving a 

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.900
 little more forwarded then this is a 

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.580
 thing that we are looking for 

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.589
 legal suggestion that you are seeking a 

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.590
 way to speak the user because people 

00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:39.200
 placed 

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:41.510
 the very simple android for several reasons 

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.040
 a link to stay agile same thing 

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.470
 boring to do with wherever 

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.280
 fast and the other thing is the issue of 

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.920
 safety 

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.440
 batman has only 20 releases on android 

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.470
 and only the release does not have a balance 

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.670
 There's nothing like that. 

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.250
 any problem 

00:38:55.670 --> 00:39:01.700
 I lost my cell phone, I see nobody's going 

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:03.380
 see what is good to see this point another 

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.050
 thing that might make you think maybe 

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:08.870
 because the future there you have this version 

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:11.720
 for web because not so explicitly 

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:13.100
 have signed up an ep that I can use 

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.200
 all on tablet 

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.240
 because then you have a tablet of 7 

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.020
 inches because I hope you guys 

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.610
 tablet look like a phone with a 

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.590
 Israel pay I paid for seven 

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.830
 inches and 10 inches and I see it 

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:30.920
 a phone or a zoom then maybe 

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.970
 It would be nice for you to think about the future. 

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.210
 more elaborate application by tablet 

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:40.160
 do 

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:41.390
 It's just that we're all tips is 

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.940
 enjoying the staff just to remember 

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:45.770
 who does continue tablet that goes 

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.480
 happen in a while, it's already 

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:49.310
 talking in practice this can 

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.980
 were tuned in our quest for 

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.630
 applications you have board support that 

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.220
 will appear better in the search ranking 

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.010
 applications. 

00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:01.460
 But this flower of safety, I'm not in 

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:03.320
 It's true, I found how we 

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.570
 after I posted expense I can not 

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.370
 edit once the expense I have 

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:10.220
 that go there on the web to do this 

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:13.310
 work there we will do 

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:15.800
 removals will make it the only thing but 

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:19.040
 the rest is not sauna, not because in the 

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.570
 truth the system is the same on the web you 

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.850
 has edition removal 

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:25.070
 but underneath for you never never said 

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:30.230
 nor remove always makes a throw 

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:31.250
 contrary according to him and then to do 

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:34.610
 this on android 

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:36.830
 We thought we were going to do it but it's not 

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:41.990
 one type I the idea of ​​android was to be one 

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:44.630
 business and took the legal course for 

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:46.700
 example how do I play cool of 

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.360
 account 

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.360
 as a matter of fact 

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:57.079
 the neighborhood and that your new 

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.640
 there is no longer the menu and we were afraid 

00:40:57.079 --> 00:41:01.490
 in the previous notification 

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.760
 so there and do you can change your account 

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:06.470
 some settings to move chan 

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.119
 all this is good for you a bar 

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:12.470
 reinforcing that I was longing for the 

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:15.200
 another and put it is that for example this 

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:17.630
 busy time is what a smartphone there 

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.750
 The person who picks us up keeps the last ones. 

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:22.760
 20 and only the phone but still the 

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:24.770
 Come in and see my 

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.020
 last 20 releases understood 

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:30.349
 maybe they can put it if the guy wants 

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:33.140
 not only as mandatory but a pin of 4 

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:35.180
 numbers that can enter the 

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.730
 presenter mouse said a pint four 

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.160
 and it enters the application because 

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:43.280
 I think as being so beautiful 

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.200
 but so the guy picks up and sees maura end of the 

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.109
 Morning was a dry day already celebrating in this 

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.790
 old who spent they do not do 

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:51.410
 Do this several times and put something 

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.299
 soccer city every time we go 

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:55.250
 to use a control application 

00:41:53.299 --> 00:41:58.910
 that there is a padlock there 

00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:02.180
 like in fear in the restaurant, I go 

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:04.670
 make a launch only assaulted have 

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:07.250
 that dictating another lady is there 

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:09.530
 people got kind of cool is the good feedback 

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.569
 sometimes they can also create then do the 

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:14.599
 launch saw India 

00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:16.760
 I can have an Indian on the home screen. 

00:42:14.599 --> 00:42:18.920
 then I'll make a quick launch with 

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:22.520
 I click he opened it and where it will open 

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:25.430
 another tivit in modal format there in the 

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:29.329
 case above a video there you to the 

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:31.069
 launch there it gives ok it closes time and 

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:32.450
 already launches launching evidence 

00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:34.579
 it works there 

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.380
 essence is an application there you 

00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:37.040
 including by some 

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.049
 functionalities 

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.480
 so I do not even need an app 

00:42:39.049 --> 00:42:45.650
 in a restaurant that comes the bill had 

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:49.670
 the pocket phone puts it there and do it 

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:52.369
 the launch is back and ready 

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:55.280
 And there you think it would be worth it. 

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:57.440
 put a four-day pin of a 

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.750
 thing for never so exposed 

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.000
 understood and then you are a brush you can 

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.619
 one with an infinite cycle are the 

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.720
 latest videos 

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:06.430
 she demonstrated a more power he can 

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:08.619
 Climbing on Sunday safely 

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.480
 do but put more information 

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:12.700
 Suddenly I think so my opinion 

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.319
 The user I have with you expense 

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.079
 financial and everyone has their eyes 

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:19.720
 You, but what made me a little afraid. 

00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:21.009
 this part has not transposed yes 

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.470
 maybe we'll work a little on the 

00:43:21.009 --> 00:43:25.390
 part of legal security and I work 

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:27.759
 a bit more the interface but it 

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:29.529
 cool idea of ​​camera microphone 

00:43:27.759 --> 00:43:32.980
 I tested both ideas of doing the 

00:43:29.529 --> 00:43:34.839
 and I thought it was cool, but I think 

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.539
 that I'm on the way but also that the 

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:41.200
 It's a good point to be so simple. 

00:43:37.539 --> 00:43:44.740
 also may not be ideal but it is 

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:47.259
 cool, I have the idea of ​​your advice 

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.980
 do not have much in your own 

00:43:47.259 --> 00:43:51.339
 web 

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:53.950
 and then I can also use it as well 

00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:56.259
 a responsive web does not cause a span of 

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:59.440
 something so cool. 

00:43:56.259 --> 00:44:02.619
 Good, but I do not want to comment on something. 

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.450
 I did not want to thank legal feedback. 

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:06.789
 legal evaluation of the very 

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:12.819
 Cool it is very good for us 

00:44:06.789 --> 00:44:22.660
 starting out now or else it's good and the 

00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:25.480
 people are going to work a lot and also just 

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.039
 this was our first edition of the 

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.390
 when are sao paulo 

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:31.180
 we want to do some more 

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:33.249
 edit maybe not live maybe a few 

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.529
 studio seconds and I want to 

00:44:33.249 --> 00:44:36.759
 still have this format to do 

00:44:35.529 --> 00:44:38.109
 a call for action 

00:44:36.759 --> 00:44:40.630
 where people can 

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:41.890
 submit applications is someone who 

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.960
 application tackman that was not 

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:46.749
 selected not only will I know 

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.430
 It's cool, the people. 

00:44:46.749 --> 00:44:50.259
 here participate 

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.759
 We can take advantage of you. 

00:44:50.259 --> 00:44:54.849
 watching online can not participate 

00:44:51.759 --> 00:44:56.319
 pizza with us here I wanted 

00:44:54.849 --> 00:44:57.730
 take the question if someone wants to 

00:44:56.319 --> 00:45:00.390
 ask a question the audience has 

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:00.390
 first you can talk 

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:38.790
 It is not true that this 

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:41.490
 the personal title to the internet 

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:43.859
 you can move and give a tip is a 

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:48.450
 old problem of maybe giving a warning 

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:51.180
 and I'm not today, right? 

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:54.089
 I think I really like this. 

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.030
 approach because you end up bothering 

00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:59.030
 very user now notification 

00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:01.380
 previously notified something 

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:03.030
 when you start asking a lot for 

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.260
 user I already said be in app 

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.810
 who is issuing a notification to 

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:09.420
 me maybe and may have been configured 

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:11.940
 remind me of a release reminder 

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.520
 of expenses for example but not some 

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:17.130
 thing of the application and remembering 

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:19.380
 Good time, I'll tell you, this is everything. 

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.790
 be careful about modification because if you 

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.079
 not just being in the wrong way can 

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:27.960
 be out some online games by 

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:30.750
 example notification for advertising has 

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.880
 that take pitzi luzzi wuta then by 

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:36.060
 example I want to inform you that you have 

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.440
 you want to receive the 

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.960
 notice or notification 

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.810
 yes if this application did not have a 

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:45.390
 specific objective for this you can 

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:47.819
 you may actually not be who you are 

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:51.089
 here and that's not going to be removed by 

00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:53.520
 school but it can be a highlight in the 

00:46:51.089 --> 00:46:56.430
 I thought it was cool but still 

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:59.160
 otherwise configurable for example 

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.569
 nor does it notify twice a day 

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.910
 lay down my expenses 

00:47:00.569 --> 00:47:04.349
 maybe it might be an idea but I think 

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:07.079
 maybe start to get away from the focus a little 

00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:09.300
 application but I think it's legal to 

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:14.069
 idea is also cool but some people 

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:15.720
 a question is not good at all 

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:18.260
 is a little bit already gave a little 

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:27.079
 start by action please only by 

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:27.079
 1 40 dollars when you 

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:34.630
 agent or robock to fill your 

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.150
 intention to control both independence 

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:39.490
 And the people had us today. 

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:41.740
 I was implementing it and why 

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:44.620
 you came across it because bill 

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:47.800
 downe shot of him to support one that 

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.390
 have to understand that tite to launch the 

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.130
 people made with your note 

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:54.870
 I just wanted to know if this is a good one. 

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:58.720
 practice 1 to 1 a control version and 

00:47:54.870 --> 00:48:03.100
 706 mouth is cool a question is the 

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:05.260
 studio citation for the zone and clips is 

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.210
 who could not avoid the studio 

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.070
 maybe wearing a dow cap looks like 

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.020
 to set up the humble 

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:15.220
 library and he will make you in this life 

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:18.160
 there is the big question of independence is 

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:21.280
 one way of 12 is two-handed law 

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.860
 because it was developing in the case 

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:27.510
 of independence but it ends up generating 

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:30.760
 a little over head a in the case of 

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:32.260
 dependence so that's how I said it 

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.180
 enough test to see if it is 

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.250
 impact, but I think you do not 

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:38.410
 will impact a lot that the land is not 

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.390
 so complex with this very theme 

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:42.490
 complex and begins to irritate a lot 

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.390
 may be to give a little loss of 

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:47.500
 performance 

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:49.240
 This is good practice, but I think 

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.980
 Maybe if you're doing a 

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.690
 look at the studio creed that goes 

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.180
 only you can create the 

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:57.850
 bild settings he's already looking for 

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:02.530
 new version lay there do compilation 

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:04.090
 right of gas also serves to 

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.650
 other languages ​​such as volleyball for example 

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.230
 after speaking that it is a line of the 

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:10.300
 own google also supports but maybe 

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:14.860
 one way is to use the cap that facilitates 

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:18.930
 a little at that point there answered more 

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.930
 now they are here I can confirm 

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.300
 while the pizza reaches eight 

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.830
 It's just to talk about the robot. 

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.510
 recently used another 

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:32.339
 library that holds what he 

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:35.160
 does this injection in population time 

00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:37.530
 So take this, this is an extra's. 

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:39.660
 even the staff of the bass sound and locke 

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.520
 including cool not only my good tip 

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:44.010
 Take a look at our conversation. 

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.599
 I confirmed that it is legal that Albanian 

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:47.910
 downloads that she does a while 

00:49:45.599 --> 00:49:49.560
 Create alert 

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:52.859
 This is what I do not like much 

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:55.770
 of her time but if she does what 

00:49:52.859 --> 00:49:59.700
 it does at compile time I think 

00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:03.060
 No problem, it's one more question. 

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:06.210
 not quiet person 

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.670
 well that's it then they showed up for 

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:10.500
 there google.com more beto marin 

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:12.180
 we also have the personal community that 

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.470
 android development is Brazil 

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:16.320
 inside your android faces 

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:18.420
 developers, it's good, it's the 

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.160
 comunidad code google also like the 

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.830
 created a short time ago 

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.869
