00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.180
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill. This is Crash Course Economics, and today, we’re talking about the underground economy,

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:12.420
the shadow economy, the informal economy, the black market, the unofficial economy, the hidden economy.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.320
Whatever you want to call it, today we’re looking off the books, under the table, at the underground economy.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.360
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.300
So what exactly do we mean when we talk about
the underground economy?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.880
The first thing that comes to mind is the illegal stuff, bad guy stuff, like making and dealing drugs or selling kidneys.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.820
But when economists talk about it, they’re talking about a much wider, less-nefarious group of activities.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.859
The informal economy they talk about is all
the trade and work that happens off the books,

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.480
under the table, outside of the sight and
reach of government rules and taxes.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.600
And sure, some of those activities are illegal
but a lot of them are completely mundane.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Take the mom who cuts hair out of her house
without a license from the state.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.600
The guy who sells fruit on the side of the road. The nanny and housekeeper who get paid off the books.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.880
Or you -- when you babysit or when you sold
lemonade on the street corner.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
All that work and the money it made can be
considered part of the informal economy.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.000
As you might guess, it’s hard to measure
exactly how big this underground economy is.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.520
Which makes some sense.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.880
It can be hard to get people who fly under the radar to answer survey questions about their wages.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.060
Excuse me small-child. Can you please give me revenue estimates for the last 4 quarters of lemonade sales?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.220
I also need the number of hours you worked
and the cost of the supplies and equipment. OK?

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.590
Also, it’s not like tax evaders and rare-animal
smugglers and cocaine dealers are going to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.870
want to give a completely honest accounting
of their finances.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.480
But economists are a diligent bunch, so they’ve
also come up with indirect macroeconomic ways

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.750
to try to wrap their head around the informal
economy. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.840
One way economists try to estimate the size
of the hidden economy is by looking at the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.460
difference between the total income a country
reports and its total expenditures.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.640
If there wasn’t an underground economy,
you’d expect the two to be pretty equal.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.120
But, if people are spending a whole lot more
than they’re legally making or borrowing,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.260
that money has to be coming from somewhere.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.740
So, the difference between the two might help indicate the size of the informal economy in a given country.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.599
Economists also look at the demand for cash
since many of the transactions that take place

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.159
in the underground economy take place in cash.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.819
It’s not like most street vendors are set
up to take Apple Pay.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.129
And you probably don’t want to write a check
for an endangered salamander or something.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.049
A greater demand for cash in an economy might
signal a larger underground economy.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.000
Another way economists attempt to measure the size of the informal economy is by studying electricity use.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.940
It turns electricity is a good indicator of
total economic activity.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.000
I guess everyone from off-the-books dishwashers
to drug dealers need energy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.440
So, if electricity use is high and the GDP
is relatively low, economists estimate the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.049
underground economy is doing pretty well.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.929
Thanks Thought Bubble. So just how big do
economists think the informal economy is?

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:14.340
Huge. Huge-huge. Trillions of dollars globally.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.889
The underground economy is less active in
developed countries,

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:24.480
where economists estimate it is between 10 and 20 percent of total GDP. But that’s still a lot of money.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.520
In the U.S. the underground economy is probably
worth somewhere between 1 and 2 trillion dollars.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.860
And in developing countries, the underground economy often accounts for more than 1/3 of economic output.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.060
The International Labor Organization says the informal economy also employs half to three quarters

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.909
of all non-farm employees in developing countries.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:53.200
In India, for example, as many as 90% of workers have jobs of the books. Out of reach of the government.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.960
And there have even been places where the
ENTIRE economy was informal. Seriously.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.540
Look up the Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong.
It was amazing. Bad, yes, but amazing.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.620
A lot of work in the informal economy is
focused on selling or doing everyday things --

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.520
just out of sight of the government.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.680
But we should take a minute to talk about
the illegal trade that goes on around the world.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.820
According to the UN, organized crime is an
870-billion dollar a year business.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.840
About 1.5% of global GDP. Drug trafficking is
the biggest chunk of that -- about $320 billion.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.020
Counterfeiting earns about $250 billion a
year for criminal groups.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.170
There’s also billions getting made from human
trafficking -- smuggling people across borders.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.520
Exploiting the environment is profitable, too.
Timber trafficking is a $3.5 billion business.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.900
Smugglers also kill and sell ivory from elephants,
horn from rhinos, bones from tigers.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.980
The E.U. recently asked member countries to do
a better job counting vice in their GDP totals.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.960
According to the New York Times, statisticians
in Spain tried to pinpoint the average price

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.460
of a room at a Spanish brothel, and what
Spanish prostitutes charged per session.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.180
Britain has also tried to put numbers on its sex and drug trade -- its office of National Statistics thinks prostitution

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.940
and drug sales added about 10 billion pounds
-- that's $17 billion -- to the country’s GDP in 2009.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.360
Because illegal markets are by-their-nature illegal,
they can often be dangerous places to buy or sell.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.660
Take the market for human kidneys.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.840
Kidney sellers often get less for their
kidney than they agreed to before a surgery.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.460
They might not get the medical care they were
promised.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.160
People on the receiving end of the kidney sometimes wind up with diseased or non-matching organs.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.220
And there’s not much you can do if you illegally
buy a lousy kidney.

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.269
So some ethicists and economists argue the
market for kidneys should be legalized.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.340
They say it’s better to allow the government
to set some ground rules in a market that,

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.009
it seems, is going to exist with or without
regulation.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.529
Allowing people to sell their kidneys could
also help solve the supply problem --

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.429
keeping thousands of people who need
new kidneys from dying each year.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:08.380
But, making the kidney market legal, moving
it into the official economy, has it’s own risks.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.880
In Iran, where it’s actually legal to sell
kidneys, the sellers are typically poor.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.879
Do we really want poor people selling organs
to help provide for their families?

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.590
Do we want situations where people might be
coerced into selling a kidney for money?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.480
Let’s go back to the broader informal economy.
You might be thinking to yourself,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.860
"OK Adriene, I get that unscrupulous organ traffickers should be put out of business."

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.420
"And I’m against protected rain forests
getting chopped down as much as the next person."

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.530
"But what’s wrong with people doing LEGAL
jobs, just working off the books?"

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.350
And It’s a fair question.
It depends on who you ask.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.060
Groups like the International Labor Organization point out that all that work in the informal economy

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.780
don’t have the same sort of safety-net place
as people who work in regulated jobs.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.180
They might not get sick time or health insurance.
They might not get paid overtime -- or get paid at all.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.020
They may not get to work with the safety precautions
in place that the government would require.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.400
And while it’s not always true, informal employment often means poor working conditions and increasing poverty.

00:07:08.409 --> 00:07:14.109
The people who take this work are often women and migrant laborers, or people who don’t have access to better jobs.

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:19.060
Economists also point out that a big informal
economy makes it difficult for the government

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.240
to get an accurate count of those important economic statistics like unemployment and income.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.960
And that might encourage misguided policies.

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:32.469
But, the underground economy CAN offer jobs
and work where they don’t otherwise exist.

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:38.740
Researchers estimate the size of the informal economy in the U.S. doubled during the financial crisis.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.639
People who were laid off from their jobs,
with no prospects for formal employment,

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:46.110
picked up odd-jobs to piece together a living.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.120
And they turned around and spent some of that money in the formal economy. Places like the grocery store.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.740
The informal economy can serve as a temporary buffer for individuals -- and the economy as a whole.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.420
But economists worry the growth of the underground
economy can set off a negative cycle --

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:07.400
basically as people drop out of the official economy, and stop paying taxes, tax revenue falls.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.600
Governments are then faced with
a couple of choices.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.500
They can respond with cuts in spending on things like social safety nets, or they can increase taxes.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:21.920
But that creates a vicious cycle, pushing more people into under the table jobs. And on. And on.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.340
So, the informal economy is complicated.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.760
Governments can try to fight it, they can
try to integrate it, but they can’t ignore it.
