00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.290
- What do we got here?

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.000
LORI: I have 1800s Sinclair
Scott apple peeler.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.710
Be careful.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.880
You might need a tetanus shot
after you touch that thing.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880
[laughter]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.040
[apple crunching]

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.710
LORI: I came down
to the pawn shop

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.540
today to sell my
late-1800s apple peeler.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.710
It doesn't come in handy for me.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.540
It's in pretty good condition.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.000
It just needs to be
polished up a little bit.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.880
Pretty self-explanatory.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.080
It's an apple peeler.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.000
Can I take a look at it?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.830
LORI: Yeah.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.170
All right.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.540
So where in the world
did you get this?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.250
LORI: I got it from
my grandma Betty.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.380
It was passed down
from her grandmother.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.250
It's been in the family for,
I'd say, 100 years or so.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't peel my apples,
so I don't really

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.750
have any use for it anymore.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.920
I don't think anyone's had use
for that for about 100 years.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.170
When they first
started, they were

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.000
more of a commercial thing.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.830
If you were a guy with a
small apple cider company

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.380
or something like
that, you would have--

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.040
you know, you'd have 10
of these things going.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.540
Right.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.710
People sitting there all
day long cranking them.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.380
The average farmer
in the country,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.250
if his wife asked him for
that, would laugh at her.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.750
LORI: Right.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.040
So how does it work?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.620
You'd stick the
apple on there,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.960
and then clamp this on a
counter or a bench or something,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.620
and screw it on.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.960
It looks like we might be
missing a little flat piece

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.290
right there.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.920
And you would crank this, and--

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.710
it's little rusty.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.790
LORI: Yeah.
- There you go.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.080
You'd peel your apple.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960
Sweet.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.120
What do you want
to do with it?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
LORI: I'd like to sell it.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.750
Any idea of how much
you're looking to get?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.580
- I was thinking like $90.
- $90?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.790
You know, it's cool.
It's neat.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460
It doesn't really
have a practical use.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.380
All it is is a
decoration, at this point.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.330
Right.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.420
That being said, I could
probably give you around $50

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.790
for it.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.290
- Would you do $75?
- Nope.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170
I'll go $60.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.000
I'm investing money in an
antique apple peeler here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580
It's not-- it's not Apple stock.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.500
- I'd take $60.
- $60?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.420
All right.
Deal.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.670
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.670
[inaudible] you
want to write her up?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.330
- Yeah, come on.
- All right.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960
When he offered me $50, I knew
that that was a good deal.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.170
But I just wanted to
see how far I could go.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.830
I feel good.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.830
I'm going to go and have a
really nice lunch, on them.
