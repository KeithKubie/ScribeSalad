00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.320

 phone calls yes yes and that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 I really like this at last but I was very 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.899
 touched especially since I am moved 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.829
 especially since I have a little son 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.070
 Edward I hear it moved me ok again 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.339
 and you said yes in the center of paris 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.040
 in which laughs yes I was on the side of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.140
 was waiting or the garden side of the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 luxembourg a super his peers and that wants 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.080
 say what for you to receive the award 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.380
 nobel what does it mean to you 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:29.090
 listen to it first 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 one on the game takes not at all 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:39.030
 to have this thing really it got me 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 much touched that the juries but that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.180
 made me a lot of smokers yes but has 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.159
 stretched out his emotions hand to help you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.299
 are writing several years 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.549
 why are you actually writing yes I have that 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.869
 I started very early because I 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.759
 in fact I lost it particular wheels 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.680
 and I started very early at the age of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.350
 20 years old and so 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.090
 yes it starts to do a lot in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.990
 my pace for me yes it was some 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 natural thing at the end of the game yes it's 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.290
 one thing but since the beginning and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.270
 that she scree because you have 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.660
 writes about twenty or thirty 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.660
 books 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 there is some vacuum that you like 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.520
 a lot to what means 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.460
 several pounds of other facts because 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.520
 that in fact I always had the impression 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.560
 to describe a little bit the same book it's up to 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.410
 say decree is already almost 45 years 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.930
 yes I always had the impression 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.630
 to write the same book is actually in 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.240
 taking a bit of a continuous way 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.840
 like that but it was always a 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.280
 little the same book of the same and obviously 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890
 we are not quite happy with this 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.390
 that have written because when we write 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.030
 can never really be his reader 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.480
 so all that is a bit confusing but the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.390
 only socialist impression and that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.940
 it was the same book as if 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.590
 I stopped for them to take a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.200
 step but actually it's part of the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.820
 even the same book written for 45 years 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.310
 but if we will tell the world that she is 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.590
 this is the book we have to read 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.350
 now the first of the calves as 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.060
 now you had to have a package 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:42.640
 in the world 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 yes, uh, we are always said more 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.770
 I always feel like it's the 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.890
 last book I write in fact and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.950
 is called how is it called hum 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.760
 that the so that you do not lose yourself in 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.480
 the neighborhood 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.820
 for keith dean ethernet to 1 2 for that 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.430
 you do not get lost they have like 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.709
 someone who gives a concept everything for 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.530
 that you do not get lost in the neighborhood 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.980
 in fact it's the last deal to comes from 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.150
 look 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.150
 we are always a little 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.560
 after we lose a little visibility of 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.300
 motives but the last obviously this is 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.620
 the one you still have a little bit of 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.240
 all want more and you have to do the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.650
