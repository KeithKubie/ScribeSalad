OMT was developed at General Electric corporation by James Rumbaugh and

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.110
others that were there. It resulted in a book, a cover of a book as a,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.435
a die on which there are three visible faces. And

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:18.970
one face has a class model diagram, one face has a state chart diagram, and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.170
one face has a data flow diagram. The class model gave you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.040
the structural aspects, the state chart gave you the behavioral aspects, and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.050
the data flow diagram gave you the functional aspects.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.250
That is OMT was a way of putting together three views of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.205
a system into a cohesive view. As OMT was coming along other competitive,

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.680
object-oriented methods and diagrams were also being developed.
