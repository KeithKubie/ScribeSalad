00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
All right, I'm Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. This is part 2 in our slow motion sound series

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.220
We're recording stuff with the Phantom

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.389
And we're going to just play it back and show you how to create those sounds and there's something just inherently funny

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.319
About a banana and right next to your face about blow up. I don't know why, but that's just funny! Also something funny about a bana...

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.960
Whoa! *hysterical laughter*

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.900
All right look this is gonna be one of the more ridiculous videos on smarter every day

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.949
It's because Gordon and I got the giggles right so this video is about

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.299
Blowing up a banana right next to Gordon and a bottle and showing how the slow motion sounds are created, but if I'm honest

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.399
It's more about hanging out with Gordon. Here you go; slow motion sounds.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.009
Gordon: Whenever I'm explaining what we do on the channel to people, I really hold us to a higher standard

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.859
than a lot of other channels. Like you know we we do 'edutainment'

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.840
We're very educational; sometimes the science gets really deep. We're not like all those other channels that just, like, blow stuff up,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.460
and don't teach you anything.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.800
We're not like them at all. As soon as you bring me here it's like; 'PUT A FIRECRACKER IN A BANANA!'

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920
*laughter*

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
Science later!

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.740
*more laughter*

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.920
Okay, yeah, oh man

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.470
Oh wait is the audio recording?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
What's happening

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is so scary

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.260
Is this a dud that's not going to go?  I don't think it's going to go.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.340
That was the most intense, like 30 seconds. I haven't laughed that hard in a really long time.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.349
All right

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.268
My heart. Why you do me like that, banana? All right, baby? Yeah

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.269
This is why we came to Alabama for

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380
To learn about the culture. Okay

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.960
Bang! Bang!  Ohh!  Got it!

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.980
Did you get it all over you?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.760
You good? Earplugs work? Yeah, yeah. All right, let's look at the high speed. Gross! Okay,

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.909
I know we're goofing around and having a little fun here, but do you remember what Gordon said in the last episode?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.390
We are gonna record the sound because one of the questions we always get is

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.999
Can you just record the sounds real-time and slow it down the answer is no, which we'll explain later

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.880
We recorded this video at 28,000 frames per second, which is roughly a thousand times slower than standard video.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.460
Here's the slow most sped up a thousand times and laid over the top of the audio exactly as we recorded it

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.100
Now let's cut the audio speed in half

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.970
Here's audio at a quarter speed. Here's one tenth the speed of the original audio.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250
Once we stretch the audio down to

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.240
1/100th, it no longer sounds like an exploding banana - it sounds like something else I love. Can you figure out why this is happening?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.960
Slow motion banana explosions sound like the Saturn V rockets

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.080
No, slow motion sound effects are not recorded at the moment, right? No they're not. And why, why is that?

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.658
Because when you slow down a sound you make the waveform longer, you make the sound lower

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.760
So we think we can get a more interesting

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.800
organic feeling effect by redesigning it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.140
If Gordon's trying to make this slow-motion video feel more organic and interesting by adding things to it

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.700
What kinds of things is he looking for? There's one more experiment,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.270
let's see if we can figure out how he thinks. Okay last thing - do you remember the first video

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.549
we worked on together? Sure do. What was it? It was bottles, and yeah, we blew up some bottles

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.679
And it wasn't a science video it was more of just like an... art thing?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.500
We used your song, Cicada's Waltz, so, so I think we should blow up a bottle... for old times sake here. Sure, yeah that'll be fun.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.580
So I'm thinking bullet comes in the neck here

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.459
in and then we should be able to see the bullet do its thing on the way out,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.000
and everything's gonna get wet. We're gonna hide because there's gonna be glass that flies.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.130
The aim looks like it's the right offset that we figured out earlier. Three, two, one

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.539
One of the first things we do always is we always lay down like a drone and just underneath everything, to give like...

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.439
To make the silence more interesting, and because there is no such thing as like a totally silent room, other than like an anechoic chamber

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.029
We're gonna go bam. We got something for the... we have to do our impact

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.409
What's so what's interesting that we want to highlight in this video, I think,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.909
is definitely gonna be the cap launching off, and we're definitely gonna want like sound for the bullet coming through,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.570
and this split here is also one of the more interesting parts of the video.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.819
As well as the exit of the bullet. So you pick out like specific things that happen temporally

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.010
and then you highlight them with sound. Yeah, yeah,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.219
because if we just try to cover everything realistically, it can become just sort of like a mishmash and...

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.560
Or just like a wash. We just we're picking the important parts, and we're highlighting those things.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.170
That's what keeps entertainment interesting. It makes sense now that I think back on the slow-mo footage you've done in the past.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.760
Yeah.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.100
You look for like knocks or bings or something that's hitting. What do we want people to look at,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:13.320
or what is, what are people already looking at. So you're highlighting visual things with acoustic cues (yeah), or audio cues, that's awesome. Yeah totally.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.960
{ Long Bang Sound }

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.520
{ Bullet hits bottle }

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.460
{ Glass shattering }

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.820
What can people do right now with their mouse to support you in a way that changes your life for the good?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.620
Follow me on Spotify. That would be handy

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.430
A Shell In The Pit on Spotify. And just follow you. Yep, you can listen to all the smarter every day music there,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.440
and all my game soundtracks. That's awesome. Yeah. Thank you very much dude.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.140
{ Bang Bang }

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.740
All right, I know this video was different, um, but I hope you understand now that

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:10.159
slow motion sound is in fact created by a guy named Gordon McGladdery from A Shell In The Pit, but I want to say

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.240
thank you to the sponsor because that helps me pay Gordon. This episode of smarter every day

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.040
was sponsored by

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.040
23 and Me

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The sponsor for this video is

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.719
23 and Me which is a personalized genetic testing service - if you want to check out your DNA all you have to do is go to

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.509
www.23andme.com/smarter

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.219
And you can get a kit, just like this. This kit will come to your house, you spit in the kit

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.950
and then you mail the kit off, and once you do that, you get to learn a lot of stuff about your own DNA

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.820
It's fantastic

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.999
I went and checked out the lab itself because a lot of people are concerned about privacy

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:59.870
But I went and checked out exactly how they did everything, for example, this is a genotype test. They're not testing every specific

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.630
location on your DNA - that would be sequencing.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.429
This is a genotype type test so it's not your whole genome. Anyway

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:13.070
If you want to know more about your own body then go to 23andme.com/smarter

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.360
and you can get your own DNA tested, and you can learn all kinds of different stuff

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.490
I enjoyed it because I got to talk about the results of where our ancestors were from with my father

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:28.720
Which was a blast. Anyway, if you support Smarter Every Day by going to 23andme.com/smarter

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.200
That will support me, which enables me to continue to support Gordon,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.880
which means we've got plenty of slow-motion sound to come.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.740
Anyway, that's it. I'm Destin. You're getting smarter every day. Thank you for tolerating this video

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.549
I know this was just more of a fun video than most, but it was uh, it was a blast.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:54.319
I'm Destin, getting smarter every day. Have a good one. Please consider subscribing if you feel like somehow this has earned your subscription. Bye!
