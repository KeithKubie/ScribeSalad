JASON SANDERS: Thank you for
joining us for another Talks

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.030
at Google event.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.390
We're lucky enough to be
joined today by Meb Keflezighi.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.460
Meb is, of course, a man
who needs no introduction.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.050
Shortly after immigrating to
the United States in 1987,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.990
Meb discovered he was
a natural born runner.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.900
And the rest, as
they say, is history.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.130
He's won more than
20 national titles.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.460
You're the former
American record

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.430
holder in the 10,000 meter.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.000
You're the only runner in
history, American or otherwise,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.758
to have won Boston, New
York, and an Olympic medal.

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:37.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.890
And you're the founder of the
Meb Foundation, a nonprofit

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190
which funds programs
that promote

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.020
fitness and other positive
lifestyle choices for children.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.436
And so without further
ado, let's talk to Meb.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:53.810
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
Thank you, Jason.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.520
JASON SANDERS: So thanks
again for joining us today.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.930
Congratulations on
another top 10 performance

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.260
on Monday in Boston.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.840
I know, though, that the race
didn't go exactly how you'd

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.312
hoped, especially that last 5K.

00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:12.270
You've had a couple days
to think about it now.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.030
Do you have any
thoughts about the race?

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.490
I know people have asked
you a lot about this.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.680
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.040
Most definitely.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890
It's a great honor
to be here at Google.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.595
And thanks for the opportunity.

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:23.720
It was a great honor to
represent the United States

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.590
over my career, but
especially last year,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.470
to be able to win the Boston
Marathon on the most important

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.260
day, on Monday, after
the bombing of 2013,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.550
to help expedite the
healing process of the many

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.350
that got affected.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.640
And unfortunately we can't get
the lives back that we lost.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.720
But I tried to do
something really positive.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.560
That was my goal.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.380
And this year, going
into the 2015 Boston,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.330
my whole goal was just make
it over Heartbreak Hill

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.130
and the last two, three
miles-- two miles, actually--

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.060
and everything will play itself.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.920
Use the support of the crowd.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.130
And the race unfolded
the way I anticipated it

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.790
would, and stayed [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.860
It was really windy,
so I tucked in behind,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.290
didn't do crazy moves.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.345
A lot of people were doing
sprint, slow, sprint, slow.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:11.845
And I was in the back, just
kind of taking a mental note who

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:13.640
was doing that, and
I was going to come

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.690
to hunt them at the end.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.740
So I was looking
forward to the crowd

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.690
and to the last mile,
mile and a half.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.650
And unfortunately, with
about three miles to go,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.180
I had an upset stomach, and
I guess I had eaten lunch.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.550
It's not a good scenery
for it, but I had

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.160
to stop five times in between.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
And I was trying
to close the gap,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.510
because they made the move.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.800
And the water, the
fluid wouldn't go down

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.180
as I was trying to sprint,
and stopped five times.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.750
And basically, just I
didn't have the opportunity

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.020
that I was anticipating in
the last mile, mile and a half

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.940
to use the crowd to help propel
me forward to go to Boston

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.070
and stay for another,
try to defend the title.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.690
But sometimes you don't
always get what you want

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.950
or what you desire.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.710
You just gotta finish
the task that was ahead

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.840
and what is there for
you, you seize the moment.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.460
And for me, just to come
across the finish line

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.417
in eighth place, as
Jason said, top 10,

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.750
anytime you finish at the
world's major marathon top 10,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.870
is a great, great honor.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.760
And you know, I feel strong.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.470
And I was able to see a spot--
one of the elite women that was

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.660
running, she made me work hard.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.080
I had to sprint really hard.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.660
And I just got-- right before,
from here probably to the exit

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.470
sign there, I caught up to her
and raised her hand to say,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.550
hey, we did it together.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.700
And it was a great finish,
representing the United States.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.350
JASON SANDERS: So
after Boston, we

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.240
appreciate you coming up to
New York here to join us.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.840
I know you're based
in California.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.520
You went to UCLA,
and then you were

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.400
based in Mammoth Lakes
and now San Diego.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.320
But you seem to have very
strong ties to New York.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.360
You've run the New York
marathon nine times.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.370
You've been top 10
seven of those times,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.910
and you w won it
in 2009, famously.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.820
You've run the New York
half several times.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.640
You've run even 10Ks in
Central Park a few times.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.870
What is that keeps bringing
you back to New York?

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.700
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: New York
is my second home here,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.300
because I've won many
competitions, anywhere

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.450
from the 8K to the 10K,
Healthy Kidney, half marathon.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.700
In fact, I was runner up in
the inaugural half marathon

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.110
in-- I believe it was in
2005, when it was in August,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.810
when it was hot and humid.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.160
And they changed it to a
tune-up for the spring marathon.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.220
So the New York Road
Runners do a great job.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.020
My first marathon was here in
2002, where I went for the win,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.300
and it was a cold and
chilly morning, 38 degrees.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.520
The water is outside.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.350
And you know, when
you get 19 miles,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.150
you kind of get a
little bit, maybe, warm.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.470
And I'm like, I threw my
beanie away, my gloves away,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.540
and put water over my head.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.820
And that kind of
shut the engine off.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.120
And I was doing really nice
rhythm, running like this,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.320
started doing stomping.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.320
And I got it down
to four people.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.165
I said, best scenario,
I think I can still win,

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.230
and worst scenario
I got fourth place.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.710
And I got slower and slower.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.850
And the qualifying time for
the Olympics for the 2004 was

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.830
sub-2:12.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.390
And I ran 2:12:35.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.310
I missed it by 35 seconds.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.410
But I always tell, the New York
City Marathon, the first time

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.650
I did it, I got my Ph.D. I
learned a lot what to do,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.370
what not to do.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.530
So since then, it's been
kind of like the relationship

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.357
that I have with the
New York runners,

00:05:35.357 --> 00:05:36.440
who put on amazing events.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.690
And I just keep coming back.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.650
And as Jason said, I've
done it nine times.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.880
Seven times I've
been in the top 10.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.390
And people dream to come
to New York just to visit.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.680
And we have the
privilege to run.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.160
Those cities close, and do
[INAUDIBLE] through the five

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.380
boroughs and to be able to
come finish in Central Park

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.020
is really honored.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.020
And the streets are closed,
because I can't even

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.610
get a taxi for 45
minutes sometimes.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.320
So it's an honor
to be in New York

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.920
and be able to have that
relationship with them

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.344
and try to run the best
that I can every time.

00:06:14.344 --> 00:06:16.010
And I've been-- like
you said, I won it.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.968
I've been second place.

00:06:16.968 --> 00:06:19.444
I've been third place,
been fourth place,

00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:21.610
been sixth place twice, and
the first time I did it,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.140
I was in ninth place.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.490
So I struggled my first one,
but I kind of love, love,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.980
love-- I do struggle.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.570
In fact, the first time
I did the marathon,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.840
I said, never again.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.020
It was bad.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.860
It was really bad.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.950
I couldn't even walk or squat.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.036
But at the same time, we
do forget some things,

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:45.160
and we want to do it again.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.605
I'm glad I didn't make that
my last-- my mom was there,

00:06:48.605 --> 00:06:51.620
the first time she saw me run
the marathon, both my parents

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.620
and my son.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.610
It's OK to do 5K, 10K, but
no more marathons for you.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.999
No mother wants to see her
son or daughter in pain,

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:02.040
and I was really in pain.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.930
But you know, I got over it.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.290
And in fact, I was
born in Eritrea.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.770
So I went and visited.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.220
And I understood
how life in Eritrea

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.270
is versus the United
States, because you

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.010
have to go three miles to
get water out of the well.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.170
And you have to go
two, three miles

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.620
to get branches or
bark from a tree

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.966
to have fire to cook,
to boil the water,

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:24.840
and things like that.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.510
So that made me realize the
pain that I was going through

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.513
in the last four, five
miles was not that bad,

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:32.629
so don't complain.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:33.670
So I wanted to come back.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.670
I said, coach, I'm ready
to do another marathon.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.912
And I want to do Boston.

00:07:36.912 --> 00:07:37.870
He said, wait a minute.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.240
No, not yet.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.097
So through marathons,
I have learned a lot.

00:07:41.097 --> 00:07:41.930
JASON SANDERS: Yeah?

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.350
I think we're all grateful
that you, in this instance,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.020
didn't listen to your mom.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.230
Though I'm sure in most
instances, you did.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.890
So marathoning has taken
you a lot of places.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.741
But as a child, soccer was
actually your favorite sport,

00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:57.240
right?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.381
So how did you discover that
you were talented at running?

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:03.880
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I was born in
Eritrea where there was a war.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.116
And you didn't have
the normal childhood,

00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:08.990
and you didn't know what
the next day brings.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.015
But the only fun thing probably
we did was play soccer.

00:08:12.015 --> 00:08:14.560
And in fact, it was
makeshift soccer.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.200
So arm warmers or
socks, long socks,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.380
you stuff it in with plastic.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.200
And you tie it and
then do a second layer.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.510
And you sew it, so
you could have--

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.140
it's not like playing on the
grass or nice smooth air.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.850
There's rocks and dirt
and all that stuff.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.900
Barefoot, so the plastic
would make it bounce up high.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.799
And that's how we played soccer.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.560
And then eventually,
we just said--

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.490
we came to Italy, lived in
Italy for a year and a half.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.930
My brothers and
sisters and my mom,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.910
who were separated from
my dad for five years.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:55.267
He has to walk from Eritrea to
Sudan, 225 miles in seven days

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:56.850
to save his life,
otherwise he's going

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.750
to get killed or prison
by [INAUDIBLE] soldiers.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.662
And then we went
to Italy-- futbol,

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:03.870
that's what it's known there.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.400
I used to play futbol.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.662
And I got the nickname Pele.

00:09:07.662 --> 00:09:09.780
So that was my nickname.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.165
And I thought I'd be a
professional soccer player.

00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:13.915
But then when we came
to the United States

00:09:13.915 --> 00:09:18.430
in 1987, two, three
years later, I

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.719
heard my dad talk
about my brother's

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:23.760
doing soccer and running--
the soccer coach wants

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.850
him to play soccer year round.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.870
The running coach wants
him to run year round.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.169
So there was a little
bit of favoritism,

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:32.210
who was going to play,
who was not going to play.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.300
So my dad just said, choose one
and do it well to my brother.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.779
And that's when I
kind of let soccer go.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.070
I could control my own destiny.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.029
And running is beautiful
because you get out

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:44.070
of it what you put in it.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.986
And you start here, you
finish there together.

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:49.320
There's no stopping in
between or judgmental things.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.820
So it's whatever
effort you put in.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.515
And I always say, run to win.

00:09:52.515 --> 00:09:54.290
It doesn't mean
getting first place,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.500
but getting the best out
of yourself each time

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.780
and every time on the moment.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.310
JASON SANDERS: So let's talk
a little bit about the book,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.810
"Meb For Mortals."

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.720
The elite running coach, Greg
McMillan, he's called you the,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.324
quote, "king of
the little things."

00:10:09.324 --> 00:10:10.740
I don't know if
you've heard that.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.820
But to some extent,
this book is kind

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.024
of about all the little things.

00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:19.440
Could you talk a little bit
about what those little things

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.132
really are and what you might
expect to find in this book?

00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:25.340
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: "Meb For
Mortals," it's a great honor

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.070
to have [INAUDIBLE] help me
out with it and Scott Douglas

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.990
to write the book.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.120
And what it does
is, people think

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.130
you run 10 miles or 15 miles.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.630
I got it.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.129
I got it.

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:40.960
But to have the longevity
and to have the consistency,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.730
you have to do the small
things that make a difference.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.860
People say, go the extra
mile, go the extra mile.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.080
Really, you need to
take that one mile less

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.860
and emphasize on doing
stretches before or after,

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.530
doing the core exercise a
little bit before or after,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.180
or doing the drills.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.200
And are they boring or kind
of monotone at the same time?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.870
Sure.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.040
But those small things add up
to be big things down the road.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.680
It keeps you injury free.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.905
It helps you be stronger.

00:11:09.905 --> 00:11:11.780
If you're stronger,
you're going to run more.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.840
You're going to
be more efficient.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.080
So that's what "Meb For
Mortals" discusses about.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.150
And I don't like ice bath.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.670
But I used to sit in the ice
bath for 15 minutes every day,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:28.120
probably 340, 330 days a year.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.380
And I used to shiver for four
or five hours afterwards.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.830
And not fun, but
I know they were

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.310
essential to help me be-- have
an injury, you recover faster,

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.330
so you can do it day in,
day out, week in, week out,

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.914
month in, month out, and do it
for a long time over the years.

00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:45.705
JASON SANDERS: So it's
about all the things

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:47.620
that maybe a recreational
runner is not

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.830
doing between runs
that would potentially

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.287
help them to achieve a
higher level, stay healthy?

00:11:53.287 --> 00:11:54.870
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah,
most definitely.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.330
I mean, I can't ask everybody
to be New York City champion

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.430
or Boston champion
or Olympic medals,

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.160
but you can use those principles
to apply it to nutritionally,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.100
stretching-wise, core
wise, and training-wise,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.230
to how it can help you be the
best that you individually

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.730
can be.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.700
And if you see it--
and the book shows

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.500
a lot of illustration of
what to do, what not to do.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.010
So if you can do that, it will
help you be the best you can.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.270
JASON SANDERS: Right.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.650
So you talk about being
the best you can be.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.960
And some of the book is
about setting good goals,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.820
that that's a big
part of the process.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.600
So you are a couple of
weeks from turning 40.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.370
You've said that winning
Boston last year-- you

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.060
don't seem it, by the way.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.950
Winning Boston last year has
made your career 110% complete.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.420
So what are some of the goals
you have for the next year?

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.870
I mean, the trials
are coming up.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.270
Can we expect a masters
marathon record?

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.260
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah, I
mean, goals are recommend.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.870
And you have to set them
weekly and yearly and whatnot.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.380
But yes, the Boston
Marathon was the capping

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.160
of my running career, because
it started with seventh grade PE

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.960
class, trying to get an A,
trying to earn a T-shirt.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.790
And who would have
ever thought I

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.360
would have that all in between?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.710
And who would've ever
thought that also,

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.480
that it would be coming at the
biggest stage of the Boston

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.220
Marathon.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.800
And the only thing that
was missing on my resume

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.770
was just the Boston title, and I
was able to get that last year.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.710
So going forward, what my
goal is, in terms of running,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.871
hopefully do a fall
marathon, hopefully New York.

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.100
And also the trials
are in February.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.720
So if I could earn my spot,
top three, to go to Rio,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.152
that would be my
fourth Olympic team.

00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:51.450
And be 41, to participate in
it, it would be a huge honor.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.430
And why do I want to do that?

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.080
Two things.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.510
One is, every time you get
an opportunity to represent

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.160
our country, it's a huge honor.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.824
And also, my daughters--
I have nine, seven,

00:14:02.824 --> 00:14:05.240
and five years old daughters,
and they were all in London.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.670
But the three-- she was three
at the time, five year old now,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.020
she does not remember
what happened in London.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.610
So it would be good for her to
see if I could make the team

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.136
and remember what her
daddy did as an Olympian.

00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:18.010
JASON SANDERS: Right.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.270
And so an important
part of this,

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.000
especially for
recreational runners,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.290
is setting realistic goals.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.310
You alluded before
to just missing out

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:32.700
on the Olympic marathon team
in Sydney by 35 seconds.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.640
But you did end up going
to that Games, right,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.900
and you competed in the
10,000 meters, correct?

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.110
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: So missing
the New York was for 2004.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.749
Sydney was my first
Olympic in the 10K.

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:43.790
JASON SANDERS: Right, OK.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.630
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: But I went to
Chicago-- setting goals, right?

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.780
I want to break 2:12.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.036
And I ran 2:10:03.

00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:53.320
And it's probably the
only time that I ever

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.820
went farther than 26.2, because
your body usually shuts down.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.830
But that day, I was
just running 2:12.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.000
I was very conservative.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.170
And I finished, and I went for
a half mile cool down, which

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.370
is crazy, after a marathon.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:15.030
But I made the 2004 team in the
10K, which I won the trials,

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.040
and set the championship record.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.740
I was second in the
trials to Alan Culpepper.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.660
And my times were
probably more realistic,

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.770
the medal in the 10K,
than was the marathon.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.940
But because of the history
behind how the marathon started

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.170
was from Marathon to Athens,
what Pheidippides and announced

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.220
that they defeated the
Persians at Greece,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.720
I couldn't turn it down, just
because of the historic moment

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.220
of it.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.510
And the marathon is one
of the prestigious events.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.920
And it was into the
closing ceremony,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.080
even though my chances
were, like I said, better

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.570
to medal in the 10K with
the American record and all

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.070
that stuff.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.480
But Coach Larsen, for a
long time my mentor now,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.240
we decided go for the marathon.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.160
The hills, the humidity, and the
course will equalize everybody.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.450
So we went for that and came
home with a silver medal.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.650
JASON SANDERS: And so the
10K that I'm thinking of

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.076
is the night of the finals,
your father said to you--

00:16:13.076 --> 00:16:14.550
he's always pushed you.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.870
And he said, Meb, you're
going to win tonight.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.260
And so this is-- in
terms of realistic goals,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.530
this is an example
where run to win

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.610
meant something
different to you, right?

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.026
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
Absolutely, Jason.

00:16:28.026 --> 00:16:30.480
So my dad in 2000, I
made the Olympic team.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.810
I'm so excited to be on
my first Olympic team.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.870
And my time was 28
minutes and three seconds,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.000
which is fast but
not fast enough

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.720
to be a contender for the medal.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.620
So we were going to the
stadium and he goes,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.945
you're going to win tonight.

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:47.577
I was like, Dad, I
can't win tonight.

00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:48.910
He's like, don't think that way.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.076
You're going to win tonight.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm like, Dad,
they've run 26:30.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.810
I have yet to break 28 minute.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.620
And it's a minute and
a half in between.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.756
That's more than a lap and
a half almost on the track.

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:04.089
So hopefully I won't get lapped.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.910
But hopefully one day
I'll close the gap

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.730
and hopefully be
able to beat them.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.040
And that's what happened.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.130
And so I finished 12th.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.450
I barely made the final.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.410
In fact, they had a prelim
for the 10K on Friday,

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.090
Monday final.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:23.246
I broke 28 minutes
on both occasions,

00:17:23.246 --> 00:17:25.079
and I was the second-to-last
guy to qualify,

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.204
because I had the flu that
you get in the athletes'

00:17:27.204 --> 00:17:30.590
village, where everybody's
there and gets--

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.394
the downside of the athletes'
village is you get sick,

00:17:33.394 --> 00:17:34.810
and the flu that
was going around.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.220
And I finished 12th overall.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.770
And then 2004, four
years later, the guy

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.690
Paul Tergat from Kenya,
who was second at the 10K,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.930
the greatest distance
runner in my book, I think,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.890
Haile Gebrselassie, was
running the marathon.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.770
And he was-- his best time
at the Athens Olympics

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.500
was two hours, four
minutes, and 55.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.430
My best time was 2:10:03.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.700
That's, if you look
at it, almost a mile.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.410
The only way I could beat him
was if I get a mile head start.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.890
But I know that
was not possible.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.650
And basically-- and
I really did not

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.980
think he was going to
get beaten on that day.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.750
For everybody else, silver
or bronze was fair game.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.530
But for him, I would have almost
handed it to him, the gold.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.080
And so we've got four people
going on through the race.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.640
I'm like, my gosh, if
I can beat one person,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.010
I'm going to be a medalist.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:36.490
And then eventually, I start
over-striding, longer stride.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.970
And I decide to
pick up the pace.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.950
And I'm getting away from him.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.910
I'm like, wow.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.010
And the marathon, this was
only my fourth marathon ever.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.280
So you're here, going
through the good patches

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.415
and the bad patches.

00:18:47.415 --> 00:18:49.540
I'm like, he must be going
through the bad patches.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.050
So I picked up the pace,
got it down to two people.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.840
And there was one, de Lima
from Brazil, in front of us.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.500
So like I say, I
got my bronze medal.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.670
But I think I can get second
place, maybe going for gold.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.830
So I tell Stefano
Baldini, which remember

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.040
I used to live in Italy
for a year and a half,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.565
I just told him,
[SPEAKING ITALIAN] which

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.707
means, let's go get one, two.

00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:11.540
And he looked at me.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.810
He's like, how is this
guy speaking Italian?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.367
In retrospect, I should
have made that move then,

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:22.700
kind of give him a double shock.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.740
But he looked at
me, taking leads.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.590
And we caught de Lima.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.700
And unfortunately,
he was also the guy

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.500
got attacked-- I don't know
if you guys have ever seen it.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.208
He got attacked in
the middle of the race

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:37.730
by an ex-priest that was
testifying that Sunday

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.770
should be a rest day.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:42.330
But we did not see it happen
because it happened on a turn.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.480
So I was able to
beat Paul Tergat, who

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.590
was the silver
medalist at the Olympic

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.120
when I finished 12th,
[INAUDIBLE] four years later.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.710
My goal was to bring a
medal for the United States,

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.750
and I have to beat the world
record holder to do that.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.716
And he finished eighth.

00:19:57.716 --> 00:19:58.670
I finished second.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.920
JASON SANDERS: That's amazing.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.020
And so I guess the
moral there was

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.290
it took patience and
more investment and time.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:10.070
And it's funny that Paul
Tergat, the guy that you beat,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.100
because shortly before
the 2000 Olympics,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.780
you sat down and had a
conversation with Paul, right?

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.779
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Correct.

00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:18.230
I mean, you have
to be realistic.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.280
You have to make goals
that are attainable.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.060
And I love crossing goals out.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.187
Make that goal attainable.

00:20:25.187 --> 00:20:27.020
Once you attain it, you
can always reset it.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.160
Don't set it so high that
you cannot reach it or have

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.540
a stepping stone toward that.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.250
And basically,
that's what I did.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.760
And then I also met him
in '98, the first time.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.690
I said-- in Brussels, hey, Paul.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.220
I'd love to talk
to you about it.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.350
And he took me around.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.630
He took me for a drink, for tea.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.940
And he mapped-- you need
to make small progress.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.280
I can tell you all my secrets or
the workouts that I have done.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.000
But you are at a
different level.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.250
You're here, I'm here.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.104
So to get up here, you've
got to do small things.

00:21:01.104 --> 00:21:02.020
And that's what I did.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.000
And I pass that advice
to everybody now.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.145
Because if they ask me,
people, what should I do?

00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:06.770
How many miles?

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.650
I have to know what you
are doing, because I can't

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.980
tell you to do this,
because I don't

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.188
know what your background is.

00:21:11.188 --> 00:21:16.730
And sometimes you give advice,
and they come to haunt you.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.354
Or sometimes you get advice,
and you'll be able to beat them.

00:21:20.354 --> 00:21:21.520
JASON SANDERS: That's right.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.424
You wrote a book for mortals.

00:21:23.424 --> 00:21:25.840
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: You know, it's
an honor to write the book.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.673
And who would have ever
thought, for someone

00:21:27.673 --> 00:21:29.920
who didn't speak
English coming here,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.802
we didn't have
anything, no finance

00:21:31.802 --> 00:21:33.510
but the clothes on
our back And the love,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.210
the support of my brother
and sisters and my parents.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.030
And to be able to
be here at Google

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.510
and to be able to talk
about the "Meb For Mortals,"

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.960
a book that I wrote.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.290
And I just have to pinch myself
sometimes that this is real.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.790
JASON SANDERS: I do as well too.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.047
So you've mentioned a
few times, and you often

00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:52.130
talk about running to win.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.270
And we know that's not
always about coming in first.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.710
And for a lot of us, we may
not ever win an Olympic medal.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.030
I think that's a real
possibility that I'm starting

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.820
to face in my own life.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.820
And you know from your
own experience as someone

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.260
who actually does win races that
it doesn't always mean winning.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.050
And I think probably the
best example that I know of

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.556
is at the London Olympics.

00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:19.430
And if you could talk
a little bit about what

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.880
your experience was there.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.380
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: You
know, run to win

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.060
doesn't always mean
getting first place

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.559
but getting the
best out of yourself

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:28.950
with the situation you're
faced with in that moment.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.120
And Monday, before
even going to London,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.231
I ran the best that I can that
day, and stopping five times,

00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:37.730
I could just say, you know what,
I'm not defending my title.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.750
I could stop and then
have the van pick me up.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.444
But when you start a project,
you have to finish the project.

00:22:43.444 --> 00:22:44.360
I really believe that.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.450
And my parents have always
encouraged their kids

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.140
to do that.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.300
You start something,
you must finish it.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.710
And in London 2012, I didn't
have the ideal training.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.440
Really, I had a really solid
five weeks of training.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.160
And going through
the race, I'm like,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.147
this guy's going
to go crazy fast,

00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:02.980
and then maybe I can
pick up here and there,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.770
little by little,
and finish maybe

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.640
for the bronze, the
only chance that I had.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.480
But about halfway
through the race--

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.880
people often ask me
when I run marathons,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.040
do you enjoy the scenery?

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.280
I'm like, not really.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.810
I'm just going by and
trying to concentrate

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.860
on what I'm doing,
what others are doing,

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.920
trying to get
calculated decisions.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.240
So I don't really
enjoy the scenery.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.810
But in London,
I'm like, hm, this

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.742
would be a good place
to stop, because I

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:31.700
was hurting pretty bad.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.540
I already had my Olympic medal.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.144
I was 20th, 21st place.

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:38.310
I already have signed up
for New York City Marathon,

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.594
so don't do something
crazy, injure yourself.

00:23:40.594 --> 00:23:43.260
But then I'm like, you know, I'm
representing the United States.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.720
I have the USA jersey on me.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.760
And ever since high school,
San Diego High, UCLA,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.000
and world championship,
all the big teams,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.003
you try to represent to the
country the best you can.

00:23:53.003 --> 00:23:55.090
And when I made the
Olympic team in January

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.705
that year, 2012, I said,
we're sending our best team.

00:23:57.705 --> 00:24:00.570
I hope we can represent
our country really well.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.010
And I just said, you
know what, no matter

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.320
how many people pass me, I've
got to get to that finish line.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.550
That's goal number one.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.820
And I said, I'm representing
the United States.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.660
My girls are there.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.950
If I tell them to do their
best, and say if I stop now,

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.772
was that your best?

00:24:16.772 --> 00:24:18.730
I'm going to get asked
that question eventually

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.801
when they get older.

00:24:19.801 --> 00:24:21.050
So I just said, you know what?

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.410
Get to that finish line, no
matter what the circumstances

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.695
or how many people pass you.

00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:28.810
And then I was closing
the gap, I said,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.676
maybe I can beat one person
out of those eight people

00:24:31.676 --> 00:24:32.675
that I was running with.

00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:34.840
And then the next thing
is, maybe I could beat two,

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.040
maybe I could beat three,
so constantly changing.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.690
And then all a sudden
is, I was in 15th place,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.990
I was in 13th place.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:44.400
And then with 5K to go, my
mentor Bob Larsen was there,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.900
and he pointed out like this.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.650
So I was running next
to the Japanese guy,

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.355
and I can see him.

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:51.360
And I was like, sixth place.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.360
And I'm like, am I sixth
place, or the Japanese guy's

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.030
in sixth place?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.384
I need to clarify here.

00:24:57.384 --> 00:24:58.800
He didn't give me
a clarification.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.070
And then I just said, so
basically-- and then I

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.670
see a green jersey down
the road with two miles

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.350
to go, probably like
30 second, 40 second.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.774
I'm like, if that guy
is in fourth place--

00:25:10.774 --> 00:25:12.690
this guy's in fifth
place, I'm in sixth place,

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.950
that guy's in fourth
place, for whatever reason,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.570
our sport is kind of
tainted a little with drugs.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:26.220
I'm like, if one of those guys
gets busted up in the front,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.980
and that guy's in fourth place,
if I can beat the Japanese guy,

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.430
I'm going to be in fifth place.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.130
So if somebody gets
caught, that guy's

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.790
going to move to
bronze medal, and I'm

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.980
going to move to fourth place.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.970
I say, I gotta catch that guy.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.160
And I just dug deep.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.020
And with one
kilometer to go, there

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.550
was an American supporter
or a fan there, and he goes,

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:48.140
you can get him five seconds.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.015
You can get him fast.

00:25:49.015 --> 00:25:49.860
I was like, OK.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.776
I get my head nodding.

00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:52.190
I'm going to dig deep.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.950
And then there's a picture
of us, me passing him,

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.110
with 500 meter to go.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.044
So I'm in the front, the
500 meter sign, and then

00:26:00.044 --> 00:26:00.710
him in the back.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.610
And then I'm like-- so it's not
like the New York or the Boston

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.150
Marathon was a big finish line.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.970
It's just a little
line like this.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.150
But there's a ton of people.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.980
I'm like, where's
the finish line?

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.980
Where's the finish line?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.780
I'm digging deep.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.696
I see the flag, our flag
and the Unites States.

00:26:15.696 --> 00:26:16.820
I'm like, should I grab it?

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.180
Should I not?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.388
This guy's trying to catch
me too that I just passed.

00:26:19.388 --> 00:26:22.000
I'm like, I grabbed the flag,
I want it around like this,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.250
but he's right on my heels.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.470
I tucked in like this,
running, running, running.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:32.480
And then I see little lines so
I raise our flag above my head

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.970
and finished fourth.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.560
So run to win doesn't
mean getting first place.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.600
But I felt like I was
a winner just because

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.090
from potentially dropping out
and not getting to the finish

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.730
line, finishing fourth and
passing all those people was

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.020
one of the proudest moments.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.940
And dig deep, beyond
yourself for the country.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.250
So run to win doesn't
always mean first place,

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:52.905
but getting the best
out of yourself,

00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:53.930
each time, every time.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.055
JASON SANDERS: Yeah, to
come back from one of those

00:26:56.055 --> 00:26:58.720
rough patches is some of the
hardest thing that you can do.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.890
Anyone who's run a
marathon knows that

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.270
and can identify with that
more than they can identify

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.110
with last year in
Boston, where you're

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:11.190
leading the pack for
pretty much the whole race.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.230
For mortals, for the
inexperienced runners,

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.800
one of the hardest
things going into a race

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.360
is picking a goal, one or more
kind of pace or time goals,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.970
or maybe it's to finish.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:32.814
I imagine you sometimes
struggle with what

00:27:32.814 --> 00:27:33.730
your goals need to be.

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.420
I know that you've
said, the first goal

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.290
is always to win, then
podium, then personal best.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.560
But what are the workouts, what
are the benchmarks that you

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.450
have to know whether
or not you're in shape

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.110
to do a 2:08 or 2:10?

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.310
Or do you have certain things
that you go back to again

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.746
and again to kind of
evaluate where you're at?

00:27:51.746 --> 00:27:52.620
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.140
I mean, some people ask me,
when you first meet somebody

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.140
and you tell them
you're a runner,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.300
it's like, how often do you run?

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.110
I'm like, do you run every day?

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.809
I'm like, well, I
train 12 times a week.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:06.600
They're like, what?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.980
You run twice a day?

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.970
And I'm like, yeah.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:09.850
That's what I do.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.060
And those trainings,
there's a long run,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.820
which for me, I cover as long
as 28 miles in preparation.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.089
I'm done 16 miles, 15
mile tempo run, which

00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:21.255
is about a five minute pace.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.775
It's like that picture
there, I was going that fast.

00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:28.150
JASON SANDERS:
That's that 7,000?

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.566
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
That's that 7,000.

00:28:29.566 --> 00:28:33.420
I'm going about a five minute
pace, 12 miles an hour.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.890
And they captured that
moment right there, so kind

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.520
of hard work that's paid off.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.100
And also intervals, so you
do faster than race pace,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.600
so when I'm doing intervals,
I'm going 13 and 1/2, 13 miles

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.160
an hour, faster than race pace.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.200
So you put all that together,
it gives you confidence

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.760
that, you know, faster than
race pace, race pace, and longer

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.980
than race pace.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.820
But the hardest part
is staying healthy,

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.040
because I have the
desire, the motivation

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.660
to push my body to the limit.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.210
And it got me in a lot of
trouble in the past also.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.130
So now I expanded that training
cycle, seven days a week

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.970
to nine days cycle, so you
have two days between recovery.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.040
So I run hard, two days
off, long run, two days off,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.066
and tempo run, and
then two days off.

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:19.190
And it seems to be working.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.770
But you just have to-- the
bread and butter for me

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.820
is tempos and long run.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.152
But at the same
time, it just depends

00:29:28.152 --> 00:29:29.360
what time you have available.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.004
Routine is important.

00:29:31.004 --> 00:29:32.420
Are you going to
do it after work,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.700
or are you going to before work.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.574
And then stick to it.

00:29:34.574 --> 00:29:37.970
If you can do that consistently,
you will perform really well.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.810
JASON SANDERS: So you talk about
how the really important thing

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:41.910
is to stay healthy.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.880
You don't want to be the
fittest spectator at your race.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.599
So maybe you could walk us
through what a typical warm up

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:51.390
before one of these
hard workouts or a race

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.170
would be for you.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.134
When you started, what
kind of stuff do you do?

00:29:54.134 --> 00:29:56.050
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: So what
most people don't know

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:00.730
is that even, if
I'm running 5K, 10K,

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.980
a half marathon,
or a full marathon,

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.542
I always warm up three months.

00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:07.750
So people say, you warm up
before you run a marathon?

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.124
But if you're going to start
a five minute pace, 12 miles

00:30:10.124 --> 00:30:11.840
an hour, you have to do those.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.360
So I do an hour before is
when I start my warm up.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.860
And then it's like,
if it's really cold,

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.190
I break it up to two
segments, a mile and a half,

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:23.235
stretch, do the drills,
and then to keep warm,

00:30:23.235 --> 00:30:24.360
go another mile and a half.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.174
Otherwise there's Athens,
was hot and humid,

00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:29.590
then seven minutes
is good enough,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.456
just to let the body
know that you're

00:30:31.456 --> 00:30:32.830
ready to go at
some kind of pace.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.090
So I do eight strides
and then do the drills,

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.410
and then hopefully when the gun
fires off, I'm-- you know what,

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.540
as elite runners, we
never run our own race,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:49.150
because if seven guys go world
record pace or faster than

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.620
the course record, you
have to make that decision.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.020
If you want to challenge
for the win, you have to go.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.270
Not all of them will
survive that pace,

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.997
but three will survive,
four will come back.

00:30:58.997 --> 00:31:00.580
So do you want to
go for fourth place,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.871
or do you want to go for a win?

00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:05.490
Those are the decisions that
are made in mile one or mile 15

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.290
or mile 17 and all that.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:11.920
But Boston Marathon last year,
I controlled most of the race.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.040
And I ran my own race.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.360
And I made the move with--
I was scared in Athens

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.580
to make a move, in
Athens Olympics 2004,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.760
5K to go, I'm like,
that's a long way.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.780
It's a long way, it's
only your fourth marathon.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.710
But on your 20th marathon,
I ran out-- really,

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.920
it was seven, eight
miles into the race.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.890
So 20 miles to go,
19 miles to go,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.320
I made that move, make it count.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.030
And it made that gap.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.655
And then once I made that gap,
the mantra was Boston strong,

00:31:39.655 --> 00:31:41.240
I'm going to give
them Meb strong.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.340
If I get caught, I'm OK with it.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.634
But I'm going to
run for the victims.

00:31:45.634 --> 00:31:46.800
I'm going to run for Boston.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.841
I'm going to run for United
States and the world.

00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:51.255
And if they're
going to catch me,

00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:52.630
they're going to
have to earn it.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.960
So you have to have those
constant talks and whatnot,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.590
and I was able to hold them off.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.604
But experience pays big
dividends in training and also

00:31:59.604 --> 00:32:00.270
in competitions.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.145
JASON SANDERS: Right.

00:32:01.145 --> 00:32:03.062
That was an amazing
win to watch.

00:32:03.062 --> 00:32:08.100
So a lot of us, yourself
included, need to travel a lot.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.430
How do you stay
on top of workouts

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.432
and all this stretching
and core stuff?

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.890
How do you stay on
top of that when

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.770
you're in unfamiliar
cities and hotels,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.024
and maybe they don't have
the right facilities?

00:32:22.024 --> 00:32:23.815
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Well,
in terms of training,

00:32:23.815 --> 00:32:25.970
you've got to have a watch.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.760
That tells you--
I wear my Epson,

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.310
and that kind of comes into
distance, because sometimes I

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.670
used to do a lot of guesswork.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.230
Oh, I'm going to go for
an hour and five minutes.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.390
Is that 10 miles
or nine and a half?

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.910
But now you can get
pretty accurate.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.240
But the hardest thing is
nutrition when you travel,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.300
because I have my routine.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.551
I like to have my toast, tea,
and almond butter or peanut

00:32:47.551 --> 00:32:48.550
butter, before I go run.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.380
But sometimes I'll just
have Generation UCAN, which

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.960
is one of my sponsors, or
have a Power Bar, half a Power

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.280
Bar in the hotel, have
a little tea, and go out

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.150
and come back, and get it done.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.460
But the other important
thing is routine.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.920
No, you have to sleep less.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.220
I mean, do you want
to get up an hourly,

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.660
use that almost as your
caffeine, as your energy?

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.676
Or do you, especially when
you guys travel with work,

00:33:13.676 --> 00:33:16.050
if you guys go with a group,
some people are sleeping in,

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.910
and all that stuff.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.180
But you've got to get up.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.660
For me, I like to get up in
the morning, get it done,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.000
and get it over with.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.320
You don't have to think
about it throughout the day,

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.950
because what to eat, what to
drink, and all that stuff,

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.565
you're constantly thinking
if you haven't done it

00:33:27.565 --> 00:33:28.190
in the morning.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.837
So get it done in the morning.

00:33:29.837 --> 00:33:30.670
JASON SANDERS: Yeah.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:35.230
So all this focus on
the things surrounding

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.490
the runs themselves,
you talk in the book

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.240
about how it's not when you're
running that you're actually

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.090
getting into better shape.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.030
Could you talk about how
maybe as an elite runner,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.630
your approach to
recovery differs

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.580
from what the recreational
crowd might be doing?

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.480
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Famous
in basketball courts,

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.360
John Wooden said, it's not what
you do in practice, the two

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.930
hours, but how you take
care of yourself the next 22

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:05.380
hours-- sleeping,
nutrition, therapy, and also

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.082
icing or a massage, and
all those things add up,

00:34:09.082 --> 00:34:10.040
doing the small things.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.790
Yeah, you can have
a great workout

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.389
and say, oh, that
was a great 20 mile

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.463
run or five mile
run or 12 mile run,

00:34:16.463 --> 00:34:18.129
but you've got to
take care of yourself.

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:20.090
And nutritionally
it's important.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.460
It's always good to
graze throughout the day

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.280
than having big meals and
not feel good and then

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.219
have snacks around so
you don't feel hungry.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:34.280
And I usually use a lot of--
I have five fruits a day,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.493
as much as I can, and
graze throughout the day

00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:38.659
instead of having big meals.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:44.260
But also sleep is important,
and hydration is important.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.600
And what you eat
is also important.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.159
When I'm very disciplined,
when everything's going well,

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:52.520
I am really motivated.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.100
But as soon as I get injured
or something is going wrong,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.390
I just throw in the towel
in terms of nutrition.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.585
That's what I need to be
careful about sometimes.

00:35:00.585 --> 00:35:01.724
He let it loose, I guess.

00:35:01.724 --> 00:35:03.640
JASON SANDERS: Because
you have a sweet tooth.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.306
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I do
have a sweet tooth.

00:35:05.306 --> 00:35:08.260
And I had my banana
nut when I was waiting.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.980
I got here a little
early, so I have to spoil.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.770
And cheesecakes-- strawberry
cheesecake is my one weakness.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.970
So I had that a couple days ago.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.930
So after marathons,
I spoil myself.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.221
So even my girls, especially the
seven-year-old, they're like,

00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:26.346
Dad, you can't have sweets.

00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:28.960
You're training.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.227
So in fact, she asked me, oh,
I want to have a date with you,

00:35:32.227 --> 00:35:34.560
an ice cream date because you
did really good in school.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.960
And I'm like, when am I going
to have that date with her?

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.357
Because I'm in training right
now, and I can't have that

00:35:40.357 --> 00:35:40.940
date with her.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.260
But I had a really nice date a
couple of days ago, breakfast,

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.170
and she had the former
world record come by,

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.610
and we had our eggs and stuff.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.560
And they're like, well, if you
want that ice cream now, you

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.450
can have it.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.790
But you have to be
very, very disciplined.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:03.800
Because for me, I'll be 40
on May 5, and I have to--

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.010
I weigh myself every day.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:05.940
Is that cynical?

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.300
Probably, but I have to see
exactly where I need to be,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.120
because every pound, two
pounds, make a big difference.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.020
JASON SANDERS: Right.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.130
And so you've been
running competitively

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.770
for 25 years,
something like that.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.590
It sounds like
you've learned a lot

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.700
over the course of that career.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.740
What's the one thing you wish
you could go back and tell

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.770
yourself 25 years ago?

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.950
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I think as
an elite athlete, four years

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.930
in high school, four
years in college,

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.535
and 17 years as a
professional-- yeah,

00:36:36.535 --> 00:36:40.720
it's 25 years that I've been
running-- as a professional,

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.560
it's very difficult
to take a day off.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:48.210
You need to work hard, but
also, if you feel something,

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:49.252
you take another day off.

00:36:49.252 --> 00:36:51.918
And if I had done those, I could
have saved a couple of injuries

00:36:51.918 --> 00:36:52.430
myself.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.410
But we are so driven,
type-A personality, go, go,

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:55.910
go, go, go.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.050
And it's going to get warmed
up after a couple of miles.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.530
And then you're digging
yourself a hole.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.800
So injury prevention,
I think, is--

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.170
you know what, if
you take a day off,

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.320
nothing will happen to you.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.330
You're probably going to
do yourself a big favor

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.479
than do harm if you try to run.

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.020
So that's what I
will tell to myself.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.870
JASON SANDERS:
That's good advice.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.027
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I still
need to apply it at times.

00:37:16.027 --> 00:37:18.110
JASON SANDERS: I'm nursing
a hamstring strain now,

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.715
so this is coming at
the perfect time for me.

00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:22.090
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
You'd rather just

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.360
be one day late to
come than one day early

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.210
and lead to more problems.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.920
JASON SANDERS:
That's great advice.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.480
So I mentioned in
the introduction

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.572
about your foundation,
the Meb Foundation.

00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:34.280
Could you tell us a
little bit about that

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.107
and maybe tell us
how we could help?

00:37:38.107 --> 00:37:39.940
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: When I
was in seventh grade,

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.420
that's how my god-given
talents was discovered.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.277
The PE teacher said,
if you run hard,

00:37:45.277 --> 00:37:47.360
you're going to get an A
or B. If you mess around,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.276
goof around, you're
getting a D or an F. Well,

00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:53.240
I ran hard in PE
class and ran 5:20.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.797
That's where my
god-given talents--

00:37:54.797 --> 00:37:56.130
JASON SANDERS: In seventh grade?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.010
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
In seventh grade.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.495
And to get the A
and a T-shirt, you

00:37:58.495 --> 00:38:00.490
had to run six minutes
and 15 seconds.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:04.257
So I ran almost
50 seconds faster.

00:38:04.257 --> 00:38:06.090
And he said, you're
going to be an Olympian.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.489
But when you don't
speak English,

00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:09.030
you don't know what
the Olympics are.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.030
You never watched TV before.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.555
So it was an awkward moment.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.360
But he was right.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.200
I'm still in touch
with Coach Dick Lord.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.916
And I see him occasionally.

00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:23.250
He's like, I knew you
were going to do it.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.750
And he called the
high school coach.

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:28.030
And he said-- my two oldest
brothers were running.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.855
This little one is
really, really good.

00:38:30.855 --> 00:38:32.230
He's going to be
in the Olympics.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:36.490
And so due to that, because of
budget cuts with education now,

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.840
people are eliminating the
physical education class.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.690
But I think physical education
class is good for the brain,

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.930
is good for academics,
for well-balanced.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.810
So through the Meb Foundation,
maintaining excellent balance

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.340
through health,
education, and fitness,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.900
we need to give back to kids
to have active lifestyle,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.540
because I think if
you do that, it's

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.580
going to help them set goals,
hard work, perseverance,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.410
and also time management.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.520
And that can translate
to academics,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.660
to work ethic, the workforce,
and also positive contributions

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.270
to society.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.490
So I just hope to do those works
to be able to-- we've done,

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:15.160
like, we had 11 or 12 people run
the Boston Marathon on behalf

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.280
of the Meb Foundation to raise
money and give it to kids.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.202
Some schools, they just
need advice and nutrition

00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:24.280
and work ethic and tell
them to give a talk.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.654
But there are
others that we have

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:31.400
given about 7,000
or a pair of shoes,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.130
for others to put a sneaker
on and go for a run who

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.390
never had that opportunity.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.210
I myself didn't have that.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:39.770
My parents couldn't afford
to buy a pair of shoes.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.490
So the coach at Ramos,
he used to provide that.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.640
So we want to help others to
be able to exercise and live

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.575
an active lifestyle.

00:39:47.575 --> 00:39:49.950
JASON SANDERS: And maybe you'll
train the next generation

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.115
of Olympic superstars.

00:39:51.115 --> 00:39:52.490
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
It'll be an honor

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.740
to be able to help others
accomplish a dream.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.780
For me, like you said earlier,
Jason, I've been fortunate.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.800
Boston was the cap of my career.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.730
But I still am a competitive
kind of guy, so I'm like,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.070
2016 is around the corner.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.720
I might as well just
participate and see

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.690
if I can earn the top
three to go to Rio.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.952
But after that, it's for me to
help others, help them realize

00:40:14.952 --> 00:40:17.410
their potential, whether it's
through motivational speaking

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.970
or through coaching
and whether they

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.210
want to break five hours for
the marathon or three hours

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:25.450
for the half.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.931
It's just a way
of life, I think.

00:40:26.931 --> 00:40:28.680
Sports has done an
amazing journey for me,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.675
and I'm in a position to give
back, and I want to do that.

00:40:31.675 --> 00:40:32.550
JASON SANDERS: Great.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.300
Let's hope people are encouraged
to obviously go look up the Meb

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.550
Foundation and make donations.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.890
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.160
You can go to
marathonmeb.com, and there's

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.170
a link for that for
the Meb Foundation.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.836
JASON SANDERS: And
if you can't find it,

00:40:42.836 --> 00:40:45.285
just use a search
engine to find it.

00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:46.410
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Guess what.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.615
I think you can Google it.

00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:50.490
JASON SANDERS: Great.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.700
I think we have some time.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.890
If people have questions
they'd like to ask Meb,

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.080
please go to one of the two
microphones so that everyone

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.177
can hear you.

00:41:00.177 --> 00:41:01.010
People seem excited.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.210
And you should feel
free to call on people.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.494
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: We'll
rotate, I guess.

00:41:09.494 --> 00:41:10.298
Go ahead.

00:41:10.298 --> 00:41:12.510
AUDIENCE: Meb, thanks
so much for being here.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.870
And thanks also for being
someone that all of us

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.680
average runners can relate to.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.000
Jason brought up the
London situation.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.070
I know I always
think about how you

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.440
put the names of the
victims on your bib.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.350
That meant so much
to so many people

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.950
and to the people
of Boston that day.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.250
And I just wanted to
personally thank you for that,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.720
fighting through injuries, all
those things we all go through.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.030
I guess this is a
question for us mortals.

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.950
And that is, how
would you recommend

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:46.660
that us average runners approach
the first half of a marathon?

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.690
I, like you, just ran on
Monday for the seventh time,

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:54.540
and I struggle every time at
Boston and other marathons

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.120
with falling apart in the
second half of the race.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.820
Do you recommend
negative splits,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.410
taking it slow the first 5K?

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.400
What do you recommend
for that approach?

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:04.760
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
What's your name?

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.860
AUDIENCE: Michael.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.005
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Michael, thanks
for the nice compliments.

00:42:09.005 --> 00:42:10.280
I appreciate it.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.470
And I try to be a good
ambassador for the sport.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.150
But in terms of
breaking the marathon,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.860
breaking the segments--
so basically, life

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.740
is about patience,
marathon is about patience.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.760
Running a marathon
that day is to test you

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.480
if you have the patience,
meaning that any world

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.700
record from 5K up
to the marathon

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.280
is all about even splits
or slower the first half.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.410
So for me, even Boston, if
I was running by myself,

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.700
even expenditure of energy.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.983
And I ran-- I know it's going
to sound fast, but 1:04:19,

00:42:45.983 --> 00:42:49.350
1:04:18, with the challenge, of
course, of the Boston Marathon.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:54.560
So just what I do is
focus on the 13 miles.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.680
You'd rather be within
yourself well beyond,

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.730
controlling yourself, oh,
this is still easy for me.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.420
And then you'd rather just
pick it up and finish stronger

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.592
than say, you know what--
because it's hard to do,

00:43:06.592 --> 00:43:08.050
because you are so
excited, there's

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:09.375
so many people around you.

00:43:09.375 --> 00:43:11.750
You want to go, hey, I'm not
going to let that person go.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.580
I'm not going to let that
person get ahead of me.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.220
So the competitive you, you need
to shut down almost your mind

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.900
until the 13 miles, 15
miles, and after that say,

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.832
you know what,
it's game time now.

00:43:22.832 --> 00:43:24.290
I'm going to be
able to run faster,

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.185
and we'll try to negative split.

00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:26.880
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.100
Thanks so much for the advice

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.889
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No
problem, Michael.

00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:31.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.090
I have a similar
question on that.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:39.670
So you did touch upon the topic
that the advice kind of depends

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:40.910
on where you are.

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.300
And sometimes giving
advice can bite you back,

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.010
hey, I didn't know
enough about the person.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:52.360
So similarly, like you spaced
out the zoning and the race,

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.382
how do you say, hey,
you are at level this

00:43:55.382 --> 00:43:57.340
and you are at level
this, and you are at level

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.450
this, now you
should do this next?

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:03.112
Because depending on your level,
what you have already done,

00:44:03.112 --> 00:44:04.570
that's how your
recovery should be.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:07.780
And that's how much icing--
like, 15 minutes every day,

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:12.890
probably not so much if someone
is running once in a year.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.570
So how do you give
the advice depending

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.805
on where the person is?

00:44:17.805 --> 00:44:19.680
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: That's
an excellent question.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.950
What's your name again?

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.443
AUDIENCE: [? Aditieu ?].

00:44:21.443 --> 00:44:21.796
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: What is it?

00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:22.796
AUDIENCE: [? Aditieu ?].

00:44:22.796 --> 00:44:25.250
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: [? Aditieu ?].

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.015
You know, the 15 minutes
and the ice bath,

00:44:27.015 --> 00:44:28.740
that's like on hard days.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.840
I would concentrated--
you guys are busy,

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.060
and I have to meet criteria.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.460
I have almost 24
hours of my profession

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.280
to do the small
details, take my time.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.890
But for you, it's maybe
stretching on the easy days.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.050
And maybe when you do
a long run, maybe once

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.790
a week or every two weeks,
you need to do the ice bath.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:48.680
Or if you do your
tempo run or race pace,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.580
you need to do the ice
bath-- not every day.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:55.310
And in terms of
setting goals, you

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.070
have to be yourself
and say, you know what?

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.390
I just want to run 25
miles for the week.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:03.645
I want to do that
four weeks in a row.

00:45:03.645 --> 00:45:05.520
And then once you get--
you can see yourself.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.270
If you do four weeks,
you're going to do stronger.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:09.400
It's time for me to
increase it by two miles,

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.940
and I want to do that
for two or three weeks.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.070
And then, say, seven
weeks or nine weeks,

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.192
I want to run 13
miles my long run.

00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:18.650
You started with
three, four miles.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.575
But in eight weeks,
it's attainable.

00:45:20.575 --> 00:45:22.030
It's not undoable,
but you've got

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:26.470
to be very careful to make the
increments move a little bit

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.470
versus, I'm going to do
it and Meb said this.

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.330
You have to know
yourself and consult

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.275
with your coach and other people
that you're around with to say,

00:45:35.275 --> 00:45:36.140
you know what?

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.264
I want to achieve this.

00:45:37.264 --> 00:45:38.180
And how can I do that?

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.300
And then if you
put it in writing,

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.300
you're going to achieve
it, just because it's

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.160
positive reinforcement.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.620
I love doing my train log.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.080
I have a train log since '93.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.109
I'm like, this week I just
want to put 50 miles a week.

00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:52.525
Like, right now I'm not running
after the Boston Marathon.

00:45:52.525 --> 00:45:53.710
I'm debating when to run.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:57.640
I'd rather be one day too
late than one day too early.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.360
And then after that, it'll
be two, three days a week

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.660
I'll run every other day.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.790
And then after that,
I say, my body's OK.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.400
I'm going to try
to run every day.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.720
And then slowly,
maybe 35 miles a week.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.430
And then once you do that, you
become strong enough to say,

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.855
OK, I'm ready to step
it up another notch.

00:46:12.855 --> 00:46:13.565
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:13.565 --> 00:46:14.690
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No problem.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.029
Good luck.

00:46:17.029 --> 00:46:17.820
AUDIENCE: Hey, Meb.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.520
Thanks for coming in today.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.600
I have a time
management question.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.850
So obviously, to train takes
a lot of time every day.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:29.060
And I know you have a
family, three daughters.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.190
I struggle with
having a child myself.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.500
Like, either I would
spend time with my child

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.710
after work, which is an
investment in her future,

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.550
or I would-- kind of, yeah.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:47.830
Or I would run or train or go
to the gym and invest in myself.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.260
So I kind of feel,
it's a little bit--

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:55.890
I know it's wrong at some point,
but how do you manage that?

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.980
Like, does your family
support you in your effort?

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.170
And what do you tell them
when you spend so much time

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:07.770
training, which is a very
good thing, but I mean,

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.350
I would appreciate
an advice on how

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.684
do you make them understand
that this is very important?

00:47:13.684 --> 00:47:16.100
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Well, I've
been very fortunate to surround

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.420
myself with good team.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.026
So my brother is here, my wife.

00:47:20.026 --> 00:47:21.400
She gave up her
career so I could

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.030
have the career that I
have, because as an athlete,

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.410
it's limited time.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.470
So to be a parent, she's
spending a lot of time

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.970
with her.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.049
But sometimes I'll
give her a break

00:47:31.049 --> 00:47:33.340
when I'm on break after a
marathon or things like that.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.020
I let her do her thing,
and I'll go to the park.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.950
You don't have to
do that every day.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.700
But if you say, you know what,
I'll meet you at the park.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.630
After a run, bring
the kids down.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.250
And then while you do your
stretching, put them on a swing

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:48.900
and spend time with them, that's
going to be more valuable.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.510
And it depends how
old the kid is.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.860
And sometimes I'll tell my wife,
here, don't worry about it.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.420
I'll get up early
in the morning when

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.379
I can, take them to school,
bring them from school.

00:47:59.379 --> 00:48:01.295
I might do that for a
week, a week and a half,

00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:04.230
when I'm in San Diego, whereas
right now I can't do that.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.370
So Daddy, you're
traveling again?

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:08.900
I hear that a little
bit sometimes.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.460
And I say, yes, but I'll
be back in nine days.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.207
And I would love to do-- you
know, share your story, what

00:48:15.207 --> 00:48:16.040
you have been doing.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.572
I will catch up with you.

00:48:17.572 --> 00:48:19.150
So you have to have a balance.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.250
I personally try
to live by my name,

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:23.150
maintain excellent balance.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.920
You know, you'd love to be there
for your family, your wife,

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.920
your kids, all the time.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.912
But at the same time,
job gets in the way,

00:48:28.912 --> 00:48:31.120
training gets in the way,
and travel gets in the way.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.520
So I try to make the
most of it when you can,

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:38.382
because those are profound
times of kids' life.

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:39.840
AUDIENCE: So I
guess the good point

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.476
is that you set an example
for your kids to follow.

00:48:42.476 --> 00:48:43.350
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Yeah.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.980
You know, when I take
exercise, sometimes I

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:48.890
tell my kids they have a
little disadvantage because I

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.500
tell my wife, bring
them here, if I'm

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.666
doing [INAUDIBLE] course,
two and a half mile loops,

00:48:52.666 --> 00:48:56.012
every time I do that,
they want to run with me.

00:48:56.012 --> 00:48:58.470
But they know that I'm going
six minute pace on my recovery

00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:59.330
runs.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.730
So they hang out
with me for 50 meters

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:04.400
and I'll say, go, go, go,
keep going so I could catch up

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.120
to them, you know?

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.900
But then at the
end, I'll spend time

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.115
with them doing strides or
doing a run with them whatever

00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:11.740
pace they want.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.540
And sometimes out of the
blue, they will ask you, Dad,

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.210
can you run around
the block with us?

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:20.780
And if I'm home, as long as
they ask, I'll do that for them.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.469
Just, when they
demand it, you've

00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:23.510
got to be there for them.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.230
But other times, I just explain,
sorry, but I have to travel.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.000
I have to do this.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.305
And they usually understand.

00:49:28.305 --> 00:49:29.596
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

00:49:29.596 --> 00:49:30.720
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No problem.

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.130
My name is Jesus.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:38.380
I did the New York Marathon
last year and the year before.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.620
I did not do it officially, like
I started before it officially

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.410
started.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:45.020
But I managed to do it in, the
first time, two hours and 15

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.550
minutes, and the second time
in one hour, 57 minutes.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.090
I did it on a bike.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:54.840
And at that point I realized
that you guys are superhumans.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.660
It was hard.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.720
We had, like, a really hard
pace to keep on the bike.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.114
And it was almost impossible.

00:50:03.114 --> 00:50:05.280
I mean, we had some traffic,
but it was really hard.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.010
So I realize that doing it
in under two hours running,

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:13.430
it's an accomplishment
that is out of this world.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:15.750
But have you ever had
that goal in your head?

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.322
And do you think it's going
to happen sometime soon?

00:50:19.322 --> 00:50:21.280
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: At least
you have a perspective

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.685
of what pace you're going?

00:50:23.685 --> 00:50:26.175
JASON SANDERS: Have you ever
considered just using a bike?

00:50:26.175 --> 00:50:28.140
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No, I have
people pace me for my training.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.223
I have people on the bike.

00:50:29.223 --> 00:50:33.880
So I can catch most people
going up hills on the bike.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.950
So I race against them,
especially on trails.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.215
And they zoom down with
me on the downhill.

00:50:39.215 --> 00:50:41.840
And I'm like, I know the course,
there's another uphill coming.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.790
So I close the gap and then
try to catch them again.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.190
And I have people on my long
run, tempo, and intervals.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:52.070
But is it possible to
break the two hours?

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:54.060
I think it is, as long
as-- unfortunately,

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.050
like I said earlier,
there are some people

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.950
that have not done it clean.

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.630
Sometimes you hear--
but the consistency

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:05.640
from-- before I started running
was 2:04:55, now it's 2:02:38,

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.630
I believe.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.870
It's going down, going
down pretty drastically.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:13.554
And obviously, it'll be
like Roger Bannister, where

00:51:13.554 --> 00:51:15.470
he broke the four minute,
and then many people

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.178
started doing it.

00:51:16.178 --> 00:51:17.200
Is it going to happen?

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.210
I think it can happen.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:23.490
But as female use
male pacers, we

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.800
need you as male
pacemakers on the bike

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.730
and give us drinks whenever.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.424
If people are concerned
about winning,

00:51:31.424 --> 00:51:33.840
I have to beat that guy and
that guy, you are by yourself,

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.970
you're going to slow.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.000
But if you are not
concerned the [INAUDIBLE] is

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.520
going to slow down, you can
get closer to two hours.

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.750
So I say, hey, Jesus is my guy.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.710
I say, pick it up.

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.920
Let's surge.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.070
And somebody else has
their own or whatever.

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:51.070
The reward for breaking
it versus for getting

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.070
second place, first
place, and all that stuff.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:54.720
So if that happens,
I think it can.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.640
Can it happen when?

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.750
Probably on our
lifetime, I think

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.400
it's going down pretty quickly.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.730
And we have a guy
where I was born,

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:06.360
in Eritrea, the guy that
ran 58:23, I believe,

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.400
for the half marathon.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.050
So if someone like him
that has the talent

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:14.050
runs two hours, that's
a minute and a half,

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:19.200
that's 10 seconds per mile
slowing down on a flat course.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.610
You need to go an hour
and then run 59, 58.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:27.840
It can't be, like, 59 and
then go the other way around.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.160
You have to negative split it.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.870
And I think it can happen.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.604
AUDIENCE: And have you had it
as a goal in your life to do it?

00:52:34.604 --> 00:52:37.020
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: You know, I
think it was "Runner's World,"

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.150
they had an article what
the criteria of that person

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.120
would be and what
height, what weight,

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.610
and it kind of sounded like me.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:49.540
It really did.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.962
But that was,
like, 13, 14, years

00:52:51.962 --> 00:52:54.140
ago, so you need to be 27.

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:59.749
And it described a lot
about what I have done,

00:52:59.749 --> 00:53:02.290
what the training, and what the
height and all that stuff is,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:03.760
and the weight and all that.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.230
But no, it's never been my goal.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.140
It's too late to think
about that goal now.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.740
I'm just trying to stay healthy
and get to that finish line.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:18.200
But yeah, if somebody who
is 5'6, 119, 121 pounds,

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.250
and would have a
VO2 max of high,

00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:22.980
we can see it
happen potentially.

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.132
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:25.132 --> 00:53:26.590
AUDIENCE: Hi Med,
my name is Katie.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.798
It's really nice to meet you.

00:53:27.798 --> 00:53:29.790
I've been a long time
fan, so it's really cool

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.230
that you're here at Google.

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:34.590
In full disclosure, I work
on the Lifestyle Fashion team

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.460
here, and Skechers
is one of my clients.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.340
So I can attest to the
fact that they really

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.760
do love you at Skechers,
and they're so proud of you.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.870
So my question is
kind of twofold.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:52.430
The first is, how important is
it to have the right equipment?

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:56.000
And what impact does having
the wrong equipment make?

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.770
And then also, when you
signed with Skechers,

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.160
what was the feedback you got
from the running community?

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.520
Because they're
not a Nike or maybe

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.120
one of the more serious
brands-- at least back then,

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.260
hopefully that will change.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.990
But I'm just curious about
how you choose a sponsor

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.498
and how important
the equipment is.

00:54:15.498 --> 00:54:16.414
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Great.

00:54:16.414 --> 00:54:17.250
Thanks, Katie.

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.820
Nice to meet you.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.540
Choosing a sponsorship is huge.

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.210
And for me, I have
to be very authentic.

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:29.140
In fact, with Skechers, we met
with them in January of 2011,

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:34.414
and I met with Robert Greenberg
and Michael Greenberg.

00:54:34.414 --> 00:54:36.330
And I say, you know, I
need more a partnership

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.310
than a sponsorship,
because I really

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:41.670
believe I have half
marathon and marathon PRs.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.480
I can't guarantee
you in the 5K, 10K.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.000
That might be behind me.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.240
But I need you to
help me design shoes.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.440
But there was
shoes call ProSpeed

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.920
that I use just recreational.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.470
And I'm like, I ran 20 miles.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.690
They go, you did?

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:00.550
And then we use that.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.670
And then basically, as you can
see in the picture, the Go Meb

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:09.270
Speed 3 there, we probably
made 40 pair of shoes

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:11.110
with that before
that final one there.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.010
We had the Go Meb
Speed 3, I helped

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.950
them design the firmness.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:18.930
Then we eventually even put
carbon fiber in it to make it

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.210
stiffer, lightweight,
and very narrow.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.385
Because I mean, the tongue,
where you kind of land and then

00:55:26.385 --> 00:55:28.130
kind of come up,
we have-- it was

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.080
so low that I had to
give input that says you

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.430
need that roll off, roll off.

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.220
And then we had to work
from the lacing, how

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.490
long the lace should be, and
kind of starting from scratch.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.390
And also, when
you tie the shoes,

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:44.500
there's no more ripple
almost, like crunched up.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.110
So we have to make
sure we smooth it out.

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.250
So it was a lot of work.

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.350
But they want my input.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:51.520
I give them my input.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.300
And to run a personal best
that first time when I

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.720
ran the New York City Marathon.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.220
And not many people remember,
but I'm pointing at the clock.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.695
I said, I ran faster
than I every did.

00:56:00.695 --> 00:56:03.320
And then eventually going to the
trials, going to the Olympics,

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.770
finishing fourth.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.180
So it says a lot about them.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.620
It also says a lot about me,
to teamwork or partnership,

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.720
to be able to just achieve.

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.960
And what the people say
when I first wore Skechers,

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.380
they were very skeptical.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.390
Some people are still skeptical.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.840
And they see them in my trunk
of my car, and they said,

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.249
do you really wear Skechers?

00:56:22.249 --> 00:56:24.040
I'm like, I just pop
the trunk, and there's

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.110
like a kazillion pairs there.

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.090
And then sometimes-- I
remember this vivid moment.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:34.835
It was Christmas,
probably, 2012 or 2011.

00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:36.960
I was running on Christmas
Day by my sister's house

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.370
in San Diego.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:42.090
And the person goes, I can't
believe I'm running with Med.

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.450
Is that really you?

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.755
She's watching my watch,
watching my socks,

00:56:46.755 --> 00:56:47.985
watching my shoes, Skechers.

00:56:47.985 --> 00:56:49.470
She's like, it is really you.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:50.910
So you do really wear Skechers.

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:54.650
But every sponsor that I
do, I'm very authentic.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:55.820
I try them out beforehand.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:57.870
And hopefully it's
a win-win situation.

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:00.070
And I hope to be a brand
ambassador for them

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.227
for a long time.

00:57:01.227 --> 00:57:02.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.650
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Thanks, Katie.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:04.400
AUDIENCE: Hi, Meb.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.380
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.340
And I wanted to ask you a little
bit about your perspective

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.830
at the front of
the field competing

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:12.440
against the other
elite athletes.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.210
And in particular, with the
resurgence of American distance

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:17.720
running in recent
years, especially

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.310
in the longer
events, sometimes we

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.300
see American athletes in
the middle of the race surge

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.600
to the front, hold the lead.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.260
And the announcers and
such are super-excited.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.400
We saw this this year
with Dathan and Desi

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.330
in Boston, and in other
races in the past.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.850
And I was curious
as to your thoughts

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:43.200
about in terms of strategy,
in terms of what kind

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.800
of goes on upfront in the pack.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.560
You mentioned earlier you
spoke Italian to the one guy.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.389
Like, how much chatter
happens up there?

00:57:50.389 --> 00:57:51.930
You guys are running
a marathon pace,

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.930
so it is not
conversational, but you guys

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.170
can talk, in spite of
going extraordinary speeds.

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.810
And so I was curious about
your perspective up there.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:06.270
How does strategy play into
that while you guys are sort

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:08.970
of working together, sort of
trying to account for the wind,

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:11.234
surges, et cetera?

00:58:11.234 --> 00:58:13.650
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Full disclosure,
I didn't see Desi's race,

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:16.870
but she ran a great
race, from fourth place.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:19.824
In terms of Dathan,
it's always encouraging

00:58:19.824 --> 00:58:21.323
to have your
countryman next to you.

00:58:21.323 --> 00:58:23.420
It just makes it a
little bit easier.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.347
So if you find somebody from
Google on a plane or something,

00:58:27.347 --> 00:58:28.930
you try to get to
talk to them, oh, we

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:30.304
work for the same
company, you're

00:58:30.304 --> 00:58:32.720
more relaxed-- versus who's
that person kind of thing.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.722
So similarly, when you're
running, competing,

00:58:35.722 --> 00:58:37.180
you're trying to
push the envelope,

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.750
and they're thinking
from behind.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:41.251
And I thought at one point, I
thought that he was struggling

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.916
or we made the gap, and I didn't
think he was going to catch up.

00:58:43.916 --> 00:58:46.170
And then he came, and he
went to the lead right away.

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.360
I'm like, that was
tactically not the best thing

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.315
just because it was windy.

00:58:50.315 --> 00:58:51.690
If it was not
windy, I would have

00:58:51.690 --> 00:58:54.490
been not forced but
encouraged to go with him

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:56.480
and work as a team in dialogue.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.017
And Ethiopian, in
fact, four of them,

00:58:59.017 --> 00:59:00.350
they were talking to each other.

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:02.433
And I'm like, nope, I'm
going to get close to you,

00:59:02.433 --> 00:59:04.800
because if you spread
apart a little bit,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.400
they're going to encourage each
other to go faster because you

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.722
show them sign of struggle.

00:59:08.722 --> 00:59:10.680
But if you're next to
them, then it's like, oh,

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.390
we haven't really maxed this
guy out of his potential yet.

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:18.002
So you have to-- unwritten
rules to be able to follow that.

00:59:18.002 --> 00:59:19.960
And then the Kenyans were
doing the same thing.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.580
And just, whenever
they were talking,

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.474
the other Kenyans or Ethiopians,
I just says, buckle your belt.

00:59:25.474 --> 00:59:27.640
There's going to be a big
move coming sometime soon.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.840
So be ready.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.570
And Dathan ran well.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:36.200
It's always good to see the
transition to a 5K, 10K,

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.130
through the marathon.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:41.500
And Ryan Hall, we've
done that some last year.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:46.870
And Abdi and Culpepper and Abdi
Abdirahman and Alan Culpepper,

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:49.254
we used to do that ourselves,
changing leads and this

00:59:49.254 --> 00:59:50.420
and this, our work together.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.460
And it's always-- you know,
there's no trash talking.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.882
But sometimes there's gestures,
because somebody kind of

00:59:55.882 --> 00:59:56.840
tapped you from behind.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.570
You're like, be careful.

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:04.135
And sometimes there's a lot of
juggling at the fluid stations

01:00:04.135 --> 01:00:05.010
and things like that.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.980
So it's good to see that
US distance runners be up

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:11.850
in the front, just because
hopefully I can be an example,

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:15.680
Deena Kastor can be an example
that we have one major-- like,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.805
she won London and Chicago.

01:00:16.805 --> 01:00:18.620
I won Boston and New York.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.670
And an Olympic
medal, both of us.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.930
I say, if we can do it, we
all started here in the US.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.550
I might be born elsewhere,
but all my training,

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:30.060
all my time came here, so we
can be an example with league

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.660
champion, NCAA and
USA champion, and then

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:34.740
major marathon champion.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.948
So they can be, hey, if they
can do it, we can do it.

01:00:36.948 --> 01:00:38.300
AUDIENCE: Thank a lot, Meb.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.969
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No problem.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:41.010
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:45.200
Thank you for being
here this afternoon.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.765
So I was out for a morning
run not too long ago,

01:00:49.765 --> 01:00:52.294
and another runner
synced up with me.

01:00:52.294 --> 01:00:54.460
And speaking of chatter,
we got into a conversation.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.290
And they asked me if I
was training for anything.

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.770
And I said no, I'm not.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:04.080
I've kind of decided not to
do anything terribly difficult

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.310
this year.

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.910
And it made me realize how
much joy there is in that.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.560
Like, I didn't have to
worry so much about, oh, I

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.000
have to always beat this pace.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.190
Or you talked about the
watch and this equipment.

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:24.240
I'm kind of curious how
much you, or people, should

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:30.310
let their equipment dictate
to them how much they should

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:33.530
be pushing themselves
or worrying about that

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.910
versus how often even
you might get out

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:39.570
to just run for the fun of it.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.860
We talked about kids.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.790
If you ever go to a
playground with your kids,

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:44.581
you just see all these
kids running around.

01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:47.660
They're just active
for the joy of it.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.035
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
What's your name?

01:01:49.035 --> 01:01:49.576
AUDIENCE: Ed.

01:01:49.576 --> 01:01:50.670
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: Ed.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.660
You know, in "Meb For Mortals,"
that's what I try to portray.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.160
All the drills that
I have in there,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.260
illustrations, like
being a kid again.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.524
Because sometimes we
get so serious to train,

01:02:00.524 --> 01:02:02.690
I've got to run these miles,
and I've got to do this

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.689
and I've got to do that.

01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:07.415
But at the same time, there's
days where in the evening runs,

01:02:07.415 --> 01:02:08.540
I'm not worried about pace.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:12.290
I'm just out for my evening
runs, just enjoy your sunset,

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.452
or enjoy just a run at
the beach and whatnot,

01:02:14.452 --> 01:02:15.910
because I'm not
worried about time.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.970
But there's three times
a week that's probably,

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.540
I'm like, I'm on the clock.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.040
Other than that,
it's just pure joy.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:21.840
I love doing it.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.020
And I want to be
able to-- and I have

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.140
my watch on heart
rate screen and try

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.160
to guess what pace I'm going.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.830
And vice versa, I will
have it on the pace

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:34.520
and then guess what
my heart rate is.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.796
So you have to use
technology to your advantage,

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.255
see if you have recovered from
the hard day the day before,

01:02:40.255 --> 01:02:41.421
so by looking at heart rate.

01:02:41.421 --> 01:02:44.090
But then there are other times,
it's just like, you know what?

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:48.790
I'm not going to see my watch
for the next three miles.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.110
I just want to see my
body, how it feels.

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.210
And you kind of go from there.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.430
But yeah, being a
kid, like you said,

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:57.810
those drills and things
like that-- we are so

01:02:57.810 --> 01:02:59.310
going to go forward.

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.126
We don't go lateral or backward.

01:03:01.126 --> 01:03:03.250
I mean, I don't know when
the last time some of you

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.256
guys went backward.

01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:06.870
It's been a long time, probably.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.550
So that's what the
drills emphasize.

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:11.720
We use the other muscles
than just the front

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.609
and try to have fun
at the same time.

01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:14.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:15.260
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No problem, Ed.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.676
JASON SANDERS: I think we have
time for one more question.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.170
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: I'll
make a short answer.

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:22.920
AUDIENCE: Hi, Meb.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.300
My name's Bridget.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.230
And my dad's a PE
teacher, so I loved

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.065
hearing your story about PE.

01:03:29.065 --> 01:03:30.440
It sounds like
something he would

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.539
say about how important
it is for your whole life

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:35.330
and how important it
is to stay in schools.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:37.985
But you also talked
about your coaches.

01:03:37.985 --> 01:03:39.985
You talked about your
parents and their reaction

01:03:39.985 --> 01:03:41.770
to your racing.

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:43.900
And I'm wondering now
that you're a parent

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.560
and you have daughters,
what do you want for them?

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.780
Do you want them to be distance
runners or Pele or none

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.400
of the above?

01:03:56.744 --> 01:03:58.410
MEB KEFLEZIGHI:
Yordanos, my wife, and I

01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:59.993
encourage them to
do different sports.

01:03:59.993 --> 01:04:02.300
They already have
participated in soccer.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.970
We want them to be outdoors.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:08.450
And we will support them
to whatever their goal is.

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:12.350
And if they do become
runners, they're

01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:15.520
going to get good advice.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.570
But the middle one, Fiyori,
you can see a little bit

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:22.510
enthusiasm, you can see
discipline and dedication.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.880
When I'm at the house,
she's always following me.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.650
She's my assistant, helping
me out, getting me that,

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:31.530
stretching with me, core with
me, and planks with me and all.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:33.520
So the other two,
you kind of have

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.460
to convince them to come in.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:41.530
But as long as, whether it's
soccer or tennis or softball,

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:45.510
whatever it is, hopefully they
can be outdoor and participate.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.860
But if I have to
choose, I'll probably

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.460
tell them to play tennis because
I love tennis and watching it

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:51.960
and whatnot.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.604
But running is lonely,
it's hard work--

01:04:56.604 --> 01:04:58.020
not that the other
sports are not,

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.860
but you have to have
the self-discipline

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.560
to be able to
achieve those things.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.910
But first and foremost,
academics comes first,

01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:07.810
because I did not give
running a priority

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:12.050
until I graduated from UCLA,
because I was one injury away,

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:13.520
or I don't want to get injured.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.830
And you never know if
you're going to make it.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:20.250
My mom always says, the person
thinks it, God finishes it.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.960
And I just tried to do the
right things every time.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:27.400
And I've been overjoyed
to what that the running,

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.950
from physical education, has
taken me around the world

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.860
and be able to
write books and be

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.000
able to enjoy the
lifestyle of being fit,

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.024
which is good for the head,
for the mind, and for the body.

01:05:40.024 --> 01:05:40.690
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.446
Thank you.

01:05:41.446 --> 01:05:42.180
MEB KEFLEZIGHI: No problem.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.429
JASON SANDERS: Thank you, Meb.

01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:45.580
I think that's all
we have time for.

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.350
Will you be around
after to sign?

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.400
[APPLAUSE]
