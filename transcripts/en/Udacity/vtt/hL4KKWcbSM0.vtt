00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to the second problem set.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's start this off with some questions just to

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
check your understanding of NP and NP-complete problems.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So first, are there some NP-complete problems

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that can't be transformed into SAT in polynomial time?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Second, nondeterministic RAMs may give different results

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for the same decision problem.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Third, a problem with exponential possible solutions can only be NP if P equals NP.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And finally, every program that takes

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
exponential time on a deterministic machine can be

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
made to run in polynomial time on a nondeterministic machine.

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check true or false for each problem.
