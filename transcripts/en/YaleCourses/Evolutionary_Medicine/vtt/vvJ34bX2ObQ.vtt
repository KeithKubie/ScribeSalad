00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.180
In this first of two concluding lectures.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.770
I would like to go back and revisit some of the important points for which we do

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:10.140
not yet have answers.
These are the open questions.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.310
Can we develop evolution proof antimicrobial therapies?

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Can we switch the host pathogen interaction from resistance to tolerance does

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.670
very owns evolve when leaky vaccines are used,

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.360
can we treat cancer by slowing somatic evolution?

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
What are the ultimate reasons for susceptibility to cancer?
Do early,

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.920
late light hit life history tradeoffs help us to find new treatments for aging

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.870
and what is the role of parent of origin in printing in metal disease?

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.770
First,
can we develop evolution proof therapies?

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.590
We know the resistance evolves rapidly.

13
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.170
Every time a new drug or insecticide is introduced,

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.100
we're losing the chemical arms race for evolutionary reasons.

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
Evolution proof options for bacterial infections includes phage therapy and

16
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:05.460
disrupting public goods for insect vectors.

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.310
Options include pesticides,
that accolade in life.

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
Another open issue is whether we can switch the patient's response from

19
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.100
resistance to tolerance.

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.780
We need to understand the conditions under which it pays to tolerate an

21
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.580
infection rather than resistant.

22
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.020
The trade offs in which tolerance tolerances evolved so that we can judge when

23
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.880
to promote it and the mechanisms that mediate the transition from resistance and

24
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.070
various lens to tolerance and commensalism.

25
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.980
It's quite a research agenda.

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.480
What does inflammation trade off with and can we modulate that tradeoff to

27
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.360
reduce endothelial damage and atherosclerosis?

28
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.340
That would be a very interesting approach to cardiovascular disease.

29
00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.220
<v 0>The next issue is whether virulence really does evolve when a leaky vaccine is</v>

31
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.054
used.

32
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.960
We know that in very increases when these leaky vaccines are used in mice and

33
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:09.990
chickens,
will that increased virulence evolve?

34
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.130
When we use leaky vaccines for HPV and for malaria in humans,

35
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.270
we need monitoring programs to measure the virulence of circulating strains so

36
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.390
that we can assess the magnitude of any effects and we need to develop

37
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:29.100
treatments for the more virulent strains that are are anticipated to evolve.

38
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.050
<v 0>Can we treat cancer by slowing somatic evolution?</v>

40
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.750
We know that adaptive therapy does extend the lifespan of mice suffering from

41
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.584
cancer.

42
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.790
One clinical trial of this idea is now underway in humans.

43
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.650
We urgently need to understand the potential benefits to patients who would

44
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:52.080
otherwise die from failed chemotherapy.

45
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.710
<v 0>What are the ultimate reasons that we are susceptible to cancer?</v>

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.610
We have preliminary comparative evidence suggesting that more invasive,

48
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.550
pleasant Taishan increases the risk of metastatic cancer.

49
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.470
We need to understand the mechanical bases of that effect and to explore them to

50
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.280
develop strategies for preventing and treating metastatic cancer.

51
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.253
In other words,

52
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.830
we may need to look for clues in a model system in which embryos or pre pre

53
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:32.041
embryos are implanting in the endometrium to understand the mechanical bases of

54
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.930
myth metastases

55
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.800
do early late life history tradeoff suggest treatments for aging.

56
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.201
For example,

57
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.490
the target of the rapid mice signaling network mediates performance early and

58
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:48.420
late in life.

59
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.030
The late life effects may include risks of all the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

60
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.650
Rapha mice and supplements do extend life in mice,

61
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.520
but they do not appear to do so in humans.
However,

62
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:05.610
the idea that prompted that research was more general.

63
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.140
What mechanisms mediate the tradeoffs between early and late life.

64
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.750
By investigating that more general question,

65
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.450
we may get at new treatments for aging,

66
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.910
other mechanisms must exist and finding them could suggest more successful

67
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:21.744
interventions.

68
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.910
Another open issue is what actually is the role of parent of origin imprinting

69
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.020
in mental disease.

70
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.300
We know that the deletions of parent of origin imprinted genes do produce

71
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:37.960
syndromes of heightened risk of autism or schizophrenia depending on which

72
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:42.700
parental copies deleted.
That's the Angelman Prader,
Willi contrast,

73
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.743
and others.

74
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.670
There is correlative support for this idea that comes from a large scale study

75
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.930
of disease risk.
In Denmark,
we need independent tests.

76
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.850
If the results are confirmed,

77
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.480
then we need to identify the mechanisms that mediate that risk.

78
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.370
So to summarize,

79
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.960
evolutionary medicine is a new field in which some issues are supported by

80
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.570
reliable results and others remain open.

81
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.270
Some of the open issues are really quite serious.

82
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.300
They deserve immediate attention and investment.
