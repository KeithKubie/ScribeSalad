00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.940
[sigh]  I don't know if it's the string of particularly bad Disney sequels

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.240
I've had to sit through the last few days, or the fact that this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.320
might actually be a good movie, but "101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure"

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.340
is *actually* kind of a good movie.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.240
I dare even say; on par with the original!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.640
Yeah!  I can't believe those words are leaving my mouth, either!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.260
Really?  *This* is the one?!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.120
It has the spirit of the original, artwork similar to the original,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.400
some great updates, some good callbacks...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.560
It's exciting, I didn't always know where it was going to go.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.640
It's funny, adventurous...Oh my God!

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.140
I think I came across an actual *good* Disney sequel!

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.760
It begins not too shortly after the first one, where we see the Dalmatian Plantation is about to be put into effect.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.680
So, the family is about to move.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.320
But one of the puppies, named Patch, is feeling a little out of place.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960
And it's understandably so.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.660
When you're the middle child of a hundred and one, you can get a little lost.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.140
Hungry for his chance to stand out, he sees that a TV dog, named Thunderbolt,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.040
Is holding auditions for a new dog to be on his show.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.220
What he doesn't know is that his current sidekick, named Lil' Lightning

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.480
has told him that they're about to kill off his character,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.940
so he needs to find a way to prove to the public that he's a real hero.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.700
Patch gets roped in as he knows everything about the show,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.880
but, they seem to cause more chaos and misery than they do save people from it.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.340
Meanwhile, Cruella...Oh God, how do I even explain this?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.060
Gets sucked into the art world because she sees a guy who paints a dot.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.740
She admits that it feeds her crazy obsession, and they just kind of paint dots together!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.940
But, he seems to be running out of inspiration, or at least she doesn't like the work he's putting out

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.400
So, she once again tries to kidnap the puppies.  Only this time she's not going to make a coat out of them,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.660
She wants to paint the canvas with them.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.940
Oh my God, that is delightfully psychotic!

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.900
In fact, I think she's even crazier in this movie than she was in the last one.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.540
The funny thing is, as I describe this plot, I realize it's kind of a formulaic plot.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.040
Well, for the most part.  The art stuff is pretty out there.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.260
But, there's a lot of callbacks to the original, there's another "Liar Revealed" story

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.420
another kid feeling out of place, we've seen all this stuff before.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.100
In fact, this is about as typical a Disney sequel script as you can get.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.520
But there's one thing this movie has that those other Disney sequels didn't have.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.940
Charm.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.260
It's a charming movie.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.520
The characters are so likeable.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.820
The comedy actually gets a few laugh out loud laughs.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.420
The pacing is never too rushed.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.260
The slow moments are perfectly slow, the fast moments are perfectly fast.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.760
The voice talent is especially good.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.680
That's Martin Short as the artist, he's really funny as hell.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.640
Cruella's voice is hilarious, the hero dog is delightfully full of himself.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.100
Jason Alexander as another villain, that's a lot of fun!

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.180
And they got a *real* kid to play the puppy,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.180
not some adult just [mimics] doing a high-pitched voice like this that's just uncomfortable and weird.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560
The artwork is also really great,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.460
these are some very distinct backgrounds that are very similar to the original.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.160
I like the original a little better, because they were hand-painted and these are clearly computer.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.320
But, by God, they still look great!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.420
It can be extreme and over-the-top, but it can also be kind of subtle and delicate, too.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.140
I guess the one thing that's missing from it is it doesn't feel quite as big as the original

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.660
I mean, the climax is another car chase.  And it's just Cruella trying to catch the puppies again,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.640
There's even another scene where all the dogs bark to communicate.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.720
But, in my opinion, the film makes up for it by having better comedy than the first.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.800
The first isn't especially funny.  It's just...cute.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.180
This one has a much better sense of humor.  And you can tell the writing is trying much harder than it really needs to try.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.460
And I love that!

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.300
I love taking this idea that really should only entertain your two-year-old

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.620
and actually throwing in some witty dialogue.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.100
So, is it a great film?

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.060
By no means, but you're talking to a guy who doesn't even think the first one was a great film.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.320
But the first one was good and cute and had some charm to it.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.220
This is exactly the same thing.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.300
I love the interaction off of these people, I love that cute little pup talking to the egotistical dog,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.660
I like that weird artist talking to the insane Cruella De Vill.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.780
I like the husband and wife doing the little counterpoint duet in the opening

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.060
It's just--it's likeable!

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.420
It's really likeable!

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.780
It reminds me a lot of the "Wallace and Gromit" shorts

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.440
or the "Shawn the Sheep" movie.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.340
It's not like you're slapping your knee at the comedy, but there's just something inventive about it.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.900
Something so delightfully innocent, yet still intelligent.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.640
Like I said, I can't act like this is any phenomenal feat of animation or cinema storytelling,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.060
but, it's just a nice, enjoyable little movie.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.680
A movie that I couldn't predict where it was going to go.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.940
A movie that had a line or two I might actually quote out of context.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.240
A movie I legitimately wanted to stay and watch until the very end.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.980
If somebody turned it off, I would go rent it and watch the rest of it.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.020
I know that's how movies are supposed to work, but for a lot of Disney sequels, that's not what happens.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.200
It's a perfectly entertaining little film.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.060
And after all the stinkers I've had to watch, entertaining little film to me equals

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.880
Amazing!
