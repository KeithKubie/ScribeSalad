FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join
me in welcoming Bill Belew.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.149
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.690
BILL BELEW: I didn't
do anything yet,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.210
so I wouldn't clap
until I was finished.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.540
So I am going to do something
that, as far as I know,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.460
has never been done before.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.930
And I'm going to
do it just for you.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.060
Now the reason I say that is,
about five, six weeks ago,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.010
I came to this room-- the
tour brought me up here--

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.509
I stood here, and I looked,
and I closed my eyes.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.380
And during the time I was
preparing for this talk--

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.600
many times-- I
closed my eyes, and I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.510
tried to imagine who
would be sitting here.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.463
And it was you.

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:46.460
I am not bringing
something else and hoping

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.030
that you will be interested.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540
I am bringing something
for you and hoping

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.420
that other people
may be interested.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.810
And if they are
not, that's OK, too.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.070
This talk is for you.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.830
Now, the reason I
say, as far as I know,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.519
nobody's ever done this before,
is I'm almost 60 years old.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.450
Three months from now,
I'll be 60 years old.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.600
And I'm a churchgoer.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.380
So in 60 years, I've been
to church almost every week,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.560
probably every week,
more than once a week.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.200
So 60 times 50, that's
about 3,000, maybe 4,000.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.500
Without exaggerating, I have
heard maybe 5,000 talks.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.870
I have probably
given 2,000 talks.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.980
I go to conferences
the same as you do,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.480
and I hear these
talks all of the time.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.490
And so I am pretty sure,
somewhere between 7,000

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.310
and 10,000 talks I
have heard or given,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.590
and nobody has ever done
what I'm going to do today.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.530
We hope it will work, right?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.270
So the idea for what
I'm going to do today

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.730
came from my children.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.030
My oldest son is a piano player.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.280
And I think he's very good.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.680
But then, all parents will
think their kids are good.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.367
Well, he writes
these piano pieces.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.075
And if you listen to
them very carefully,

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:03.460
you will hear that there are
two songs going on out of sync.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.275
They are not matching together.

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:09.120
So we hear two songs going--
one here, one there-- right?

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.074
So it's called counterpoint.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:12.490
So you would play
a song, and then

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.390
there's another song, that,
ha, I can hear that, too.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.815
Well, and then my other
son is a scientist.

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.260
And he's a biologist,
a bioscientist.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.820
So he knows how wonderfully
the body will work together.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.740
Now, my right hand doesn't know
what my left hand is doing.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.840
Sometimes, I can write
and listen and tap my foot

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080
while listening to
music at the same time.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
They're all not together, but
they all work together, right?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.610
And then, I have a six-year-old.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.772
And you say, what
is a 60-year-old man

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:46.855
doing with a six-year-old?

00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:49.397
Well, that's none
of your business.

00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:50.605
But I do have a six-year-old.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.045
How many of you have
seen the movie "Frozen?"

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:59.040
Where have you been? "Frozen,"
let it go, let it go, right?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.615
Well, Anna is singing
one song, and Elsa

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.610
is singing another song.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.210
And you can hear
them going, depending

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.080
on which side you
listen out of, right?

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.610
So there are two things always
going on at the same time.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.630
But they match more or less.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.885
So I'm going to try.

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:16.340
No, I'm not going to try.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.736
I'm going to give you two
talks at the same time.

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:22.720
Hm.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.890
One of them is going
to be on the slides.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.830
Just watch the slides.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.050
The other one is going
to be what I say.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.480
They're not going
to be the same.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.050
But they will be
somewhat the same.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.591
But they're not
going to be the same.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:41.790
So if your thing is watching and
not listening, then just watch.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.820
There will be 15 points, that
if you do only those 15 points,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.440
you will be able to communicate.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.686
You will be able
to talk to anybody

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:54.935
from any country in the world.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.690
Just do those 15.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.870
And they should be pretty
easy to understand just

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.380
by looking at them.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.810
And if you want to be
really, really good,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.350
do more than those 15.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.710
So just pick one.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.410
Just do that.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.870
If you just do
that, oh, you will

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.510
be able to talk
across any country.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.590
And if you do two of them,
you'll be really good.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.520
And if you do three of them,
you'll be really, really good.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.720
And what if you do 15?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.303
You'll be really, really,
really, really, really, really,

00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:19.827
really, really,
really, really good.

00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:20.660
I think that was 15.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.850
I'm not quite sure.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.860
So just watch the 15.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:24.830
Write those down.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.960
Go home, and master those.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.189
Make that what you want to do.

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.730
And no matter what
culture you go to,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.110
they will understand
what you are saying.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.930
Now, if watching's not your
thing but listening is,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.830
I'm going to tell
you three stories.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.230
I will tell you three stories.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.440
Do you know, the
number one reason

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.200
why people are bad speakers?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.350
There's one reason that's bigger
than all of the other reasons

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.300
put together.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.720
There's one reason why
people are very bad speakers.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.840
And I know this, because
I have interviewed--

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.235
I have talked to
people-- from China.

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:58.610
I've talked to
people from Korea.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.151
I've talked to people
from Indonesia.

00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.040
I've talked to people
from South America.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.752
I have talked to people
from, I don't know how many,

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:05.585
different countries.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:09.880
And I ask them this question,
and I get the same answer.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:16.420
So they come to me.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.670
I what to learn English, Bill.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.680
OK, that works for me.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.690
So if you could speak
English, and you understood

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.770
and, well, could speak it
perfectly, what would you say?

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:31.420
Yeah, you see, there's
the point there.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.330
I have asked 1,000 people.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.530
I have asked 2,000 people.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.080
If you could speak my language
perfectly, what would you say?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.510
And they say, nothing.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.250
Because they don't have
what it is they want to say.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.490
You see, if you don't
know what you want to say,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.570
you're not going to
be able to say it.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.010
If you have something
you want to say,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.680
you will find a way to say it.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.390
It always works that way.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.514
Now, I have come up with three
steps, three different steps--

00:05:59.514 --> 00:06:00.930
I will call them
levels, but we'll

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.830
call them steps--
three different steps.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.980
There are things that
people want to say.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.320
There are things that
people need to say.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.110
And then there are things
that people have to say.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.840
They are different.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.620
The things that
people want to say

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.440
will live on the tip, on
the end, of their tongue.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.330
The things that
people need to say

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.791
will dig inside their
belly [GROWLING].

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.290
And then the things
that people have

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.030
to say, they will
burn in their bones.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.686
It's different.

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:35.310
So I'm going to tell
you three stories.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.400
So we'll go through.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.710
Watch the slides, or
listen, or try to do both.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.200
You guys are smart.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.386
You should be able
to do that, right?

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:44.110
Is anybody here besides me?

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.400
Yeah, you can do that.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.540
So I was in Bangkok.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.680
And there was a room.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.750
There were probably
not more than 20 people

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.030
in the room at the same time.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.730
And in those 20 people,
12 or 14 of them all

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.614
came from a different country.

00:07:02.614 --> 00:07:03.780
And they were sitting there.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.870
They're talking in English,
back and forth, back and forth.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.470
They are talking to each other.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.450
And they were saying, we
have written something,

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.030
but nobody will read it.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.760
We have written this paper.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760
We have written this story.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.270
But we can't get anybody
to read the story for us.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.440
What are we going to do?

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.530
So their solution, their
answer to that problem,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.015
was let's just share with
each other and pass it around.

00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:33.140
And then, hopefully, people
will pay us to do that.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.600
Well, good luck with that.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.280
Let me know how that works.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.060
And so they complained.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.620
They argued so much.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.510
I have this material.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.440
I don't know what to do with it.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.520
I could not take it anymore.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.490
I said, don't you people
know about Google?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.240
So you don't know what you do.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.320
But I know how it plays
out on the other side.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.860
So I said, don't you
know about Google?

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.860
Google has made it
possible-- seriously,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.410
I'm running around the world
telling about you guys.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.195
Thank you very much for what
you do-- if you write something

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:12.430
good, you can put
that on the internet,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.000
on this magic
whatever, and people

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.650
will find it and read it.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.100
And they thought, wow, I cannot
give stuff away for free.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.990
Are you crazy?

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.710
Why would I give
it away for free?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.930
I cannot give something
good away for free.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.170
How will I make
money doing that?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.240
I know the answer to
that question, you see.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.309
And so I now travel the
world telling people

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.907
how to use what it
is you have made.

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:39.740
Thank you very much.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.360
You have given me a job.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.355
Well, a year after that,
I went to Kuala Lumpur.

00:08:46.355 --> 00:08:47.980
And there were the
same kind of people,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.330
or some of the same
people, but there

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.620
were other people in there.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.990
And they were mad.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.870
And they hate you.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.200
Google has stolen
all of my stuff.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.150
And now they have put it
where anybody can read it

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.527
and nobody will give it to me.

00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:08.860
Nobody will pay me for anything.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.520
You are a thief.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.540
Shame on you.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.536
Did you steal from these people?

00:09:15.536 --> 00:09:16.230
Say no.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.730
Of course, I'd say no.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.480
Maybe you did.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.620
Maybe I've caught them.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.180
So you see.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.120
And now they're mad.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.074
You have stolen
all of this stuff,

00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:26.740
and you are giving
it away to everybody.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.323
And we cannot make
any money for that.

00:09:28.323 --> 00:09:30.190
Well, see, this is
what I get to do.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.860
I said, no, that's
not how it works.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.240
Let me tell you how you
can write very good stuff,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.220
and you can put that
in a place where people

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.060
can use their computers
to find you and read you.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.926
And if you're good, you
will make money at that.

00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:50.430
Well, isn't that interesting?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.120
So and the process of
doing all of these things,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.130
I have learned a
simple step-by-step,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:07.920
that if I do these five things,
I can beat anybody at anything.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.090
I can beat anybody at anything.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.450
So how do you do that?

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.440
And I thank you for the lessons,
because you taught me this.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.710
It starts with telling stories.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.210
I tell stories.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.040
You have a problem.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.580
You don't know how
to fix that problem.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.670
I know how.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.840
And I fix the problem for you.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.750
And the more I tell
the story about how

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.750
I can fix your problem,
the bigger, the better,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.520
the stronger the hero I am.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.630
What's your problem?

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.830
Let me solve that problem.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.390
Let me fix that problem for you.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.390
And when I fix it, I
will be your champion.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.370
I will be your hero.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.790
Well, that's the basics.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.960
I tell stories.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.890
And if I tell that
story more than anybody

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:54.020
else who tells the same kind
of story, I can beat them.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.120
So if I tell a story,
and I tell it more,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.060
and then I have
to tell it better.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.870
You see, you guys are tricky.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.060
You see, you cannot
just throw up junk.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.690
You can not throw trash.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.170
You have to give something
good before people

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.110
will search and
find something good.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.890
So I have to tell it better.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.610
I tell stories.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.230
I tell more.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.290
I tell it better.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.250
And I tell it more often.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.500
And if I tell that story more
often, I will beat anybody.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.060
And then there's one more step.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.700
You see, people get tired.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.805
Do you ever get tired?

00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:27.030
Yeah.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.179
Are you tired?

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:28.970
Yeah, we get tired.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.470
Everybody gets tired.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.690
Well, when I'm in
my workspace, there

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.180
are other people trying
to do the same thing I do.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.170
And I know that they get
tired, because I get tired,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.810
and everybody gets tired.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.490
So when the person you are
trying to beat gets tired,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.950
don't get tired.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.310
And you will beat them.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.570
Tell good stories.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.910
Solve real problems,
for real people,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.520
in the real world, in the real
locations that get the real end

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.350
result.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.400
Tell it a lot.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.930
Tell it better.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.800
Tell it often.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.640
And tell it longer.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.090
And you can beat
anybody at anything.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.760
So thank you for the job.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.620
Thank you for giving
me something to do.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.970
Oops, lost my screen.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.850
Thank you for giving
me employment.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.810
So if you cannot tell people,
well, we can always show them,

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.310
right?

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.430
Now, if I just show
them, they will

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.730
be able to see what it
is we're going to do.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.300
And I keep telling that story.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.420
Now, the bottom
line here is, when

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.490
you are people's
hero, they like you,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.360
because I can fix what is wrong.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.320
So people are terribly-- what's
the word-- they don't quite

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.120
get it.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.890
They think if I sit
in a room and create,

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.630
if I make something really
well, all of the world

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.680
will come to see what I made.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.820
Well, let me know how
that works for you.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.020
You see, there comes that point
where I have made something,

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.200
and now I need people
to find that for me.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.950
And that's where you come in.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.770
Well, if you think that you
can do something in your room

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.320
and all the world will come
and find you, it won't work.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.210
We call that looking at things
with googly eyes, googly eyes.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.890
But what we want to
know-- what I teach people

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:25.080
is how to look at the world
through Google's eyes.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.340
Do you see the difference?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.620
There's googly eyes, and
then there's Google's eyes.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.030
So if I learn how to write
good stuff for real people that

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.110
gets real results,
I can be found.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.156
I know that, and I thank
you for letting me do that.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:46.810
Well, that's something
I want to tell people.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:52.040
I want to tell people
how to become a hero.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.590
Well, now there are some things
that I need to tell people,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.390
I need to tell people.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.710
I was in Japan.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.154
I lived in Japan
for almost 20 years.

00:14:01.154 --> 00:14:03.070
And while I was in Japan,
I went off to Russia

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.028
and taught for a while.

00:14:04.028 --> 00:14:05.210
I visited China for a while.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.455
I visited Korea for a while.

00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:08.120
I visited several
different countries

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.310
as a visiting teacher, OK?

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.350
Come teach us.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.980
And so I'm in Japan.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.120
And my boys, both of my
boys, are made in Japan.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.210
It says, made in Japan here.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.840
We just don't show
that to people.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.540
My daughter was made in China
but with American parts.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.110
What can I say?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.980
And so my boys were nine
years old and six years old,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.070
and they were going
to a Japanese school.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:38.200
One day, they came home
from school with tears.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.900
What's wrong?

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.110
What's wrong?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.180
Well, Poppa, when we
are at school today,

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.530
everybody was calling us half.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.570
You are half.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.300
Their Japanese friends were
telling them, you are only half

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.290
of what we were doing.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.845
Well, don't you know?

00:14:56.845 --> 00:15:00.970
I was prepared for that.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.530
They came home and
said, we are just half.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.836
Well-- so Benjamin
is my oldest son.

00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:08.210
Micah is my younger
son-- I said,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.030
let me ask you some questions.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.690
When you go to
Japanese school, do you

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.170
understand your
Japanese teacher?

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.710
Well--

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.221
Do you understand
the comic books?

00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:19.970
Do you understand the
books that you read?

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.000
Well, yes.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.420
How about when you watch
Japanese on the TV?

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.160
Can you follow?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.039
Yes, I can do that.

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:26.330
Now, do you like Japanese food?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.038
Well, sure we do.

00:15:27.038 --> 00:15:28.455
Sure we do.

00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:29.431
And what about Grandma?

00:15:29.431 --> 00:15:30.930
Can you talk to
Grandma in Japanese?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.415
Well, of course, I can.

00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:34.650
I said, what about
when you go to America?

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.650
When you go to America,
can you do those things?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.850
Do you eat American food?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.349
Yeah.

00:15:38.349 --> 00:15:39.750
Do you like American books?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.250
Yeah.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.856
And do you watch
American television?

00:15:41.856 --> 00:15:43.230
Yeah, I like all
of these things.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.380
And can you pay with
American friends?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.376
Yes, yes, I can do
all of those things.

00:15:47.376 --> 00:15:48.500
And how about your grandma?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.820
Can you talk to your grandma and
grandpa in America in English?

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.890
Well, of course, we can.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.380
Yes, we can.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.450
So now, let's go back to Japan.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.700
And we go back to Japan.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.090
How about your Japanese friends?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.690
Can they eat Japanese food?

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.050
Well, yeah.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.670
Can they watch Japanese
television-- yeah-- and so one

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.220
and so on.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.680
So what about when your
Japanese friends go to America?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.410
Can they watch
American television?

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.715
No.

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:16.160
Can they read English books?

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.485
No, they cannot do that.

00:16:17.485 --> 00:16:19.110
Can they talk to your
American friends?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.220
No, they can't do that either.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.020
And what about your grandma?

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.853
Will they play with
your grandma in English?

00:16:22.853 --> 00:16:24.690
No, no, they cannot do
any of those things.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:29.380
So, I said, Benjamin and
Micah, who is half of whom?

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:36.080
You see, all of their friends
who had been calling them half,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.610
they were the half.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.020
And then, I said, Benjamin
and Micah, I'll tell you what.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.670
You guys are not half anymore.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.370
From now on, you're doubles.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.000
You are doubles.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.380
Well, that was fun.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.920
There was a newsletter.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.209
Remember people who used to
write and put it on paper

00:16:53.209 --> 00:16:55.000
and put it in mailboxes
and send it around?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.833
Remember those days?

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:57.205
Maybe some of you don't.

00:16:57.205 --> 00:16:58.500
Yeah, there was that.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.620
Well, I was a writer for
one of these newsletters

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.050
that traveled throughout Japan.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.173
And so I wrote about
that experience.

00:17:06.173 --> 00:17:07.839
I wrote about that
day with my children.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.849
You are not half.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.300
You're doubles.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.865
And it went throughout
all of Japan.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:16.900
Now, it was not a big group,
but it was the right group.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.619
Because two weeks later
or three weeks later,

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:25.790
in a national newspaper, the
country newspaper, there was,

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.670
don't call these
children half anymore.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.190
Let's call them doubles.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.630
And suddenly,
everybody in Japan who

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.699
came from two
different countries

00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:36.740
were not half of anybody.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.880
They were double everybody else.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.877
And then about two
weeks after that,

00:17:40.877 --> 00:17:42.460
we're watching
television, and there's

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.840
some singer, [GROWLING],
you know, screaming

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.820
and whatever they do.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.660
And the interviewer comes
out--the man he comes out

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.880
with-- and he says, how do you
like being a half in Japan?

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.560
He said, don't call me half.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.490
Call me double.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.460
And now that word
moves throughout Japan.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.160
And now, it moves its
way into China, as well.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.110
And I know where that word
came from, because I made it.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.360
BILL BELEW: It was
never said before then.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.959
I had never heard
it said before then.

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:13.000
I never knew anybody who
talked like that before.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.630
I never got the
idea from anybody.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.810
I just sat there waiting for
my children to come home.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.480
I sat there and
waited for my children

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.510
to come home and ask me the
question, why do people call me

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.300
half?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.784
That's something I
needed to tell them.

00:18:30.784 --> 00:18:32.450
That is something I
needed to tell them.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.020
And it's not the same as I
want to tell them, is it?

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.710
It's not the same.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.620
So there is another step.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.127
And this one is things
that I have to say.

00:18:45.127 --> 00:18:49.690
Well, what could that be?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.460
I was in Russia.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.770
I was in Russia.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.100
I was teaching a class.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.490
This was during the Cold War.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.420
It was still 1989.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.100
And I'm teaching a class.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.390
There are probably this many
people in the classroom.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.400
They asked me to come teach
them how to teach English.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.440
They were Russians.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.560
They were very, very good.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.620
Some of them spoke
English better than I did.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.020
Well, and here I am
teaching this class.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.590
And a man in a black suit
comes in with a little girl

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.700
and yellow hair.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.550
It looked like
Boris and Natasha.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.580
I don't know if you knew it
from Maxwell Smart, right?

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.370
He was a KGB agent.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.750
He was a secret policeman.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.200
And I know that, because
everybody in the room

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.050
began to whisper,
[WHISPERING] KGB, KGB.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.770
And when everybody in the room
whispers [WHISPERING] KGB, KGB,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.610
I can hear them, right?

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.110
Try that.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.558
Everybody, try it.
[WHISPERING] KGB.

00:19:55.558 --> 00:19:57.010
Yeah, you see, we can hear that.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.180
And so after I
taught to that class,

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.080
the KGB man came up to
me with his little girl.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:10.988
He said, Bill, Bill, I want to
take you out to meet a witch.

00:20:10.988 --> 00:20:14.240
Well, I've never
met a KGB agent.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.760
And now I get to
meet a witch, also.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.270
And they put me in a car.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.120
And they drove me out
into the darkness.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.790
Have you ever seen the movie
"White Nights," "White Nights?"

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.230
Now, I see a head.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.190
If you have not seen
the movie, go home,

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.645
watch the movie, "White Nights."

00:20:32.645 --> 00:20:34.680
Baryshnikov, the
ballet dancer, right?

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.927
He escapes from Russia.

00:20:36.927 --> 00:20:38.760
He runs away from
Russia-- the word defect--

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.170
he runs away from Russia.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.780
And Gregory Hines goes
the other way, to Russia.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.410
Well, at the end of the
movie, Gregory Hines-- he's

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.235
a tap dancer-- he's
in a black sedan.

00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:52.890
He's In a black car, and
they're driving him out.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.906
And you think, he is dead.

00:20:56.906 --> 00:20:59.140
They are going to kill him.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.860
That's what happened to me.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.870
I'm in a black car,
it's very, very dark,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.750
and they're taking me out
and into the darkness.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.580
Oh, I'm going to die.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.910
I was sure I was going to die.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.420
And the only thing
I could think of,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.725
I hope I meet the
witch before I die.

00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:18.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.225 --> 00:21:21.760
BILL BELEW: Otherwise,
why am I doing this?

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.960
Well, when I met
the witch, we had

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.600
this talk going back and forth.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.120
And the questions she asked
me were the same questions

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.790
I was asked just
two weeks before.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.190
I was in Moscow.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.072
Moscow was the only
Russian word I know.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:43.405
And that's not even said Moscow.

00:21:43.405 --> 00:21:45.080
It's Moskova, right?

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.440
So I'm in Russia.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.450
I'm in Red Square,
right in the very heart.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.550
There's a big red wall
and a big yellow building

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.299
on the other side.

00:21:53.299 --> 00:21:55.080
There's dead Lenin, [MOANING].

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.170
He's dead right there.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.600
And on the other
side of the wall,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.900
there is a school called
the Moscow Higher Party

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.530
School of Communism,
the Moscow Higher Party

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.090
School of Communism.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:16.200
And never, never had an American
been inside that school before.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.130
They invited me.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.330
Well, that's cool.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.400
I get to go inside the Moscow
High Party School of Communism.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.490
Well, they couldn't
just let me go.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.790
So they had to change my name
from William to Uil'yam, from

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.075
Belew to Beloff.

00:22:31.075 --> 00:22:32.700
And then the middle
name was Ivanovich.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.074
It should have
been Leonardovich.

00:22:34.074 --> 00:22:36.360
So I'm Uil'yam Ivanovich Beloff.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.800
And they took me in there
and said, [RUSSIAN],

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.240
and I just go on in.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:45.430
And they took me to a room where
I met a professor whose job it

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:54.850
was to tell the world
what is communism.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:23:00.710
He had his fingers in the
entire world of communism,

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.690
and I was invited
to talk to him.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.330
Well, the first day, we
were talking and talking.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.650
And he just comes after me.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.850
I'm just an English teacher.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.130
Help, help!

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.720
And he wants to
know, what's better?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.830
Is it feudalism, where
people rule people?

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.500
Is it imperialism, where
countries rule others?

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.950
Is it nationalism, where
countries rule countries?

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.530
Is it capitalism, where
money controls everything?

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.172
Or is it Marxism,
this big idea where

00:23:28.172 --> 00:23:29.380
everything is going to be OK.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.590
Or is it communism, where
we will decide what is good,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.220
and you will like it?

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.740
So he wants to decide which
of these systems are the best.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.105
I don't even know what
he's talking about.

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:39.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:39.605 --> 00:23:42.310
BILL BELEW: But we
spent a good five hours

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.440
going back and forth,
back and forth,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.190
talking about these
different ideas.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.810
Well, I went back
home that night

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.951
feeling pretty sad about life,
because he's smarter than me,

00:23:54.951 --> 00:23:55.450
right?

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.900
He knows things I don't know.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.050
He said, can you come
back again the next day?

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.430
And he did.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.090
He said, Bill, come back.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.070
So I went back to
the very same room.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.780
And I come to find out that this
is most likely the very room

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.500
where Lenin and Stalin and
these guys got together and sat

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.940
and decided this is how
communism should play out.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.820
I'm in the very same room.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.560
And he looks at me
and says, Bill, it's

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.500
your turn to decide
what we will talk about.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.000
Ha, ha ha.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.360
Well, I have the
man who can touch

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.955
the entire communist
world sitting before me.

00:24:34.955 --> 00:24:39.126
And he says, what do
you want to talk about?

00:24:39.126 --> 00:24:41.110
Well, now, if you were
asked that question, you

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.540
were asked that question in that
situation, what would you say?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.710
What are you going to say?

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.320
Well, this is how you do
coding-- over at Google,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.360
we have-- no.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.170
What are you going to say?

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.130
Well, I was ready for this.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.910
I was ready for this.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:01.060
Because I have something
that burns in my bones

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.910
that I have to share.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:04.970
So he is looking at me.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.344
He is sitting
there very quietly.

00:25:06.344 --> 00:25:09.630
And it's my turn
to say something.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.750
And this is the first
time I have ever

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:17.090
started a fight that I
was prepared to lose.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.160
You see, this is the first
time I started a fight

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.570
that I was prepared to lose.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:32.480
So I said, OK, let's
talk about God.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.750
OK, he says, how do
know there is a god?

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.930
And I began to talk.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.330
And I talked for
some 45 minutes.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.805
And I went through
this reasoning,

00:25:43.805 --> 00:25:44.930
and I went through this.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.160
I just kept on going.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.580
45 minutes later,
he said nothing.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.390
So I continued to talk.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:26:01.150
And not only is there a god,
this god has written a book.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.910
And that book is
now ours to read.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.200
And he says, how do you
know this book is from God?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.520
Well, I got into
the middle of that,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.190
and I talked for another
45 minutes, maybe an hour.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.970
It's going, you know.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.390
This is how I know
these things to be true.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.750
And when I got done,
he said nothing.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.180
So I continued to talk.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.400
Yeah.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.190
And don't you know
that this God,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.480
who made the world--
and I'm wondering,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.990
why doesn't he fight back--
this God who has made the world,

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.320
he has given us a book so
that we can know who that is.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.830
He has also come
to us in a person.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.986
He became a person.

00:26:40.986 --> 00:26:43.220
Who is that person, he said.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.080
And I told him who
that person was.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.630
And how do you know
this person, Jesus?

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.942
How do you know?

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:51.150
How do you know these things?

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.280
And so I went into
history, and I

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.880
talked for another 45 minutes.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.910
I did this beyond what we
are talking about here.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.860
But let me give you an example.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.570
In his office, there
was a calendar.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.790
It was a calendar.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.610
And so I said, so do
you see the calendar?

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.250
He said, yeah, I
see the calendar.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:14.260
I said, you know, a year is
once around the sun, right?

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.290
A month, it's the moon.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.010
And once around the
moon takes a lap.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:21.690
A day is when the Earth spins.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.580
What are we to
understand about a week?

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.890
How did a week come to be?

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.050
Well, that's interesting.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.226
You can look that one up.

00:27:33.226 --> 00:27:34.934
And then, I looked at
the calendar again.

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:37.760
And I said, this
says 1989, 1989.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.380
What happened 1,989 years ago?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.490
Why do we go from here to
zero and then back to 1989?

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.304
What is in the middle?

00:27:47.304 --> 00:27:48.099
Well, I don't know.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.640
I said, you need to
go find that out.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.349
Well, I told him, because
it was my turn to talk.

00:27:52.349 --> 00:27:54.140
And then, I'm looking
at the same calendar.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.780
And I said, look,
there is Sunday.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.222
Sunday is in red.

00:27:59.222 --> 00:28:01.080
Why is Sunday in red?

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.767
Well, I learned some Russian.

00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:05.100
You know, there is Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.000
Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
right, Monday through Sunday,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.833
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN.].

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.125
And then, Sunday is [RUSSIAN].

00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.060
And I asked him.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:22.040
I said, Mr. Professor, what
does the word [RUSSIAN] mean?

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.836
It means resurrection.

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:26.700
Well, isn't that interesting?

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.710
For thousands of years
or hundreds of years,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.090
they've been Sunday
Resurrection Day.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.090
And then he began to get it,
you see. [WHISPERING] Ah.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.590
And then I finally
finished talking.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.494
And I looked at him, and I
said, what do you have to say?

00:28:41.494 --> 00:28:43.160
Because, I said, it's
his turn to fight.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.050
And he could have
fought, you know.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.500
He put his head down.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.921
I said, what do you have to say?

00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:51.420
He looks back, and the words
he uses are [SPEAKING RUSSIAN].

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.400
It sounds like interesting.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.960
Very interesting, he says.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.370
Now, I said, I know
it's very interesting,

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.020
but what do you have to say?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.320
He said nothing.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.450
What's wrong here?

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.260
Tell me something.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:08.961
Fight back.

00:29:08.961 --> 00:29:09.960
Tell me where I'm wrong.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.001
Show me where it's wrong.

00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:14.300
And we went home friends.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.310
Well, not two weeks after
that, barely two weeks

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:27.480
after I sat in the office with
him, the Berlin Wall came down.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.750
They did.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.940
Just two weeks after that is
when that all began to happen.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.670
Now, I probably didn't do that.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.470
BILL BELEW: But you can tell it.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.990
You can blame me if you want to.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.114
You can say, Bill did that.

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:42.940
Bill did that.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.650
Yeah, ah, it was great.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:50.570
You see, when I am able to talk
to people of other countries,

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.770
you see, I can touch people
in their business life.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.920
I can touch my children
and see their lives change.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.930
And if I'm really good,
I can touch the world,

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.910
if I just touch
the right people.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:11.637
Well, I want to know what
it is you want to say.

00:30:11.637 --> 00:30:13.720
So some of you are watching
this on the streaming.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.664
Hey!

00:30:14.664 --> 00:30:16.080
Some of you will
watch this later.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.370
Some of you are sitting here.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.810
Well, I want to know what
do you want to tell people.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.550
Write that down.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.540
Send it to me.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.130
Put it in the comments.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.890
What do you need to tell people?

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.930
Tell me what that is.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.010
What do you you
have to tell people?

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.470
When you find the answer
to those three questions,

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:38.370
you will find a way to be able
to communicate to more people.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:46.864
You will find a way to talk
to more and more people.

00:30:46.864 --> 00:30:48.830
Let's see, what did I forget?

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:54.150
Ah, the witch--
yeah-- and the gun.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.400
They had a gun.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.910
I'm sitting in this car on my
way out to meet this witch.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:07.220
And they said, Bill, there is
something we did not tell you.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.710
So, OK.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.930
He said, there are some
black magic people,

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.860
and those black magic
people have a gun.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.080
And with this gun, they can
shoot-- [HUMMING]-- waves.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:27.220
And if it hits you, they
will control how you think.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.850
And I'm thinking,
if it is not me,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.760
I will not believe
what they are saying.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.282
But I am in the car,
and they are telling me,

00:31:35.282 --> 00:31:36.990
they can shoot you
with the gun, and they

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.340
can control how
you are thinking.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.000
So I'm sitting in the back seat.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.970
Sergei is here, and
Boris is over there.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.760
I said, Sergei, ask Boris
if he's pulling my leg.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.025
Sergei says, huh?

00:31:48.025 --> 00:31:50.841
I said, ask Boris if
he's pulling my leg.

00:31:50.841 --> 00:31:51.840
Sergei said, what, what?

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.360
I said, pulling my leg.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.756
Bill, how can he pull your leg?

00:31:54.756 --> 00:31:55.630
You are sitting here.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.410
He is sitting there.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.050
No, is he kidding me?

00:31:59.050 --> 00:31:59.990
Is he joking?

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.870
No, no, no.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.840
We have this gun, and
we can shoot people.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.750
And I'm thinking, shoot me.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.270
I know.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.210
I'm telling them,
shoot me with the gun.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.500
I am not afraid.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.950
I do not think so deeply.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.364
So what can happen?

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:14.280
Shoot me with the gun.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.610
Well, we met those people.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.590
They never shot me with the gun.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.750
But we ended up at
the witch's house.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.710
We ended up at
the witch's house.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.610
And, you know, she was kind
of short, kind of round,

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.105
looked like a fire plug, you
know, for fighting fires.

00:32:31.105 --> 00:32:31.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.605 --> 00:32:34.590
BILL BELEW: And
she looked at me,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.450
and she says, Bill,
I want you to help

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.200
me fight the black magic.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.110
Will you help me?

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.400
Well, that's another
story on another day

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.010
that I would like
to tell you about.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.890
But this goes,
again, beyond this.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.060
But she asked me
three questions.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.840
How do know God made the world?

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.040
How do you know he talked
to us through this book?

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.665
And how do you know
he became a person?

00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:02.050
And I know the answers
to those questions.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.150
But what I'm looking
for here is how

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.990
to tell these
stories that I want

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.820
to tell, how to tell these
stories that I need to tell,

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.720
how to tell these
stories that I have

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.020
to tell with as few
words as possible.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:26.800
And if I did my job correctly,
I have used only 800 words

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.065
in this whole talk.

00:33:28.065 --> 00:33:31.140
And if I stepped outside
of those 800 words,

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.530
I was able to explain the words.

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.730
You see, there's 800 words.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.890
With 800 words, I can
touch people's lives.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.710
With 800 words, I can
change my children's lives.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:51.350
And with 800 words, I
can change the world.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.360
If you could change
the world, why

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.170
would you not change the world?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.860
Thomas Edison said
about Henry Ford--

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.800
Thomas Edison said
about Henry Ford--

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:12.100
we cannot be sure whether what
Henry Ford did was good or bad.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:17.550
But Henry Ford did not leave
things the way he found them.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.690
Yeah.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.159
If you could change
the world, why

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.879
would you not change the world?

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:24.420
And all you need to
change that world

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.356
are those 800 words, 800 words.

00:34:28.356 --> 00:34:30.440
This is what we call
them the wow factor.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.710
I can touch the world.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:38.710
So we know the 1-800, right,
the 1-800 numbers you call.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.350
Then you can talk to anybody.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.350
Well, with 800 words, I
can now change the world.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.260
So this is my call
to action for you.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.830
What are you going
to do that makes

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.940
the world a different
and better place?

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.739
How are you going
to change the world?

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:55.989
Thanks for letting me be here.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:56.750
I appreciate your time.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.210
I appreciate you sharing
your lunch with me.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.409
Thank you very much.

00:34:59.409 --> 00:35:05.037
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:08.070
BILL BELEW: So how did I
come to have these 800 words?

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:13.209
All right, so this was back
before Google was even anyone.

00:35:13.209 --> 00:35:14.250
Well, no actually it was.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.480
It was, like, 1991, was it?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.411
When was Google founded?

00:35:19.411 --> 00:35:19.910
'93.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.050
Well, this was
back in '89 or so.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.159
And so I actually did it
a little bit before then.

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:25.450
I was teaching in a university.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.180
I had a bunch of students
who were really stupid.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.340
And they needed
extra work to do.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.700
So I gave them extra work to do.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.130
So what we did was
we watched movies.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.560
We watched 50 different movies.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.180
And in each of those 50 movies,
we wrote out the dialogue

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.921
on all of those
50 movies by hand.

00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:44.170
And, you know, exactly, we
wrote them out all by hand.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.280
And then each of
the students who

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.831
were failing, they didn't know
English, but they could count.

00:35:47.831 --> 00:35:50.330
So I said, now, just go through
and circle all of the words.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.500
Circle all of the "the's."

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.120
Circle all of the "wents."

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.430
Circle all of the "is's."

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.950
And let's list them all up.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.420
So I had 50 students over
three years watch 50 movies

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:05.000
and list up all of these words
and most frequently ordered.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.600
There are about 612
words, 612, 613 words.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.270
It depends how you
group them together.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.190
I can talk about
86% of everything

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:22.070
I want to say with 612
words, not 800, 600.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:27.007
About 7% of all movies
are names, places.

00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:27.965
Let's go to Cincinnati.

00:36:27.965 --> 00:36:30.550
You know, let's go kill
people in South Africa.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.500
You cannot.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.790
You have to learn them.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:38.035
And then another 8% percent or
so, I forget the exact numbers.

00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:39.160
It's in the book, whatever.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.534
I'm not going to
sell you a book.

00:36:40.534 --> 00:36:42.870
But I'll send you the list
if you give me your email.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:49.640
So another 8% of all words in
a movie is only used one time.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.090
The word pops up, and
it's never used again.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.660
Don't touch that detonator.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.750
You will die.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.570
Well, I don't know what it is,
but if I touch it, I'll die.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.340
So it's something that
dies people or, you know,

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.062
kills people.

00:37:00.062 --> 00:37:02.020
So we can understand,
that's how we learn words

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.470
by using the 800, to be
able to define those things.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.710
So I want to encourage
you to find, you know,

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.580
develop, create,
build on those 15.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.880
If you're just an
expert at what you do,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.752
just be really, really
good at what you do.

00:37:19.752 --> 00:37:21.460
And people will find
a way to understand.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.500
Oh, that's easy.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.780
And then we build on that.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.235
If I cannot tell or if I
don't master words, well,

00:37:26.235 --> 00:37:27.200
I can show people.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.130
That's why I created
a deck and so on.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.860
So add up those 15.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.210
Pick and choose
the ones you like.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.495
Use the ones you
want to use, right?

00:37:35.495 --> 00:37:39.475
And add to those 800 words,
and you can change the world.

00:37:39.475 --> 00:37:44.060
AUDIENCE: So as engineers, we
often talk in a techie way,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.150
where we have a lot of
words to explain something.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:50.620
So do you have any suggestions
on how to make our talk,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.952
like, our presentation
more essential?

00:37:54.952 --> 00:37:56.160
BILL BELEW: What do you mean?

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:03.050
AUDIENCE: I mean, how to make
our talks or presentations

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.260
in a condensed way?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.700
BILL BELEW: Well, see, I can
connect those techie terms.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.940
I can connect to that
techie expertise.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.920
Whatever it is you're trying
to do, all of those words,

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.020
all of those ideas,
all of that job,

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:20.250
is connected by these
800 words, right?

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:24.530
So here, I need to do this,
while I need to do that.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.770
And that's where the
show-me tells me.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.330
So if I can show and I can
connect with those 800 words,

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.342
I can tell anybody anything.

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.065
Does that make sense?

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:34.460
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.930
BILL BELEW: The problem is
we try to overwhelm people

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.630
with how smart we are
when we different words.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you travel
a lot, you know, over Asia.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.361
So just compare Asia
culture and here.

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:55.050
Can you put some comment on when
you say deliver some message?

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.270
Do we need to be very
culture-sensitive?

00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:03.250
BILL BELEW:
Culturally-sensitive,

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.189
well, when you go to Asia to
speak to a professional group,

00:39:07.189 --> 00:39:08.105
you don't wear shorts.

00:39:08.105 --> 00:39:09.556
No, I'm kidding.

00:39:09.556 --> 00:39:10.055
Ah.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:20.260
I think it comes down to,
people are people everywhere.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.940
And what they want
to know is, what

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:28.130
is in your heart that connects
to what's in my heart.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.030
You know, we don't have to
worry about cultural gaps.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.980
We don't have to worry
about cultural gaps.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.930
All I need is to consider what
it is that I have to share,

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.950
what it is that I need
to share-- so I'm back

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.600
to the very basic, what I want
to, what I need to, what I have

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.080
to-- and when people
begin to understand

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.130
those different levels, all
of that culture breaks down.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.420
You know, every culture loves
their children, for example.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:53.104
In every culture, people
want to do a good job.

00:39:53.104 --> 00:39:54.770
They want to be experts
at what they do.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.103
And every culture wants to
have that [FOREIGN LANGUAGE].

00:39:57.103 --> 00:39:58.790
Everybody wants to be liked.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.040
And those things don't change.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.740
How that plays out is different.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.860
But those elements of
those-- those 15 that I'm

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.440
sharing with you-- those are
the same in every culture.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.050
So what I want to do is I
want to pick 1 or 2 or 3,

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.960
or all of those 15, and
there are some more.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.290
I want to pick 1, 2,
3, or all of those 15,

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.340
and I want to be able to
connect those 15 with 800 words

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.500
to anybody.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.210
And I don't have
to be overwhelmed.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.070
I don't have to think
too hard about it.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.920
AUDIENCE: Your other
slides, you mentioned

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.284
the use of Google eye,
is Google kind of funny--

00:40:31.284 --> 00:40:33.450
BILL BELEW: Look at the
world through Google's eyes.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.574
AUDIENCE: Yes, through eye.

00:40:34.574 --> 00:40:37.620
But, like I say,
in China or Russia,

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.630
there are some local
or our search engine.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.700
BILL BELEW: Can I use
Baidu Index here with that?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, that's it.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.820
You can talk about it.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.640
So that is the same thing
if you are a person?

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.540
BILL BELEW: I'm outside
of my 800 words here.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.039
Is that OK?

00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:52.970
So the rules are the same.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.080
You know, we are
looking for people

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:59.580
who can satisfy my problem.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.100
So at the very
basic level, there

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.590
is a person who wants
something, but there

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.950
is a problem in the way.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.789
And so they are looking for
the fix to that problem.

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:12.330
And they will do
that with the index.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.538
They will do that with Baidu.

00:41:13.538 --> 00:41:15.220
They will do that with Dogpile.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.420
They will do that especially
with Google and Bing.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.670
I hope I don't get in trouble.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.315
You see, it's I
have this problem.

00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:23.370
Who can solve this
problem for me?

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.760
And the more problems I can
solve, the better the expert

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.570
I am.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.170
Now see, I don't say, just
throw a bunch of stuff.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.960
No, we don't throw
a bunch of stuff.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.120
We want to solve real
problems, for real people, who

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.600
need real answers,
in real locations

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.445
so that they can make real
changes to their life.

00:41:43.445 --> 00:41:45.260
And then it works the same.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.444
I understand that Baidu's about
three years behind Google.

00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:48.943
Ah.

00:41:48.943 --> 00:41:50.030
You know, Than.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.530
You tell me.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.820
I don't know.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.924
How many years is Baidu behind?

00:41:54.924 --> 00:41:55.424
OK.

00:41:55.424 --> 00:41:57.924
You can make up something, and
we won't know the difference.

00:41:57.924 --> 00:41:58.607
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:58.607 --> 00:41:59.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:59.106 --> 00:42:04.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for me, just I
feel maybe the kind of pretty

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.230
much control, right, you
know, a little bit several

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.940
censored some information.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.964
So that different.

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:16.130
BILL BELEW: If you want me
to talk about censorship,

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.960
I'll just get myself
in trouble, right?

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.850
You know, different countries
have different rules.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.710
So we play by the rules of
the different countries.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.700
Now, I don't want to
start a discussion.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.730
That's beyond the scope here.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.960
But, you know, the old
saying, when in Rome.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.990
You know, in Japanese, we
say, [SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.040
It's the same thing.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.792
When you're in
Goa, do like Goans.

00:42:39.792 --> 00:42:42.000
So there is a reason why
that proverb has been around

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.780
for a very long time.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.250
Because that's how we
should do things, I think.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.000
All right.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.186
Well, thank you very much
for sharing your lunch

00:42:48.186 --> 00:42:48.600
time with me.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.100
MALE SPEAKER: And let's
thank the speaker again.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.700
Thanks.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.250
[APPLAUSE]
