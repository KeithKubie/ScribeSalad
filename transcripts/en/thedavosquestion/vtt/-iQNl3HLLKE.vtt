00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.540
&gt;&gt;The most pressing issue today is basically
social responsibility.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.200
So we have plenty of people here that are
social entrepreneurs selected

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.001
by the Schwab Foundation that try to combine,
to show responsibility

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:28.840
[INAUDIBLE] and business so how can we move
the world, a more

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.230
responsibile world?
Because you it can be very romantic by telling

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.910
we have to change this
or we have to change that.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.950
What about the climate change what about this?
But at the end of the day, it is the person

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.010
who is fighting or
struggling for a new system of sewage or for

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.570
clean energy or for
helping women who are mutilated since birth.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.829
These are the basically, the real issues that
nobody discuss.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.609
So let's take our time and do our things,
our mission in life because

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:14.619
our life is our mission, having more social
responsibility in what we

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.689
do.
So the basic question is are we doing enough

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.149
to transform our life in
our own missions?

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.709
Thank you.
