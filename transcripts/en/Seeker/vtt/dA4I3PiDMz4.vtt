00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.360
[TRACE] There are lots of different types
of robots; insect robots, animal robots, jellyfish

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.690
robots, toy robots, cooking robots, military
robots..sex robots?

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.050
An android is a human-like robot...it looks
like a human, talks like a human, it acts

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.289
like a human.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.880
Androids are the pinnacle of robotics and
artificial intelligence.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
Successfully building an android is essentially
like creating synthetic life in our own image.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.800
So how close are we to building an android?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.300
Right now there are only a handful of robots
that are anywhere close to passing themselves

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.450
off as human.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.860
Not only do these ‘bots look and feel weird,
their artificial intelligence systems... aren’t

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.240
that intelligent.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.510
But roboticists and computer engineers are
working on humanoid, intelligent robots all

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.040
over the world.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.100
Why?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.920
Because who doesn’t want a robot cook, butler,
or driver?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.110
But making science-fiction a reality is way
harder than it looks.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.180
Even just attempting to make robots look and
move like humans is hard.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.979
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI]: AI has gotten very
smart, in specific aspects most recently in

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:21.979
perception.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.200
Well you have speech recognition, as well
as image recognition software on your cell

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
phones.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.909
One of the pieces that AI is not still very
good at is things like grasping and manipulation

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.369
of physical objects.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.520
Things like cooking actually requires enough
fine motion skills that it will be at least

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.679
need 10 years.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:50.520
[RUZENA BAJCSY] You have now more sophisticated
robots that can pick and move around and help

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.620
you, more as a complement to the human capabilities
rather than replacement.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.619
[TRACE] So robots can’t physically cook
you dinner and clean up afterward - yet.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.540
Even though most of the robots that you see
online are more like this, we’re not actually

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.780
that far from robotic limbs that perform basic
movements.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.069
In the last 10 years, bionic prosthetic arms
have come a long way.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.890
Many models have decent grip strength and
individual finger articulation.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.690
But, they’re still controlled by people.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.980
[RUZENA BAJCSY] We don't fully understand
how our muscles work.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.150
It's a complicated system that robotic technology
can help to unravel.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.870
[TRACE] So, that’s where we are with movement,
but right now that’s kind of the best we’ve

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.870
got.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.430
And when it come to the looks department,
we’re really far away.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.489
Synthetic robot skin is made of things like
silicone and polyurethane.

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.750
It still can’t bounce back or feel things.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.720
As you probably know, it doesn’t even look
real.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.950
Realistic, synthetic skin will need to be
sensitive to different tactile experiences

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.209
like heat and cold, and no one is even close.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.090
As for a humanoid robot with clever AI, a
robotic skeleton, artificial limbs and flawless

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.090
skin?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.300
That could take decades, or longer.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.540
[RUZENA BAJCSY] We’ll have better sensors,
sensor meaning cameras, smaller, higher resolution,

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.849
faster, detecting what's out there, but it's
not only visual.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.010
It will be auditory.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.260
It will be tactile, fingers, hands.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.560
[TRACE] Maybe we’re overthinking this, do
we really want or need robots to be humanoid,

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.239
like the replicants in Blade Runner?

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.650
Or would we be happy with them being out of
sight, like the disembodied voice on Star

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650
Trek?

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:01.739
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI] if you want a household
robot that walks from one room to the other,

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.620
then you’re probably looking for something
that looks humanoid, but if on the other hand

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.799
you’re looking for a smart home, and food
just appears in front of you, that’s a smart

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.230
home not a smart robot.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.810
In terms of the challenges, they’re the
same, it’s as to which one you prefer is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.470
really an issue.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.240
[TRACE] What it’s really about is the task.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.060
Androids are great for working around the
house, but several companies are already proving

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
we don’t necessarily need a humanoid robot
to drive a car.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.520
Perhaps the more important obstacle to overcome
isn’t physicality or looks.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.700
If we really want intelligent robots to work
for us, we’re going to need them to learn

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.530
to work with us.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.130
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI] To be an effective
assistant you really need to be able to read

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.330
the other person’s mind.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.030
That’s the whole entire direction, that’s
actually happening right now.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.060
And, in fact, there is this whole saying that
the reason humans have the huge brains that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.919
we have is not to run away from the tigers
in the savanna, but to be with each other.

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.860
[TRACE] So what we need is to find a way to
not only make robots act human but, for them

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.110
to fully understand and even anticipate what’s
on our minds.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.470
And... is that what we really mean by intelligence?

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.630
What is intelligence anyway?

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.680
How do you test it?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.479
How do you know when a thing is intelligent?

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.250
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI]...intelligence involves
things like perception, things like ability

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.700
to manipulate the world, emotional intelligence,
social intelligence.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.560
[RUZENA BAJCSY] That process of how you deal
with the never seen before, never heard before,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:50.120
never experienced before, and still you somehow
know how to react is something that we don't

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
understand.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.690
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI] it’ll be at least
25 years or more before we reach human level

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.460
intelligence and we do reach human level intelligence,
that we will have also passed the Turing test.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.020
[TRACE] Alan Turing, is often referred to
as the father of modern computing.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.560
He said “a computer would deserve to be
called intelligent if it could deceive a human

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.849
into believing that it was human.”

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.599
But anyone who’s ever chatted with a bot
online knows they’re not ... great.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.051
They don’t always understand, they’re
repetitive; they don’t respond in the way

00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:24.750
a human would -- or they know things that
no human would know off the top of their heads!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.900
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI] there was this one
human being who knew so much about all the

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.639
arcana of Shakespeare that people essentially
decided that it must be a machine because

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:43.310
nobody with a real life would know so much
about Shakespeare.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.639
[TRACE] Robots are a comin’, and while they
may not be in humanoid form, they will be

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.690
replacing the work of humans across our society.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.720
Blue collar, white collar, nobody is safe.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.729
[SUBBARAO KAMBHAMPATI] The reality is that
anything routine, whether it is cognitive

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.060
or non-cognitive is going to be replaced.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.520
So, for example, truck driving is something
that within five years it’s probably going

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.539
to be gone.

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.580
[TRACE] Radiologists: you got 5 years.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.940
Psychologists: we have an app for that.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.110
Sports and economics reporters: Too late,
computers already do that job.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.610
Paralegals: Bye!

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.740
[TRACE] So, how close are we to creating androids?

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.710
Smart AI systems already exist and we’re
a decade away from building robots that move

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.340
like us, though, aesthetically we’ve still
got some major challenges to overcome.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.669
There’s really no incentive to put all the
pieces of the intelligent humanoid robot puzzle

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:39.560
together, at least, not yet.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.520
But in reality, we’re not building toward
a future where one type of artificially intelligent

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.120
robot will exist.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.550
For better or for worse, we’re heading toward
a world where a whole fleet of specialized

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.960
robots will be developed, each taking over
its own little world.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.120
How close are we... to getting you to subscribe?

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.500
It’s easy, just tap this button.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.889
So at the moment AI isn’t great, but part
of that might be that AI just doesn’t have

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:09.730
its own memories… so what if we gave an
AI the ability to remember?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.260
To think back?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.900
Find out in this video we made, here.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.330
And thanks so much for watching Seeker.
