had faith it never worked for me so I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
had faith it never worked for me so I
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.110
had faith it never worked for me so I
became an atheist very cognitively by

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
became an atheist very cognitively by
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120
became an atheist very cognitively by
the time I was about probably 14 and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130
the time I was about probably 14 and
 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.280
the time I was about probably 14 and
certainly by 16 and 18 I knew that I had

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
certainly by 16 and 18 I knew that I had
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.620
certainly by 16 and 18 I knew that I had
no belief and heaven in hell so then

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630
no belief and heaven in hell so then
 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.949
no belief and heaven in hell so then
there was the question how do you make

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959

sure you do the right thing and for me

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
sure you do the right thing and for me
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.130
sure you do the right thing and for me
it was really clear because my mother

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140
it was really clear because my mother
 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.410
it was really clear because my mother
had said to me you know all the dogma in
