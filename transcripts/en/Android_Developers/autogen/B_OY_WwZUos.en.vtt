00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.560
 I grew up in a farm 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.750
 My childhood was wonderful 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.400
 Because I grew up next to my father and worked in the field 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.920
 One of the things I learned 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.290
 The meaning of working throughout the day 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.580
 So I wanted to become an entrepreneur 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.520
 A few years ago I started with my partners from almost zero 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.160
 Now we have more than 200 employees and more than 200 million downloads 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.640
 As well as our partnership with Adidas. We have made great achievements. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
 I was 40 years old when I started running 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.690
 The whole thing began with a challenge 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.320
 My daughter, Alexis, registered in the jogging race 10 km 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080
 I decided to register myself in a 5 km race 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.540
 To show my support for her and she will not run alone 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.770
 Alexis does not think I can 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.550
 She told me it was not so easy 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.760
 I was advised to use the Runtastic application and accepted the challenge 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 I ran a full 5 km 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.190
 Since I started running, I've been involved in all kinds of races 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.140
 Currently I'm training for the second marathon 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.470
 I learned from jogging that I could do a lot 

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:18.040
 By diagnosis, I have learning difficulties 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.970
 School years were not easy 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.200
 She then met the "Whitefield" 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.377
 Which completely changed my life 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.330
 The main idea of ​​the Remind application 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.020
 Came from my desire to strengthen the abilities of teachers such as Miss "Whitefield" 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 And increase their effectiveness 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.860
 In order to make a tremendous development in the educational system 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.360
 So I was spending my time talking to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.580
 Hundreds of teachers throughout the country 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.760
 While my brother was busy studying programming 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.520
 Remind now employs more than 23 million teachers, students and parents 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.100
 In more than 90% of US education areas 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.720
 We were never able to reach these customers 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.550
 If not Google Play 

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:02.800
 One of my students, Jason, was suffering 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.220
 Of completing tasks on time 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.300
 One day he came to tell me ... 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180
 Then I bet on 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.600
 I will do all the homework and pass the test successfully 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.790
 Provided you give us a party 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.350
 I was constantly receiving messages from Miss "Limer" 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.270
 And my classmates for my encouragement and support 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.650
 She finally lost the bet 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.150
 I gave the students an ice-cream party 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.691
 Perhaps this was one of the best achievements 

00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:25.090
 Which I saw achieve 

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.190
 There are more than 30 million users 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.640
 Applicable at this time 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.570
 We are larger than any university or school 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.790
 It has existed for many years in India 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.190
 Our inspiration and enthusiasm 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.740
 Is to hear others talk about 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.080
 The effectiveness of learning English using the application 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.780
 And how much they benefit from it 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.240
 This gives us greater strength to continue 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.110
 And strive to make a greater impact 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.520
 When she retired 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820
 I decided to do something useful 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.640
 So I joined Hello English 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 I think many children around us want to 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.550
 learn English 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.790
 Joining Hello English has given me enough confidence 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.930
 To go to my towns and educate the poor and the needy 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.740
 welcome 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.326
 how are you? 

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:17.896
 what's your name? 

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.020
 Bogar 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.065
 Wonderful 

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:23.130
 My name is Sidhar 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.570
 My name is Sidhar 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.323
 English is useful for higher education 

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:31.340
 And open up to you better areas of life 

00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:39.700
 I began to establish Sesame about five years ago 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.670
 I was working in computer vision 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.300
 And gesture technology 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.000
 And appeared on TV to display the game 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.281
 Developed and controlled by head gestures 

00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.780
 I received a call the next day 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.810
 Someone told me that he was unable to move his hands or legs 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.376
 He asked me to make him a smart phone that he could use 

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:55.834
 He came and looked at me to tell me 

00:03:55.834 --> 00:04:00.009
 That he founded a new company 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.960
 I told him that this would be a lot better 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.900
 To help the world 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.980
 I was convinced by my point of view 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.160
 My company has provided a new perspective 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.850
 About what technology can do 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.270
 And their ability to change their lifestyle 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.740
 Allows me to modify the Android operating system 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.690
 Make more innovations than I imagined at first 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.710
 There are things I do and I could not do before 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.770
 I could not handle my smartphone 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.120
 My life has changed completely 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.530
 User success is not just a number 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.850
 Success is the fruit of a full life with its various details and events 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.630
 Those successful people joined us in supporting our success.
