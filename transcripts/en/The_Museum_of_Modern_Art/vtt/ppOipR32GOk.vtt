00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390
(indistinct chatter)

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.170
It is my duty to teach young generation

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.411
about the experience in a performance.

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:20.332
And I really think this
is a part of my work

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.703
as an artist; a kind of
duty and responsibility.

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.290
- She is probably one of the best teachers

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.194
I've ever had, in just this one week.

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:32.433
- So there's always
that suspended animation

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:35.075
not quite knowing what to expect next.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:39.292
- And her criticism can be, it goes down

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:42.339
with a spoonful of honey,
literally for some people,

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.095
but it really does come from a place where

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:50.634
she is not taking, she's just giving.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:54.390
And with a lot of people,
artists especially, that get to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.730
a level like, "Oh, I'm having
my own show at the MoMA",

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.531
can get that important feeling
when you're around them.

00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.802
She relates to you like we're all just

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:06.691
children in the playground.

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.482
- Performance is all about the dialogue,

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:12.171
energy dialogue, and being
present in here and now.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.714
Audience is like a dog;
they can feel immediately

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:17.055
that you are afraid;
that you are insecure;

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:21.137
that you're not in the
right state of mind.

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:24.240
And they just leave; all tension is gone.

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:27.717
- Learning my potential for concentration,

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:30.639
Marina really showed us how to find it.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.759
- The challenges really,
to maintain this level of

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.769
mind and body cleanse, and
she's definitely given us

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.625
the tools to be able to do
that when the time comes.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.210
But these are things that are gonna be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.529
very challenging in New York City.

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.971
- She already put us
through much more difficult

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:49.244
circumstances than we will
face in the performance.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.074
I'm not gonna wait until
my first performance date

00:01:52.074 --> 00:01:55.095
to see what's it's like
to stand for 2 1/2 hours.

00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:59.537
- It's real lots of work to do
with yourself and your mind.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.110
And people think, "Oh, that's easy,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.909
just standing there and that's it."

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.297
But it's not like that.

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:08.401
It's very much demanding.
