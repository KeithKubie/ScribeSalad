00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.270
gene. But the pill directly provides her with active lactase.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.050

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.860
isn't altering transcription or translation in any way

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.510
or the DNA or genetic sequence. It's simply

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.360
providing her with a temporary relief of active protein.
