00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.080
Ow, so I wrote this song with my
two good friends, the Scottish

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.250
Freddie Stevenson
and the young man

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.010
from Georgia-- not the state,
the country-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.690
And we wrote this one day
in the Upper West Side

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.070
in an apartment.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.320
We had a little Grand Marnier.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.040
And we just vibed,
honey, we just vibed.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.680
A black girl and two white men
from Europe, honey, vibing.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.243
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:35.993
[MUSIC - KIMBERLY
NICOLE, "IT AIN'T FAIR"]

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.160
All right, it ain't fair.
