00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.490
Here are 10 Amazing Movie Facts Brought To
You By Our Fans.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.210
Home Alone – Buzz’s Girlfriend (from Crankii
Badger)

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.340
Kevin McCallister and his older brother Buzz
don't exactly get along, but the bully does

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.470
get burned by one of the movie's most lasting
jokes – well actually, it's his girlfriend

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.620
who takes most of the hit.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.470
Since the joke about Buzz's girlfriend hinges
on the reveal that she is laughably ugly,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.360
the director couldn't bring himself to subject
an innocent young actress to that straightforward

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
an insult.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.259
Instead, he put a boy in a wig for the photo,
meaning the joke could work, but nobody's

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.500
feelings were hurt in the process.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.130
Scream – The Birth of Ghost Face (from River
The Don)

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.229
Some horror icons are painstakingly created,
and others are just complete luck.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.450
When Wes Craven decided to reinvent the modern
slasher movie with Scream, the actual script

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.560
never described what kind of mask the killer
was wearing.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.189
It was only when scouting for locations that
a producer stumbled on the now-famous mask.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.909
When Craven contacted the Fun World company
for the right to use their "peanut-eyed ghost"

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.350
mask in the movie, the company knew they had
the upper hand, and drove a hard bargain.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.780
The crew then designed their own version of
the mask - different enough to not get sued

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.359
- and the company accepted the offer, and
the free publicity that came with it.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.740
The "Ghostface" mask became iconic, but the
altered version still made the cut, visible

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.229
in the movie's opening sequence.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.539
Dr. No – Itsy Bitsy Spider (from Aidan Butler)

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.920
Just because a movie's hero is a fearless
badass, that doesn't mean the actor playing

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.219
him had to be, too.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.530
For plenty of James Bond fans, Sean Connery
will always be the best version of the suave,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.810
womanizing secret agent.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.939
But in his debut, the actor's fear of spiders
became a serious hurdle.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.170
When the story planned for James to be threatened
by a deadly tarantula in his bed, Connery

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.720
couldn't let the spider actually crawl up
his arm, so the filmmakers cheated, putting

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920
a pane of glass between the two.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.120
It was easy to see the spider wasn't actually
on the actor, so in the end, a stuntman was

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
used.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.510
It wasn't just Connery who had a thing about
spiders though - the stuntman said it was

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.040
the scariest scene he ever had to film.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.260
Frozen – Reindeer Games (from Mari Roald
Meldal)

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.930
Sven the reindeer may be just a supporting
player in Disney's megahit, but he still got

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.980
plenty of laughs.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.489
The animators took his character seriously,
examining real reindeer in their research

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.140
trip to Norway, the inspiration for the fictional
kingdom of Arandale.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.250
They even had a small reindeer brought into
their office to capture its personality, but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.280
soon realized it didn't really have one.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.370
In the end, they relied on Pixar legend John
Lasseter's dog for inspiration, and the canine

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.120
habits are easy to see in the finished film.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
The Godfather – Second Chance (from Emsal
Yaclin)

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.280
It's hard to imagine the story of the Corleone
family was every going to be any different

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.129
than the timeless masterpiece audiences eventually
got, but the movie almost featured a pair

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.579
of award winning icons before either had proved
their true talents.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.620
Before James Caan had landed the role of Sonny
Corleone, the handsome son of Marlon Brando's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.640
Don, actor Robert De Niro was pursuing the
part.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.209
It's a shame to think both Pacino and De Niro
could have played brothers in one of cinema's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.599
most revered dramas, but Francis Ford Coppola
made it up to De Niro by casting him in the

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.340
sequel, as a young Vito Corleone back home
in Sicily.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.849
*That* role would land him an Oscar, the first
ever given for a role spoken mostly in a foreign

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.090
language.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.129
Star Wars – Trusty Old Ford (from Caitlin
Mcewan)

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.209
As one of the most successful movie stars
in history, Harrison Ford has become synonymous

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.450
with not one, but TWO iconic movie franchises.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.209
But his rise to fame started with Star Wars
- a role that he was never meant to even be

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.520
considered for.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.129
After Ford won over George Lucas for a role
in American graffiti, the director failed

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.150
to see his star potential - but the producers
and casting agents around him didn't.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.879
Lucas had no intention of casting Ford as
the smug smuggler Han Solo, but agreed to

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.299
let him read the part in auditions for the
other roles.

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.349
After countless hours, and other star actors
struggled to deliver, Lucas finally realized

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.999
Ford had the character all figured out.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.999
He cast the actor, and the rest is history.

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.120
Die Hard With a Vengeance – McClane Says
(from Travis Allday)

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.000
Before Bruce Willis was jumping on jet fighters
or launching cars into helicopters, he was

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.940
solving riddles across New York city.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.720
The third Die Hard movie ended with a memorable
bang, but did you know that wasn't actually

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.820
the original ending?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.230
That's right, Die Hard With a Vengeance originally
had a darker, more badass ending that actually

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.960
sent John McClane off into the sunset on a
happy note.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.600
After tracking Hans Gruber back to Germany,
John turns the tables, ambushing his enemy

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.730
with riddles of his own, playing Russian roulette
with a rocket launcher.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.490
McClane - who had given up drinking and smoking
after almost being killed - comes out on top,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.760
and leaving the expired Gruber to spend Christmas
with his family.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.970
Star Wars – What’s in a Name? (from Gamer
of Darkness)

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.440
George Lucas tends to get all the credit for
dreaming up the Empire, Rebel Alliance, and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.130
the droids of a galaxy far, far away – but
some of the planets owe their names to places

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.480
in our very own world.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.140
Lucas hadn’t quite decided on a name for
Luke Skywalker’s planet when his first script

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.060
was completed, since so much of the action
takes place on other worlds.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.750
But in the end, decided that the name of a
town in Tunisia was a perfect fit.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.620
“Tataouine” or “Tatween” wasn’t
actually home to any of the movie’s locations,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.751
but considering what an achievement it was
to make it out of the desert with the film

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:24.760
still on track, maybe the director thought
the name would be a good luck charm.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.600
Harry Potter – It Wasn’t Butterbeer (from
The Sweggy Dinosaur)

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.730
There’s no pressure like that of a Hollywood
movie star, and for young actors, it’s only

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.730
more intense.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.370
As the star of the Harry Potter series, actor
Daniel Radcliffe faced more pressure than

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.020
most people could grasp – and has since
admitted that he used alcohol to help him

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.020
cope.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.120
The actor has since steered clear of drinking
entirely, and claims he never actually drank

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.190
on the set of the movies.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.590
But coming into work drunk means Radcliffe
can point out scenes in the Harry Potter movies

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.870
where he is simply “dead behind the eyes.”

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.740
Since he refuses to say which movies or scenes,
fans can only guess.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.500
Back to the Future – Method Acting (from
soccerjocks07)

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.030
Marty McFly is usually prepared for anything,
even if he’s dropping into a brand new decade

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.030
– or century.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.680
But when Marty first winds up in 1885 in Back
to the Future Part 3, he needs Doc Brown to

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.200
save him from a guaranteed hanging at the
hands of Buford “Mad Dog” Tannen.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.620
As it turns out, actor Michael j.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.340
Fox needed some rescuing, too.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.900
To film the scene, Fox had agreed to have
a real rope tied around his neck, and shown

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.880
how to keep himself safe by holding it slack.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.410
When the procedure slipped his mind during
one take, the rope really did cut off his

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.410
air supply.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.500
The crew and cast simply thought he had found
a way to play a strangled man even better…

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.410
until he passed out, at which point co-star
Christopher Lloyd severed the rope with a

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.750
single gunshot…

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.750
We hope.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.150
Probably not though.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.060
Those are the best behind-the-scenes details
that our fans supplied, but if you have more

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.190
