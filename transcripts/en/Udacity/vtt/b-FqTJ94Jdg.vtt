Creating individual triangles by hand is pretty painful, as you probably noticed

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.738
from the exercises so far. The most common way to generate geometric objects is

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:12.774
to use a modeling program. Writing such program is the bread and butter for the

00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:16.560
company I work for, Auto Desk. Here, I'm using 3 studio max to create a number

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.292
of basic objects including the tea polyhedron. There are plenty of other ways to

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:24.864
acquire models. For example, laser scanners can be used to find a cloud of

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:29.362
points. This data is then processed to make a mesh. Another method is to take a

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:33.747
series of photos and have a program derive the shape of the object from these.

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:37.595
Whatever process is used you normally end up with the geometric mesh of

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:41.967
triangles. Within Web GL on 3JS, there's a whole process where you can take a

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:46.068
mesh in some 3D file format and convert it to a form that Web GL can read. I

00:00:46.068 --> 00:00:49.780
could spend the next few units discussing this process, but it's not all that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.790
relative to interactive rendering itself. Take a look in the additional course

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.923
materials for it to learn more about this.
