[INTERPOSING VOICES]

ROB DODSON: I think
the thing that I

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.001
love most about
being a web developer

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.450
is that, in our industry,
we share all of our work

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.280
with one another.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.840
We do open source.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.580
And, as a result, we can kind
of read each other's code,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.556
and we all collectively
improve because of that.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:20.680
And there's not a lot of
other industries out there

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.340
which are built on openness.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.590
And so, I don't
know, for me, that's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.470
a pretty compelling reason
to be working on the web.
