to pull up the drawer and tap in the
 

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.900
to pull up the drawer and tap in the
overflow icon and as we did with a

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:39.910
overflow icon and as we did with a
 

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.120
overflow icon and as we did with a
navigation drawer users can open that

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.130
navigation drawer users can open that
 

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.370
navigation drawer users can open that
drawer at any time by pulling from the

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:44.380
drawer at any time by pulling from the
 

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.490
drawer at any time by pulling from the
bottom edge of the screen in fact we

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:47.500
bottom edge of the screen in fact we
 

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.470
bottom edge of the screen in fact we
found that usability studies that once

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480
found that usability studies that once
 

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.509
found that usability studies that once
users discovered that behavior they

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519
users discovered that behavior they
 

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.220
users discovered that behavior they
don't even wait for the pick stage they

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.230
don't even wait for the pick stage they
 

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.900
don't even wait for the pick stage they
know the drawer is there they just open

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:54.910
know the drawer is there they just open
 

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.500
know the drawer is there they just open
the drawer and perform the actions so

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:58.510
the drawer and perform the actions so
 

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.150
the drawer and perform the actions so
what happens if you have only one action

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160
what happens if you have only one action
 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.569
what happens if you have only one action
in your drawer so if you have only one

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:03.579
in your drawer so if you have only one
 

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:05.190
in your drawer so if you have only one
action you don't need an overflow icon

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200
action you don't need an overflow icon
 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.960
action you don't need an overflow icon
so the overflow icon does help to helps

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:06.970
so the overflow icon does help to helps
 

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.730
so the overflow icon does help to helps
you figure out there's more actions

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:08.740
you figure out there's more actions
 

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.639
you figure out there's more actions
there but we only have one we debated

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:11.649
there but we only have one we debated
 

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.590
there but we only have one we debated
whether we should have like a drawer and

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600
whether we should have like a drawer and
 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.110
whether we should have like a drawer and
just the peak state with a tact icon in

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120
just the peak state with a tact icon in
 

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.290
just the peak state with a tact icon in
it and we found out that sometimes if

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
it and we found out that sometimes if
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.030
it and we found out that sometimes if
you use an icon that users have never

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040
you use an icon that users have never
 

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.310
you use an icon that users have never
seen before it's useful to have a drawer

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320
seen before it's useful to have a drawer
 

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.110
seen before it's useful to have a drawer
with just one action so they I can

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120
with just one action so they I can
 

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.759
with just one action so they I can
actually associate that associate the

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:26.769
actually associate that associate the
 

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:33.569
actually associate that associate the
action with the icon so tapping on the

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:33.579
action with the icon so tapping on the
 

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:35.670
action with the icon so tapping on the
action as you're gonna see an animation

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680
action as you're gonna see an animation
 

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.810
action as you're gonna see an animation
now instead of opening the drawer will

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:39.820
now instead of opening the drawer will
 

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.259
now instead of opening the drawer will
perform the action directly so in this

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:43.269
perform the action directly so in this
 

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:46.350
perform the action directly so in this
case when the user taps on that the

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360
case when the user taps on that the
 

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.930
case when the user taps on that the
action you will just reply he would just

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:48.940
action you will just reply he would just
 

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.800
action you will just reply he would just
reply to the conversation to prevent

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:52.810
reply to the conversation to prevent
 

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.660
reply to the conversation to prevent
unnecessary screen obstruction the

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:54.670
unnecessary screen obstruction the
 

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.980

drawn wearable navigation drawer and
afterwards we'll take a little deeper

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:56.640
afterwards we'll take a little deeper
 

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.280
afterwards we'll take a little deeper
dive and show you how to build some

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.290
dive and show you how to build some
 

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.260
dive and show you how to build some
custom drawers if your application

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:00.270
custom drawers if your application
 

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.790
custom drawers if your application
should be a little more tailored to the

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800
should be a little more tailored to the
 

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.180
should be a little more tailored to the
user experience so wearable drawer

your content this is going to be the
 

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.860
your content this is going to be the
vertically scrolling thing that JP spoke

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:12.870
vertically scrolling thing that JP spoke
 

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.810
vertically scrolling thing that JP spoke
about and within it you're also going to

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820
about and within it you're also going to
 

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.970
about and within it you're also going to
define an action drawer and a wearable

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980
define an action drawer and a wearable
 

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.360

behavior you need to enable nested

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.200
behavior you need to enable nested
 

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
behavior you need to enable nested
scrolling what this does is it allows

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:24.210

the movement that's occurring deeper
 

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.240
the movement that's occurring deeper
within the view hierarchy so that it

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:29.250
within the view hierarchy so that it
 

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.250
within the view hierarchy so that it
knows when to peek for instance when you

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260
knows when to peek for instance when you
 

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.930

want to use that base class and place
your content within it you need to set

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:29.380
your content within it you need to set
 

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.190
your content within it you need to set
layout gravity on the drawer view too so

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200
layout gravity on the drawer view too so
 

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.750
layout gravity on the drawer view too so
it knows whether it exists on the top or

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760
it knows whether it exists on the top or
 

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.820
it knows whether it exists on the top or
bottom of the screen in this example

bottom of the screen in this example
we're using a drawer on the top if the

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.490
we're using a drawer on the top if the
 

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.400
we're using a drawer on the top if the
content within your drawer also Scrolls

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.410
content within your drawer also Scrolls
 

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.140
content within your drawer also Scrolls
you'll need to enable nested scrolling

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.150
you'll need to enable nested scrolling
 

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.060
you'll need to enable nested scrolling
again this just helps wearable drawer

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.070
again this just helps wearable drawer
 

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.380
again this just helps wearable drawer

two methods in wearable drawer view

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:53.980
two methods in wearable drawer view
 

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.790
two methods in wearable drawer view
there's set peek content and set drawer

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:56.800
there's set peek content and set drawer
 

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.040
there's set peek content and set drawer
content and both of these methods take

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.050
content and both of these methods take
 

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.470
content and both of these methods take
Android view arguments and they follow

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480
Android view arguments and they follow
 

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.210
Android view arguments and they follow
all the standard view conventions so you

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:03.220
all the standard view conventions so you
 

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.180
all the standard view conventions so you
can set a click listener on on it on a

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.190
can set a click listener on on it on a
 

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.590
can set a click listener on on it on a
peak State if you want to respond

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600
peak State if you want to respond
 

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.580
peak State if you want to respond
differently in some cases your app may

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:11.590
differently in some cases your app may
 

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.350
differently in some cases your app may
need to respond depending on the drawer

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360
need to respond depending on the drawer
 

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.570
need to respond depending on the drawer
state so you can use a drawer state

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:15.580
state so you can use a drawer state
 

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.130
state so you can use a drawer state
callback which lets you know when a

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:17.140
callback which lets you know when a
 

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.380
callback which lets you know when a
drawer has been opened closed or the

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:19.390
drawer has been opened closed or the
 

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.570
drawer has been opened closed or the
state changes we've also defined a few

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:21.580
state changes we've also defined a few
 

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.250
state changes we've also defined a few
states such as dragging when the user

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.260
states such as dragging when the user
 

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.290
states such as dragging when the user
drags the drawer up and if they let go a
