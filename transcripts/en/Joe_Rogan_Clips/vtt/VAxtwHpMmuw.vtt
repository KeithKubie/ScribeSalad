00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.870
You'd be checking social media constantly and,
and also if you're,
you know,

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:05.280
your controversial like he is,

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.740
a lot of people are talking shit to him and that would hurt his feelings and

4
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.850
saying mean things to them.

5
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.210
And social media has gotten to the point where I'm on it all day and I'm like,

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.420
I'm not having any fun.
No,
it's really gotten to the point where,

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.750
what is this experience?
Facebook is a nightmare.

8
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.430
It's elderly people screaming at each other.

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.820
This was a website where kids were trying to get laid in college.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.670
This is elderly people screaming and complaining.

11
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.690
They can't afford knee operations.
And I'm just going like this all day.
Yeah.

12
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.930
It's,
it's not,
you don't get a lot of bang for your buck.

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.050
I've dropped off radically over the last six months.

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.270
The last six months I've made a giant,

15
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
giant shift away from a reading things and posting things and just,

16
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.980
I like look at it and like for a couple seconds and then I'll put it down.
Um,

17
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.010
or helping our posts.
Yeah,
yeah.
More engaged.
I'm too fucking busy,
you know.

18
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.830
And so what I'm trying to figure out,
ways to better optimize my time.

19
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.860
That was one of the first one.
Stopped reading comments.
Stop reading posts.

20
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.840
Don't just,
just mindlessly shift through Instagram pictures.

21
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.730
Looking for something that strikes me as interesting.

22
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.970
I just stopped doing that and it made a big difference in my productivity.
Yeah,

23
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.700
huge difference.
Yeah.
Cause you know when the,

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.610
when iPhone real recently they started putting that thing on your phone.

25
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:18.420
We see how much screen time you had.
Oh yeah.
It's crazy.
You look at it,

26
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:22.620
you're like,
what,
five hours and hours,
46 minutes.
Just five hours of nothing.

27
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.290
Yeah.
What did I do?
I get a little out of it.
Right?

28
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.220
Like I'll find new stories I can talk about.
But it's like finding,

29
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.050
I found that like finding the perfect blend seems to be letting the stories get

30
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.030
so big that they get to you anyway.
Right now,
rob.
Dot.

31
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.470
The fringe stories that like the Jesse Small age,

32
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.490
it gets so big you can't ignore about it.
Yeah.
And then you hear,

33
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.330
and I love the day that the day when we all found out it was social media was

34
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.060
great today that we all found out he was full of Shit.
Yeah.

35
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.850
Because then if we could make jokes,
but the three days before that,

36
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:56.820
everyone was posturing.
Oh,
so start out.
Right.

37
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.790
But then when it came out that it was all bullshit,
everyone's like,
oh,

38
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:03.300
let's just have fun.
Yeah.
And even though it's,
you know,

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.890
I'm not saying that people aren't getting attacked and things aren't bad,

40
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.760
but this particular thing,
if you can't make a joke about this,

41
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.060
what can you make a joke about?
If you can't make a Joseph,
if you,

42
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200
someone shouldn't joke about this.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Absolutely.

43
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.520
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is one of those things.
So he,
it's fucking ridiculous.

44
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:27.410
Insane.
Holding the subway with the fucking news.
My Sandwich.

45
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.230
He pled not guilty in court.
No,
he did.
Yes he did.
No,
Jamie,

46
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:36.040
he pled not guilty on everything.
Right.
He denied all charges.
Denial.
Oh,

47
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.200
denied all charges.
He's gonna take his own life.
I believe they have the check.

48
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.500
He wrote to them.
He ran check three to five hunch.

49
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.180
He wrote a check already $500 in cash.
He wrote a check.

50
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.150
Now here's the other thing,
I could get punched in five minutes for free.

51
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
I could get beat up so easily.
Why is this guy spending $3,500?
Well,

52
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.520
not only that,
why did he write a check?
Do you have no friends?
So he just,

53
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.230
he didn't think this through even a little bit.
Yeah.
God Damn it.

54
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.630
It's disappointing.
It's kind of funny though.
It's,

55
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.530
there's nothing funny right now.
Well,
I think this is what we need.
You know,

56
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:14.680
we need to understand the outrage machine a little bit better.
Yeah.

57
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:18.130
And one of the best ways to see it as see manufactured outrage.
Absolutely.

58
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.260
And then you go,
oh,
okay,
this is a hustle.
Well,

59
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.040
the cup and tinting was great because people like wishing death on 15 year old

60
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.490
kids and it's like the video comes out exonerates him and then people are like,

61
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.580
no.
Yeah.
People were doubling down.
Yeah.
People were like,

62
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.160
you can't deny with my eyes.
So I'm like,
are you nuts?

63
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.340
And then I was afraid cause I'm like tweeting things and support the kids.

64
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.050
But I'm like,
what if the next video,

65
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
it's just the kids in Klan outfits like this and just dancing around with,

66
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:44.290
with torches like Charlottesville.
And I'm like,

67
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.510
well then now I look like an idiot.
Yeah,
you can't,

68
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.080
you don't know what to tell him.
You're better off being an observer.
Yeah.

69
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.440
Just let it know people get into the fray.
You just,
you make a little choke.

70
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.900
Sit back.
Yeah.
It's like a gang fight.

71
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.440
You better upstairs standing back and going,
hmm,

72
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.090
I don't want to jump in this every,
every day.
Every hour.

73
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:05.140
Another fanish pointed that thing was like,
well no,
maybe they are guilty.
Yeah.

74
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.510
You know,
I saw that thing.
It was like a white kid.

75
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.170
I thought they encircled the native American guy who was banging the drum.

76
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:13.600
And I'm like,
fuck these kids.
Exactly.
That wasn't,
that's not good.

77
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.540
Do you see the first image and you know,
the first image,
which is even crazier,

78
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.250
was put up by a troll account.
Russians.
I don't know who the fuck it was.

79
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.650
Write a know all the problems,
rushing things that came out of Brazil to that,

80
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.020
cause I saw some posts yesterday,

81
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:31.870
but a few shady social media posts fed a viral firestorm over covering and

82
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.740
Catholic.
Oh,
sure.
Why it will happen again.
Yeah.
These co the,

83
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.170
they're doing this on purpose.
The,

84
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.830
they took that screenshot to try and get people angry and it worked.

85
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.980
And then they Twitter found out that it was a bullshit account.

86
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:46.030
They've banned the account.

87
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.230
So it's very possible that account was some troll phone.
No,
it's a troll farm.

88
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.890
Wow.
Yeah.
So that's what they'd say,
whipping manipulated.

89
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:57.190
Now on a level that is like unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

90
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.450
And people were furious.
