00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be good okay so let's
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be good okay so let's
let's<00:00:44.180><c> take</c><00:00:44.330><c> a</c><00:00:44.390><c> step</c><00:00:44.630><c> back</c><00:00:44.860><c> so</c><00:00:45.860><c> if</c><00:00:46.040><c> you</c><00:00:46.250><c> guys</c>

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 align:start position:0%
let's take a step back so if you guys
 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.710 align:start position:0%
let's take a step back so if you guys
seen<00:00:46.550><c> happy</c><00:00:46.760><c> graphs</c><00:00:46.970><c> like</c><00:00:47.120><c> this</c><00:00:47.270><c> before</c><00:00:47.420><c> go</c>

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
seen happy graphs like this before go
 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
seen happy graphs like this before go
ahead<00:00:47.840><c> and</c><00:00:47.960><c> smile</c><00:00:48.470><c> and</c><00:00:48.620><c> not</c><00:00:48.710><c> if</c><00:00:48.800><c> you've</c><00:00:48.890><c> seen</c>

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
see this human error rate is somewhere
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.289 align:start position:0%
see this human error rate is somewhere
between<00:01:30.289><c> five</c><00:01:30.799><c> and</c><00:01:30.829><c> ten</c><00:01:31.159><c> percent</c><00:01:31.460><c> on</c><00:01:31.579><c> this</c>
