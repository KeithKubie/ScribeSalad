00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.600
So the best categorization on mismutation would

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.950
be a missense mutation. And that's because

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.300
the GGC codes for a glycine which

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.550
we said was important in the structural formula

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.510
to get that triple helix. And the change to a TGC changes the glycine to a

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.410
cystine and any amino acid change to another is considered a missense mutation.
