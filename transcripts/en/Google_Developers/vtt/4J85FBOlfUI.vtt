MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.230
I'm Martin Omander and this is
the show Root Access, a show

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.090
on Google Developers Live
about startups.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.660
And I'm joined today by Don
Dodge, startup advocate,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.750
longtime investor.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.400
So Don, we did a show a couple
of weeks ago about ownership

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.590
structure of your startup.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.570
And we got a really interesting
question from

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.430
Anthony Kelly.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.150
Thank you, Anthony, for
sending us a question.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.410
He asked, what are some of the
Do's and Don'ts for attracting

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.270
investors and getting the
investors signed up?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.300
And what are some of the
mistakes you've seen, and what

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.940
are some the right
ways of doing it?

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.300
DON DODGE: Well, you
need to choose

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.970
your investors carefully.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.130
Sometimes companies are so
desperate for startup capital

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.440
that they'll take money
from anyone who comes

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410
at almost any terms.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.390
And you do what you have
to do, obviously.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.519
But there are some things
you need to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.260
do to protect yourself.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.790
So when you take money from an
investor you need to be very

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.760
clear up front about what your
long term vision is.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.240
So, is this going to be a 12
months and we sell it and flip

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
it kind of business, or is this
going to be a five year

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.110
kind of growth and
development and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.280
building users and revenues?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.740
And what kind of expectations
do they have?

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.430
So if you're clear with those
kinds of expectations up front

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.120
it makes it a lot easier
down the line.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.560
So that's the first thing.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.780
The second is to just think
about the ownership structure.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.920
Is it common stock?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.230
Is it a convertible note?

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.080
Is it preferred stock?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.450
So those are fairly
generic terms.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.730
What they mean is, common stock
is just regular stock

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.190
that employees get.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.639
So employees, when they get
employee stock options,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.740
they're getting common stock.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.960
Investors, VC investors,
when they invest they

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.510
get preferred stock.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.970
Preferred means that it has
preferences over the common

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.950
stockholders, typically in
doomsday scenarios, like when

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.440
you're shutting down the
company, or when the company

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.580
is being acquired, or those
sorts of things.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.590
They might have preferences.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.320
MARTIN OMANDER: So,
do they get paid

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.840
first if it shuts down?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.180
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.540
MARTIN OMANDER: With the--

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.150
DON DODGE: So, preferred--

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.420
MARTIN OMANDER: --assets.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.080
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.500
Preferred means that they
get paid first.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.380
They get preference.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.270
And if there's any money left
over, it goes to the common

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.040
shareholders.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.450
So that's fairly typical.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.860
There are also convertible
notes, which have become

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.250
fairly popular recently.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.130
Convertible notes means that
it's a loan that converts to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.270
stock when you raise
your next round.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.370
So it's an easy way
to raise money.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.510
From a legal point of view,
it can be a one

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.810
page or two page document.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.090
It's very inexpensive to do.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.980
And it just lays out, here's
the money that

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.460
you're putting in.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.540
It will convert to common stock
or preferred stock at

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.060
the next round, when you
raise your next round.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.100
And typically it
has a discount.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.690
So you might have a 20%
discount, where you put your

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.060
money in, and then some time
later, when you raise money

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.710
for a VC, if that valuation is,
let's say $5 million, and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.040
you have a 20% discount,
then your money

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.120
goes in at $4 million.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.660
Because that's the 20% discount
off the five.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.080
So it typically has
a discount.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.320
Or it might have cap, meaning
that you put your money in at

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.640
a cap of $4 million, and if this
takes off like a rocket

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.870
and you raise money at $10
million, your money goes in at

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.660
the cap of $4 million.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.240
So, in essence you get 2 and
1/2 times your money right

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.780
away from the first round.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.680
So it's those kinds of things
to look at with investors.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.260
There are some other nuances
that are only an issue when

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.070
things go wrong.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.980
But when they do go wrong,
you need to make

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.190
sure that your protected.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.770
And that's where you have to
get a lawyer and really

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.760
understand what each of
those provisions say.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.250
MARTIN OMANDER: So, you need
the lawyer up front.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.960
Then, when you get investors--

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.120
just so that you have the
convertible note, or whatever,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.970
set up correctly.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.550
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.610
Lawyers do this every day.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.280
So they know what provisions
to put in there.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.160
Startup entrepreneurs
do it once in

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.670
their life, maybe twice.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.120
So, it looks fairly simple, but
there can be some catches.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.560
So it's always good to have
a lawyer who has done this

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.550
multiple times to set up the
initial documents for you.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.920
MARTIN OMANDER: Very good.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.050
In a similar vein, are
there Do's and Don'ts

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.230
about bringing founders--

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.170
co-founders on board?

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.340
DON DODGE: Yes, absolutely.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.660
And it's a different set of
issues, equally important.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.820
Maybe even more important.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.690
MARTIN OMANDER: Uh huh.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.210
DON DODGE: So, you need
to have they the same

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.380
understanding with
your founders--

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.250
your co-founders--

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.580
that you do with
your investors.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.530
Meaning, here's what we're
going to try to do.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.420
Here is how long it's going
to take to get there.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.810
Here are the roles and
responsibilities that each of

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.360
us are going to have.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.230
Here's what we're going to
contribute to the company.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.940
Here's how we'll divide
up the founder shares.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.690
If you have three founders,
it's not necessarily

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.960
33% for each one.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.440
It could be that there's one
founder who, they are the

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.210
technical genius and the vision
of the company, and

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.570
they get 50% or 60%.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.340
And the other two founders
split the remaining 40%.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.780
But you need to be very clear
about that up front.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.170
Second thing is, you need to
have employment agreements and

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.560
IP assignment rights.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.050
Sounds kind of strange
to do that when

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.150
there's only two or three--

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.415
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:09.170
Only two guys.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.080
What's could happen?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.120
DON DODGE: A lot could happen.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.330
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.610
DON DODGE: If you don't have
the IP assignments and

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.610
employment contracts, then they
are free to leave the

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.120
company at any time and take
their ideas with them.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.600
So that's pretty dangerous
for an investor.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.210
If an investor comes in and
says, OK, you've got an idea

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.120
and you've built it, and you
have three employees.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.030
What happens if one of your
co-founders leaves?

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.430
And they can leave
with the idea and

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.900
start another company.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.520
They're going to want employment
contracts, IP

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.630
assignment rights, and maybe
in some states non-compete

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.630
agreements.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.260
Those don't work in California,
but there's

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.090
non-compete agreements that
say that if you leave the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.490
company, you can't do exactly
the same thing at another

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.980
company for some
period of time.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.720
So there's a variety of issues
that you need to face with

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.120
your co-founders very early on
that are setting expectations

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.040
and protecting the company in
case you leave, or protecting

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.890
the technology.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.410
And again, a good startup lawyer
can take you through

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.540
this in an hour or so and just
make sure you're protected.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.200
MARTIN OMANDER: So, lawyer early
on to help with that

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.100
piece as well.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.420
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.040
You need a lawyer
for both pieces.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.540
MARTIN OMANDER: Both pieces.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.040
DON DODGE: To set up the
company, to set up the

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.190
agreements with your
co-founders, and also to set

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
up the financing documents
with early investors.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.850
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.110
Thank you very much, Don.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.370
DON DODGE: Thank you.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.270
MARTIN OMANDER: I'm a
developer as well.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.640
And when I do development,
I love to do it on

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.070
Google Cloud Platform.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.460
It makes all management of your
application much easier.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.700
You don't have to deal with
individual servers going up

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.220
and down and things like that.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.810
Google takes care of all that.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.280
We have a special offer for
you, Root Access viewers.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.990
You can get a $2,000 credit
to start building your

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.210
application on the Google
Cloud Platform.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.390
And you'll see the details
on screen.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.440
And while you're trying that
out, in the meantime, I hope

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.895
to see at the next show.

00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:12.030
And keep those comments
coming on YouTube.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.620
We'll pick them up and deal with
them in future episodes.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.450
Thank you.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.700
Bye.
