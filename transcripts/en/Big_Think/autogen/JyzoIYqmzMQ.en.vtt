00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.069
When you start talking about hope some people
think it’s immediately a kind of Pollyanna-ish

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.069
thing.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.840
Like: “Oh, I should be hopeful,” or it’s
kind of a greeting card sentiment.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.560
You go kind of doe-eyed and start thinking
soft thoughts about how we should all be hopeful

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.560
in one another.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.360
And, of course, there are some important things
to be said in favor of those kinds of things,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:31.430
but we think of hope as also an extremely
difficult and important and foundational sort

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.339
of state that can be discussed in ways that
aren’t so saccharine.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.340
One of the interesting things that philosophers
talk about with respect to hope is, of course,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.600
its rationality.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.179
So there’s a sense in which you can’t
hope for everything.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.719
You can wish for lots of things for which
you can’t hope.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.749
I can wish that the Bears won the Super Bowl
last year, but I can’t hope that they won

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.149
the Super Bowl last year because we know that
they didn’t.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.269
And so it seems almost like you’re misusing
the word to say, “I hope that they won last

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.269
year.”

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.160
Or, “I hope that the weather was different
yesterday than it was.”

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.770
So there’s a kind of semantic content that
suggests that there are rationality constraints

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.920
on hope which philosophers try to look at
and analyze.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.670
There’s a kind of orthodox account—people
call it the orthodox account because most

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.450
people share it—that says that hope involves
at least desiring something and believing

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.870
that it’s possible.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.860
So in this case you wouldn’t believe that
the weather yesterday could be different than

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.250
it was and so you wouldn’t believe that’s
possible, and so you can’t really hope for

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.250
it.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.070
So that’s that condition that’s constraining
the rationality of hope.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.950
And then there’s this kind of debate about
what further conditions might be required.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.470
One thought experiment that people have discussed
frequently is that of 'The Shawshank Redemption'.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.870
So this is a Stephen King short story that
was turned into a film.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.780
You have two characters, Andy and Red.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.390
Both of them really desire something: to get
out of prison.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.330
Both of them regard it as possible, it’s
explicit in the story and in the film, but

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.569
somehow one character, Andy, is hopeful and
says he’s hopeful and that he’s acting

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.139
in such a way as to make it come about even
if he thinks it’s extremely unlikely.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.580
And the other character, Red, says he can’t
allow himself to hope.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.150
The fear of disappointment is too great and
will crush him.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.340
So they both meet those conditions.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.540
It’s something they really desire and it’s
something they believe to be possible, and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.010
yet one hopes and the other despairs.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.909
So cases like this make people think we need
some other kind of condition to really explain

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.519
the difference between hope and despair.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.939
And that’s where some of the debate is at
the moment, trying to find this elusive third

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:48.939
condition.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.689
And different people have different things
they want to add to the orthodox conception.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.029
My own favored approach, which I’m in the
middle of writing up, is what I call the focus

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.769
or attention account of hope.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.219
So it basically says something like the difference
between hope and despair is the extent to

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:13.060
which you’re focusing on the very slim odds
of the thing coming about or whether you’re

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.290
focusing on the fact that it’s possible—or
that you take it to be possible.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.180
So if you’re focused on the thing as a possibility,
under the aspect of its possibility, if you

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.099
want, then you’re hoping for it.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.980
If you’re focusing on the fact that it’s
incredibly unlikely and the odds are such

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.900
long-shot odds then you’re despairing of
it.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.529
So you can desire it in the same way.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.370
You can believe that it’s possible in the
same way.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.680
And it’s this focus that really makes the
difference between hope and despair.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.730
It might even be a kind of spectrum thing
where you can move back and forth.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.559
The focus might be under your control sometimes,
other times given the circumstances or the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.299
strength and the desire it might not always
be under your control.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.299
So I also kind of talk a little bit about
the way a certain kind of mindfulness training

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:05.349
could lead us to be more hopeful people, cultivating
the virtue of hope by learning how to focus

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.900
on something under the aspect of its possibility
rather than allowing our focus or attention

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.920
to always drift towards the fact that it’s
so unlikely.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.739
You can even hear this in the way that someone
might say something about what they hope for

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.830
or despair of.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:29.050
So in the Andy and Red case, Andy might say,
“I know that it’s really unlikely but

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.190
at least it’s possible,” and sort of focus
on the possibility.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.840
That’s the hopeful sort of approach.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.010
And Red might say, “I know that it’s possible,
but it’s really unlikely.”

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.610
Same desire, same estimation of the probabilities
but you can even hear in the way it’s stated

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.250
a kind of difference in attitude that I take
to be the essential difference between hope

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.370
and despair.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:59.340
So one more locus of discussion is the relationship
between hope, optimism, and action.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.520
I think a lot of people regard hope in a way
as unserious because it gets detached from

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.650
action in a certain way.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.310
So hope is something that you do when you
can’t do anything else.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.570
It’s the kind of curse that is left in Pandora’s
box, because you still have it even though

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.330
there’s nothing else you can do with respect
to achieving the goal in question.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.320
“I’m just hoping for it.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.590
It seems possible but there’s not much I
can do.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.680
I’m just sort of passively hoping.”

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.100
That obviously seems like a bit of a character
of the way in which hope might actually work.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.360
And so we’re curious, and people in both
psychology and sociology, other social sciences

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.980
as well as philosophers and religious studies
people, in our project, think about the way

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.150
in which hope underwrites action, hope manifests
itself in action, hope is the result of action.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.669
So agency and hope is a really interesting
set of issues that we think is underdeveloped.
