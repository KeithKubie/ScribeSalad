00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.440
our way are essential to our existence
for example how can we know we are in

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
for example how can we know we are in
 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.750
for example how can we know we are in
the square in front of the concert hall

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760

in Stockholm and how can we know how can
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.650
in Stockholm and how can we know how can
we find our way from the concert hall to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
we find our way from the concert hall to
 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.770
we find our way from the concert hall to
another place in the city for example

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
another place in the city for example
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.089
another place in the city for example
the city hall and how can we store this

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099
the city hall and how can we store this
 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.789
the city hall and how can we store this
information so we can find our way the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799
information so we can find our way the
 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.990
information so we can find our way the
next time we take the same path these

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
next time we take the same path these
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.540
next time we take the same path these
abilities are governed by activity in

similar to the previous question we had
 

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:41.880
similar to the previous question we had
in Swedish but it's very clear that

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:41.890
in Swedish but it's very clear that
 

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.310
in Swedish but it's very clear that
there are many processes in the brain

there are many processes in the brain
 

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.070
there are many processes in the brain
and this is one function one process

will disturb these circuits so you will
 

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.790
will disturb these circuits so you will
have an impaired function so we are on a

Verity based on this more questions

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100
 

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.420
appear please

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:44.430
 

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.280
question is are the gender differences

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.290
question is are the gender differences
 

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:54.680
question is are the gender differences
in the positioning system of the brain I

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:54.690
 

00:16:54.690 --> 00:17:04.140
don't know I think that I don't even

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:04.150
don't know I think that I don't even
 

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.320
don't know I think that I don't even
know but I think that the experiments in

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.330
know but I think that the experiments in
 

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.300
know but I think that the experiments in
rats weren't done in both male and

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:09.310
rats weren't done in both male and
 

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:14.090
rats weren't done in both male and
female rats I think is that what you are

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100
female rats I think is that what you are
 

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:21.270
female rats I think is that what you are
aiming so this is just we don't know

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280
