the reason I put so much time and effort

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480
the reason I put so much time and effort
 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.089
the reason I put so much time and effort
into creating Tesla was because it it

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
into creating Tesla was because it it
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.629
into creating Tesla was because it it
seemed to me that the transportation

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
seemed to me that the transportation
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849
seemed to me that the transportation
will go electric and should go electric

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
will go electric and should go electric
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950
will go electric and should go electric
but we have a nun priced externality in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
but we have a nun priced externality in
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.910
but we have a nun priced externality in
the negative effects of of gasoline and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920
the negative effects of of gasoline and
 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.920
the negative effects of of gasoline and
on the environment and also in the you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
on the environment and also in the you
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.859
on the environment and also in the you
know the wars that we fight and national

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
know the wars that we fight and national
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810
know the wars that we fight and national
security and that kind of thing whenever

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
security and that kind of thing whenever
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.160
security and that kind of thing whenever
you have a nun price externality you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
you have a nun price externality you
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319
you have a nun price externality you
can't quite review can quite rely on the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
can't quite review can quite rely on the
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.049
can't quite review can quite rely on the
market to to do the right thing so in

market to to do the right thing so in
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.750

order to have electric vehicles come

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
order to have electric vehicles come
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400
order to have electric vehicles come
sooner than the otherwise would really

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
sooner than the otherwise would really
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.860
sooner than the otherwise would really
electric vehicles were always going to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
electric vehicles were always going to
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229
electric vehicles were always going to
be the long-term transportation

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
be the long-term transportation
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.350
be the long-term transportation
mechanism but to make that day come

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
mechanism but to make that day come
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.970

you have to bridge the gap with

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
you have to bridge the gap with
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720
you have to bridge the gap with
innovation that was the goal with Tesla

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
innovation that was the goal with Tesla
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760
innovation that was the goal with Tesla
is to try to serve as a catalyst to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
is to try to serve as a catalyst to
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.070
is to try to serve as a catalyst to
accelerate the day the day of electric

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
accelerate the day the day of electric
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.660
accelerate the day the day of electric
vehicles and and I I think when all said

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
vehicles and and I I think when all said
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969
vehicles and and I I think when all said
and done I'm hopeful that historians

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
and done I'm hopeful that historians
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530
and done I'm hopeful that historians
will look back on Tesla and say the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
will look back on Tesla and say the
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.420
will look back on Tesla and say the
Tesla advanced that by at least ten

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
Tesla advanced that by at least ten
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249
Tesla advanced that by at least ten
years which that would be a huge victory

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
years which that would be a huge victory
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010
years which that would be a huge victory
in my in my mind the Solar City of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
in my in my mind the Solar City of
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920
in my in my mind the Solar City of
course is on the soul it is on the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
course is on the soul it is on the
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.580
course is on the soul it is on the
energy production side of things because

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
energy production side of things because
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.780
energy production side of things because
it doesn't help if we have sustainable

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
it doesn't help if we have sustainable
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550
it doesn't help if we have sustainable
consumption of energy but but then that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
consumption of energy but but then that
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.319
consumption of energy but but then that
energy isn't produced in a sustainable

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
energy isn't produced in a sustainable
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.499
energy isn't produced in a sustainable
way and I feel quite strongly that solar

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
way and I feel quite strongly that solar
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.819
way and I feel quite strongly that solar
power will be the single largest source

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
power will be the single largest source
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.819
power will be the single largest source
of of electricity generation by the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
of of electricity generation by the
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.940
of of electricity generation by the
midpoint of the century infected just a

simple extrapolation of the growth of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
simple extrapolation of the growth of
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120
simple extrapolation of the growth of
solar power would show that that's

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
solar power would show that that's
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130
solar power would show that that's
obviously going to be the case and also

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
obviously going to be the case and also
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.359
obviously going to be the case and also
when you consider that the earth is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
when you consider that the earth is
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429
when you consider that the earth is
almost entirely solar-powered today and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
almost entirely solar-powered today and
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.249
almost entirely solar-powered today and
that the the fact that we're not a

that the the fact that we're not a
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.889
that the the fact that we're not a
frozen ice ball at say 4 degrees Kelvin

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899
frozen ice ball at say 4 degrees Kelvin
 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.120
frozen ice ball at say 4 degrees Kelvin
and it is just due to the Sun and the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
and it is just due to the Sun and the
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950

whole ecosystem is powered by the Sun

there's just an any bitty amount of
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.680
there's just an any bitty amount of
energy that we need to do complicated

energy that we need to do complicated
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750
energy that we need to do complicated
human things this is a tiny

out of energy really compared to what

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379
out of energy really compared to what
 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.280
out of energy really compared to what
the Sun puts on the earth every day and

the Sun puts on the earth every day and

the Sun puts on the earth every day and
we just need to capture a little bit of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370
we just need to capture a little bit of
 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.929
we just need to capture a little bit of
that and turn it into electricity so we

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939
that and turn it into electricity so we
 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.640
that and turn it into electricity so we
have to try to accelerate that with

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
have to try to accelerate that with
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410
have to try to accelerate that with
innovation that's what solar studies

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
innovation that's what solar studies
