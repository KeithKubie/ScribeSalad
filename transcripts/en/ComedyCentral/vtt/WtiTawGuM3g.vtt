00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.434
I figured since women can paint
their boobs

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:04.136
and show them on Instagram,

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:06.072
I should be able to paint
my dick and do whatever I want.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.406
True.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:11.945
So, put together this cyclist
suit with fucking ...

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.982
The spandex shirt, the ten
speed bike, and the helmet,

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:18.151
and we just painted
on the shorts.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.719
Just straight black paint.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.787
So, I can go cruising around
riding this bicycle

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.089
and crashing it
in front of people,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.323
and they're like,
"Oh, are you okay?"

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.725
They reach out their hand
to lift me up

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.427
and I've just got
my schlong fucking like that.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.630
So, we got me all decked out.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.366
The costume just looked
fucking hilarious.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.169
And I took a photo,
hoisting up the bike.

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:40.473
I text this photo to Knoxville,
and he writes back,

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.875
"That's the smallest black dick
I've ever seen."

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.846
That's what's so funny about
those, when the girls do that.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.315
They paint on jeans, and will
anybody notice in a store

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.650
if a girl's pussy
and asshole are out?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.721
And it's always at first, look,
no one notices.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.121
By the second store
they always notice,

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:58.357
because their pussy
and asshole look like

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.593
The Ultimate Warrior's face
at the end of WrestleMania.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.128
Oh yeah, it's like
cracked and losing.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.829
Oh yeah.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:05.899
Just covered in sweat.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.802
Was your asshole in a cage match
with the Natural Disasters?

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.540
We have a video
that we want to watch of ...

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.276
Do you know who Lil Boosie is?
He's a rapper?

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.978
Oh, it sounds a little familiar.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.581
I heard the name before.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.582
I don't know who he is,
but on WorldStarHipHop today

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:26.785
they had a video of him,
I guess-

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.788
Is that something you frequent
pretty regularly?

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.356
It's his news source.
First thing every day.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.624
That's where you get
your news from?

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.159
It's my CNN, man.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.694
I'm pretty sure I could plant
information on WorldStarHipHop

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:38.097
that Jay would believe is news
if I got it on there.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.166
If you put it on...

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.401
The only footage I've ever
watched of Donald Trump

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.304
is when I clicked a video
that says,

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.239
"Donald Trump
fucking up again.

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:50.243
Shake...
SMH."

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.645
Jay needs super
hood introductions

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.446
to all of his news stories
or he goes,

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.450
"Oh man, Saudi Arabia
popping off at the mouth.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.418
You ain't even going to believe
what they did."

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.020
And he's like, "Do you know
they killed a journalist?"

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.389
Obama going ham on Syria.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.893
Most of Jay's knowledge
comes like that.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.498
How far these fans are willing
to go to get your attention.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.899
This made me laugh because...

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.034
I don't know if I would
normally click this,

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.570
except it was in
the uncensored part,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.707
so I'm like,
what is this girl going to do?

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.442
She got fake lips, right?

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.979
I mean, yeah, but this is great.
Lil Boosie's a rapper.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.384
He's talking on Instagram Live
to this girl, and he just...

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.319
Everything about her voice ...

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.054
A white girl
with a hip-hop thing,

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.557
and then revealing her body,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.092
this hilarious sort of weird
mom body she has,

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:41.294
[crosstalk 00:02:41]

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:42.662
Can I guess on the voice?

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.963
The stuff he's saying,
it's just great.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.364
Can I guess on the voice
before we see it?

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:48.100
Is she going to be like this?
"My pussy's so good."

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.735
Sort of. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Sort of.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:50.970
"It's so good."

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.305
She goes [crosstalk 00:02:51]

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.240
"Oh you already know.
You already know."

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.208
And she go, "Oh yeah, no,
this pussy what's up."

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.879
And then this dude going,
"Darlene! Darlene!

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.481
The fucking Camry
is blocking me."

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.417
Yeah, I'm telling you-

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.785
Am I not wrong?
I know white trash.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.954
It's more ...

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.623
I think it's definitely
Southern white garbage for sure.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.792
I'll take our temperature.
We've all better-

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.062
And if you get ...
all the new backpacks I have.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.597
Wow.

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:19.898
Hook me up. I messaged you,
so if you could message me back.

00:03:19.898 --> 00:03:21.434
Hell, when you was down here
back in Atlanta

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.634
the police kept
running us off till-

00:03:22.634 --> 00:03:23.836
Oh, she is fucking Southern.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.304
She sounds like
Danielle Bregoli.

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.805
I had two pictures of your mama
and you and your sister-

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.307
Wait, pause it, by the way?

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:30.309
I want you to pay attention for
some key words here she says.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.245
She sounds like Boomhauer
from fucking King of the Hill.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.347
Yes, she says something-
[inaudible]

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:40.453
Come now [inaudible 0
She gon' [inaudible]

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.255
I was trying to reach you.
Come on [inaudible].

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.090
I'll have you know
that Danielle Bregoli-

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.291
Yes?
Yes?

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:46.726
... the cash me outside chick-

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.227
Oh, yeah?
... is my neighbor.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:49.495
Really? What?

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.829
Come on come on, dude.
Danielle Bregoli?

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.198
No shit.
Yeah.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.932
Can you put in a good word
for us? We love her.

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:55.601
Dude, we've-
We went 180 on her.

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.170
I still haven't talked to her,
and-

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.973
You've never caught her outside?

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:07.813
That was perfect.

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.015
That was really good.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.483
I know.
I love you, Jay.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:13.385
I mean, sometimes just fucking
preparation meets opportunity,

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:14.653
and you just fucking-

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.155
You opened the window.
I just jumped through.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.790
Watching that home run leave
the park,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.727
and I was like, "That's
my friend. That's my friend."

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:25.531
That's so good. We've driven
past her a bunch of times.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.567
I've never had the nerve
to get out and introduce myself.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.037
You could ... There's a good
tie in to Theo Von.

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.271
You know Theo?
Sure.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.473
He was just in her last video,

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.909
as a pedophile that she brands
on his forehead.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.344
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.645
Did a great job.

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:41.514
Well, we love her.
I've gone 180 on ...

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.183
We came out first thing,
what a horrible thing

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.285
it was that this young girl's
acting like this,

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:47.987
and she never actually ...

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.355
Then society just made her
a bazillionaire,

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:52.124
and then I'm like, fuck it,
I'm steering into it.

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.325
I like her now.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:54.827
Yeah.
Dude, it's crazy, man.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:58.164
She's selling out
large venues every time.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:00.533
As someone that just did
a very half-sold

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.237
Albany Funny Bone,
I'll tell you, that stings.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.542
No one wants to catch me inside,
let alone fucking anywhere.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:10.810
They don't want to watch-

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.111
And then the staff tells you,
goes,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.612
"That wasn't your fault, dude."

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.414
He goes, "You're competing
with Bregoli this week."

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:17.583
He goes, "Oh, dude,
Cash Me Outside's in town."

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:18.884
Bhad Bhabie's in town.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:20.786
Bhad Bhabie.
Bhad Bhabie.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:23.389
Also, there's a giveaway
at a Toyota ...

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.923
There's a Toyotathon going on.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:26.792
There's Theo.
There's also a Toyotathon?

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.328
I used to get the worst ones.
He goes, "Oh, man, I'm sorry

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.730
there's nobody here this weekend
for any of the shows."

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.332
And they go, "No, it's fine,

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.267
there's the pumpkin festival's
this weekend in town."

00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:36.969
Yeah, they always have some-

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.771
"Oh, dude, you're dealing with
Honda's Deal Days of Summer."

00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:42.141
You go, "It's December."
And they go ...

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.343
He starts asking her about
if things are real,

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.212
and one of the things she says
are real are her eyes.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.513
What?

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.215
She goes, "My eyes real, too.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.882
People be asking that
all the time."

00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:52.117
[inaudible 00:05:51].

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.318
[inaudible 00:05:52].

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:54.620
She goes ...
[inaudible 00:05:54]

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.223
"A lot of people think
I have glass eyes, but-"

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.293
To this girl, this is her shot
at the big time.

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:02.895
This is her fucking ...
This is it.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.864
She gained audience
with Lil Boosie.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.900
Yeah. You want to sit down
with the Lil Boosie?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.168
I don't even know ...

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.636
Am I saying his name right?
Boosie?

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:12.037
Boosie, I think.
Yeah, Lil Boosie.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:13.339
Well, let's see where this goes.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.708
He is ... This is just
another Tuesday for him.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.243
... because I have
my kids and stuff,

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:18.678
and I sent them to you,

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.713
but I don't know if you ever
got them or whatever,

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.982
but it's ...
Be for real, man.

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.017
[inaudible 00:06:23].
Send me some-

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.252
What are we watching?

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:27.453
I don't know.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:28.687
Instagram Live.

00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:30.689
I think this is a murder video.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.793
A wacky white girl has somehow
got Lil Boosie

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.528
to just take her ...

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.196
On Instagram Live,
when you're on Instagram Live,

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.764
it ... can people-
You can split windows and stuff.

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:40.132
Can you? I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:41.200
I think you can. I don't know.
I don't know.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.568
That's what's happening here.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.270
So this is like a direct person
that he accepted,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.375
and I think it's a naked,
odd white woman who ...

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.543
I like when they talk to you,
also ...

00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:53.012
Not to you, but to this guy.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:56.282
When they talk to celebrities
like that, just that, he goes,

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.916
"Did you get I dunno
if you got it.

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:01.887
I sent you a box of my hair
last month. Did you get that?"

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.123
"I sent in you toenails
for the past six months.

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.391
Were you gettin'
my envelope a' toenails?"

00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:07.626
So Lil' Boosie's on top.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:10.029
He's a I guess
a well known rapper

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.932
and the girl underneath
is a fan who got his attention.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.835
He is nonchalantly asking her
to do weird things.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:18.504
She is like "oh yeah is
that what you want?

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:20.639
Okay" and she starts doing it.
It gets bizarre.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.941
Do you think she gets naked

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.442
before the call
or during the call?

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.743
But, she naked already.
That's what I am saying.

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:25.944
She's currently naked.

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:27.246
Does she put the phone down

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.115
and she goes
"Naw I'm still here hold on."

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.218
So Worldstar just goes ahead
and shows everything?

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.386
Well they let you know
it's not safe for work.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:35.654
Oh, gotcha
But,

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:37.255
It its all safe for.

00:07:37.255 --> 00:07:39.558
When I'm taking a shit when I am
watching it on my laptop.

00:07:39.558 --> 00:07:41.360

"Okay I'll see you
when I'm there okay."

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.530
I think Worldstar could
have done

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.765
a little bit of editing on that.

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.033
Yes, I completely agree
with you.

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.201

They could've gone

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.602
I'll tell you what.

00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:52.004
To me that's like
Appetite for Destruction.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.272
The whole things perfect.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.207
Everything's necessary

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.276
I don't like Paradise City
on it's own.

00:12:58.276 --> 00:13:00.378
But you take it out of Appetite
for Destruction?

00:13:00.378 --> 00:13:01.613
You gotta leave it in there.

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:02.881
It all builds.

00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:04.783
You don't watch parts
of the Godfather.

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.020
Ah that's just fucking,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.222

Errybody ask all the time "

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.162
But, no one did ask.

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:18.364
No one asked that day.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.499
Her narrator.
"No one ever asked

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.568
to see her eyes
it was always her butt hole."

00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:25.337
You want to take
our last break?

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:26.938
"Her pussy like butt hole."

00:13:26.938 --> 00:13:29.607
We will take our last break
we're hanging out with Steve-O.

00:13:29.607 --> 00:13:31.576
We think we found her or we hear
we did find her.

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:32.844
We found her.

The internet is an amazing place
that you can just find a girl

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:43.988
who show'd a rapper
her butt hole on Worldstar.

00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:46.525
She's sucking her finger
that's her trait.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.026
That's a technique.

00:13:48.026 --> 00:13:50.462
"This so y'all know my pussy
and butt hole clean.

00:13:51.229 --> 00:13:52.464
I keep it clean"

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:53.899
It'd be great if she went
to do it

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.667
and just winced once
without knowing it.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:58.670
