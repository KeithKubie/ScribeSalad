00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.550
CHRIS: All right.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.530
Good afternoon everybody.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.384
Can you hear me OK?

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:05.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.490
CHRIS: Excellent.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.330
All right.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.870
I'm here today to introduce
Aaron Gross who founded Farm

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.750
Forward in 2006 as an
organization entirely devoted

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.290
to ending factory farming and
creating humane, sustainable,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.080
and just alternatives to it.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.980
He collaborated heavily with
Jonathan Safran Foer on Foer's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.350
bestselling "Eating
Animals" in 2009.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.220
Foer also spoke at Google,
I believe, about

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.050
a year or two ago.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.450
So you may remember that talk.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200
He's currently working with
Jonathan and Natalie Portman

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.880
and director Christopher Quinn
to transform the book into a

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.430
feature length documentary.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.340
Gross serves as Farm Forward
CEO and is professor of

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.860
theology and religious
studies at the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.540
University of San Diego.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.300
He recently published "Animals
in the Human Imagination," a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.400
companion to "Animal Studies."

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.870
And just so you know, there'll
be time at the end of the talk

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.530
for questions.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.090
So please save your questions
for then.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.870
And we appreciate
you all coming.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.460
Without further ado, help
me welcome Aaron Gross.

00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:07.600
AARON GROSS: Well, thanks.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.830
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.880
It's really good to be here and
really good to talk about

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.210
these issues and nice to have
a good crowd like this.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.930
So my name is Aaron Gross.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260
As Chris was telling you, I
started this organization

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.290
called Farm Forward about
five years ago.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.450
And there's two big things that
Farm Forward works on.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.430
One is we try to work on the
kind of supply-side end of the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.300
problem of factory farming,
changing what's available,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.890
working with producers to try
to create more humane and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.220
sustainable farms.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.620
And there our work
really centers

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.000
on the poultry industry.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.530
And I'm gonna in most of this
talk center on the poultry

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.230
industry for reasons that
will become clear.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.150
The other end of our work
is consumer focused.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.000
And that's really in some ways
what I'm doing right now,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.290
doing educational outreach in a
whole variety of ways to get

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.550
people more knowledgeable about
what this thing is we

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.440
call factory farming and how
we can respond to it.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.410
Because we really live in a
world that's changed radically

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.160
in a very short period of time
when it comes to food.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.230
I mean, we're getting used
to very rapid change.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.910
Certainly in this building
you've got to be.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.580
But with farming, there's a
lot of important knowledge

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.919
that in a previous generation
might have been passed on to

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.130
us through our parents,
through grandparents.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.680
And today, what our parents and
grandparents might know

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.330
about farming is just irrelevant
to what's going on.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.800
It really changes
that quickly.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.190
And so I'm gonna try to fill
some of those gaps.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.590
I have to say, I had a bit of
fun with my title, "Robot

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.910
Chickens and Virtual Farms."
Probably with such a serious

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.030
topic, I shouldn't
have so much fun.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.810
But really, each one of the kind
of images here-- that is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.620
the image of the robot chicken,
the image of the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.280
virtual farm, the image
of pink slime--

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.190
really does help kind of set
up what I want to do.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.580
We do, I think, live in the age
of pink slime, that is,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.270
the pink slime controversy.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.050
People familiar with pink
slime controversy?

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.730
For those who aren't, it looks
like kind of pink soft-serve

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.910
ice cream, but it's actually
a beef product.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.540
And it's kind of seen as pretty

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.130
disgusting by consumers.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.030
It's not really the problem I
want to focus on, but this was

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.190
a big recent controversy.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.620
And ABC showed that this pink
slime stuff wasn't just kind

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.930
of occasionally used
here and there.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
But in about 70% of the ground
beef in supermarkets there was

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.110
this substance pink slime.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.560
And why I think this is kind of
an image of the age is it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.000
was there all along for more
than a decade and we didn't

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.810
know it, even though it was
something with us every day.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.270
And that really is the kind of
situation we're facing in

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.910
trying to understand
factory farming.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.010
And we don't have cybernetic
chickens yet.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.760
That is true.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.420
But we do have transgenic
chickens, chickens that have a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.750
human-created gene snipped
from a virus and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.980
inserted into a chicken.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.560
That's already a done deal.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.600
Those same scientists who are
in Edinburgh at the Roslin

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.410
Institute, where Dolly the sheep
was created, are now

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.870
working on putting a mouse
gene into a chicken.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.830
So the image of a cybernetic
chicken isn't actually that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.340
far off from what we're
actually doing.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.730
Chickens may not come to mind
when we think high tech, but

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.990
chickens are pretty
high tech today.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.730
And what I mean by the
virtual farm is this.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.690
In a certain sense, all of
us here are farmers.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.870
We're virtual farmers.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.710
What we decide to eat, the
decisions we make, go through

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.505
a chain and tell farmers what
they're gonna make.

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:16.365
And we really have tremendous
influence that way.

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:19.079
Wendell Berry, an interesting
person in the broader movement

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.800
of kind of reflecting on
food, he's kind of the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.770
quintessential farmer
intellectual.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.940
He has this famous statement--

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.630
or famous within foodie
circles-- which is we're all

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.820
farmers by proxy.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.200
I think it's a powerful idea
that what we choose to eat

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.090
ends up dictating what
gets farmed.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.830
So, with that as an
introduction, I want to have

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.250
one little piece to kind of
complicate the social justice

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.440
issues and so forth associated
with food which is that when

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.970
we talk about food, we're
never talking

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.660
about a simple issue.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.020
We're never talking about just
the environmental issues that

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.290
might be affected by it or just
the animal protection

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.040
issues that might be connected
with it or just the social

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.000
justice issues.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.540
We're also talking about
something that's really close

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.100
to our identity, that we think
tells us who we are, how we

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.040
choose to eat.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.270
It's a very personal
statement.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.870
To drive this home, I want to
share with you two small

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.400
excerpts from the book, "Eating
Animals" by Jonathan

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.650
Safran Foer.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.780
That book begins and ends this
with a chapter named

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.710
"Storytelling." Both the
opening and the closing

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.180
chapter have the same title.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.340
And I've got a small quote
I want to share with

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.810
you from each one.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.900
So in the opening section,
Jonathan includes a monologue

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.080
from his grandmother--

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.590
his grandmother who was
a Holocaust survivor.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.200
And the clip I have here is
Jonathan's grandmother

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.760
speaking, and then them
in conversation.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.140
And I'll just read this.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.940
So this is grandmother
speaking,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.640
"Then it all changed.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.200
During the war, it was
hell on earth.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.300
I was always running day and
night because the Germans are

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.920
always right behind me.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.690
If you stopped, you died.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.290
There was never enough food.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.820
I became sicker and sicker
from not eating.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.430
And I'm not just talking about
being skin and bones.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.560
I had sores all over my body.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.360
It became difficult to move.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.420
The worst it got was
near the end.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.650
A lot of people died
right at the end.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.330
And I didn't know if I could
make it another day.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.090
A farmer, a Russian,
God blessed

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.610
him, he saw my condition.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.950
And he went into his house and
came out with a piece of meat

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.950
for me."

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.410
And then Jonathan interjects,
"He saved your life."

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.070
Grandma, "I didn't eat it."

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.760
"You didn't eat it?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.160
"It was pork."

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.490
"I wouldn't eat pork."

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.740
"Why?"

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.880
"What do

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.400
you mean why?" "What?

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.710
Because it was kosher?"

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.780
"Of course."

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.330
"But not even to save
your life?"

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.615
"If nothing matters, there's
nothing to save."

00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:45.040
Something really ultimate was
at stake for Jonathan's

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.760
grandmother here.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.160
Something about food cuts
to a deeper level.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.780
Now at the end of the book,
Jonathan revisits this story.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.460
He ends up kind of sharing a
little story that comes out of

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.840
the history books about
Abraham Lincoln.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.560
"While returning to Washington
from Springfield, Abraham

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.810
Lincoln forced his entire party
to stop to help some

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.340
small birds he saw
in distress.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.700
When chided by the others, he
responded quite plainly, 'I

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.130
could not have slept tonight
if I had left those poor

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.180
creatures on the ground and
not restored them to their

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.010
mother.'

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.710
He did not make a case for the
moral value of the birds.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.700
Instead, he observed quite
simply that once those

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.230
suffering birds came into
his view, a moral

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.290
burden had been assumed.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.450
He could not be himself
if he walked away.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.900
Whether I sit at the global
table with my family or with

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.490
my conscience, to accept the
factory farm feels inhuman.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.980
To accept the factory farm would
make me less myself,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.290
less my grandmother's grandson,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.290
less my son's father.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.650
This is what my grandmother
meant when she said, 'If

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.620
nothing matters, there's
nothing to save.'"

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.180
This is a complicating factor
with food we don't have with a

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.590
lot of other social justice
causes, and something I want

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.920
to have us keep in mind.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.185
Now food matters so much.

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:05.560
I Imagine if you're here, it's
already because you have some

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.180
sense that food is important.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.810
But I think the scale of it
always needs to be emphasized.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.180
So I've got five points I want
to begin with here just to

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.630
give you a sense of how
important this issue is, just

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.310
how much we shape our world
in the choices we eat.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.050
The number one cause of global
warming, the number one

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.390
contributor of global warming
related gases, is animal

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.150
agriculture.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.790
This has now been well
documented in two studies, one

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.030
initiated by the UN, another
initiated by the Pew

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:31.340
Commission.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.909
Those are not lightweight bodies
when they do research.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.880
So if we care about global
warming, we got to care a lot

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.260
about animal agriculture, about
the way in which we

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.960
raise and eat animals, because
that is the biggest cause.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.580
Not [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.280
something obviously good or bad
but just gives you a sense

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.460
of the magnitude, a third of
the surface area of the

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.080
planet, excluding kind of frozen
tundra and that sort of

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.030
area, a third of the planet on
which human beings can walk is

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.345
occupied either by animals
grazing or by the farms that

00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:06.320
have to feed those animals that
are grazing, a third of

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.280
the surface area of the planet
occupied by this single

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.870
activity-- not producing
food, but just

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.090
producing animal food.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.020
We can also talk about this--
and we do less of this, for

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.170
whatever reason, publicly--

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.120
but we could talk about this
problem not just in relation

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.840
to land animals but in relation
to sea animals.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.900
The industry that produces
seafood has undergone the same

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.620
kind of radical transformation
that we've seen in animal

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.270
agriculture.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.170
Really, a lot of actual military
technology's applied

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.910
to fishing-- to catch fish in
areas they weren't able to do

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.560
before, at depths human beings
were never able to

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.930
reach, and so forth.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.020
And we now actually have a
situation where we're hauling

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.410
so much biomass out of the
ocean-- so much biomass out of

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.070
the oceans--

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.690
we can actually measure a
decline in the overall

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.490
vibrance and health of
ocean ecosystems.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.520
Now think about what
I'm saying here.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.530
We're not talking about like a
particular gulf near a human

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.050
area where a particular route
which salmon follow.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.590
I'm talking about the
whole of the oceans,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.990
all of it as a whole.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.420
There's a statistic called
marine tropic index, MTI.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.210
It took about 20 years
to develop.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.830
But it's a way scientists have
that allow them to actually

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.180
get a snapshot of the
global ocean.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.420
And they can actually watch a
process of kind of reducing

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.570
food webs by eliminating
certain kind

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.330
of top level predators.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.010
And so we end up with basically
a lot of jellyfish

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.920
or a lot of algae instead of a
diverse range of species, and

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920
less of them.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.580
So we're actually emptying
the oceans.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.470
In other words, if we were
just to stay where we are

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.560
right now and continue, the end
of that curve would be a

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.840
completely kind of
empty ocean.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.280
Really an amazing thing
to think about.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.840
It used to be we thought there's
no way we can have an

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.190
impact on the oceans,
but indeed we can.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.740
And farming is also related
to global inequity.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.650
I'm not gonna focus on
this right here.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.150
But I have one statistic
worth pondering.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.330
By 2050, the world's livestock
will consume as much food as

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.540
four billion people.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.220
You can do the kind of math and
think about how this will

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.700
work in terms of conflicted
resources around water or land

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.520
or even food itself, how
that's gonna become an

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.790
increasing issue.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.970
We have a situation right now
where the poor compete with

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.560
wealthy people's livestock
grains.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.430
And that is only gonna become a
more serious situation as we

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.980
move into the future.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.780
And finally, the source of what
we call super bugs or

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.480
super pathogens-- these things
you hear about referred to as

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.180
bird flu and swine flu and so
forth with scientists really

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.070
worried about it becoming
a serious pandemic--

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.090
this is primarily driven
by the kind of animal

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.700
agriculture we have.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.960
I mean very simply--

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.290
I'll flesh this out a little bit
later-- but very simply,

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.330
we've got about 50 billion
chickens being raised for meat

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.030
on the planet.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.340
These are chickens which are
kept in circumstances such

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.010
that their health
is compromised.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.350
And they're constantly being fed
drugs because that's the

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.570
way the system works to
make them productive.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:04.500
So we've got 50 billion sick
animals being fed antibiotics.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.110
That creates a perfect situation
for viruses to

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.550
emerge that are gonna be able
to survive this, or new

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.770
bacteria to emerge that aren't
gonna be able to respond to

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.150
antibiotics.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.040
So we've got this perfect
recipe for

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.560
creating new pathogens.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.940
And this is really worrying
scientists quite a bit.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.030
To give you a sense why, just
the other month I had the

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.620
interesting privilege
of go to the Roslin

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.720
Institute in Edinburgh.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.130
This is where Dolly the
sheep was created--

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.265
mentioned it a second
ago because of

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:37.170
the transgenic chicken--

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.010
and I was speaking with one
of the virologists there.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.860
And this is somebody not
interested in farm or food

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.860
issues, but he's working
on transgenic chickens.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.870
He developed the transgenic
chickens because he's so

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.040
worried about what could
happen with H5N1.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.330
That's the bird flu virus that
folks are most worried about.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.280
Viruses all have these H's
and N's to classify them.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.000
So when we say H5N1, we're
talking about a particular

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.390
kind of lineage, a particular
lineage of a virus.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.840
And that lineage--

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.080
this is why it worries folks.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.470
Because when human beings have
gotten that virus, about 60%

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.650
of them die.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.200
That's a very high death rate.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.640
To give you a sense of how high
that is, in 1918 we had

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.480
the biggest natural disaster
in human history.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.830
20 to 50 million people,
they estimate, died.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.250
The US was bulldozing
mass graves.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.580
It's really an amazing thing.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.310
We don't hear too
much about it.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.290
But that pandemic, they
estimate, had

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.650
a 2% fatality rate.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.950
So we're dealing with something
that currently has--

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.330
if that virus doesn't decrease
in its virulence--

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.100
is a 60% death rate.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.470
Now what that virus hasn't yet
done is mutate in a form which

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.220
allows it to be easily
transmitted.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.560
So it's very deadly, but we
don't worry about it because

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.080
at the moment it can't be
easily transmitted.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.980
But birds and pigs and humans,
we all share receptors that

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.200
allow us to be susceptible
to viruses.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.640
And so when birds can get sick
by something or pigs can get

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.270
sick by something, it's a
relatively small step for

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.060
humans to get sick
by something.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.180
So we pay careful attention
to this.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.020
And the scientists are looking
at-- and they're saying we've

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.645
got this virus what appears to
about to be adapting to a form

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:09.460
where it can spread quickly in
the human population, and it

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.270
would be the most deadly
virus we've ever seen.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.000
And we know that the situation
of the factory farm helps

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.770
create these viruses.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.510
So we're dealing with a very
important topic, one that will

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.880
shape us in profound ways
going into the future.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.850
Now what I want to do here in
the center of the talk is tell

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.980
you a short history of
factory farming.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.700
How did we get to where we are
today with this industry I

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.700
keep telling you is so radically
different than other

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.650
kind of farming industries
we had before?

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.520
Well, my story's gonna start
in the 1920s in Delmarva.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.770
Delmarva is Delaware, Maryland,

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.520
Virginia kind of area.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.540
And this is where the poultry
industry has really grown up.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.990
And in somewhere around 1926,
there was an Oceanview

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.240
housewife, a woman named
Celia Steele.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.880
And like many housewives at
the time, she had a small

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.760
flock of chickens.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.210
Actually at this time in the
US history, we had an

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.460
estimated 26 million
poultry farms, 26

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.610
million poultry farms.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.690
But each one only had
20, 30, 40 birds.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.220
And this was the way America
produced its poultry and its

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.630
eggs, by lots of very
small-scale producers.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.660
So Celia Steele was
one of them.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.020
And she placed an order for
chicks, for baby chicks.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:25.800
And there was--

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.940
this is a legend--

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.800
a mistake.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.320
She ordered 50 chicks, that
which she could deal with, but

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.750
you've got 500.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.470
So she had all these extra
birds that she

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.200
wasn't able to sell.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.600
And so she experimented with
actually trying to keep the

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.420
birds alive indoors during the
winter when they wouldn't

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.740
survive outdoors and actually
keep them healthy and fat

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.620
enough that they would be
sellable at the end.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.260
Now had she tried this at any
other point in history, she

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.150
would have failed.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.550
We know it wouldn't
have worked.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.160
But at that particular moment,
we had some new knowledge.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.340
We knew a little bit more about
how nutrition worked.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.280
So she knew to add vitamin A and
vitamin D to the animals

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.550
feed that made them
a bit healthier.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.570
And very quickly, she had access
to drugs that could

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.450
deal with the diseases that were
cropping up by keeping

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.070
the animals inside.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.680
So what she was able to do is
kind of figure out a way to

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.940
put birds inside, which caused
a lot of health problems, but

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.410
then counteract those health
problems by manipulating the

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.250
feed and ultimately by putting
drugs into the feed.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.100
And she was very successful.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.900
So at a time when the average
poultry farm is 20 some birds,

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.210
her farm very quickly
had 10,000.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.270
And in that area, that county
today, there's still 250

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.520
million chickens produced.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.840
In terms of county specific,
that's the largest county for

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.780
producing broiler chickens.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.600
So the rest of the country
is looking around at this

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.760
incredibly productive farm
and say, this is great.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.270
This is the way of the future.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.820
We're gonna put birds indoors.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.160
And it's gonna be
more efficient.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.100
We can do it in all seasons.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.280
And it started to grow.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.220
Now as it started to grow, the
industry became interested in

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.750
intensifying this process and
creating kind of a loop that

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.480
made it go faster and faster.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.560
So after this basic idea of
putting birds inside and then

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.319
giving them specialized feed had
been developed, they went

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.020
after the genetics.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.700
That's really what drives
the poultry

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.920
industry is the genetics.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.770
Once you have a certain set of
genetics in place, you have to

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.990
raise the animal in a certain
set of circumstances that fit

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.730
the animal's genetic makeup.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.599
So they wanted to breed a
chicken that would be really

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.010
profitable in this kind
of circumstance.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.670
Unlike previous generations
which had to deal with

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.270
chickens being able to survive
in diverse kinds of weather

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.020
because they were outdoors,
this new generation of

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.150
chickens could be bred with
the notion that they could

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.480
control their environment and
various other kinds of things.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.710
And so they were able to come
up with a new chicken.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.990
The government actually held a
chicken of tomorrow contest in

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.660
the 1940s that helped
lead to this.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.490
And it was amazing, in
some ways, what they

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.120
were able to do.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.190
They've now taken the chicken
and they've created a bird

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.410
that can grow three
times as fast--

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.250
three times as fast.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.540
That is, it'll reach market
weight in 35 to 40 days

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.010
instead of something more like
120 days like it would have

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.370
been in the 1920s.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.520
And not only will it reach
market weight in a third the

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.000
time, while it's growing it will
eat a third less feed.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.040
This is kind of like a
five-year-old that looks like

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.330
they're 15 but has only
ever eaten breakfast.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.110
Now from the point of view
of efficiency, this

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.650
looks really great.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.960
But you can imagine there's
gonna be some cost to an

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.690
animal if you push its immune
system that hard.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.290
And indeed, there is.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.920
These are very sick animals.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.380
These are really in some
ways mutant animals.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.170
They all share, for example,
what we call colloquially an

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.150
obese gene.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.610
They have a particular
genetic marker.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.840
We actually have
the gene coded.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.980
We know what it is.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.470
And that seems to be the kind of
key factor in creating this

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.830
rapid growth.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.690
But it also means that
the birds flesh--

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.070
the birds meat, its fat,
and so forth--

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.700
grow faster than its bones
are capable of growing.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.040
So you've got a situation where
the animal is constantly

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.110
breaking its bones or
unable to walk.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.520
Pretty serious problem.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.840
It means that for about the last
third of their lives--

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.210
even though these birds are only
a month and a half old--

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.790
about the last third of their
lives, it's painful for them

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.710
to move, just to walk.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.790
And so as a result, they
don't walk very much.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.310
But it turns out the not
walking very much is

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.040
profitable because they don't
burn as many calories and they

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.380
build more fat.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.510
So we created a situation where
we have to use drugs,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.820
where we have to use confinement
because this

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.340
genetics won't work.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.020
We put these birds out on
pasture, we just deal with

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.560
very, very high mortality
rates.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.470
So a lot of our free-range farms
are dealing with like

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.880
30%, 40%, 50% mortality rates
because they're using these

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.470
factory genetics and just
responding to this market

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.360
demand to put birds outside.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.660
But if we don't change the birds
genetics and we just put

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.560
them outside, it's just
a lot of suffering.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.930
Now you and I may be looking at
this situation saying, this

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.690
sounds awful.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.350
Like why would you want to
do farming in this way?

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.220
But the industry looked
at the situation and

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.400
said, this is great.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.930
And as the ag industry looked at
this, said this is the way

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.580
farming should be.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.280
Look at the way this
system works.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.050
The genetics of these birds end
up being controlled by a

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.870
few corporations.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.840
That's actually a story worth
pausing on a bit.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.260
Let me explain how
that happened.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.970
It used to be that farmers who
had chickens could just breed

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.240
chickens together and get
more chickens, right?

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.660
Wouldn't you have thought
that was still the case?

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.590
You could just breed your
chickens together and get more

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.140
chickens, just like somebody
can breed their golden

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.910
retrievers together and get
more golden retrievers?

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.060
Doesn't work that way anymore
with chickens.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.630
Because in the process of
creating that new chicken, in

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.280
the process of moving from the
chicken that we've had with us

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.910
throughout history to the
chicken we now have with us

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.750
today, they changed
the breeding

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.535
techniques rather radically.

00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:41.700
This is why I would say the
chicken is essentially a

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.740
genetically engineered bird
even though it doesn't fit

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.580
that definition as
commonly defined.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.840
So, here's what happened.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.120
Normally what you could do
is take chickens from two

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.180
different lines.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.490
Let's say this line is
especially fast growing and

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.840
this line is especially
good at laying eggs.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.490
And if I've breed those two
birds together-- a mother from

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:00.820
here, a father from here--

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.620
I'd get what they call
hybrid vigor.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.120
That is, the first generation
of birds born from a cross

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.260
show some increased
productivity.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.700
But here is the problem.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.310
The birds that came from that
cross-- if I was the farmer

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.840
and I bred those together--

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.680
those gains wouldn't be
sustained over time.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.110
So I could cross birds once, get
a little boon, but then it

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.560
wouldn't be sustainable.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.510
You couldn't have this kind of
hybrid thing be a permanent

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.180
situation in the old way
of doing things.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.660
But what the companies figured
out is they could actually

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.910
find ways to make all
birds hybrids

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.890
by doing the following.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.320
So it used to be I had my
small flock of birds.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.220
But now if you want to breed
birds, you have to have at

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.210
least around two million birds
because what I'm gonna do is

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.880
I'm gonna preserve parent
line, grandparent and

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.570
grandparent lines.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.860
And each line I have is gonna
take about 100,000 birds.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.730
And then I'm gonna breed
them together in a

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.500
kind of cocktail fashion.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.210
And then it's only the end
resulting bird, the result of

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.120
somewhere between 10 and 20
crosses, that I'm gonna sell

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.260
to the consumer.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.970
And that bird is just completely
useless as far as

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.180
breeding is concerned.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.760
It'll have a really big breast,
have a lot of fat on

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.070
it, or it will lay a lot
of eggs depending on

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.180
what I want to do.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.280
But if I try to breed the
offspring together, just

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.050
completely unviable.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.870
So this was fantastic from the
point of view of corporations.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.900
As long as they could control
these big farms, control the

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.360
genetics, they could
own everything.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.420
So vertical integration
started moving.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.960
They had reduced the cost, and
in general that increases

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.960
market share.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.340
And so the other industries
started following suit.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.060
I'm not gonna go through
anywhere near the kind of

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.345
detail I just did
with poultry.

00:22:32.345 --> 00:22:34.610
But it's basically
the same story.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.470
First the pork industry jumps
on board and starts to ask

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.900
what it can do, then
the dairy industry.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.690
The beef industry is last.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.110
The beef industry is still, to
a large extent, removed from

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.430
the factory system in the early
part of beef cow's life.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.890
In the latter half, it ends up
being in a pretty kind of

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.440
factory setting.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.070
But poultry became the model.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.800
It drove the whole thing.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.800
And I think that's important to
know because if we want to

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.700
change it, poultry is kind of
the hardest nut to crack.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.010
It's the biggest problem
that we have out there.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.670
So one of the things that
happened in the course of this

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.000
breeding is we ended
up with two

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.390
different types of chicken.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.140
We ended up with what's
called layers--

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.810
birds that are specialized in
laying eggs but absolutely

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.460
useless for meat production--

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.010
and another set called
broilers.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.010
This was a new thing.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.590
It used to be birds were
always dual production.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.810
You'd get certain
number of eggs.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.310
If you were a meat farmer, that
would be side income.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.750
Now it's completely
specialized.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.950
At the egg end, we've made the
bird produce twice as many

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.860
eggs as it produced pre-1950 and
with similar consequences.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.610
The stress on the system weakens
the immune system and

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.260
creates this kind of cycle where
you then need to control

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.060
the animals environment and feed
it drugs in order to make

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.310
it productive.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.950
So I want to show you a few
things we're doing kind of in

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.590
response to this situation,
cause we've kind of all grown

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.260
up with this situation, not
being quite aware that it was

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.910
unique for chicken to be as
cheap as it is today.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.150
We actually eat more than 100
times per capita as much

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.020
chicken as we did
in the 1920s.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.990
100 times.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.880
It's really hard to believe
this, but I've looked at the

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.200
primary sources and the data.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.950
It's really true.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.840
It's only in the '90s that
chicken became the most

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.300
consumed food.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.040
So we've got this exciting
thing going on.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.310
How many people here are
familiar with the

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.270
book "Eating Animals"?

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.470
I imagine some of you that
brought you here.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.410
So "Eating Animals" was a book
very important to my

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.420
organization, by Jonathan
Safran Foer.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.180
It really kind of captures the
ethos of what I'd like to see

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.230
kind of happen, and certainly
the ethos of what we're doing

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.630
here at Farm Forward.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.690
And it's really exciting to
report to you it's now being

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.860
made into a documentary.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.420
And an amazing lineup of
folks are behind this.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.690
Jonathan is the author.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.180
Natalie Portman ended up being
the kind of key person who

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.050
really pushed this into
the realm of being

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.470
a documentary film.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.190
And as it turns out--
this is kind of hot

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.610
off the presses news--

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.580
but Biz Stone and Evan Williams
have agreed to

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.430
finance the film.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.450
So they're putting about
$1.25 million into

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.670
making this film happen.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.330
So over the next
two years, this

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.510
film is gonna be produced.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.640
Filming has just started.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.460
It's gonna be about a year of
filming, a year of editing.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.500
And I want to show you some of
the scouting that we've done

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.310
to give you a sense, kind of
fill in with some images some

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.140
of the things I've
talked about.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.730
So what you're seeing right
here is actually an egg

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.650
factory farm.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:26.300
This is what an egg farm looks
like in the contemporary day.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.620
This is Christopher Quinn, the
director I mentioned, doing

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.330
the shooting.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.230
What he's standing in front
of here is chicken shit.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.560
This is just a vast lagoon
of chicken waste.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.360
It's kind of pretty
here with the farm

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.820
reflecting in the cesspool.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.340
It's pretty disturbing.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.580
But this is what rural landscape
begins to look like

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.500
with factory farming.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.840
You'll notice you don't
see any animals.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.995
They're there.

00:25:51.995 --> 00:25:54.140
You just aren't gonna
see them.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.020
This last shot is an empty
egg factory farm.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.950
I don't include any shots, in
case you're wondering, of

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.810
animals actually suffering
on factory farms.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.970
I think it's really important
to see, but sometimes it's a

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.050
little bit overwhelming.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.440
So I do encourage folks
to look at that.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.590
But being inside that empty
egg factory farm was an

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.345
interesting experience.

00:26:12.345 --> 00:26:16.440
Those cages you saw end up being
split into cages about

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.360
this long in which--

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.520
it's basically the size of
folded newspaper in which five

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.770
to six birds would be raised.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.100
That particular one was
abandoned because the factory

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.870
farmer who owned it went on hard
economic times and just

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.025
stopped feeding his animals.

00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:31.710
So it was seized by the state,
which had to then kill the

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.030
animals that were remaining
in there.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:37.280
And it ended up being a good
place to do some filming.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.530
So that's the problem
we're fighting.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:45.310
But there is some good grounds
for being hopeful.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.560
So this gentleman here
is Frank Reese.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.100
And he's in some ways the last
like traditional poultry

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.060
farmer we have in the country.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.900
This is Christopher filming
Frank working with his birds

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.020
when they're first hatched
coming out of the hatcheries.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.480
This is still a kind
a high tech

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.810
operation in certain ways.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.090
This part of the operation looks
the same, that is the

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.480
birth of the birds.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.840
But after the birds are born,
it's night and day.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.880
These are his turkeys
out in the field.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.110
And these birds roam
around all day.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.000
They fly.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.460
They spend time in trees.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.200
They basically do the kinds of
things you thought birds would

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.280
do, as opposed to industrial
turkeys which aren't even

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.780
capable of sexual
reproduction.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.020
This bird right here, it's
actually a wild turkey.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:30.730
I'm not kidding.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:35.070
This wild turkey joined the
flock of Frank's turkeys.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.370
It's a good life.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.920
They have a good life.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.680
I personally wish they didn't
have to be killed at the end,

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.720
but at least they have
a really good life.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.500
Here are some of the chickens.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.040
Now these birds are so unusual
that you're seeing because

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.680
these are pre-industrial
genetics.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.280
This is one of the things
we're working on

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.100
that really very few--

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.740
in some sense, no other really
big players are working on--

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.830
is actually trying to get these
traditional genetics

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.220
back in the market, to recognize
that that road we

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.270
went down when we introduced
that fat gene and intensified

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.670
the bird's growth rate so that
it would grow three times as

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.440
fast, that forced us into a
situation where we need to use

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.960
drugs, where we need to use
confinement because otherwise

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.730
we deal with such rapid
death rates.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.460
We need to reverse
that situation.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.210
It's very hard.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.180
We're kind of locked in as far
as the big industry is

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.270
concerned in using these
fast-growing birds.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.270
What we're trying to do at
Farm Forward is work with

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.200
folks like Frank to try to
create an alternative model, a

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.830
model that can be profitable,
that can deliver a product

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.440
people feel really good about,
and that can eventually

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.570
challenge the industry.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.230
Because what we see right now is
there's just not a model in

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.570
the poultry industry.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.440
In the pork industry, in the
beef industry, I can point you

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.610
to small producers which are
doing truly extraordinary

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.500
things entirely outside
of the factory system.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.030
But if you have in your mind a
poultry producer you know,

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.190
maybe a poultry producer whom
you buy eggs or meat from at

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.990
the farmer's market or that kind
of thing, probably that

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.150
farmer is in the end getting
their chicks from the same

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.210
factory hatcheries with the
same factory genetics that

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.740
other folks are.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.930
We don't have alternatives in
the poultry industry the way

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.760
we have another industries.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.690
So working with Frank is
a way to create that.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.570
And our aim is to
create a model.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.300
Frank, bless his heart, is
willing to share all his

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.810
economic data and what it takes
him to be successful.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:25.510
And we're working on, basically,
producing a model

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.646
that can be repeated and
that can be duplicated.

00:29:28.646 --> 00:29:29.900
So one of the other things
we're doing, I

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.210
mentioned, is education.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.980
And here's where technology
starts to end up entering in

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.630
an interesting kind of way.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.750
So one of the things we've done
is try to bring Johnson

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.550
Safran Foer into classrooms.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.520
We found that if you have a kind
of live interaction, you

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.400
get a lot more bang, a lot
more emotional impact.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.100
But how do you do that
on a large scale?

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.730
How do you reach young people
on a large scale?

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.020
So we're getting very excited
about using video conference

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.990
technology to provide
at very low-cost--

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.890
we spend a few thousand dollars
and we can provide a

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.620
live kind of experience for
students in high schools and

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.150
small classrooms that otherwise
couldn't interact

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.560
with Jonathan an opportunity
to interact with him live.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.940
So I'm just gonna play here a
minute or so of Jonathan just

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.970
from October 3--

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.860
so this is just earlier
this month--

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.420
Jonathan speaking to about
3000 students.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:17.680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.530
-I am at the New York Video
Conference Center which is in

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:24.540
midtown Manhattan,
just a couple

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.490
blocks from Times Square.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:30.960
And I came here this morning
from my house in Brooklyn.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.755
There are many things I could
have done with my day to day.

00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:33.700
I have two little kids.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.490
I could have played with them.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.060
I could have worked
on my writing--

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.342
novel.

00:30:40.342 --> 00:30:41.520
But I really wanted
to be here.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.120
I'm very happy to be here.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:48.380
I wanted to be here because I
believe strongly in the issues

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.900
we're gonna talk about.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.870
I believe very, very strongly in
this form of communication.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:54.780
Something that's direct.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.030
Something that's
conversational.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.700
I prefer it, actually,
to writing books.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.010
What I would prefer even more
would be to join you in the

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:10.690
classrooms, have a genuinely
personal conversation, a

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.850
real-time conversation.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.155
That's the best--

00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:15.100
obviously, won't
be able to do.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:20.150
And finally, I'm happy to be
here because I like talking to

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.660
younger people.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.840
Students--

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.810
grade school, high school,
and college--

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:35.250
are more able and more open to
change than older people are.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.200
That's been very well
demonstrated.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.880
So when thinking about factory
farming as a problem and when

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.350
thinking about the solution to
the problem, which will not be

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:53.180
huge amounts of money, will
not be going to war with

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.300
another country, will not be
electing new governments,

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:02.130
it'll not even be finding news
values, but simply changing as

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:07.690
individuals, changing our daily
habits, I, of course, am

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.960
most excited to talk to people
most able to change.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.390
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.100
AARON GROSS: So we had
tremendous feedback.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.660
As you can see this
is low tech.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.930
This is him off the cuff.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.600
That conversational style
really worked.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.170
We just got incredible feedback
from teachers.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.020
It's something we're gonna
do again next year.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.020
Now another thing we're doing--
and this is really

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.820
more of a serious use
of technology--

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.220
is we're looking for a tool
that's gonna allow consumers

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.810
to make smarter choices
around poultry.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.910
And what we've come up with is
the idea of a program we're

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:40.230
calling buyingpoultry.com.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.810
And the idea is not to promote
the buying of poultry but to

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.510
educate consumers so they can
make choices about what

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.060
poultry they want to buy,
if they want to buy it.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.800
Simple kind of idea here is to
have a mobile app that looks

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.960
something like this.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.690
We're working with a wonderful
firm, BLT and Associates,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.160
which is a Hollywood
marketing firm.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.270
They really help us kind of
impact in a way we can't as a

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.300
small organization.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.260
So this is kind of a partnership
between us and a

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.890
much bigger gun.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.920
And the idea is that you'll have
something very simple.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.690
You open it up.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:11.810
It's gonna geo-locate.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.600
You'll know where you are, tell
you what's available in

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.780
that area in terms of poultry.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.170
But it's gonna have some kind
of system that's gonna help

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:21.680
you understand what's
going on.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.710
So it's gonna help you learn
about sustainable poultry.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.220
It's gonna have easy to
access information.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.110
It's gonna tell you what
certifications actually mean.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.640
It's gonna provide some real
commentary, not just technical

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.720
information, give you a sense
what are the kind of labels

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.350
and buzz words which probably
don't mean anything in terms

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.220
of your own values and
which ones really do.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.800
It'll have things like national
top 10 lists, worst

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.710
10 lists, ways that will help
create competition among

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.420
businesses to do this.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.420
It'll also allow a consumer
to immediately be in the

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.240
supermarket.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.210
There isn't the chicken
they want to buy.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.200
There isn't that faux chicken
they want to buy.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.815
They can with one click
send an email.

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:07.860
It will know what building
they're in and

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.949
be able to do it.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.810
And we've worked out the kind
of back end of this.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.230
We're in the process of doing
the fundraising for it.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.630
We've got a Kickstarter campaign
that's gonna be

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.270
kicked off.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.540
And of course, the web version
will just simply be a little

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.960
bit more robust.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.515
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:23.515 --> 00:34:25.600
-Hi, I'm Jonathan Safran
Foer coming to you

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.290
from my home in Brooklyn.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.400
And I wanted to talk to a bit
about buyingpoultry.com.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.500
People ask me all the time what
they should be eating.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.290
And, I always return their
question with a question,

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.750
which is what do
you care about?

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.120
The food choices that we
make have very serious

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.060
repercussions in the world, not
just for the animal we're

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.080
eating or not eating, but for
an entire food system.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.790
The farm industry is
famously secretive.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:51.010
It can be very complicated to
buy food because we are

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.340
bombarded with different
kinds of labels,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.270
different stamps of approval.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.190
So what can you do?

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.680
Sign up on this page that
can connect good

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.320
farmers with consumers.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.950
You will know where to buy
food that is cage-free,

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.620
free-range, natural, organic.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.720
And perhaps more importantly,
you'll know what those terms

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.200
actually mean.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.450
It's a project that's
in development.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.400
But in the meantime, you can
offer your input, you can

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.690
receive updates, and when it
ultimately goes live be among

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:21.940
the first to have it.

00:35:27.307 --> 00:35:28.650
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:30.180
AARON GROSS: So these are some
of the ways we're trying to

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.640
think about to reach consumers
in new ways,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.170
to change the culture.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.440
And that's in some ways the
most important work.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.990
But as I mentioned, we're also
working on the production end.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.740
And I just want to share one
thing we have just recently

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.180
been able to accomplish there.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.860
What we found out is there's a
bit of a problem with getting

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.770
investment in these kinds of
high-welfare operations, but

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.550
not because there
isn't demand.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.020
That is, pretty much everybody
who's looking at investing in

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.340
something like a higher welfare
poultry operation

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.330
knows there's a whole bunch of
people out there who will pay

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:02.520
quite a bit more to have a
product that's produced

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.710
according to their values.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.710
You might be sitting here
thinking, I'd pay another

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.910
dollar a pound for chicken
if it met my values.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.670
And you may be some
of those people.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.040
That market is there.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
But here's the thing.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.520
There's this kind of scary
situation where even if

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.900
somebody produces a product
that really does fit your

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.100
values, they don't have
a vehicle for

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.040
protecting its integrity.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.200
They don't have a way of
communicating to the consumer,

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.780
hey, we're different.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.310
It's too easy for another
corporation to come up right

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.380
now and kind of steal the
language and appear to be like

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.740
that other company.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.040
That's where buyingpoultry
became very important.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.140
We realized unless there was a
tool that allowed consumers to

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.750
discriminate, you couldn't get
investment in these new

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.170
operations to make
these kinds of

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.200
high-welfare products available.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.940
Now in the interim while we're
kind of in this place where we

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.080
don't have good certifications,
we don't have

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.880
good labels, where it's easy
to confuse the consumer, we

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.920
still need to be building that
alternative infrastructure.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.130
We don't really want
to waste any time.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.840
Especially true because what
happens in the US, even if

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.840
it's on a really small scale
in poultry farming, if we

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.210
change just a few poultry
farms, get a few things

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.870
happening differently, that
can have a massive impact

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.860
globally because of what's going
on in India and China

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.960
who have not, like us,
factorized their whole

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.400
production process.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.610
There's still a lot of stuff
there that can be transformed.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.260
So I'm very excited about
changes here even if they're

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.600
at a relatively small scale.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.310
And so we created a loan
program that's

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.180
directly for farmers.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.640
And the money comes from animal
protection groups.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.320
This is pretty unprecedented
to have animal protection

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.850
groups actually supporting
people who are involved in the

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.820
killing of animals.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.000
And that's a bit of an
uncomfortable relationship.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.710
And some people think that's
just a bad idea all told.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.370
But what it's enabled is--

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:51.560
or what it is enabling is the
truly high-welfare producers

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.400
to get a slight edge
that allows them

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.320
to get off the ground.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.930
We are talking about
a loan program.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.460
They have to pay it back.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.555
And that shows that this is
a real economic model.

00:37:59.555 --> 00:38:01.220
This is part of what I was
saying in terms of

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.510
demonstrating a model's
viability, if you can't

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.010
demonstrate it, if you can't
get a loan to begin with.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:10.570
So we've solved that problem by
bringing in some nonprofit

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.770
interests to put together in
this case $150,000 to fund a

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.950
barn for Frank Reese, the farmer
I showed you before who

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.070
actually has wild turkeys
joining his flock.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.260
What you see in the background
there looks from a distance

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.060
not all that different from a
factory farm barn like those

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.310
ones you saw next
to the cesspool.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.550
But on the inside, it looks
completely different.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.080
It just has a bunch of roosts.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.680
And it's really where the birds
will go in the evening.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.980
Birds are natural roosters.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.160
They like to go in and be
protected in the evening.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.990
But during the day, the barn
doors open and the birds are

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.420
out on the field.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.340
But this barn has a lot of
high-tech features that would

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.780
otherwise been very hard
for Frank to invest in.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.140
We've got automated feed
for water and--

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.310
automated feeders and automated
water and fans and

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.580
various devices that
help control the

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.890
temperature in the building.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:04.940
So basically taking advantage
of high-tech solutions that

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.720
help and that create better
welfare, but not going that

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.340
route of using those genetics
that force us into using

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.350
confinement and drugs and all
of this kind of thing.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.130
And we'll see.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.640
We're right in the midst
of this experience.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.090
This barn just opened
a month ago.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.140
If the model is successful, if
it can pay the loan back as

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.290
I'm very certain it's going to,
we'll then have another

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:28.400
tool in our shed.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.590
We can really bring that
data out to the public.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.250
And in the meantime, of course,
there's people forging

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.510
relationships between
consumers and

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.410
these special producers.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:42.430
And that's an exciting thing
in and of itself.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.000
Now I added this little
piece at the end.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.475
I'm calling this kind
of part two 'cause

00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:46.800
it's kind of an add-on.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.580
What I've given you so far is
kind of my usual stick.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.230
But I'm sitting here.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.990
I'm coming to Google.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.790
I couldn't help think
like what if--

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.770
this is my little personal
fantasy, not something I think

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.010
is gonna actually be a
strategy-- but I'm like if

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.440
Google decided it wanted to
fight factory farming, what

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:00.970
would it do?

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.940
And I actually think if Google
wanted to, it's a company in a

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.370
perfect position to end
factory farming.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.220
And I think we can do
it in three steps.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.570
And it begins with asking
a simple question.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.080
If we have technology that can
make, say, every road in the

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.820
country visible, why not
consider using similar kind of

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.320
technology to make every
farm visible.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.580
I realize a little bit more of
a technical accomplishment,

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.520
but we're in the realm of kind
of thought experiments here.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.290
You see, the thing is the
factory farm industry depends

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.690
entirely in its business
model in a very

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.980
serious way on secrecy.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.730
It depends on that.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.700
It's very, very serious
about protecting that.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.900
You may have heard something
about what we call ag-gag

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.620
legislation.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.660
That is special legislation
which makes it illegal to do--

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.240
makes it more illegal to do
things that are basic

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.300
investigative techniques that
have allowed various

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.370
investigators to uncover things
that happen on factory

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.970
farms and bring it
to public view.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.080
That's really the main channel
right now of bringing

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.170
information to folks like
us about what goes

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.720
on in factory farms.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.560
And so threatening is this
information to companies,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.180
they've actually gotten
together and supported

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.080
legislation that does things
like make it illegal to take

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.010
photographs of animals
on a farm.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.150
You may be thinking, don't I
have free speech rights that

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.580
protect that?

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.420
And you do.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.400
But the time in which they
passed the law and the years

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.160
in which it's going through the
court system and so forth,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.260
will all be years where
investigations don't take

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.150
place because the investigators
are scared of

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.550
the kind of draconian possible
consequences that are there.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.700
So they're introducing a bunch
of things which probably won't

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.300
pass constitutional muster but
which you should be very

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.530
worried about nonetheless
because the industry is

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.610
expanding this strategy.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.790
They were in a few states last
year, about 15 states in this

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.250
coming legislative session.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.710
They're gonna be introducing
this kind of legislation.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:46.460
Point being, this industry is
so concerned about secrecy

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.570
that it will publicly support
anti-free speech legislation.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.830
It's incredibly unpopular.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:52.560
You can imagine.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.350
Folks do not like an industry
trying to pass legislation

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.110
that hides it.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.410
But it's worth their while
because so dangerous is

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.960
transparency to this industry.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.530
So what if Google offered to
put cameras on every farm?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.190
It's actually happening in
slaughterhouse auditing.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.230
They're doing remote auditing
through cameras.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.050
It's probably what will be the
way in which slaughterhouses

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.470
are audited in the future.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.840
So this is not a complete
science fiction scenario, if

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.690
it is to somewhat.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.310
I think if you pretty much do
it, it's gonna go like this.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.970
If there was push in that
direction, some kind of push

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.730
towards providing that
technology, activist groups

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.770
can put plenty of pressure on
farms in various ways to go

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.790
transparent, including by
passing ballot initiatives.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.800
We have a movement that's
organized enough to pass

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.360
legislation at the
state level.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.390
So you could imagine them
pushing for transparency.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:42.450
There's a vehicle for it.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.030
They can't complain that it's
costing them money.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.080
I think very much what would
happen as soon as those video

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.990
cameras got installed, the very
simple economic cycle

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:54.200
would start where people would
see this farm, they'd see that

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.830
farm, and they'd make their
choice very clearly.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.810
And I genuinely believe
that would be enough

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.840
to end factory farming.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.900
I don't know if it's gonna
happen that way, but it could.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.780
And that is what I wanted
to share with you guys.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.140
I'm hoping we can have a bit
of a conversation here.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.379
Thanks so much.

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:17.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:17.736 --> 00:43:18.230
BRIAN: Hey.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.420
Thank you for the talk.

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.110
I saw Jonathan's talk here.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.300
I subsequently read his book.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.410
Loved it.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.110
Think what you're doing
about raising

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.280
awareness is fantastic.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.520
And as a person who's been
vegetarian basically 25 years

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.930
or vegan my whole adult life,
I mean I generally support

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.120
anything that's going
to better the

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.790
condition of animals.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.630
But I look at it, I guess,
a little bit skeptically.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.090
And I say that just in a
friendly way because--

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:47.600
AARON GROSS: Please.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.750
AUDIENCE: --I'm definitely
sympathetic.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.260
But let's say factory farming
ends tomorrow.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.500
Let's say the industry adopts
all of your standards, or

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.910
Frank Reese's standards,
tomorrow, right.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.570
So you already said at the
beginning of the presentation

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:11.150
a third of the land on earth is
devoted to raising animals.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:16.500
So if they adopt this, then that
means more land needs to

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.190
go towards eating animals.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.740
Why don't you just tell people
to be vegetarian or vegan and

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.990
help them make those choices
because if you--

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:31.340
and I'm not advocating factory
farming, but you can't scale

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.405
what you're doing.

00:44:32.405 --> 00:44:33.300
AARON GROSS: Yeah, so let me--

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.580
BRIAN: People have
to eat less meat.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.420
I mean it's just a
simple equation.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:37.830
So I--

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.010
AARON GROSS: You're
actually correct.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.540
So the question is why
not just promote like

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.980
no meat, less meat.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.660
And tell me your name.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.190
BRIAN: Brian.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.430
AARON GROSS: Brian is absolutely
correct that

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.910
there's no way around eating
less meat as a population.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.640
And one way to accomplish
that is a lot more

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.620
vegetarians and vegans.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.950
There's really no scenario,
whether factory farming stays

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.770
with us or not.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.140
So that's absolutely correct.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.750
And I do encourage people
to be vegetarian.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.710
I would encourage people
to go vegan.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:05.750
There's very few ways you can
have as much impact on animals

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.860
and the environment than simply
just by removing them

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.900
from your diet entirely because
it's extremely hard to

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.380
find the really good
producers.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:15.660
So that is something
I would advocate.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.670
But what we see is that meat
eating is very entrenched.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.220
It's probably not gonna go
anywhere, no matter how much

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.800
the vegetarian movement grows.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.690
And it is growing, and I think
it will continue to.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:31.240
And so what I focused on today
really was about how to make a

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.640
future in which meat is still
there but has to be a smaller

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.120
part of the plate, possible.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:37.570
BRIAN: Fair enough.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.420
And I think that makes sense.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:44.740
I mean I would pose sort of a
counter argument which is that

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.190
I see round other than San
Francisco, and a lot of my

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.930
friends they hear, oh, you're
vegan, you're vegetarian.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.370
Oh, I buy my eggs here.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.050
I'm really careful and
stuff like that.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.290
And then we're out late night in
the Mission at a taqueria,

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.990
and they're having beef tacos.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.620
And guess what?

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.220
Like that taqueria in the
Mission isn't buying

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.910
free-range beef.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.970
And so what I've seen is that
it becomes almost more of an

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.830
excuse for people to kind of
go on with their existing

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:16.610
habits of eating meat because
they're lured into this sense

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.840
of, oh yeah, I'm making a
conscious choice and I've

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.930
thought about it or whatever.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.490
But they're really
kind of not.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.240
And in a sense, the people
who are the most

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.100
receptive to change--

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.420
like people like us, people who
are affluent, people who

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.960
are well educated, people who
are open minded and willing to

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.130
make the change--

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.710
are kind of siphoned off when
they have options like this.

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:41.070
AARON GROSS: So this
is, yeah--

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.530
you're presenting a very serious
argument that we

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.830
thought a lot about.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.910
And what I would say
is I'm sympathetic

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.190
to what you're saying.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:50.950
I'm making a bet on a
different strategy.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.680
My observation is that
vegetarianism and lower meat

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.530
or higher ethical meat diets
rise and fall together.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.520
So I see a lot of evidence that
if we get people eating

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.680
higher welfare meat that we'll
also encourage vegetarianism,

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.790
rather than the competitive
scenario.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.650
And I think we actually need
to do some research.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:11.210
This is really what I came to.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.240
Because what I want to say is
I think there are large

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.370
elements of the so-called kind
of ethical or humane meat

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.420
movement which are actually
really hostile to vegetarian.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:21.010
They don't say that
explicitly.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:24.180
But there's this notion that's
really kind of a meat advocacy

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.470
and then do it right
on the back end.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.180
And I think that's a really
serious thing to avoid.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.700
We think it's really important
to say as we work towards

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.330
higher welfare animal farms that
there is another viable

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.790
option and that many people
really need to be adopting it

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.420
if we're gonna be successful,
which is

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.660
vegetarianism or veganism.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.270
So I don't take that as a small
part of the solution.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.030
I think it's a big part.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:50.860
But my bet is that we can work
for these high-welfare farms

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.780
and advance that at
the same time.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.330
But I think the real answer is
we need to do some studies

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.960
because this is a really
serious question.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.680
And we need to find out when we
promote this kind of thing,

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.340
does it make vegetarians go back
to eating higher welfare

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.820
meat or does it in fact promote
higher welfare,

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.920
high-ethical eating
in general.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.250
BRIAN: Cool.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.400
Thanks for the answer.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.760
AARON GROSS: Thank you.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.440
AUDIENCE: I talked a lot of
farmers who do like the whole

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.710
small farm thing.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:17.370
And they have problems
with the USDA.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.600
I was wondering if you're
addressing that discrimination

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.920
between the factory farms
and the smaller farmers?

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.340
AARON GROSS: Yeah.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:25.710
Absolutely.

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:27.970
So the question is about
addressing the way in which

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.160
the USDA is often a kind of
problem for small farmers.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.390
So the USDA is structured in
such a way that it really

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:35.810
supports factory farming.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.430
They don't really know
what to do with small

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.740
farmers like Frank.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.206
So the USDA comes
to Frank's farm.

00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:43.600
They're like, where are your
waste lagoons, like the big

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.770
cesspool you saw there?

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.940
And he's like, I don't have
any waste lagoons.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.905
Like, but you're a chicken
operation.

00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:48.240
And they literally don't
know what to do.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.230
They don't even have like
a check box for how to

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.950
investigate a farm like that.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.820
And that wasn't a
problem per se.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.770
But of course in other cases,
they really do create all

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.410
sorts of problems.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:48:59.830
It is something we're
working on.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.280
We've mostly found that what
these small farmers need is

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.510
kind of business or consulting
services.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.450
They know how to farm.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:06.630
They know how to produce
a product.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:07.700
But they don't know how to deal

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.100
with government paperwork.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.470
They don't know how to put
together a business plan.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.020
They don't know how to
think in those ways.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.720
And so those are the services
we've really been providing,

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.640
not just to Frank but to

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.870
Kansas-area farmers in general.

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:23.180
And as we develop this model and
as we have more resources,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.610
the idea is precisely to make
those services available.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you for the
talk and for your time.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.810
What are the major factors that
keep high-welfare farms

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.720
from being cost competitive
with the factory farms?

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.970
You mentioned that there was
more losses in terms of

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.360
animals dying if they're
outside?

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.680
And is it more labor
intensive?

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.750
And can automation drive
that cost down?

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:46.950
AARON GROSS: Yeah.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.090
So the question is what are
the main factors that make

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.700
high-welfare farming
more expensive than

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.680
lower welfare farming?

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.030
Just to first clarify what I
said before, if we stick with

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.610
the factory chicken genetics
and we put those birds

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.640
outside, it creates
that problem.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.880
Of course, if we take
traditional birds and we raise

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.030
them outside, they're
phenomenally healthy and have

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:08.720
robust immune system.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.610
There's two issues.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.220
There's one of scale.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.400
What Frank is doing right now
is expensive in part just

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.820
because he's so small.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.020
If we can scale that up
by demonstrating the

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.200
effectiveness of this model,
the costs will

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.920
go down to an extent.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.310
The other factor is
externalities.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.540
You currently have a factory
farm industry which can cause

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.930
hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of pollution,

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:33.520
create all sorts of injury
issues for their workers and

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.120
not pay them.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.890
So you've got all of these
externalized costs that aren't

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:40.670
externalized in the
high-welfare farm.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.040
They are polluting something.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.110
They're cleaning it
up and so forth.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.330
They're different
kind of players.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.050
So if we can clean up the
externalities, which is a

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.830
legal issue, that would
deal with the largest

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.650
kind of chunk of it.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.600
And it's hard to calculate
exactly how much those things

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.030
cost for the reasons
you can imagine.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:57.660
It's a complicated equation.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.590
But it will be more expensive.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.960
Meat is artificially
cheap right now.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.640
We pay less for food of any
kind then at any point in

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.070
human history in terms of
percentage of our income.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.020
It's incredibly small.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.590
We think food's gotten a little
bit more expensive

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.350
recently, but it's still
historically

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:14.790
at an all-time low.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.170
And so part of the solution here
is to get us a little bit

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.220
more comfortable spending a
larger percentage of our

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.260
income, whether we're wealthy
or poor, but a larger

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:25.640
percentage of our income on food
and probably less higher

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.825
quality meat.

00:51:26.825 --> 00:51:28.290
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.980
I used to work for a large
environmental organization.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:33.740
And I was always amazed that
animal agriculture really

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.710
didn't make the list of things
we talked about.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:37.130
We talked about a lot
of other things.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:41.160
But as the number one cause of
climate change, I felt like we

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.690
were burying our heads
in the sand when we

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:43.700
didn't address it directly.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.400
And, I guess it's not a really
targeted question, but I would

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.490
guess that if we could get the
environmental community more

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:54.160
behind alternatives to current
animal agriculture that we'd

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.400
see faster progress
potentially.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.460
Do you have thoughts on why
we haven't seen the

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.040
environmental movement--

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.760
is it just that vegetarianism or
eating meat is so personal

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.970
that it's something they're
scared to touch?

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:07.410
I'd just love to hear your
thoughts on that.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:07.630
AARON GROSS: Yeah.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:08.050
Thank you.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:08.720
No, it's a great question.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.310
So the question is why haven't
environmental groups been more

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.500
active fighting factory farming
and talking about

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.980
these diet issues, and yeah,
a question of longstanding

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.810
interest to me.

00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:19.350
It is one of the reasons I
started the talk with talking

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.850
about identity and the way in
which it's bound up because I

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.990
think that's a huge
part of it.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:25.150
There's something--

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.620
with many environmental groups,
there's history of

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.140
connection with hunting and
preservation around that which

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.720
has become part of
their ethos.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.300
But whether it's an
environmental group or any

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.430
other kind of group, for the
most part, Americans work

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:39.150
within a frame in which
you have to eat meat.

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:42.220
That's not a decision that's
going to be negotiated or

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:42.720
considered.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.480
It's kind of an unwritten law.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.600
The way you can kind of do this
as a thought experiment

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.330
is could someone become
president if they were a

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.920
vegetarian?

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.910
There's no law against a
presidential candidate being

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.450
vegetarian.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.900
But honestly, what do you think
would happen if we had a

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.710
vegetarian?

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.590
They'd be killed, no
pun intended here.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.630
It's just completely
unacceptable.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:04.450
And it's only really the animal
movement which has

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.400
gotten over that cultural
barrier and is willing to say

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.550
to people, you know what, maybe
you shouldn't eat them

00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:11.280
at all or you should eat less.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.400
It's happening in the
environmental movement now.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.730
A few years ago, Sierra, Club
became the first to kind of

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:18.020
have a big campaign against
factory farms.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.500
And it does help a lot.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.420
And the Waterkeepers Alliance
won some incredible lawsuits

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.960
against pig factory farms.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.020
It cost them $12 million
in lawsuits.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.430
Unfortunately the CEO of
Smithfield at the time took a

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:31.530
$12 million bonus.

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.930
So it shows you how much
that is a big fine.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.930
But the environmental groups
are having an impact.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.000
And we are seeing
progress there.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.820
But that's a cultural battle.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.150
And I think one of the most
important things we can do is

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.300
really just to get people
comfortable talking about meat

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.680
as something optional, as
something which may be if it

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.420
doesn't meet our values, we
shouldn't be eating it.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.540
And if we do want to eat
it, maybe we need

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.180
to change the system.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.840
And that's a tough one and
very important one.

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:57.520
Good question.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.300
Good question to end on.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:53:59.780
CHRIS: Great.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.480
Please join me in thanking
Aaron one more time for

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.730
joining us at Google today.
