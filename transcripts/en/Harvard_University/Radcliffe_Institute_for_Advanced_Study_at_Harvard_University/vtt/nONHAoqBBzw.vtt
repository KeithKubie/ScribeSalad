00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.872
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.656
- Well hello everyone.

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.780
My name's Yukio Lippit and
I'm the faculty Director

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.850
of the Arts at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.780
And it's a real pleasure to
welcome you to this occasion.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
The opening of the exhibition
by Wendy Jacob, titled Calm.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
Smoke Rises Vertically, in
Radcliffe's Johnson-Kulakundis

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.470
Family Gallery.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.450
Now Wendy Jacob is a
widely admired artist

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.770
who bridges many practices.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.360
Among them, the practices
of architecture,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.730
sculpture, design, invention.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.430
She was based in
Chicago for many years

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.064
where she received her MFA from
the Art Institute of Chicago,

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:48.480
and where she was a founding
member of the art collective,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.230
Haha, that was
formed there in 1988,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.875
and worked together
for some two decades.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.050
Haha is widely acclaimed for
developing an art practice that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.740
really pushed at many of the
boundaries of what art could be

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.530
and who had access to it.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.560
It's many projects, which
included all kinds of community

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.400
based projects, sculptural
installations, video work,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.030
and so forth, tended in
their words, to be ephemeral.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.190
Closely interwoven with
the times and places

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.900
where they were
shown and addressed

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.660
the particulars of living
in it locally and centrally

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.030
embedded situation.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.370
Now in addition to
her work with Haha,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.040
Jacob also developed her
own artistic projects

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
that explored among other
things, the relationships

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.510
between architecture and
perceptual experience.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.160
The interface
between architecture

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.470
and the bodies of the
peoples and animals

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.720
inhabiting the
built environment.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.880
And in this regard,
Jacob has been

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.400
the consummate
collaborator who's

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.920
worked in a collective
with other artists.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.990
But also with architects,
engineers, researchers

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.640
in various fields
over the years,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.080
really yielding a long list of
solo exhibitions, publications,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.710
and residencies, nationally
and internationally, too

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.210
numerous to enumerate here.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.310
Although I should be
remiss not to mention

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.039
that she was formerly a fellow
at the Radcliffe institute

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.350
in the year 2005.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.360
One of her more
well-known collaborations

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.210
was with Temple Grandin,
the animal scientist who

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.620
has written widely on autism,
and catalyzed by conversations

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.650
with Grandin, Jacob
developed the squeeze chair,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.940
which consists of a
series of chairs really,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.960
with arms that inflate to
hold the sitter in a firm hug.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.300
It takes its cue from the
fact that many with autism

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.680
are especially receptive to the
calming effects of pressure.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.350
In 2006, Jacob founded
the autism studio

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.230
at MIT, a multi-disciplinary
studio that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.350
aims to explore perceptual
features afforded

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.900
by the broad range of
autistic experience

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.240
and to create objects
and spaces and events

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.630
that really resonated
with these experiences.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.180
More recently, over
the past two years,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.970
Jacob has worked with the
Cherry Road Resource Center

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.640
for the Disabled in
Scotland to understand,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.640
among other things, the nature
of the tactility of sound

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.960
for the hearing impaired.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.520
Now the exhibition
that opens today, Calm.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.080
Smoke Rises Vertically,
really extends

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.970
in new ways, the
vectors of inquiry

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.460
that Jacob has been
pursuing over the years.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.350
Most notably, here
interest in expanding

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.540
the sensory dimensions of art.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.290
In the Johnson-Kulakundis
Gallery,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.960
10 architectural models are
displayed in combination

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.140
with meteorological
information, which

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.220
is played through the
walls of the gallery.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.410
And both the models
and the weather

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.780
reports, convey
empirical knowledge that,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.720
by calibrating a
verbal description

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.120
to sensory experience.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.000
The architectural models
displayed in the gallery

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.600
are on loan from the
Perkins School for the Blind

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.310
and the Ohio State
School for the Blind.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.020
They have an
interesting history.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.730
They were created between
the years 1935 in 1943,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.490
under the auspices of the
WPA, the Works Progress

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.580
Administration, which
mobilized many craftsmen

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.250
and specialists to create
tactile models for.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.017
blind students.

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.850
The models were intended
to convey knowledge

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
about architecture through
touch, allowing blind students

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.180
to see them for the first time.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.390
The weather reports which are
conveyed through the walls,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.190
include a live streaming of the
weather broadcast of the NOAA.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.720
Also live sounds from outdoors
and a reading of the Beaufort

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.420
Wind Scale.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.110
The Beaufort Wind
Scale is a scale

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.240
that was developed in
the early 19th century

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.800
to match a defined set
of verbal descriptions

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.000
to approximate wind speeds, with
the practical aim of allowing

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400
users to, on land
or sea, to quantify

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.710
the observable
conditions around them.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.920
And so for example, a 4
on the Beaufort Scale,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.570
which is a brisk
breeze is indicated

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.220
by the phrase small trees
and leaf begin to sway.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.140
So the title of the
exhibition Calm.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.810
Smoke Rises Vertically
describes a wind speed

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.800
of less than one knot.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.520
Now the exhibition highlights
in a wonderful way,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.800
the correspondences between
the tactile models and weather

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.710
reports, in order to
underscore the ways in which

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.830
perceptual experiences
through different senses

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.490
reinforce and
transform one another.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.700
In the models, touching
is synonymous with seeing.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.430
Whereas in the weather
reports, the invisible,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.364
the wind is rendered
comprehensible.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:31.780
And by playing the
weather reports

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.600
through the walls of the
gallery, Jacob in essence,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.670
transforms the gallery
walls themselves,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.530
into large surfaces of sound.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.760
Speakers of sound
thus generating

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
an equivalence again
between its tactility,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.150
and that of the models.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.500
Now although we live in an age
of the lab, the model it seems

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.210
for all forms of
innovative research,

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.440
especially at a university,
including artistic research,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.940
one might say that
Wendy Jacob is

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.950
an artist of a different kind.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.730
One who belongs to
something like The Club.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.640
Fundamentally collaborative
and egalitarian,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.310
as suggested by one of her
recent projects, the Explorers

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.390
Club.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.520
Her work is characterized
by a great deal of empathy,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.510
but not necessarily
only for the so-called

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.714
disabled peoples and
communities with whom she works.

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:24.130
But really her
empathy is directed

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.740
at the rest of humanity
which is missing out

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.860
on so much rich
sensation and attunement

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.740
to one's surroundings.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.340
In her interdisciplinary
approach

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.150
and relentless plumbing of
different spheres of knowing,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.040
her aims seem to
resonate so well

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.485
with the aims of the Radcliffe
institute as a whole.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:43.360
And it is a real privilege
to be able to work

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.300
with her on this occasion.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.340
Now this exhibition
was organized

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.530
by the academic ventures
division of the Radcliffe

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.400
Institute in conjunction with
the Radcliffe Arts Program.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.450
And on behalf of
our Dean, Liz Cohen,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.500
our Director of Academic
Ventures, Becky Wasserman,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.630
Jennifer [? Burkitt ?]
and others

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.760
at Academic Ventures, Meg
Rotzel our arts program manager.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.530
Joe Zane, our proprietor
and our colleagues

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.020
in facilities communications
events, the Fellows Program.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.490
I'd like to say a few
thank yous and we'd

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.830
like to convey a heartfelt
thanks to the Perkins

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.590
School for the Blind, and
in particular to Betsy

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.830
[? Senate, ?] the curator
of the tactile museum there,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.770
who was a really
generous collaborator

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.010
and helped enable this
exhibition and the loans

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.600
to our gallery.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.390
As well as the Ohio State
School for the Blind and Cecilia

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.760
Peirano and Laurie Kaplan there.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.580
They again, greeted this
project with so much support

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.590
and enthusiasm.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.560
We'd also like to thank our
friends at the National Rail

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.330
Press.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.240
And also to thank
Lilly [? Shirless ?]

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.240
who was an undergraduate
at Harvard College, who

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.590
served as Wendy's assistant
and whose competence

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.040
and formidable research
skills were also essential

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.457
in enabling the show.

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:03.040
Last but not least,
we'd like to thank

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.080
Wendy Jacob herself,
a collaborator

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.735
in the true sense of the word.

00:08:06.735 --> 00:08:09.100
An artist who has taught
us a great deal as someone

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.560
who is kind of constantly full
of remarkable observations

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.200
that make you see
daily life around you

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.950
in new and meaningful ways.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.340
Now for our panel discussion, in
addition to the artist herself,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.570
we'll be joined by
Hansel Bauman who

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.770
is practicing architect and
founding partner of Hansel

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.420
Bauman Architect and Planner,
as well as university architect

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.549
and executive director of
campus design and construction

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.850
at Gallaudet University
in Washington DC.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:42.760
In 2006, he founded the
Death Space Project.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.220
He's a recognized leader
in architectural design

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.420
that enhances cultural
and sensory experiences

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.100
and was lectured and published
widely on architecture,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.990
the senses, and disability.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.954
And was a 2015, recipient
of the Gold Award

00:08:55.954 --> 00:08:57.370
from the International
Association

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.350
of Universal Design.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.807
Our other panelist
is Kim Charlson

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.390
who has been the director of the
library at the Perkins School

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.810
for the Blind since 2001.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.370
She is a distinguished expert
on library and information

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.480
services for people
with disabilities.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.340
Charlson is widely
published and serves

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.190
on several committees for the
Library of Congress' National

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.710
Library Service, and for
the Blind and Physically

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.980
Handicapped.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.270
She is the first woman president
of the American Council

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.534
of the blind.

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:28.950
It's hard to think of two more
distinguished interlocutors

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.440
to discuss our exhibition today.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.200
So please join me in
welcoming them now.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.190
- Thank you, Yukio.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.080
I just wanted to add a
few thank yous of my own

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.930
and I wanted in addition,
to Yukio who has been just

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.190
really wonderful to work with,
and Rebecca, and Jennifer

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.765
[? Burkitt ?] and Meg
Rotzel, the gallery director.

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:04.120
Who also spent hours cleaning
these models with a Q-Tip

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.600
and Joe Zane who excavated
the gallery walls to install

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.960
transducers inside them.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.180
And again Lily [? Shirless ?]
the excellent research

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.370
assistant, and then
graduate students,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.820
Georgia [? Kenichi ?] and
[? Kyoto ?] [? Kaseki ?]

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.400
and Faith [? Maclure, ?]
who also spent long,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.180
patient hours
cleaning with Q-Tips.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.510
And [? Virad ?] [? Chukla ?] and
Will [? Mentor ?] for help with

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.540
production of the Model.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.400
And Cecilia Peirano who
came here from Ohio.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.970
And finally, I want to
express my appreciation

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.430
to all the unknown craftsmen
of the WPA era, who produced

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.300
these models, and for the
statesmen and stateswomen

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.440
of that progressive era who had
the vision to Commission them.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.220
- Great well let's
dive right in.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.180
You know many times Wendy,
during the preparations

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.790
for the show, you've
mentioned that you've really

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.640
taken some of your
cues for this project

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.040
and for your vectors
of inquiry in general

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.190
from the architecture for the
Perkins School for the Blind,

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.039
which is just next
door in Watertown Mass.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.330
And I was wondering if you
could elaborate a little bit

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.330
upon what it is about
the architecture

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.820
and the environment there, that
has been so catalytic for you.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.190
- I think this is something
that the three of us share.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.160
I think four years
ago Hansel and I

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.060
took a tour of the Perkins
School in Watertown.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.670
And what I think most amazed
us was the old building,

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.710
the old Victorian
buildings where

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.300
they're really built to
give you a sense of where

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.480
you are in space.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.370
For example, the
floors are tiled,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.590
but when you had
a cross-section,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.390
the ceiling is higher and so the
echo of your footfall changes.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.790
And so you know that
you've hit an intersection.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:12.150
And one of the most beautiful
and subtle aspects of it

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.890
is that the floors are slightly
tilted, really, very slightly

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.130
tilted, so that if you're
walking against the tilt

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.960
you know you're going
on a straight line.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.980
If you start to go uphill or
downhill you're going zigzag.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.140
And when we were there,
we went into the basement

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.830
where we discovered
this amazing collection

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.530
of tactile objects, which
included the buildings, some

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.380
of which are here.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.540
But it also includes a taxidermy
shark and a bear and a rocket

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.802
ship and it's like a
cabinet of curiosities.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.570
- Well Yeah, I guess on
that same tour, to me

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.160
I think, kind of seeing that
building through Wendy's eyes

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.360
really was very, really
quite an experience,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.040
because I think it was
intentionally designed

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.460
acoustically, like
Wendy's explained.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.370
I think there was also
another layer of design

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.620
about that building
that I think we often

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.430
forget, that newly
started me thinking

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.340
about the idea of materiality.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:27.690
Because it's a stone Collegiate
Gothic building that not only,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.550
do you begin to have
the kind of resonance

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.910
from acoustics from that
stone, but you could almost

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.430
begin to feel pressure from it.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.370
The weight of the
wall in that space,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.700
you could really begin
to sense the difference

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.190
or if a wood wall is next
to you or if a heavy stone

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.780
wall is next to you.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.080
Or because of the
vibration, you can really

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.820
begin to tell that the
scale of the space.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.550
So that building really, in some
ways, reached out and touched

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.590
you in a way that
I don't think I've

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.560
ever experienced in
a building before.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.060
For me that opens up a whole
new question about how we really

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.390
do experience space, far beyond
our obsessions as architects

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.560
is what they look like.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.710
- So I have the opportunity
to work with these folks

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.600
and be a part of this panel.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.150
And one of the joys
about doing this

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.570
is, because I walk through
those halls every day.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.100
And sometimes I don't think
about what they really mean.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.210
And to talk to Wendy and
Hansel about how much they

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.270
gain from walking in the
halls of the Howe Building

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.990
at Perkins, really made
me appreciate them.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.820
And kind of go back
and think about well,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.620
these are the halls
I walk all the time.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.510
But what do they mean?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.690
And they do have
a sensory meaning.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.980
And they really
do bring out what

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:01.260
I think is a often
under utilized

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.170
sense for blind or
visually impaired people.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.710
Which is really kind of feeling
and communing with the building

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.210
you're in.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.640
And it sounds a little
woohoo, to that talk

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.820
about something like this.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.460
But in fact, you may just
think about it yourselves.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.860
You may have been in a
building where part of it

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.029
felt really cold.

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:23.820
But then you might be
walking down the hall

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.500
and there's other
parts that are warm,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.940
or that sound from the high
ceiling to the more tightly

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.210
closed, or the wooden walls.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.620
You can pick up so many cues and
so many clues from the building

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.010
itself.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.240
And I think that's what's
really exciting about Wendy's

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.880
work and the whole idea of
thinking about buildings

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.450
as places that are
communicating to you as well,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.520
and delivering a message.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.570
The Perkins Buildings are
symmetrical on both sides.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:04.360
So back in the day when they
were built in 1912 or so,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.990
you know they had a side
for girls and this for boys.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.880
And so everything is
identical on both sides.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.770
And it was very thoughtfully
designed that way.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.760
But there are so many clues.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.090
And I think one thing,
when you experience

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.110
the exhibit today, the
one thing that you really

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:31.570
need to put aside is that
old mantra of do not touch.

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.450
Because this is an exhibit
where you're really

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.710
encouraged to touch
and to feel and to feel

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.940
the smoothness and the roughness
or whatever in the models

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.650
that you're looking at.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.380
it's a multi-sensory
experience that I

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.350
think will be just fascinating
and really inspiring

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.937
for all of you to take
full advantage of.

00:16:52.937 --> 00:16:54.520
- Yeah could we talk
a little bit more

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.700
about this idea of
tactile engagement

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.856
with your surroundings and with
objects and ways of acquiring

00:17:00.856 --> 00:17:01.730
knowledge about them.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.800
Because that is something that
there is a kind of very strong

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.500
I think, inhibition
against doing,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.440
once you enter a gallery or
museum space and something

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.710
that we will try to overcome
in encouraging people

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.220
to interact with the objects.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.660
We have taboos against
touching, operating in society

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.180
that very much
condition the way we

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.890
engage an event
like an art viewing.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.820
- To me what's fascinating
about what you'll see tonight

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.230
is, the walls that you'll kind
of move up against and start

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.790
to touch and put your ear to
and really engage that wall.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.850
I think that again, goes
back to an invitation

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.850
to have a relationship
or think about buildings

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.880
in a completely different way.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.900
Then I think, typically
we think of them

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.770
as objects and things that
are separate from ourselves.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:12.380
And I think that's a
very detrimental way

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.200
for all of us to think about
the spaces that we inhabit.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.962
Because that distance
is I think, sort of

00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:22.280
at the core of why we
even have a sustainability

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.480
problem in the first place.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.900
Because we in essence,
have sort of lost touch

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.460
with the very thing
that we create

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.470
to surround ourselves with.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:36.170
A building is much like
a shell is to a mollusk.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:41.480
How this building shares
and embraces my body,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.670
it also embraces all of you.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.370
And that kind of
shared embrace to me,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.200
is what I started to
think a lot about when

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.290
I'm listening to that wall
and hearing the weather that's

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.380
taking place somewhere else.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.240
So I think, looking at
that as an invitation,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.450
and then over time, how
that touch will probably

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.596
soil that wall.

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:01.970
I think that that
to me, is going

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.740
to be really interesting to come
back at the end of the display

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.950
and begin to see the
markings of what got left,

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.460
and that kind of [INAUDIBLE]
set that that wall will take on

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.110
over time is also something
that's very interesting.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.370
And invites us to think about
the life of the building

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.020
and how buildings
age just like we age.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.380
And that there's grace
to that, and that's

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.590
what I'm hoping we as
architects will start

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.320
to pay more attention to,
rather than what it simply looks

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.750
like as an object.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.330
- And Hansel and I have
had some conversations

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.650
about what are elements
of building design today.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.980
Because he specializes in
kind of creating spaces

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.860
that are optimal for
deaf and hard of hearing.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.660
And my interests in
accessibility and universal

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.430
design, talk about
using the building

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.792
and giving clues for
primarily, navigation.

00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:01.250
That's always the
biggest challenge

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.660
for blind and visually impaired.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.770
But lately, I've also
thought about sound and sound

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.160
absorption and sound
reflection, and how

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.550
that works in a building
and lighting as well.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.220
Good lighting in a
building is incredibly

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.010
important to someone
who has low vision

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.470
and can utilize that vision.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.350
It's also important to someone
who's deaf or hard of hearing,

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.880
because the better
the lighting is,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.379
the better they're
going to perceive

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:29.600
the environment they're
in when they can't hear.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.470
So we've had some
conversations about shared

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:38.510
environmental aspects of design
that really touch each other

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.880
and complement each
other in a way that

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.140
makes a building even more
universally usable for all.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.060
- And to make the
walls even friendlier

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.020
to snuggle up against
or put your ear to.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.740
We painted them
with milk paint, so

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.840
that even just an hour
after painting it,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.420
there aren't any of
those noxious fumes

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.790
you associate with other paints.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.752
So it's a very
subtle intervention,

00:21:04.752 --> 00:21:08.970
but it makes a difference
in that moment.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.960
- Now when you press here,
you're up against the wall,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.330
you will hear again
the live sounds

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.970
from outdoors, the weather
report, and the Beaufort Wind

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:19.750
Scale.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.330
And so you're really bringing
kind of weather and the climate

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.030
into the gallery.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.170
Why weather?

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.590
Why this interest in
weather and in the climate?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.920
- I was telling Yukio that
I just spent the last year

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.930
living in Glasgow, Scotland.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.220
And everyone talks about
the weather all the time.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.390
It's a big part of living
in Scotland, is the weather

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.150
and it's not like
always a bad thing.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.930
It's just what you talk about.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.610
And if it was sunny
for five days,

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.693
on the 6th day, everyone
talks about what a relief

00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:52.350
it is that the air feels fresh.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.820
Because it's raining.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.680
And so, I was thinking
a lot about weather.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.930
And also listening
to the BBC, they

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.700
have this shipping forecast.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.250
Which is this old
forecast that people like

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.540
go to sleep listening to it.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.810
It's really a much
loved forecast.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.460
And they used the Beaufort Wind
Scale in the shipping forecast.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.000
So I think we became
interested in that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.130
But I've also
interested in just what

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.290
is the climate or the
atmosphere for these houses?

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.985
And so, it's the weather
both and bringing it

00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:35.750
in from outdoors and
creating its own climate

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.650
within the space.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.100
- To build on that, I think
one of the things that

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.620
is also interesting
is again, how

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.460
contemporary that commentary is.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.010
Positioning weather and
buildings is going back

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:55.450
to this idea, the building is
sort of a skin if you will.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.870
As we've matured into the
whole era of sustainability,

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:03.730
we now have buildings where
windows don't necessarily open.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.870
Mechanical systems are driving
the temperature of the room.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.500
Often times acoustics,
this room actually

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.990
has really wonderful
acoustics, many times it's

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.360
hard to hear a speaker or
hard to hear yourself think,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.930
because of the mechanical
systems are designed poorly.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.350
We're completely separated
from that weather.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.700
And somehow weather
has become a bad thing

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.140
or to have that permeable skin.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.100
In the deaf community,
what that meant

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:39.130
was older buildings before
there was the existence of air

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.990
conditioning
systems or lighting,

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.870
buildings were much more
attuned to borrowing

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.120
those natural systems,
be it light or wind,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.640
or even temperature.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.460
And those then, gave buildings a
much more kind of navigability.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.470
They gave them the
quality of light

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.560
was much better for
reading sign language.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.450
We lost all of
that when we began

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.620
to introduce electric
light and air

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.400
conditioning into buildings.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.870
Even room dimensions,
hallways were much wider

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.210
for the circulation and
stratification of air.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.120
All of that changed as we
began to shrink buildings,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.150
largely for control
of temperature.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.570
So I think seeing these together
and seeing how weather is

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.010
our friend, like in Scotland.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.050
Rainy is good.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.270
I think there's a real
lesson to learn there

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.390
about how we think
about our environment

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.280
and where we think about
our own membrane is.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280
Is it another sweater?

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.440
Is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.680
So I think again,
your work is really

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.910
an invitation to
think about buildings

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.560
in a really wonderful new way.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.900
- And going back, I mean
it's going back in time

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.800
to the Howe Building
which is the main building

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.220
on the Perkins
campus where there's

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.670
these two long colonnades.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.950
And along them they're
windows, so in the summertime

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.380
they were originally
all open, so

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.930
that as you walk
down the colonnade

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.180
you'd feel the
breeze on one cheek.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.980
And so it would orient you.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.670
You know where you are.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.400
And I don't know if they're
still open in the summer.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.490
- Yes, they still are.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.280
- Good.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.620
- We just finished
a renovation project

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.870
on one end of the Howe Building
to modernize it a little bit

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.670
and make it more
wheelchair accessible,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.590
but that portion of the building
is still very much high windows

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:40.150
and very thick walls to keep
the cool in and the heat out

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.170
in the summer and vice versa.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.720
So there's still a lot of
100-plus year-old architecture

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.100
that lives on every day.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.620
- When I was in Ohio talking
with Celia at the Ohio State

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.712
School for the
Blind, she commented

00:25:55.712 --> 00:25:57.170
that in one of the
classrooms, they

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.640
had rebuilt the windows
are really high,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.100
and so the children
who were blind

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.540
had no idea what the
weather was outside.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.930
And they'd have to ask her
well, what's going on outside?

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.450
And so it seemed really
important to bring the weather

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.950
in.

00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:19.600
One of the interesting
things about the show

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.992
is the equivalence you
make between the models

00:26:22.992 --> 00:26:23.950
and the gallery itself.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.825
And of course, that's
underscored by the fact

00:26:25.825 --> 00:26:27.550
that one of the
models in the show

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.340
is of the Johnson-Kulakundis
gallery, which you,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.050
yourself made.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.610
But which kind of leads
me back to the models.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:42.610
And I just wanted to ask, when
you encountered the models,

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.370
well I guess this is a
question for all of you.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:51.250
What went into the
selection process?

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.920
I guess could you tell
us a little bit more

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.220
about your fascination
with the models?

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.880
- When you first invited
me to do something here,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.440
I wanted to reproduce the
Howe building at Radcliffe

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.220
and it was not practical.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.750
So, I couldn't do it.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:15.580
So then I sort of revisited our
visit, Hansel's and my visit

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.141
and going down in to
that tactile museum.

00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:20.890
And I was thinking I
just wanted to bring,

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.860
make a kind of cabinet
of curiosities here.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.950
But it was really the buildings
which were of interest.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.760
And then when Lily
discovered that there

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.330
is this whole cache
of them in Ohio,

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.870
then that got really
exciting and so

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.500
there's a lot of them in Ohio.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.740
Dozens, but they're
all in storage.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.190
And so we chose the ones which
were the most travelable, which

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.440
were in the best condition.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.040
And also to have sort
of a range of monuments

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.276
and then and domestic buildings.

00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:00.400
- You've given them a
wonderful kind of new chapter

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.720
in their afterlife.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.780
And Kim could you
say a little bit more

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:11.500
about the history of the
pedagogical use of the models.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.860
Architectural models are
really, tactile models

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.780
are a really fascinating way
of understanding architecture

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.460
and scale.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.290
- They actually absolutely are.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.740
And I can remember
the first time

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:29.770
I actually got to look at one
of the WPA models at Perkins.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.410
I didn't go to
Perkins as a student,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.570
I went to another school for
the blind in another state.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.120
And always wished while I
was in school that someday I

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.220
could go to Perkins,
never knowing

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.950
that one day I was going to
get a degree in library science

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.620
and become the Director
of the Library at Perkins.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.970
So it was kind of a wonderful
story, but touching the models

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:53.500
and just knowing
the story of the WPA

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.720
and the craftsman
of the era that,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.210
pulling those people together
to create such beautiful models.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.760
And then, that's what
you'll get to experience

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.720
when you go to the gallery.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:13.350
But it's so meaningful, because
the Parthenon for example,

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.900
is a very huge building.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.010
And very challenging
to describe.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:26.650
So I've always known that models
played a very important role

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.880
in teaching blind and
visually impaired kids.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.810
Most of the time it had been
used for animals and things

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.400
like that, but having
buildings, cathedrals,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.550
bridges is another thing that
we have several bridge models

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.280
at Perkins.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.361
Because we've got a
bridge right here in town

00:29:48.361 --> 00:29:49.360
that isn't all that old.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.900
The Zakim Bridge, how do you
describe the Zakim Bridge

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.489
to somebody who has never--
How do you touch a bridge?

00:29:56.489 --> 00:29:57.530
You don't touch a bridge.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.390
You need a model.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:04.000
And my other model experience
was the space shuttle.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.930
I lost my vision when I was 11
and so that was before there

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.060
was a space shuttle.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.150
I knew it was some
kind of little machine

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.970
thing that had these big
wheels and things like that.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.870
But I didn't really know what
it did until I saw a model

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.500
at Perkin's.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.880
So even these models are
phenomenally beautiful.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.960
They're carved.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.330
They're art in themselves.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:33.550
But even a plastic model can
convey so much information

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.420
and using them.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.850
Rockets and like you
said, you saw a rocket

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.310
in the tactile museum.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.630
They really bring
home what an object is

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.830
and how it works by having
that opportunity to feel

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:52.307
the whole dimension of the
object or the building.

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:54.640
- One of the interesting
things about the models that we

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.514
discussed when we had
a walk through earlier,

00:30:56.514 --> 00:31:01.130
was how it conveys
scale and texture.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:05.720
Which is interesting because
Hansel, as you mentioned,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.540
some of those wood components,
if they were scaled up properly

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.870
would be enormous pieces
of wood in relation to--

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.530
- Yeah, I find their
craftsmanship just really

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.806
compelling, because
of that play on scale.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.790
Some of the houses are
made out of plywood

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.240
that we build our houses with.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.310
So you'll have this wood
grain in this house that

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.740
would be, a strand
of wood would be

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.080
as big as my body
or a little nail

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.750
might be the size of this table.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.350
There's just some way in the
craftsmanship that all of that

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.790
comes together.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.990
That it really shows
the hand in the making.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.944
And so, in some
ways, I find that one

00:31:47.944 --> 00:31:49.610
of the most beautiful
parts of the model

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.430
is you see their making.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.280
And I think that's another
way that this idea of touch,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.670
it touches through
time that way.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.510
And I think that I find them
really beautiful that way.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.290
You'll notice some of
the models also will

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.410
have some variation in color.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.330
And I think that, this
is my own suspicion,

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.270
but I think that was
the craftsmen who

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:15.140
are looking at the idea
of high contrast of color

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.170
for people who are
low-vision to begin

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.570
to discern certain
building types or parts.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:26.720
So they're playing with
that as well as texture,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.310
the way they play in light.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.500
On the idea of scale,

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.360
I'm certain I'm
wrong about this,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.460
but I'm going to say it anyway.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:37.550
You'll see that the Capitol
building is in there and then

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.900
the Washington Monument.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.660
And they're almost
close enough in scale

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.585
that you could probably
set them up in the room

00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:47.000
and see the relationship
between those two

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.070
in a way that would
help you understand

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.470
our national monument in a
way that you don't really,

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.862
when you're there.

00:32:52.862 --> 00:32:54.320
And this is a place
I see everyday,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.470
living in Washington DC.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:33:00.680
So I think those
elements that we're not

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.200
accustomed to looking
at, these models really

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.240
show that really beautifully.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.570
- There's a part of
the exhibit that I

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.490
want to be sure
people don't miss,

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.300
because it's not really
a model, but it is.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.370
And it's outside
of the exhibit hall

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:21.500
itself, so make sure you
see outside the window

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.400
of the exhibit hall
when you're there,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.300
that the trees on
the wall there.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.830
They were made by the WPA.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.660
They're labeled in Braille.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.830
And they are
different tree species

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.930
in a two dimensional replica
made of wood on the walls.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.280
So they're kind of fun, because
again, think about trees.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.560
Even when you climb a
tree as a blind kid,

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.220
you're not going to get the full
sense of the shape of the tree.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.400
So there's one particular
tree on that wall

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.920
that I told my
colleagues here, I

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.700
had no idea what a
poplar tree looked like.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.710
So go look at a
poplar tree and you'll

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.560
see why I was so mystified
at what it looked

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.560
like when I touched it today.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.640
- And they have
small figures carved

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.870
in the bases of the trunks.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.078
Do give you a sense of scale.

00:34:10.078 --> 00:34:11.480
- Yes, that represent a person.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.630
So you can see the scale
with the little person

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.325
at the bottom, you can feel it.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.030
- And the models are decidedly
not architectural models.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.730
I was talking with Hansel
about this, being an architect.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.770
But architectural
models are made

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.250
to sell an idea to a client.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.380
And these are not made to
sell an idea to a client.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.699
They're made to be
touched and to be handled.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.980
And so in some ways, they
resemble doll's houses,

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.620
dollhouses a little
bit more than they

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.210
would an architectural model.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.670
- Yeah and I reminded
Wendy that one

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.219
of the travesties I
think is certainly

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.409
in architectural education
when I went to school

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.281
is learning how to make models.

00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:56.239
One of the first things
they tell you is you're

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.960
not making a dollhouse.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.230
This is about architecture.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.339
It's about the concept.

00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:04.130
We talked about that
earlier this afternoon

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.650
and it just now kind
of dawned on me.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.820
Again here, that's kind
of like teaching children

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.860
not to draw these,
to be creative.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.380
Color between the
lines kind of idea.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.990
And I think there
again, there's embedded

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.570
in our educational system is
this idea that you shouldn't

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.460
touch.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.210
You shouldn't make models that
you want to break or touch.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:32.700
So I think this idea of going
back and rebuilding dollhouses.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.200
I think we should
re-introduce that.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.840
- The models certainly
look like they're,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.020
as you said, they're meant to
be touched and that's Wendy,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.050
why you wanted to make your own
model rather than Commission

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.670
someone else to make it.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.510
- Right, at first
Meghan had offered

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:55.190
that that the architectural firm
that designed the space, maybe

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.650
they could make the model.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.160
And so I went to
visit their offices

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.284
and looked at their models.

00:35:59.284 --> 00:36:02.130
And there's like, no.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.810
There was a completely
different everything.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:06.490
Different style.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.650
- Well it's not
quite architecture,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.120
but there is this
wonderful anecdote Kim,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.060
that you told about how
tactile engagement helps

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.760
to kind of allow one
to know an object

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.820
and it concerns one
of your trips to I

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.980
believe it was Hawaii.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.916
You said, when you were
given a tour of a ship.

00:36:23.916 --> 00:36:26.290
And I was wondering if you
could kind of just relay that.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.400
- Oh I'd love to
share that story.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.370
- Very pertinent to my what
we're talking about here.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.040
- My husband and I, my
husband's in the front row here.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.350
And we were traveling
in Hawaii and we

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.130
were with a man who had been
very much involved in bringing

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:45.190
the USS Missouri to Honolulu
as a permanent museum for World

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.460
War II.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.330
And he took us on
a tour of the ship

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.630
and showed us a lot
of different things.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.900
And we were on the
main deck and he said,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.330
the kamikazes would
crash their planes

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:02.600
into the side of the
battleships trying to sink them.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.150
And that there was a
place on the Missouri

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.150
where that had happened.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.900
And I asked how far down
from the deck it was.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.600
And he said it's
about 12 inches down.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.230
And so I said, can I touch it?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.790
And he said, well sure.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.860
So I got down on the ground
and put my hand over the edge

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:27.380
and felt the dent in the side
of this battleship that I was on

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.070
and it brought it
to life for me.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.785
But what really brought it
to life was when I stood up,

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:37.690
I said to him, have
you ever touched that?

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.020
And he goes, no I haven't.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.210
I said, well do it.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.530
And he got down on
his knees and he

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.370
felt it and he sounded like
he had tears in his eyes

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:47.090
when he stood up.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:49.670
He said, I've been on
this ship dozens of times

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.320
and I never did that.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.360
And that meant so much
to me, so there's just

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.620
that whole extra level
of the sense of touch

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.589
and what it can bring
to the occasion.

00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:03.380
- This is so interesting,
one of the things

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:09.980
that really again
kind of permeates

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.520
the exhibition is this
relationship between language

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.170
and the other senses, and
tactility in particular.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.060
And it's both manifest
in the Beaufort Wind

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.880
Scale and the relationship
between verbal description

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.120
and visual description.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:31.130
But also in the very handouts
and postcards for the show,

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.900
which are printed
in Braille as well.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.130
And was something I think we
were talking about earlier.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.900
But it's something
I think that was

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.850
particularly important for
us to do for the show Wendy,

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.954
could you elaborate
a little bit on--

00:38:47.954 --> 00:38:51.866
- Well, for the
card for the show,

00:38:51.866 --> 00:38:53.240
it was really
important that this

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.570
be something that could be read
by someone who read Braille,

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.870
as well as by someone
who read Roman letters.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.387
And so the Braille
is superimposed.

00:39:02.387 --> 00:39:04.220
They're imprinted right
on top of the other.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.460
And so, it can be read equally.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.210
And I just love that sort
of simultaneous translation,

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.180
one right on top of the other
and it doesn't, neither one

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.900
interrupts the other.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.120
- And even for those of
us who don't read Braille,

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.590
it's kind of a very appealing,
kind of moving thing,

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.530
to be able to feel
it in our hands.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:30.900
Re-sensitizes us
to our fingertips.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.890
- Yes you just hold the card
and it's like oh, something

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.086
is different.

00:39:36.086 --> 00:39:37.640
- Sensory objects.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.560
Well, we're pretty much
out of time for the panel.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.070
So, what I wanted to do was now
invite everybody again with us,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.400
to move to the
neighboring Byerly Hall

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.074
to join us for a reviewing of
the show and the reception.

00:39:52.074 --> 00:39:54.240
But before that to join me
in thanking our panelists

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.990
[INAUDIBLE]
