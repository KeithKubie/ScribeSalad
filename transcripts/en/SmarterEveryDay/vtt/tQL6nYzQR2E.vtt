00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.030
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I'm in a, kind of a strange...

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.050
Oh! It's a golden play button. That can only mean one thing.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
Somebody famous.
- Not quite famous, I want to say.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
- So this is mystery guitar man, and if you've checked out YouTube for any amount of time you know who he is.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
He makes really cool videos and the reason I like your videos is because I think they're smart.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.140
- You think so?
- I do think they're smart.
- Well thank you.
- I've always wanted to see one of your smart videos being made

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.190
so that's what you're doing now? With... this.
- Yeah yeah, this is

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.210
a zoetrope.
- A what?
- A zoetrope. I can try to take

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.230
some of these letters, and... ahh!
- There we go. [laugh]

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.280
You have this cylinder, and it has a bunch of animation frames

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.310
up top. You see right now it's really blurry. They have all these frames which is basically

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.350
like, you know, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, right?

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.390
- Like stop motion right?
- Yeah like stop motion basically yeah. When you spin it,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.420
the slits act as a shutter so then you get to see

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.460
little birds flying around.
- So why do you need the slits?
- You need the slits because

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
otherwise your brain, your eyes are seeing way too many frames

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.500
and it can't make sense of them.
- Ohh.. so basically we're eliminating all the parts

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.520
that we don't want to see, so you're putting the image in one specific spot, it's like you're

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.560
indexing it or something. So what does that have to do with a record?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.590
This isn't a Neil Diamond record is it?
- No no no, it's just a very cheap record,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.620
somebody's demo record I guess. Basically,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.640
I just spin it like this, and at the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.660
speed that it spins, which is as fast as I made it go like this,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.710
I have my camera shooting at 23 frames per second.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.730
- A very expensive camera right?
- It's pretty expensive yeah, it's a good investment.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.750
Imagine it spinning very slowly, like this is one frame

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.770
And then this is the next frame, and then this is the next frame.
- So basically it's like aliasing

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.820
only it's constructive.
- Yeah, I like that, constructive aliasing.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.830
I think you just invented a new term. So I tried out a really weird frame rate like

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.880
23.2 frames per second and I can mess with the pitch too.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.920
So this specific very cheap USB thing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.970
Like if I, I can slow it down, and turn it up, and you can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.980
hear in the song actually [very fast music slows down]

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.030
You can hear...
- That's pretty awesome.
[music speed varying]

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.070
- Enough of that, for the copyright. [laugh]

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.110
- That's pretty sweet.
- Yeah so that's how it works basically.
- So enough about that,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.170
How long did it take to do this?
- This is what took the longest. I had to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.200
cut out I think 1300 different frames.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.220
This bascially is like, you know, just go up and line it up correctly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.260
- Are you serious?
- Yeah yeah.
- So what are these by the way?
- These are little frames

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.270
I would basically paste like this, go to the next one

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.280
paste it, go to the next one, paste it. And basically these are

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.290
in sequence all of the frames of the video. And while going, turn the camera on for a second.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.290
Done. Turn the camera off. Do this, shut all the lights off.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.320
Take all these frames off. Throw them on the floor,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.350
and then put the new frames on, turn it on, turn the camera on, turn the lights on

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.370
- So this is exactly why I like his videos, is because they're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.400
awesome but they're brute force.
- Brute force yes.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.460
- Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
- So if the video was three seconds long, I'd say that the video was just

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.500
from here to here, right, then we

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.520
would need 72 frames, because I did one frame every second

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.540
- Gotcha.
- Which equals to four full zoetropes, because it's

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.560
18 times 18 times 18.. [mumble] which is 72 right?
- Gotcha.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.590
OK so when you made the video, you actually

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.650
made it one second at a time and then you would reload the entire zoetrope.
- Right.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.690
Exactly yeah. Not exactly one second, it's a little less than a second because only

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.730
18 of them fit here, because this is a smaller

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.740
zoetrope, so I make it 18 24th's of a second

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.760
whatever that goes down to.
- Gotcha. So if you want to see mystery guitarman's video

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.790
or subscribe to him, like I've been subscribed to you for a long time.
- Really?
- Like a really

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.820

- Oh wow. Really long time.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.880
- Long time.
- I might owe you a dollar or two then.
- Excellent. So go check out his channel
