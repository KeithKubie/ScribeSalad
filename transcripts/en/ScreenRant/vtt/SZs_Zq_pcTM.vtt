00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.480
Animated films like Bambi

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.880
Frozen and up often allude to a character death that takes place off screen other children's movies took things a step further by actually showing

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.600
A death on the screen some of these horrific scenes would be hard to handle in live-action films never mind animated hits

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.829
Watch and see various tragic deaths murders and hangings all in animated form when it's an accident. They call it manslaughter

Can you guess which movie is represented by these emoji stay tuned at the end to find out?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.120
You want me to be the bad guy? Fine. Now I'm the bad guy.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.100
Tangled

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.480
let's face it Mother Gothel had it coming she kidnapped Rapunzel as a baby forced her to live a majority of her life in a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.430
tower and stole the magic in her hair

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.090
So she could live eternally there was really no other option for the evil witch except death although her demise was expected

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.868
No
One knew it could be as gruesome as it was as Flynn sits in pain with a mortal wound he chops all of Rapunzel's magical

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.179
Hair off this also meant that Mother Gothel lost all the magic. She used to stay young right before our very eyes

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.489
We saw her wither away to skin and bone

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.400
But even that wasn't enough as she runs around and her body literally dies by the second the mischievous

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.489
chameleon Pascal puts up a chunk of hair to trick mother Gothel and send her flying out the tower window this would have been a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.640
Great time to cut away

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.669
But we see her continue to deteriorate

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.060
As she falls a cut to the wide shot shows just how far she's falling down to her grassy grave by the time

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.220
She reaches the bottom her old body's nothing but rags and dust. yikes!

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.820
rare form of monster known as...

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.490
dolmas

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.390
Monster house

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.159
From the trailers and preview clips the movie Monster House looked like a fun

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.279
Animated adventure about a crazy house that came alive once people saw the film and learned about the houses backstory

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.489
They realized the movie is a lot deeper than they realized. In Monster House the back story involves a lady named Constance

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.149
Who's heavily overweight and made into the laughingstock of a touring circus?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.890
Then she meets nebbercracker the to fall in love and start to build their dream home together

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.179
Just when you think Constance will be happy her gruesome death scene takes place

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.269
standing above the open basement foundation of the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.209
construction site

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.679
Constant loses her balance and falls far down into the hole as she fell her arm pulled on a lever releasing gallons of wet cement

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.560
That poured over her dead body as soon as it landed.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.299
The scene is pretty crazy to watch

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.299
But it only gets worse when the children

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.239
exploring the house see her buried corpse in the form of cement and then later see the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.429
Skeleton that has been trapped underneath it for all these years. The monster house may seem mean and evil

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.530
But viewers look at it with a whole different perspective once they learn the sad truth about what made it haunted

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.600
Ola, did you hear about the latest addition to our family? The richest Espanyol is the perfect place for all you native Spanish speakers out

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.579

Amazing facts interesting people and funny pictures. Check out the richest espanol today

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.389
Needless to say we're all shocked and saddened are the news of a de contrÃ´le...

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.480
Green Lantern Emerald Knights. Green Lantern may not have found success on the big screen

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.240
But that hasn't stopped DC's animated universe from creating a number of animated hits featuring the character. In

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.080
2011 DC released the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.580
Straight-to-video release of Green Lantern Emerald Knights, the film is an anthology of stories that captures the spirit of the Green Lantern

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.660
Universe through a variety of tales and characters. There's one character

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.880
You shouldn't get too attached to though and her name is Arcadian trawl or jacket

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.840
The Green Lantern character appears briefly in the film before she's killed and probably the worst way possible

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.760
My god...

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.560
While flying trawl is pursued by a collection of shadow demons while she's able to fight them off at first the battle becomes too

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.069
Overwhelming without any help, this is when the shadow demons strike

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.469
They slice off her legs than her hands

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.940
And then decapitate her the animation actually shows her lifeless head floating through space did we mention that this movie only has a PG rating?

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.420
The scene looks like something out of saw and the pure agony. She goes through is pretty tough to watch

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.200
*Gun sound made by Tarzan*

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.720
Men like you!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.650
Tarzan

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.620
Tarzan never had it easy in the jungle once raised by gorillas you was always being treated unfairly

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.499
For being different as Tarzan got older

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.369
He was forced to defend his family from predatory animals if things weren't bad enough

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.930
Tarzan had to deal with Clayton and the massive gun he totes around the war between

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.160
Clayton and Tarzan became a serious one where only one person could survive

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.640
Fighting among the trees Clayton was clearly out of his league compared to the more experienced Tarzan.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.240
This was especially true when Clayton became tangled up in a collection of vines

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.540
Tarzan saw Clayton's impending doom and tried to help him,

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:06.280
But it was too late

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.869
Clayton dropped to his death and hung by the vines in the middle of the jungle with a few flashes of lightning we can see

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.489
Clayton's dead body dangling from the vines as a somber tarzan catches his breath. an

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.680
Animated hanging is pretty tough to take and very revealing even if it was just the shadows being shown

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.500
Littlefoot: Mother?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.080
Littlefoot's Mother: Run run!

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.580
The Land Before Time

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:31.919
There's so many different animated films where one or more of the parents have died or are missing from the picture

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.889
While that's sad enough as it is it's nothing compared to seeing the actual parental death in animated form

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.859
this is what the Land Before Time did and one of the saddest animated scenes put to print early on in the movie Littlefoot and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.860
His friend Sara encounter the hungry carnivore nicknamed Sharptooth Sharptooth nearly eats the little dinosaurs before

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.709
littlefoot's mother steps in to save the day the battle

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.539
Obviously took its toll on littlefoot's mother as she can no longer continue the journey to the Great Valley

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.998
As she slowly dies in the pouring rain Littlefoot can't quite comprehend. What's going on

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:09.569
His mother is still able to give Littlefoot plenty of words of wisdom as she lies there and takes her last breath the movie brilliantly

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.569
Stays on the shot for longer than you'd expect

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.299
Really taking in the emotional impact of death and losing a loved one

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.029
It doesn't make the sad scene any easier to watch

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.580
Littlefoot's journey continues in ten plus sequels to the film where he carries on the spirit and drive his mother gave him during her last

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720
moments

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.560
Evangeine likes that, too

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120
The Princess and the Frog

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.179
for Disney's 2009 film The Princess and the Frog

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.828
we're introduced to a whimsical cast of characters one of these characters is Rey a

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.359
Firefly with an old soul and dreams of meeting the love of his life who lives up in the stars

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.430
Rey is crucial to revealing the fake Naveen during a thrilling scene in the film where he tears off a

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:57.268
Magical necklace charm gives it to Tiana and unfortunately Rey's small size gets the best of him as dr. Facili knocks him down

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.279
That's not enough for the cruel, man

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:03.989
Though as he takes one step with his boot and crushes Rey underneath it in a truly devastating

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.869
scene

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:11.699
Luis manages to find Rey barely clinging to life and runs him to Tiana and Naveen as quick as he can has raised light sputters

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:17.368
In and out he takes his last dying breaths and looks up at the stars one last time as he looks forward to reuniting with

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:20.489
Evangeline who knew that a dead bug can make you feel so many

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:24.629
Emotions to help ease the pain Rey is shown in a spiritual form near the end of the film

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.449
I'm done for Wilbur

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.809
In a while I'll be dead.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.010
Charlotte's Web a

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.380
Spiders work is never finished

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.700
And that's truly the case for Charlotte and the classic animation Charlotte's Web the story

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.850
Showcases the unlikely friendship between a pig named Wilbur and a spider willing to do anything to help keep the pig from being slaughtered

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240
Charlotte spends endless nights weaving

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.269
Incredible webs that spell words including some Pig and humble those webs help spare Wilbur's life and prevent him from becoming a plate of bacon

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.370
Or ham by the time the collection of farm animals goes to the local carnival Charlotte is pretty worn out

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.210
And it's obvious what will happen next

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.329
After spinning a web of eggs Charlotte says her goodbyes to Wilbur and quietly dies as she backs away

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.829
The final shot of her death scene shows a few strains of spiderweb blowing in the distance

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:17.690
somehow animators have made a spider feel sympathetic when many people have a fear of the eight-legged creatures Ellie Charlotte's legacy lived on with the

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.059
Birth of five hundred and fourteen children out of all of them three decided to stay on the farm where Wilbur lives

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.220
This created a bittersweet moment in the film. That's pretty hard to have a happy ending with

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.060
Joy: Thats right your theme song! Who's your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong:
Bing Bong, Bing Bong

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.780
Both:His rocket makes you yell "Hooray!"

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
Bing Bong Bing Bon!~

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:42.340
Inside out the majority of the Pixar film inside out takes place inside the mind of an 11 year old girl named Riley

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:49.908
It's there where we're introduced to all types of unique characters including anger fear joy and sadness as joy and sadness go on their adventure

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:55.190
Through the brain of a young girl they also come across the character of bing-bong bing-bong was a whimsical

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.989
Imaginary friend Riley made up when she was younger as she's aged the memory of Bing bong

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:06.109
Isn't as strong as it used to be Bing bong ends up being stuck in Riley's memory dump with joy the characters attempt to escape

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.210
But the weight is too much to get out of the pit

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:14.119
This is when Bing bong decides to sacrifice himself by jumping out of the wagon Bing bong knows his fate now

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.580
And he slowly disappears from the screen lost forever this death scene may only represent an imaginary friend

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:22.279
But it can hit hard for a lot of viewers this

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.460
Represents the loss of innocence the end of childhood and everything that goes away when you get older. We'll miss you Bing bong

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.180
*Evil laughing* (Something) You shall DIE!

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.139
The Black Cauldron

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:40.649
When people talk about the best Disney Villains names like Jafar Ursula and Captain Hook may come up

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:44.578
Well none of them compared to the purely evil Horned King from the Black Cauldron

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.029
The dark Disney fantasy features the Horned King as the main villain

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:55.680
And he's downright scary with glowing red eyes horns and antlers the evil character is enough to give children nightmares for days

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.029
Even his gruesome death scene in the Black Cauldron is scary as the Horned King

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.350
Attempts to send a young boy into the cauldron of doom. He's the one who gets sent inside

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.880
This is when Disney really pushed their limits with death scenes for the dramatic sequence

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.729
The skin is violently torn off the Horned Kings body

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:18.328
He becomes engulfed in flames and blood spins around him as his corpse gets burned alive the whole scene goes on for several

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.389
seconds without any

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:23.060
cutaways to minimize the craziness of the shots the whole thing looked like the

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.740
climactic scenes of Raiders of the Lost Ark when all of the Nazis burned to death

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.380
It's what the Horned King deserved in the end, but we're not quite sure if we needed to see it all

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.280
Simba: dad? Mufasa: hm? Simba: were pals right? Mufasa: Right.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:43.700
and we'll always be together right? 
 The Lion King the Lion King is one of the most emotional films that Disney has ever put out the drama

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.930
betrayal and devastating scenes all stem from Mufasa is tragic death early in the film after

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:54.839
Heroically saving Simba from a stampede he tries to escape the carnage himself and climb up the edge of a cliff

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.419
This is when scar reveals his true colors

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.690
He closeted mufasa's paws and sends him to his death below

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.649
Simba watched on in horror as his father plummeted down even though

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:08.009
It was a large fall into a stampede of animals the film gave us a little

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.289
Hope you would survive after cutting back to his body

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:17.159
Shortly after what makes the death scene even harder to watch is the fact that Simba nudges his dad trying to awaken the dead lion.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:23.159
With no answer Simba has nothing to do but tuck in underneath the arm of his dead dad for one last touch of comfort

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.189
Mufasa is lifeless corpse was on screen for way longer than anyone expected making his death even harder to handle

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:35.249
Sadness quickly turns to anger as scar approaches and pins the blame for mufasa's death directly on Simba

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.299
Thankfully Simba avenges his father's death and saves the pride by the end of the movie

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.000
And there you have it what animated death? Do you think was the most graphic are there? Any we missed?
