WIL WILLIS: Bladesmiths,

00:00:03.128 --> 00:00:05.714
is to forge a Scottish Dirk
that falls within the following

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.382
parameters.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:09.175
The blade must have a single
edge along with a false edge

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.636
that covers at least
one third of the spine

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:15.306
with decorative file work in
addition to a through tang.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:18.977
You will have three hours in
which to forge those blades.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:22.021
Now, on your anvils
there's a cloth.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:22.856
Go ahead and lift that up.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.112
That is 50:100 steel
that you will use

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.239
to forge your Scottish Dirks.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.240
Good luck bladesmiths.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.951
Your three hour starts now.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.953
Welding.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.456
I've never made a blade out
of a three-inch ball bearing.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.374
I'm gonna wait on
this until it's

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.877
almost white on the outside.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.254
Then I plan on beating the
crap out of that steel.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.506
[intense music]

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.801
DAVID BAKER: You
want that yellow glow

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.386
when it comes out of the forge
before you start hitting it.

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:55.764
DOUG MARCAIDA: Yeah.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:56.806
And as you're workin'
it, as soon as it starts

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.892
losin' color, back in the forge.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.811
This challenge is perfect
for this Scotch-Irish here.

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.564
WIL WILLIS: You have 60 minutes
remaining to finish your work.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.440
Yeah.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.150
[intense music]

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.235
I'm having a blast
making this blade.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.322
I don't know about you guys,
but I think this is awesome.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.700
Doran doesn't seem to have
a Dirk point on his blade.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.368
No.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.703
DAVID BAKER: He's got a bit
of a chopper point on there.

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.830
DORAN: This man's
usin' a hammer.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.249
Well, that looks like
hammered [bleep]..

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.709
DOUG MARCAIDA:
Jonathan and Ben have

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.503
that Dirk look, same with Phil.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.505
They all dropped to the point.
- Yes.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:30.465
It really is
concerning, Doran's

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:31.841
doesn't look like a Dirk.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.511
[intense music]

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.346
I have minutes to
get this thing done.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.388
I'm lookin' at the temperature.

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:38.681
I'm lookin' at the color.

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.391
I don't know this
steel that well.

00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:43.102
But I have to quench now.

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.270
BEN ABBOTT: There you go.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.607
Doran into the
fire for a quench.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.526
DAVID BAKER: The problem
is if it keeps reigniting--

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.236
Agh.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.278
DAVID BAKER: --you know it's
hot enough to ignite the oil.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.446
Put it back in in the oil.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.489
Agh.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.281
BEN ABBOTT: It's still red hot.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.366
Get it in the oil.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.909
I'm not likin' that.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.118
BEN ABBOTT: Now he's checkin'--

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.119
WIL WILLIS: It's
still red in places.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.995
BEN ABBOTT: --the hardness.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:01.704
The thing is still red.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.580
I'm not happy.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.998
Time's running out.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.291
I have to re-quench.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.793
And if that doesn't
work, I'm done.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.003
[intense music]

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:17.053
WIL WILLIS: Five,
four, three, two, one.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.722
Bladesmiths shut down your
machines, drop your tools.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.307
Woo.
Hell yeah.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.017
This round is over.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.520
Bladesmiths, in this first round
of competition, each of you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.189
made a Scottish
Dirk, Dave Baker's

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.732
favorite fighting knife.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.652
Now it's time for the
judges to examine your work.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.987
Ben, you're up first.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.030
Please present your
play to the judges.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.616
[technical swoosh]

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.285
DOUG MARCAIDA: I like how
you put your false edge.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:41.536
It's very aggressive in that.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.413
It's a very beautiful
looking blade.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.206
DAVID BAKER: Ben,
you got cracks.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:48.084
The crack here at the tang
is worrisome, which is

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.128
a critical part of that blade.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.381
If you move forward, it's
gonna have to be addressed.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.716
WIL WILLIS: Phil,
you're up next.

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:57.010
Please present your
play to the judges.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.888
[technical swoosh]

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.015
DAVID BAKER: When I see
a Dirk, this is very

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.058
much the shape I like to see.

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:07.020
It's got a very key
point for thrusting.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.272
But there's enough mass
in that blade for a chop.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.608
A bit of a warp in your tang.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.903
Other than that,
absolutely gorgeous.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.237
WIL WILLIS: Doran you're up.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:19.073
Please present your
work to the judges.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:22.076
[technical swoosh]

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:24.704
DOUG MARCAIDA: Well, Doran,
you turned in a solid piece.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.122
You know with a
50:100, you're always

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.165
worried about the cracks.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.791
But you maintained your heat.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:30.585
And that's one of the things
I like about your blade.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:34.213
I do not see any cracks at all.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:37.967
All right, you've
got a flat spine

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.552
and then it rises
towards the tip.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.180
Most of the Dirks
drop towards the tip.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.890
That's kinda missing
in your design.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.518
It's not the typical Dirk point
that I was expecting to see.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:48.853
All right Jonathan, you're up.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.188
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.898
[technical swoosh]

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.358
BEN ABBOTT: I like the
shape of your blade.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.901
It's got that
classic Dirk shape.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.944
It does drop to the front.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487
It has a false edge.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.405
But there's some surface
cracking on this blade here.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.491
It would be nice to see
if you can grind'em away.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.453
But other than that,
it's a Dirk, well done.

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.372
WIL WILLIS:
Bladesmiths, the judges

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.581
deliberation is complete.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.875
And they've made
a final decision.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.002
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.838
[intense music]

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:20.093
--Ben, your blade
didn't make the cut.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.553
Doug Marcaida is
gonna tell you why.

00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:25.765
Ben, we really like the
look and design of your Dirk.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.184
But you developed cracks
at critical junctures

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.352
of your blade.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.062
You had cracks in your spine.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:34.274
You had cracks on your tang
that went all the way through.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.526
And we just feel that you
will not be able to fix that.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.904
And for this reason,
we're sending you home.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:43.741
WIL WILLIS: Ben, please,
surrender your blade.

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.451
BEN: I'm absolutely
devastated that I'm not

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.619
movin' on to the next round.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.287
Thank you.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:50.665
I came out here to prove
that I was a great bladesmith.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.041
I worked hard.

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:54.043
I did everything I felt
like I needed to do.

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.212
But I never messed with 50:100.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.755
And it is a bitch.

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:58.756
