00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.610
It's time to update
the Weather App again.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.470
To store the list of cities that
the user wants to keep track of.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.410
Here's what I want you to do, 1, take
a look at a few of the storage libraries

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.575
and pick the one that you
think will work best for you.

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.620
I've made some recommendation
in the instructor notes but

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.875
you can use anything you like.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.750
2.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.570
Add a function that will save the list
of cities the user has added and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.720
hook it up so that it saves
whenever the user adds a city.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760
Third, update the apps so

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.210
that on start up it checks to see
if the user has any saved cities.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.600
If it does, get the latest data for
those cities and update the cards for

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.070
those cities.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.150
If it doesn't,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.980
simulate the server injecting the data
into your app JS file and render that.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.670
When you've completed this step,
your app should show the weather for

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.510
the default city,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.550
for the first time the app loads and
allow the user to ad new cities.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.190
But then when we load it the user
sees a list of cities that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.280
they want to know about.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.320
Be sure to compare your app to the link
in the instructor notes below and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.420
make sure it works exactly the same.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.890
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.850
How does it work on Firefox,
Safari, or UC browser?
