00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
Last week, we introduced Max Weber’s
three dimensions of social stratification:
economic class, social status, and power.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.160
But how do those three things actually interact,
in the real world?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.040
What does social stratification look like
in the here and now?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.400
Or, I guess I should say, what does stratification
look like in the United States right now?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.720
For all the non-Americans watching,
don’t you worry – we will be getting to
stratification around the world later.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.760
But for today, we’re gonna focus on the United
States and how social inequality plays out here.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.500
Do we live up to the ideals that Jefferson laid
out in the Declaration of Independence?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.180
Are all men created equal?

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.460
Spoiler alert: Sociology says, not so much.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:45.480
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.800
When you hear people talking about inequality
in the US, chances are they’re talking specifically
about income inequality or wealth inequality.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.040
So let’s start there.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.540
First, we’re gonna split the US into 5 even
groups, 20% of the population in each.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.660
These are what social scientists call quintiles.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.760
As of 2015, households in the US that make
less than $22,800 a year are the bottom quintile
of the income distribution.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.780
The exact middle of the distribution, or the median
of household income, was about $56,000 a year.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.980
And the top quintile?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.460
That’s every household making over
$117,000 a year.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.760
Now, the simple fact that these quintiles
have different incomes tells us that we don’t
have a perfectly equal society.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.300
Perfect equality would mean the same
income for everyone.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.200
So, there’s clearly some income stratification
in the US.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.280
But how much?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.960
The households in the top quintile earn about
50% of all the income in the United States.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.360
And about 20% of all income is earned by the
top 5% alone.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.840
And the bottom quintile?

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.640
These households earn only 3.4% of the total
income in the US.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.400
Those are pretty huge differences!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.720
And they get even bigger when we
talk about wealth.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.800
First things first: Wealth is NOT the same
thing as income.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600
Income is the money you earn from
work or investments,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.120
whereas wealth is the total value of the money and other assets you hold, like real estate and stocks and bonds.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.680
For the bottom quintile, average household
wealth levels are negative.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.540
That’s because part of wealth is debt – so
if you have more debt than positive assets,
your wealth is negative.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.600
So we’ve got an average net worth of about
negative $6,000 for the bottom quintile and a
median household wealth level of about $68,000.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.460
Any guesses what the top might look like?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.400
Well, the top quintile’s household income
was about twice the median income.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.320
So, maybe a good guess would be about
what? $140,000 for wealth?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.500
Wrong. The average net worth for those in the top
quintile is 9 times that of the median – $630,000.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.740
And that’s not even close to the wealth
levels for the top 1%.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.160
According to the US Census Bureau, the
cut-off for entering the top 1% of the wealth
distribution is $2.4 million.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.800
Wealth levels also tend to vary by demographic
group.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.310
For example, women tend to have lower individual
wealth levels than men.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.180
Married couples accumulate more wealth than
people who are unmarried.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.920
And race and wealth are closely linked –
the median wealth level of a White household
is about 12 times that of a Black household.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.140
One of the main sources of wealth for Americans
is homeownership.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.580
White Americans are much more likely to
own houses than Black Americans,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.620
and the neighborhoods that White
Americans live in tend to be wealthier
– even if you control for income.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.040
Patrick Sharkey, an American sociologist
who researches neighborhoods and wealth,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.140
found that black families making $100,000 a year
live in the types of neighborhoods that a white
family making only $30,000 would live in.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.780
So, where are these gaps coming from?

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.760
Well, for one thing, a lot of wealth is passed
on through generations.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.100
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble
to talk about redlining,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.360
a practice from the not-so-distant past
that has made it harder for African-American
families to accumulate and pass on wealth.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.460
In the 1930s, the government founded
the Federal Housing Agency,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.360
an office set up to regulate mortgages and interest
rates, to guard against the types of foreclosures
that happened during the Great Depression.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.080
The FHA began insuring mortgages, and since
these mortgages were backed by the government,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.480
they made getting a house less risky and easier
for many Americans.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480
Which is great!

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.920
Except they didn’t make it easier for all
Americans.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.400
The big banks that issued the loans engaged in a practice called redlining,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.780
in which they’d literally draw a red line line on a map around neighborhoods they considered too risky to invest in.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.220
If your house was within that red line, the
banks wouldn’t give you a loan.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.580
And the neighborhoods that got redlined were the ones where minorities, particularly Black families, lived.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.640
Redlining was outlawed in 1968,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.020
but because homeownership is the major source of wealth for most Americans,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.340
neighborhood segregation and racial wealth
inequalities are the legacies of policies like redlining.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.480
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.800
OK, so on the money front, the US isn’t
looking all that equal.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.480
And money – particularly wealth – doesn’t
just influence economic class.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.310
It’s also a form of power, including political
power.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.700
A 2014 study by American political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.460
looked at the relationship between the political views of those at the top of the income distribution, and the laws that are actually passed.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.260
They found that the views of those at the top have a significant, positive relationship with laws getting passed,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.040
while the views of people at the middle of the income distribution have pretty much zero correlation with what laws actually get passed.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.100
But remember: Correlation doesn’t mean causation.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.380
The study doesn’t tell us WHY higher income
is related to more political influence.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.120
The economic elite’s influence could come
through donations to political candidates.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.780
But higher income is also correlated with higher
education levels – and more highly educated people
tend to be more civically active, too.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.340
Now, there are many factors besides income and
wealth that influence social stratification in the US.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.060
For example, there’s occupation.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.880
If you’re an adult, probably the first question
that people ask you is, “What do you do?”

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.840
That’s because the jobs we do – and what
other people think of those jobs – are a major
part of our socioeconomic status.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.060
You probably have opinions about what
jobs are cool, what jobs are impressive –
and what jobs you’d never work at.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.000
Those kinds of opinions are what the
National Opinion Research Center, a think
tank at the University of Chicago,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.660
was interested in when they created a
ranking of ‘occupational prestige.’

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.780
Top of the list?

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.800
Surgeons, College Presidents, Lawyers, Nuclear
Physicists, Astronauts.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.120
Smack dab in the middle, getting an average
rating of 5, are jobs like Purchasing Managers, Office
Supervisors, IT technicians, Private Detectives.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.860
That’s right, all you office managers out
there, you are just as cool as Veronica Mars.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.440
And the bottom of the list are jobs like busboys,
parking lot attendants, and telephone solicitors.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.930
You might notice there’s some similarities
in the types of jobs in each category.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.540
For one thing, jobs with occupational prestige
typically pay pretty well.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.880
We have overlapping spheres of stratification here – you get social and financial benefits from being a lawyer.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.460
Busboy?
Not so much.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.230
The other thing you might notice is that all
five of the most prestigious jobs require an
advanced degree.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.940
And not just a college degree – people
in those jobs typically have some sort of
post-grad education as well.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.660
The jobs at the bottom of the prestige scale,
however, don’t require a college degree, and
many don’t even require a high school diploma.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.420
So the kind of education you have ends up
being pretty important for where you end up
in terms of social status.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.900
Most American adults have a high school diploma
– about 88% as of 2015.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.780
But only 33% of Americans over the age of
25 have a bachelor’s degree, and even fewer
– 12% – have an advanced degree.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.760
And the issue of who goes to college is strongly
related to your socioeconomic background.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.360
For kids born in the 80s, 54% of those born
in the top fourth of the income distribution
have a four-year college degree.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.840
For those born in the bottom fourth, only
9% do.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.820
As with wealth inequality, race and ethnicity
are also linked with educational attainment.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.480
22% of African Americans and 16% of Hispanic Americans have a four-year degree,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.380
compared to 36% of Non-Hispanic White Americans and 53% of Asian Americans.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.200
Now so far, all I’ve done is give you about
a bunch of descriptive data about income,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.480
occupations, and education in the United
States that shows you that, yes, there is
inequality in the United States.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.520
But how should we think about inequality?

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.680
Is it good or bad?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.940
You can argue that inequality isn’t, in
and of itself, a bad thing.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.660
Some jobs are harder than others.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.300
Doctors take on many years of education so
that they can save lives.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.220
And I’m perfectly fine with heart surgeons
getting paid more than I am.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.700
And it’s probably good to live in a society
where working hard and learning skills that
benefit other people is encouraged.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.680
This is the idea of a meritocracy – or social
stratification based on personal merit.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.220
The US is partially a meritocracy –
social position does to some extent reflect
individual talent and effort.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.780
But a lot of socioeconomic status is also
due to something outside of your control –
the status you’re born into.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.920
If you start out on the bottom of the ladder,
the likelihood that you’ll get to the top is low.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.900
The environment you’re in during the early years
of your life shapes your ability to succeed as an adult.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:08.520
There’s a large body of research that suggests that kids born in low-income families start school behind their peers, and those gaps only get wider as kids get older.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.900
Inequalities in one generation are often reproduced
in the next generation.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.200
And as we’ve noted throughout this course,
race and gender are closely linked to social status.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.660
There are lots of factors that play into
these inequalities across groups –

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.540
differences in education levels, differences in
family composition, differences in occupation choice.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.060
Understanding why we see these
inequalities across demographic groups is one
of the foundational questions of sociology.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.020
And: that’s something we’ll be exploring
more in later episodes.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.300
Today, however, we talked about five ways
that social stratification plays out in the US:

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.860
income inequality, wealth inequality,
political power, occupational prestige,
and educational attainment.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.380
We discussed descriptive data about inequality
in the US and how it varies across race and gender.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.000
And finally we talked about the relative role of
merit in determining your socioeconomic status.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.540
