Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Um, but like I, I'm interested as well with this. I keep bringing up the subject of the empty, uh, like what I guess while I want to know about is like, cause I, I'm, you know, obviously a person in recovery, I don't drink, I don't take drugs, haven't done for a long time and are recognized for certain people [inaudible] they can't do it safely. Psychedelics and hallucinogens is, it seemed to me exist in a real mount side of that because they're not about, they're not pleasure seeking. There's like seem to me like it's a spiritual Paul. However, I'm a crafty bastard when it comes to this stuff and I'm always looking for an in, you know, when I see your cannabis treasure trove over there. I mean that is some, yeah, as you said, let Raiders of the lost Ark Stuff and I'm holding in my hand now the CBD rich cannabis soft gels class been, you know, so like I'm sort of worried that that is a gateway that CVD, which is not necessarily psychoactives psychoactive.

Speaker 1:          00:58          It's not, but it does help you with anxiety and helps a lot of people because it alleviates a lot of inflammation, which tends to have a corresponding impact on, on your anxiety. I was gonna say, this says here, 11 milligrams of THC. Does that mean, I mean it says THC. It does say that the bonds are probably a wonder one. This is the one to one or ed tech 18 to one or 11. It says there's an 1,101 is a couple of different ones in that box. Oh, I give you, almost give you the wrong one. Show a bag of snack. Don't take that. They swung, goes back in this one. This one's way more powerful than the one to one. You seem to seem very relaxed and free from anxiety. I will say that. Um, but like say like, oh well I suppose I'm interested in, because listen, I'm meditating the whole lot.

Speaker 1:          01:41          I meditate a lot. I'm doing all these things. I'm experiencing transcendent states. I'm experiencing what it's like to not feel attached to my identity as Russell. Who are you before you are Russell? Who are you before you identify yourself as a man in England? Who are you? Who is the person who is the consciousness? Who is the awareness? And when I listened to say, Terence Mckenna talking about his experiences in Psychedelia, it's such lamb and with such lucidity and we've so many philosophical connotations and the way that he uses the information he's getting from hallucinogenics, um, experiences to speculate on how we should organize society, what it, what the implications are for freedom. He's refusal to accept that there are certain kinds of experiences that should be prohibited. That it's ridiculous that adults should be prevented from having that. I'm fascinated by. I'm also, I suppose part of my biases.

Speaker 1:          02:29          I love anything that gets me out of my head. I feel a tremendous sense of relief, whether it's through meditation or even sport at the or sex being relieved of the burden of the constantly thinking mind. But when I hear like those, um, vivid or descriptions of DMT realm or our West Korea, I think something in me hungers for that hungers for it. Do you worry that you're trying to get intoxicated? You worry that you're, you're trying to find a loophole. Yeah. Cause I am doing that. I'm Lou palm looking for a loophole. He's like, I'm going around.

Speaker 2:          03:00          I like a so of a trash lawyer looking for some weight gain. Is there, hold on a second. What about this lawyer? That's a great way of putting it. Yeah. I mean, uh, I know people that have problems with addiction that have done psychedelics and didn't have a problem, but I'm sure some people have had problems and I don't know about them. DMT is interesting in that, first of all, it's very quick. The experience is only about 15 minutes, 20 minutes Max. And it's also, it's not necessary. It's not an intoxicant in the way that you would think about traditionally. You are still you in, in the face of this experience. And I think [inaudible] I think it's some sort of a chemical gateway. That's what I think. I think there's a gateway in your mind that can lead to some other dimension that's probably there all the time.

Speaker 2:          03:47          If they raise, I, uh, omnipresent continually existing realm that human beings aren't accessing because of that particular buyer, chemical formulation of consciousness as it is in this point in our evolution and that we can get there. And it seems as if like, you know, I've heard Terence Mckenna say it's more real. It's more real. They stuff in there. Yeah. You know, and excuse me. And when he talks about them beings, you know, like that he describes herself dribbling basketballs, creating life Faberge egg like I devices fruit vibration and it's easy to do it. I never saw him. I want this called the machine elves. He's called them all sorts of different things. The way I've described them as they're the geometric patterns made out of love and understanding. So like, so you've read, you can look at a geometrical pattern and read meaning into it.

Speaker 2:          04:36          It had an emotional quality. They're made out of something and they move, they change. Like they don't stay what they are. They're constantly evolving in front of you into something more and more beautiful. It's very weird. What did it make you feel like? I knew nothing. There was the most profound aspect, like all of the stuff that you concentrate on everyday is nonsense and there is some other thing that's connected that's probably influencing this world. Yeah, and it's probably what people see when they have near death experiences. The depictions of the afterlife. I mean that's probably what it all is and religious experiences and when profits are talking about, oh my God, I went into this round. There's these beings, they've told me we're all one. We have scholars, other scholars in Jerusalem or connecting Moses's experience with the burning Bush to the acacia tree, the Acacia tree, which is rich and DMT.

Speaker 2:          05:27          The burning Bush is with God was to Moses and that through this burning Bush, he came out with these 10 commandments of how people should live their lives. I mean that easily could have been just a very convoluted sort of translation of a DMT trip. Certainly. And also when you think of, certainly there are archetype or images that seem to be repeated throughout ancient cultures aren't an archaic stories that seem to refer to the potential for plant experiences to affect consciousness. Even the garden of Eden do not eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, otherwise you will become as gods. You know, I sent that. Now if, if there is some realm that we can reach through that experience, but seeing that puts into perspective everything that else we experiment on the material realm and that thing seems to, in your words, be m and a in love and understanding while ever changing, completely formless and communicate in love and understanding it for, I can't help but think that that should become our pri already.

Speaker 2:          06:32          To have a relationship with that realm and to bring about that experience. I don't even mean in a literal way. Cause even terrorism, Mckenna said there were some people vulnerable souls. He was probably referring to people like me that probably shouldn't mess around with that kind of stuff. Really talking about people with schizophrenia, which he believed he had, by the way. Did he? Yeah, he, he, he had some very unique perspectives on schizophrenia and the, the way people interact with the world itself. I think if we lived in a healthy world, uh, healthy civilization that had a healthy relationship with psychoactive substances, we'd probably have centers where you would have a legitimate Sharman, a medical advisor and someone would take you through a guided experience. We're doing that now with a ketamine. There's a lot of people that are very depressed that are having a, these physician controlled ketamine experiences that have had a profound effect on their depression.

Speaker 2:          07:27          My friend Neil Brendan's gone through several of them and he was, he's a comedian, a very funny comedian. So when he was describing it, it was hilarious. I was going to a doctor's office, a tripping his fucking balls off, you know, and the doctors shooting them up with intermuscular ketamine. Oh my God. Yeah. And he's having these insane, so yeah, I go, so you're having psychedelic experiences like, oh yeah, that's scribing. It was really funny. Um, I mean, tripping his fucking balls off in these whatever states that ketamine, I've never experienced ketamine. I don't know what it does, but it's apparently profoundly a hallucinogenic and you have these wild, crazy experiences on it. And for whatever reason it has a a great impact on depression for a lot of people. I think it's a perspective enhancer, but it also does something to rewire the mind. Some of this suggests is that mental illness is a response to our material conditions.

Speaker 2:          08:22          Whether that's mentally, honestly schizophrenia, depression or addiction is like, like people are going on and on a minute, this is now we're supposed to live. I took that, came in one time towards the end of my using and as usual, it's not in the right type of environment should be doing stuff like that in a nightclub. You need to be under that. She manic conditions, why coke guy or whatever, who had nominated a shaman, but I felt like it was like going into a tunnel made of sound and they're having to navigate. I was like, Oh shit, I'm still in reality. What am I going to do? Is it is my self consciousness becomes a noise instead a string of words

Speaker 1:          08:56          and signs. Yeah, mom in a Gad, his place, you know, so like for me it's clear that drugs were never meant to be recreational. In fact, they never was. I was never, hey man, this is crazy. I was was like, I'm fucking pain. I need some shit to help me out. Otherwise I'm can probably kill myself, you know? So like it was a way of holding that stuff. Arms Limp. So I guess my renewed curiosity around Dmt in Iowa and Iowa Ska and other sort of plant medicines and like, you know, that, do you know Daniel Pinchbeck and like them guys are sort of part of that? I'm curious about it cause I guess I'm continually trying to find a way where someone go, right, here's a way where we can do it, where it sort of safe. And I've heard of other people in recovery doing it.

Speaker 1:          09:33          But when I think about what my motivation is, is when I hear people talking about and my own and my own recollections of experiencing what felt like God. And by God I mean a sense of oneness and that my individual identity isn't my real identity and I'm connected to everything. And love is the most important thing. You know, I want a real experience of that so that when I'm out in the world, I can remember when I'm driving or when I'm dealing with people or if I'm buying something or if I'm feeling inferior or feeling superior that like you said, this is bullshit. This is like a secondary reality. Don't let it govern you. You know, as, as someone that's been seduced by fame or personal life. If I get this of film, then everyone's going to love me. Oh. If they stand up, set goes well.

Speaker 1:          10:09          You know, like I personally placed all of my wellbeing outside of myself. There's certain knowledge that there is an inner connection that will take care of you. That's accessible. I guess I'm, you know, hungry to sort of feel it in a way that it's like, oh my God, now there is no doubt it's been in a sense is a crisis of faith, not crisis psychedelic states that you could achieve without taking anything. I mean, you could certainly get there, um, in a flotation tank, you could get there through holotropic breathing. Um, I've never done Kundalini Yoga, but apparently the people that get really deep into Kundalini Yoga, you can literally have DMT trips. I know I have friends that have done DMT and have experienced DMT trips through Kundalini, but you have to be really dedicated. I mean, there's a lot of time, a lot of time, a lot of energy, and you have to really understand the methods and follow them to a t and you can achieve these altered states of consciousness that are apparently, you know, not from my personal experience, but from what people tell me.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Incredibly profound. Yeah. I mean, I've had comparable things. I guess that what you know, the difference between feeling something that's that overwhelming that gives you no choice. You know, like there's like, it's not like in a Kundalini, you've got to do these breaths correctly. You've got to sit, there you go. Try again. He had done a look quite a bit of Delini well, what for me it feels like what I felt quite a lot yoga, clea and meditatively is a cessation of what I would call my individual consciousness. Like, Oh, I'm not this, this isn't who I am. This is just a temporary experience and all of the value systems of our world are built upon these primal drives in collaboration with a culture that like the stratify people and manage people and operates like a massive farm where it's easier to keep people together operating in these kinds wastes systemically.

Speaker 1:          11:54          I've sort of felt rushes of that like a sun wordless clarity. If you can imagine me having anything that was wordless even for a moment and like and in that space, you know there there is great pace. So I suppose get that. What's turning me on about the, like the DMT and Iowaska thing is that the way it's narrow advised that there you're going to meet characters and stuff like that and it's, and he's going to be plain and beyond doubt, you know, cause I suppose what profits do you know like whether you know when a profit returned from there, whether it's the burning Bush or the cave, they come back and they say all this stuff that you'll take it seriously is not real. There's this other realm. Start prioritizing it or you are going to live in hell on earth, you're going to be governed by your materialistic drives, your sexual drive and it's going to imprison you.

Speaker 1:          12:40          And it turns out that they're bright as I would like, you know, I suppose what I'm after because I'm partly, you know, on a superfood, like on one level influenced by what you're doing and how you've created your own light, your creating your own business and your own success. Like these, this symbiosis of stand up and the podcast and like, it's become like a sort of a lifestyle brand in a sense. Joe. Like, you know, I'm sort of like, yeah, I don't, I don't want to be continually dragged in at these colors, like working within institutions. Like, you know, I'm over here doing a bloody, I'm doing ballers and I'm bloody glad to be over here doing ballers and working with the rock. And I've got a funny story about that if you want it like, um, but like, uh, you know, like really what interests me is like, can I be, and can I dedicate my life to humorously, communicate in spiritual information and indeed starting to live it.

Speaker 1:          13:30          So like that. And I suppose what that would mean is, you know, I'm getting better, but I'm not a person who's obsessed with porn or sex or drugs or web, like, you know, to become it, to become what you actually are, to recognize that we are all different. Your perfect realization of you is going to involve hun in and all of these things that you've created through your gift. And that my perfect version of me is going to involve all of this. And not everyone needs to build sort of empires or entertainment industries or whatever. But all of us are on some journey to self actualization and realization. There's individual as our fingerprints and as natural as a seed turn in with tree. And if we don't have a way of accessing that, no wonder with dissatisfied, satisfied, no wonder we tie. There's an opioid epidemic. They want to, people are bored and angry and lonely. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:10          Well, I think what you can do is be yourself. And what you can do is express yourself. And what you can do is constantly seek to improve and grow. And you are doing those things. So if you're saying, can I do these things? Can I be comedic and spiritual and what you're doing it right. So, so, so it's don't, you're doing it, you know, it's all just a matter of what, whether or not your satisfied with your progress and where you are and who you are and how you express yourself.
