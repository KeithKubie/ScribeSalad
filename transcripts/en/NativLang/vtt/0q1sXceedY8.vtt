2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.840
<v 1>This short series will cover the grammar of sentences,</v>

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.700
the very basics of syntax.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.720
It will build on the introduction to morphology where we looked at words and

5
00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:18.680
pieces of words.

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.390
This time we're moving from the form of words to the arrangement of words.

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.890
I'll use the terms grammar and grammatical in these lessons,

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.950
but they're different than how you may have heard them used in the past.

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.241
In linguistics,

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:36.380
the clearest point of comparison for what is grammatical would be this speech of

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.030
a native speaker of a language,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.030
not a set of judgments from a Gra Marian or a teacher

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.410
that touches on a longstanding debate in linguistics.

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.820
Depending on your perspective,

15
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:51.080
you might check if a sentence is grammatical by asking a native speaker to judge

16
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:55.460
the sentence or you might check against other examples produced in that

17
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:56.420
language. Instead,

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.280
a simple way to conceive of grammar at this point is to treat it as a set of

19
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:06.281
rules which allows you either to accurately describe or produce sentences in a

20
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.540
specific language.

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.500
The first topic we'll look at is a clause.

22
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.930
A clause is in some ways a kernel sentence. It usually has a finite verb,

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.170
which means that the verb reflects something about the subject,

24
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.760
the dewar of the action. It usually has tents or aspect,

25
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.420
some way of indicating when or how the action takes place.

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.330
Clauses don't have to have a finite verb,

27
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.420
a small clauses often based around an infinitive,

28
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.780
an example of a small clauses to go to the store and that small clause might be

29
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:44.720
embedded into another clause we'll talk about embedding later,

30
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.570
but one example is I want to go to the store,

31
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.250
so want is the finite verb in the main clause in the main clause can be I want

32
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.470
it or in this case I want to go to the store and that's the main clause or the

33
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:04.250
matrix clause or the independent clause because you will find it on it's own a

34
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.350
dependent clause. We'll often have some introductory word like that or if,

35
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.180
and this allows you to identify the clause as needing to be put within another

36
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:16.730
clause in order to form a complete sentence.

37
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.850
This has been a very simple introduction to dependent clauses and independent

38
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:22.684
clauses,

39
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.950
but keep these in mind as we start to build more sentences in the next lesson.

40
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.510
