solar power will replace oil and we'll

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919
solar power will replace oil and we'll

I believe in solar power however there

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
I believe in solar power however there
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.650
I believe in solar power however there
are problems that we have to face and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
are problems that we have to face and
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019
are problems that we have to face and
one of them is low efficiency the other

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
one of them is low efficiency the other
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.109
one of them is low efficiency the other
one is lack of a storage facility like a

think in the coming decade as oil prices

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
think in the coming decade as oil prices
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.810
think in the coming decade as oil prices
start to rise and as the pot the cost of

drive the whole thing forward because of
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.890
drive the whole thing forward because of
the dropping cost of solar cells and

that is prized by the oil companies
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.789
that is prized by the oil companies
because it is relatively less polluting

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799
because it is relatively less polluting

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.569
warming could actually be a problem only
for the next several decades as we enter

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579
for the next several decades as we enter
 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.689
for the next several decades as we enter
the solar era and the fusion era the

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699
the solar era and the fusion era the
 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.719
the solar era and the fusion era the
problem is we have already lofted so

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729
problem is we have already lofted so
 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.219
problem is we have already lofted so
much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229
much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.950
much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
and we will continue to do so for

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960
and we will continue to do so for
 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.100
and we will continue to do so for
decades to come that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110
decades to come that
 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.339
decades to come that
even before we enter the solar age and

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349
even before we enter the solar age and
 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.070
even before we enter the solar age and
the fusion age we will have so much

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080
the fusion age we will have so much
 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.890
the fusion age we will have so much
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that we

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that we
 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.559
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that we
will really screw up the weather but on

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569
will really screw up the weather but on
 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.800
will really screw up the weather but on
a long-term basis I think that solar

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810
a long-term basis I think that solar
 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.290
a long-term basis I think that solar
energy and fusion power will be the

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
energy and fusion power will be the
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.689
energy and fusion power will be the
solution the ultimate solution for the

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699
solution the ultimate solution for the
 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.479
solution the ultimate solution for the
greenhouse problem
