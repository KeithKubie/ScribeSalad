00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.759
Given we know that even Neanderthals would
bury their dead (even including objects with

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.120
the bodies) and various human hunter-gatherer
groups likewise used to bury or cremate people

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.579
at specifics sites that functioned as sort
of pilgrimage locations for these nomads,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
it should come as no surprise that since the
dawn of known warfare soldiers have pondered

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.380
the question of what to do with the bodies
of their fallen comrades and enemies.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.089
So what did various groups actually do throughout
history?

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.210
A thing to note before we continue is that
there is a definite gap in the memory of history

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.010
in regards to this one specific matter and
historians only have sparse reports of what

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.449
happened to the dead of many groups after
battles.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.860
You might think solving this problem would
be simply a matter of locating famous battle

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
sites and doing some digging to glean a little
more insight, but it turns out even this is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.170
notoriously difficult as we’ll get into
shortly.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.520
That caveat out of the way, on the more definitive
front, it’s noted that the ancient Greeks

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.560
made an effort to respect the usual burial
customs of the dead after a battle and collecting

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.939
the bodies of the fallen wasn’t uncommon.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.340
For example, following the Battle of Chaeronea
in 338 BC between Philip II of Macedonia and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.599
the Athenians, both sides buried their dead
in accordance with the religious customs of

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:38.369
the period; this was seemingly done both out
of respect for the valor the dead showed in

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.390
battle and to appease the gods.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.780
With the exception of the Spartans, most ancient
Greek societies also made efforts to bury

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.440
their dead near the city they hailed from
if time allowed it, though for the sake of

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.660
practicality, mass graves or the like were
sometimes utilised instead.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.460
In this case, cenotaphs were sometimes erected
near their home city in honor of the fallen.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.119
As noted, an exception to this are the Spartans
who often buried fallen soldiers on the battlefield

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.170
they were killed.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.000
Also somewhat unique was that rather than
stripping the dead of valuables, as per Spartan

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.970
tradition, each fallen Spartan was buried
with their weapons and armor and their final

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.090
resting place was marked by a simple tombstone
with their name and an inscription that read

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.870
(translated) “In War”.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.360
This was a special honor among the Spartans.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.750
If one were to die outside of battle, no such
tombstone would be given and the person would

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.120
simply be buried in an unmarked grave.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.230
The one exception to that was if a woman died
in child birth, she too would be given the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.620
honor of a tombstone.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.700
As for the Romans, most soldiers paid a small
stipend each month to pay for funeral expenses

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.280
should they fall in battle.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.750
As you might expect from this, the Romans
made a conscious effort to recover the bodies

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.250
of those who died and, if time allowed it,
would bury or cremate them individually.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.310
If this wasn’t possible, the bodies of soldiers
killed in battle would be collected and given

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.040
a mass cremation or burial.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.820
In the event the bodies couldn’t be recovered,
a cenotaph would be erected to serve as a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.530
monument to the individual.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.200
The same cannot be said of later wars where
there seems to have been an almost callous

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.400
disregard for the fallen, and looting of the
dead and dying was commonplace.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.260
For example, the Bayeux Tapestry depicting
the Battle of Hastings in 1066 shows soldiers

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.460
piling up the bodies of the dead and stripping
them of their valuables.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.730
It’s believed that following this the bodies
were quickly cremated or buried in nearby

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.920
mass graves.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.230
It should be noted here, however, that with
the rise of Christianity, mass cremation,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.290
at least for a time, seems to have gone the
way of the dodo in some regions, in favor

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.290
of mass graves.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.020
That said, despite the countless battles that
occurred throughout Medieval Europe, archaeologists

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.820
have had an extraordinarily difficult time
actually finding any of the bodies.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.180
As one paper published in the Journal of Conflict
Archeology, aptly titled “Where are the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.780
dead of medieval battles?”, notes:

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.300
Only a handful of mass graves from late medieval
battles in Western Europe have been subject

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.460
to large scale excavation to modern standards.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.629
The principal reason is that these, and indeed
even early modern battlefield graves, have

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.000
proven extremely elusive, most being identified
by chance.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.800
Despite a few successes, no combination of
prospecting techniques yet provides a consistently

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.830
effective method of locating such small archaeological
features set almost anywhere within a site

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.819
covering many square kilometres…

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.690
Looking at much better documented times, looting
of the dead was also extraordinarily common

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.459
during the extremely deadly Napoleonic Wars,
with soldiers and locals alike pilfering what

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.019
they could find after battles.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.900
For example, consider this account from a
British general following the Battle of Heilsberg

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.100
in 1807:

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.099
The ground between the wood and the Russian
batteries, about a quarter of a mile, was

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.620
a sheet of naked human bodies, which friends
and foes had during the night mutually stripped,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.190
although numbers of these bodies still retained
consciousness of their situation.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.069
It was a sight that the eye loathed, but from
which it could not remove.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.960
And yes, as noted there, the severely wounded
weren’t spared the indignity of being robbed

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.919
of their worldly possessions as they lay dying.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.979
And worst of all, this was done not just by
their enemies, but comrades as well.

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.860
In fact, there are firsthand accounts from
wounded soldiers who went on to survive their

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.409
injuries detailing the shock of waking up
completely naked.

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.720
Here’s a snippet of one such quote from
a French soldier called Jean Baptiste de Marbot:

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.229
Stretched on the snow among the piles of dead
and dying, unable to move in any way, I gradually

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.330
and without pain lost consciousness….

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.169
I judge that my swoon lasted four hours, and
when I came to my sense I found myself in

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.169
this horrible position.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.770
I was completely naked, having nothing on
but my hat and my right boot.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.430
A man of the transport corps, thinking me
dead, had stripped me in the usual fashion,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.409
and wishing to pull off the only boot that
remained, was dragging me by one leg with

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.940
his foot against my body.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.520
The jerk which the man gave me no doubt had
restored me to my senses.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.180
I succeeded in sitting up and spitting out
the clots of blood from my throat.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.229
The shock caused by the wind of the ball had
produced such an extravasation of blood, that

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.900
my face, shoulders, and chest were black,
while the rest of my body was stained red

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.400
by the blood from my wound.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.839
My hat and my hair were full of bloodstained
snow, and as I rolled my haggard eyes I must

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.369
have been horrible to see.

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.999
Anyhow, the transport man looked the other
way, and went off with my property without

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:10.229
my being able to say a single word to him,
so utterly prostrate was I.

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.810
After being stripped of their belongings the
dead, and occasionally still barely living,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.360
would often be buried in mass graves (sometimes
with bodies from both sides unceremoniously

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360
thrown in).

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.599
In general, this was either accomplished via
the soldiers themselves doing it, or in many

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.759
cases members of the local populace given
the gruesome task.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.590
However, there are accounts of battles where
thousands of bodies were simply left to the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.590
elements.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.939
For example, General Philippe de Ségur states
in 1812,

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:39.050
After passing the Kologa, we marched on, absorbed
in thought, when some of us, raising our eyes,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.669
uttered a cry of horror.

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.479
Each one instantly looked about him, and there
lay stretched before us a plain trampled,

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.740
bare, and devastated, all the trees cut down
within a few feet from the surface, and farther

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.930
off craggy hills, the highest of which appeared
misshapen, and bore a striking resemblance

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.610
to an extinguished volcano.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.149
The ground around us was everywhere covered
with fragments of helmets and cuirasses, with

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:07.270
broken drums, gun-stocks, tatters of uniforms,
and standards dyed with blood.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.389
On this desolate spot lay thirty thousand
half-devoured corpses…

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.669
It should also be noted here that beyond any
possessions the bodies may have had on them

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.969
before being stripped, the bodies themselves
were also of value.

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.139
For example, human scavengers would come through
and rob the dead of their teeth, which would

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.169
then be used to make dentures.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.499
The Napoleonic Wars, and in particular the
Battle of Waterloo, were such a boon to the

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:32.270
British dental industry in this way that dentures
were known as “Waterloo teeth” in the

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.270
UK over a decade after it ended.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.169
Teeth from soldiers were highly sought after
owing to predominately coming from relatively

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.870
young men who still had reasonably good teeth,
unlike many others that came from the more

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.870
wizened dead.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.740
In one account, one Astley Cooper met just
such a tooth hunter and noted,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.590
Upon asking this Butler, who appeared to be
in a state of great destitution, what might

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.419
be his object, he said it was to get teeth…but
when I came to question him upon the means

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:57.409
by which he was to obtain these teeth, he
said, ‘Oh Sir, only let there be a battle,

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:59.599
and there’ll be no want of teeth.

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:02.879
I’ll draw them as fast as the men are knocked
down.

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.789
Even more grimly, the bones of the dead of
some of these battles were later collected

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:11.059
and pulverised into fertiliser which was sold
for a modest price across Europe.

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:14.219
To quote an article from the The Observer
written in 1822:

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:19.139
It is now ascertained beyond a doubt, by actual
experiment on an extensive scale, that a dead

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:23.869
soldier is a most valuable article of commerce;
and, for aught known to the contrary, the

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:29.000
good farmers of Yorkshire are, in a great
measure, indebted to the bones of their children

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.449
for their daily bread.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:34.440
It is certainly a singular fact, that Great
Britain should have sent out such multitudes

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.250
of soldiers to fight the battles of this country
upon the continent of Europe, and should then

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.050
import their bones as an article of commerce
to fatten her soil!

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.960
The remains of soldiers were also sometimes
collected for use in souvenirs of major battles.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.310
For example, poet Eaton Stannard Barrett wrote,
“I know one honest gentleman, who has brought

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.840
home a real Waterloo thumb, nail and all,
which he preserves in a bottle of gin.”

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.500
Moving across the pond and slightly more recently
in history, markedly more respect was shown

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.740
for the dead during the American Civil War
where teams of soldiers were tasked with burying

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.850
the dead of both sides in simple mass graves,
with great care being taken to ensure most

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.760
soldiers received a proper burial.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.570
Finally, to discuss WW1 and WW2, individual
units were largely responsible for the disposal

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.890
of their own dead with both Axis and Allied
forces having their own rules for how this

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.900
should be handled.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.030
For example, during WW2 Colonel Walther Sonntag
of the Wehrmacht’s Casualty Office issued

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.600
a comprehensive guide for military graves
officers detailing how mass graves should

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.920
be constructed.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.780
Amongst other things the guidelines indicated
that mass graves should be made as close to

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.860
railway lines as possible and feature pathways
with the intention being that they’d eventually

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.420
be turned into war cemeteries.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.080
As the war raged on, these guidelines were
largely ignored for the sake of practicality,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.900
leading to, as Der Spiegel puts it, “a surfeit
of grave steles”.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.530
As for the Allies, during WW2 burying the
dead largely fell to individual soldiers,

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:56.330
but some units dedicated to the task did exist,
for example the United States Quartermaster

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.350
Graves Registration Service.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.640
Tasked with finding and burying every fallen
American soldier, the Quartermaster Graves

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.540
Registration Service have been hailed as some
of the unsung heroes of the War due to the

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.860
general lack of recognition they’ve received
since it ended.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.510
Graves Registration units were exceptionally
committed to their task and undertook their

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.490
duties with a solemn sense of duty and determination,
going to extraordinary lengths to identify

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.960
bodies and perform the appropriate burial
rights depending on the fallen soldier’s

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.260
religious affiliation.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.610
When appropriate, GRS units would bury civilian,
allied and axis casualties they came across,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.360
making sure to bury them in well-marked graves,
the locations of which would be passed onto

00:10:35.360 --> 00:11:30.970
the relevant authorities.
