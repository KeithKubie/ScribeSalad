00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The term we give to this is Galilean relativity. There we see it--that word relativity.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Not special in front of it yet but we're getting there, and this term

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is the first postulate of special relativity,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it says that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, these are words we haven't seen before but don't worry.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Frames of reference we can think of for now as just meaning point of view.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Inertial just means moving at a constant speed or being at rest.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So what this sentence is really saying is that the laws of physics are the same

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in all points of view which are either moving at constant speed or at rest.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And in fact, this concept of rest is a very strange one, even the train.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Even if we could have opened the window in the train and seen the world flying by us.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Is it the train moving or is the world moving beneath the train?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
All we can say for sure is that the world and the train are moving relative to each other.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This idea of absolute rest is one we really have to sort of abandon

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
now that we have this idea of Galilean relativity.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I want you to tell me is which of the following is an inertial frame of reference:

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a bike accelerating downhill, a car parked on the street, a plane traveling around at a constant speed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of 500 km/h, or an object which has recently been dropped off

00:01:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the Leaning Tower of Pisa and is now in free fall--check all that apply.
