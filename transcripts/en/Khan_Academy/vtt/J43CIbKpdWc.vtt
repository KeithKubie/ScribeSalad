00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.446
- [Instructor] What is the equation

00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:03.779
of the horizontal line

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.932
through the point negative four comma six?

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:08.506
So let's just visualize this.

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:09.556
Once you get the hang of it,

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:11.693
you might not have to draw a graph,

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:14.407
but for explanatory
purposes, it might be useful.

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:16.282
So negative four comma six,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.238
that's going to be in the second quadrant.

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:21.056
So if this is my

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.889
x-axis,

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:23.111
That is my

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.394
y-axis.

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:26.999
I'm going to go negative
four in the x direction.

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.940
So one,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.773
two,

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:29.606
three,

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.442
four.

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.275
Negative four.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.108
And then one,

00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:32.941
two,

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:33.774
three,

00:00:33.774 --> 00:00:34.607
four,

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:35.440
five,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.273
six,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:37.640
in the y direction.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.987
So the point that we care about

00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:40.838
is going to be right over there.

00:00:40.838 --> 00:00:42.261
Negative four

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:43.329
comma six.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.038
And what is the equation
of the horizontal line?

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:48.925
It is a horizontal line.

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:51.096
So it's just going to go straight

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:53.162
left, right like this.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.450
That is what the line
would actually look like.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.557
So what is that equation?

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.420
Well, for any x,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.340
y is going to be equal to six.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.733
This is the equation,

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.556
y is equal to six.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:07.454
Doesn't matter what x you input here,

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:08.720
you're gonna get y equals six.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.751
It just stays constant right over there.

00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:11.895
So the equation

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:14.182
is y is equal to six.

00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:16.682
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:20.887
So here we are asked

00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:23.304
what is the slope of the line

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.593
y is equal to negative four?

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:29.943
So let's visualize it

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:30.959
and then in the future,

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.559
you might not have to draw it like this.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.987
But let's just draw

00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:36.543
our axis again.

00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:38.029
X-axis

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:39.614
y-axis

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:41.686
and the slope of line
y equals negative four.

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:43.677
So for whatever x you have,

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.047
y is going to be negative four.

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:47.120
Let's say that's negative
four right over there.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.953
And so,

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:50.118
the line is y

00:01:50.963 --> 00:01:53.470
the line is y equals negative four.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.158
So I can draw it like this.

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.998
So what's the slope of that?

00:01:57.998 --> 00:02:01.655
Well, slope is change in
y for given change in x.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.391
And here, no matter what I change my x,

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.581
y doesn't change.

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.578
It stays at negative four.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:09.649
My change in y over change in x.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.338
Doesn't matter what my change in x is.

00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:13.213
My change in y is always going to be zero.

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:14.229
It's constant.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:18.223
So the slope here is
going to be equal to zero.

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:20.050
Y doesn't change, no matter how much

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.133
you change x.

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:23.728
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:23.728 --> 00:02:24.728
This is fun.

00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:30.207
So now they are asking us,

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:32.875
what is the slope of the line x

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.313
equals negative three?

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.235
Let me graph that one.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:38.663
So,

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:41.122
I'm just going to draw my axis real fast.

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:42.467
X-axis

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:43.623
y-axis

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:45.037
X is equal to negative three.

00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:46.228
So negative one,

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:47.218
negative two,

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:48.468
negative three.

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:52.035
And so, this line is going to look

00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:52.868
let me,

00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:55.013
it's going to look like this.

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:56.044
No matter what y

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:57.179
or

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.623
you can say no matter what y is.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:00.866
X is going to be equal to negative three.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:01.897
So,

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:02.977
it would look like this.

00:03:02.977 --> 00:03:05.394
X is equal to negative three.

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:08.828
So what's the slope here?

00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:10.215
Well,

00:03:10.215 --> 00:03:11.371
it's undefined.

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:14.638
A vertical line has an undefined slope.

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:16.672
Remember, you want to do
what's your change in y

00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:18.484
or change in x.

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:20.087
Change in y

00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:21.648
or change in x.

00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:23.331
Well, you can think about what's the slope

00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:24.475
as you approach this

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.293
but once again, that could be,

00:03:26.293 --> 00:03:27.126
some people would say,

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:29.581
maybe it's infinite, maybe
it's negative infinity.

00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:31.191
But that's why it's undefined.

00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:35.684
A vertical line is going
to have an undefined slope.

00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:37.676
So we'll go with undefined.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.176
Let's do one more.

00:03:41.277 --> 00:03:43.667
What is the equation of the vertical line

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.296
through negative five comma negative two?

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:48.129
So,

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.734
let me do this without even drawing it.

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:51.538
I'll draw it right after that.

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:53.482
So, if we're talking about a vertical.

00:03:53.482 --> 00:03:56.122
If we're talking about a vertical line,

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:58.030
that means that x doesn't change.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.375
X

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:00.859
doesn't

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.785
change.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.311
If we were talking
about a horizontal line,

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.101
then we'd say y doesn't change.

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.024
So if x doesn't change,

00:04:07.024 --> 00:04:07.992
that means that x

00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:11.517
is just going to be equal
to some constant value.

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.836
Well, if it contains
the points negative five

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.675
comma negative two,

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:18.151
so if it has a point where
x is equal to negative five

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:20.958
and if x never changes,
it's a vertical line,

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.305
well that means its equation has to be

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:24.638
x is equal to negative five.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.787
And we can draw that out,

00:04:27.787 --> 00:04:28.787
if it helps.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:31.841
So let me draw that out.

00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.963
So,

00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:35.979
I need to make sure
that's a straight line.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:36.812
Okay,

00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:37.971
so we have x,

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:39.138
and we have y,

00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:42.983
so we have the point negative
five comma negative two.

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:45.115
So negative one,

00:04:45.115 --> 00:04:45.958
two,

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:46.791
three,

00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:47.624
four,

00:04:47.624 --> 00:04:48.995
five,

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:50.102
negative one,

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:51.085
two

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:52.756
so we want to go have a vertical line

00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:54.428
that goes through that point.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:55.261
So a vertical line,

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.273
well that just goes straight up and down.

00:04:57.273 --> 00:04:59.721
So it's just going to look like this.

00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:00.784
And so notice,

00:05:00.784 --> 00:05:02.462
x never changes.

00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:03.918
No matter what y is,

00:05:03.918 --> 00:05:06.983
x is equal to negative five.

00:05:06.983 --> 00:05:08.418
This has an undefined slope.

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:09.401
It is a vertical line.

00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:13.318
Its equation is x is
equal to negative five.
