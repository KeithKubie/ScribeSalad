&gt;&gt;Craig: James is ready
to take his project

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:13.026
out to Mrs. Wright's
class and try it out.

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:16.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This class at Washington
Middle School in Olympia, Washington,

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:18.756
is like hundreds of
others across the country,

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:22.856
where teachers impart vital new
technology skills to their students.

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:23.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Creative or...

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:26.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But in this
Generation Y class,

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.366
the seventh-graders are
doing the teaching...

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.456
&gt;&gt;Student: That font is good for
the titles, because it's big.

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:32.356
It's big enough that you
can distinguish the letters,

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:33.266
but when it gets to...

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and the
teachers are learning.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You see
anything you would change?

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:37.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.456
There's no home link here.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:44.236
I noticed that on your previous
page like you have on here --

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:49.366
and that's really good, but some
browsers don't have Back buttons,

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.296
so you have to retype the
URL, which is really annoying.

00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:54.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Begun in 1996,

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:58.576
the Generation Y program pairs
tech-savvy grade-schoolers

00:00:58.646 --> 00:01:00.426
with tech-challenged teachers

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:04.016
to help them integrate new
technology into their lesson plans.

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:06.216
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Right now what we
have is a couple Web sites

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:08.576
for research purposes,
but that's about it,

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.356
so what kinds of suggestions do
you think you might have as far

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.966
as where to infuse technology?

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, for a
presentation about how we did it

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.696
in PowerPoint would be a
good one, because it's...

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:20.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now operating
in over 40 states,

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:24.066
this elegantly simple
concept was the brainchild

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.796
of Olympia School District's
technology coordinator,

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:27.996
Dennis Harper.

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:32.146
&gt;&gt;Dennis: I was a former university
college of education trainer

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:35.946
of pre-service teachers,
and typically a lot

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:39.786
of the instruction they get are
from professors who haven't been

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:41.576
in a classroom in 20 years.

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:43.926
There's not a teacher in the
United States that actually went

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:47.776
to K-12 schools when the World
Wide Web was in existence,

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:51.026
so teachers don't realize
the resources.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:53.486
They don't realize how
sharp these kids are.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:56.406
They don't realize
that for the first time

00:01:56.406 --> 00:02:00.686
in history now we have students
knowing more than their teachers

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:04.216
about something that's really
central and important to society.

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:07.126
&gt;&gt;Student: And Web pages are
just endless possibilities.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:10.396
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What age do you
recommend that, the Web pages?

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:10.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Web pages?

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:15.116
Well, we got into it a
little bit in fifth grade,

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:17.926
but you basically don't
really do very much with it

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:19.346
until middle school and up.

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:22.866
You can use PowerPoint with younger
age groups and keep it simple,

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.986
or you can use it with older age
groups and make it a little fancier.

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:30.226
&gt;&gt;Heather: It's been really helpful
for me to get a student's perspective

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:33.336
on how to infuse technology
in my classroom.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:37.936
I'm actually learning from
these girls here about where

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:41.636
to put technology, how it's used and
what's in the classrooms right now.

00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:45.556
It aligns well with my teaching
philosophy in that I need

00:02:45.556 --> 00:02:48.436
to teach what they need to know,
and if they need to learn something,

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:50.736
we need to move in that direction,
and I don't know unless I'm talking

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.446
to them and working with them.

00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:56.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what we have is Sara
and Hanako are suddenly going to turn

00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:01.566
into Ms. Conrad, the partner
teacher, and Sara is meeting

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:02.836
with her for the first time.

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:03.546
Listen carefully for what...

00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:06.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Gen. Y students also
practice communication skills

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:10.336
and teaching methods so they can
better assist pre-service teachers

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:11.806
with lesson planning.

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:13.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Soundtrack
and transitions.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:14.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's a transition?

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:16.116
&gt;&gt;Student: Transitions are
you can fade in and fade out

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:17.586
and just like the dials...

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:19.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Younger Gen. Y kids

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:23.726
like these fourth-graders help their
classroom teachers learn new skills

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:24.806
like video editing.

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:27.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Are there sound
effects that you could use?

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:28.066
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:34.856
We have to go into a CD, and
then you export it to iMovie

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:39.456
and you can use it
for the school news.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.646
&gt;&gt;Dennis: The overwhelming majority,
more than 98 percent of the thousands

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:43.786
of teaches that have been involved

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:47.396
with this program have said they
prefer learning from students

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:48.696
than learning from adults.

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:51.486
Teachers go into teaching because
they like to work with kids,

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:53.296
and that's what makes
this model successful.

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:54.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I want to
see you guys in it.

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:55.326
Ready?

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:59.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Even though
they have to get up early

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:03.416
to attend Gen. Y class before
school each day, these kids return

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:07.076
to the program year after
year, eager to teach and learn.

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:10.246
&gt;&gt;Student: ...or if you
want to cut it smaller,

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:11.856
this will make it smaller.

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:13.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Crop it.

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:17.336
&gt;&gt;DeAnne: It's absolutely
joyful to work with these kids.

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:20.956
The more power you give them,
the more empowered they become.

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.136
They take responsibility
for their own learning.

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:27.576
They get very excited about having
authentic, purposeful reason to be

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:30.126
at school and authentic ways
of helping their teachers.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:32.256
They take charge of their
learning and it carries

00:04:32.256 --> 00:04:33.706
across into all of the disciplines.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:37.016
They just really feel that it's
important for them to be here,

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:38.816
that they are the people
who matter in the school.

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:40.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Headings
go with the graphics.

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:43.676
&gt;&gt;Craig: So what I want you to watch
for as James shows his first two

00:04:43.676 --> 00:04:45.986
or three slides is: What do
you think are the things...

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:49.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Gen. Y instructors
like Craig Costello see more

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.266
than a win-win proposition at work.

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:55.216
They see schools being
transformed by the process

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:57.146
of kids training their teachers.

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:00.406
&gt;&gt;Craig: We've got teachers
who are interested in education

00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.436
because they're about to become
teachers, students who are interested

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:06.026
in the educational process because
they've just had to teach a lesson

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:08.916
for the first time and realized
suddenly how difficult it is,

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:11.936
and experienced teachers who
realize they can't figure

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.336
out the technology unless they
get some help from somebody,

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:18.336
so when we meet in that common area,
suddenly we've got something to talk

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.656
about together, and the whole culture

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:24.016
of our school has changed
in an easy way.

00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:27.476
It hasn't been teachers feeling like,
"I've got to be dragged and pulled

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:28.986
into this technology," kind of thing.

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:33.056
They've got their students working
with them over time on a project,

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:36.606
and then suddenly they have
the skills, and it was kind

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.086
of a painless way of
getting the skills.

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:40.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Then what happens?

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:41.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This looks pretty easy.

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:43.966
Is it ever this easy?

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.696
