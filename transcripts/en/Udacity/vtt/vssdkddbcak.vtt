00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.990
Here is a view of Xcode
showing our PitchPerfect apt.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm going to go over some of
the basic parts of Xcode.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.580
And we'll be diving into
the coat in just a moment.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.970
On the left side,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.830
you can see the navigator panels
starting with the Project Navigator.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.260
On the middle is the content area, and
it's currently showing the settings for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.320
a pitch perfect project.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.020
On the right side,
you have the utility area,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.490
with the inspector panels with a file
inspector panel currently open.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.450
On the bottom, you can see the debug and
console windows.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.350
Unlike other IDEs and
editors you may have used in the past,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.570
Xcode requires only a single click
to select a file or an item.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.010
Starting with a navigator panel on the
left, there are many different ways to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760
view the files and
other parts of your project.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.850
There are even ways to move through
these panels with just a keyboard.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.890
As an example,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.480
you can use command zero to toggle
the navigator's panel on and off.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.200
If like me, you need to find more
screen space from time to time.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.421
On the right side we have
the inspectors panel and

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:11.010
the number available depends on
the content or items you have selected.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.640
In the case of this project setting we
can see file in quick help inspectors.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.180
As you progress with your app you'll
be able to see other inspectors.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.020
Much like the navigator panels you can
toggle the inspector panels by using

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.690
keyboard shortcuts to move through them.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.620
This is especially useful if you're in
need of more space to view your content.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.000
At Udacity we have a saying
that content is king.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.070
And with Xcode that is also true.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.930
The code and even your user interface in
storyboards are always in the center of

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.080
view here and
the prime spot in the content editor.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.260
On the bottom right we
have the library and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.800
at the very bottom of the screen you
can see the debug and console panels.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.220
The console panel is where you
see the Hello World printed.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.280
The Exco content editor is where you
going to spend a lot of your time

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.900
as an iOS developer.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.260
It can.
Adapt to help you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.040
edit any part of your project.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.270
&gt;From project settings, to code,
to user interface elements.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.979
Knowing that the editor is
contact sensitive can help a lot

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.390
when you're looking for how to change
a particular setting in Xcode.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.560
With a Pitch Perfect project, which
is a little blue icon here on the top

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.640
of the project navigator we can see
the settings for the entire project.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.480
We can see the version
that iOS is targeting, and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.710
we can see that the interface file
is called Main for Main story board.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.070
We can also use this decide what
orientation to support, and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.130
to launch it.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.940
Here you can see we're supporting
the portrait orientation,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.360
as well as Landscape Left and
Landscape Right.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.730
If we select the AppDelegate Swift file,
we can

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.900
see that the Xcode editor panel changes
to let us modify the Swift source code.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.650
You can see that Xcode
automatically highlights the code

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.830
to make it easier to read.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.750
Remember that main storyboard selection
back in the project settings?

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.544
That's referring to this file,
main.storyboard.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.900
If you select it in a project
navigator with a single click.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.780
The X Code editor changes to show you
the user interface for this application.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.730
You can use two finger pinch to zoom out
of it so you can see the entire thing.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.700
This is the view we're
going to use to set up.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.390
Any UI elements for our IOS apps,
including pitch perfect.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.950
I know it may seem like a lot but
we'll walk you through step by step and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.230
touch every part of Xcode by the time
you've completed this course.
