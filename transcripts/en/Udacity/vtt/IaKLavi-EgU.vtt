00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.570
In the previous lesson we discussed black box

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.120
testing, which is the testing performed based on a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.760
description of the software, but without considering any of

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.440
software's internal details. In this lesson, we will discuss

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.490
the counterpart of black box testing, which is called

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.590
unsurprisingly white box testing or structural testing. And just

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.780
like we did for black box testing, we will

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.740
cover the main characteristics of white box testing and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.620
this casts the most commonly used white box testing techniques. We

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.650
will conclude the lesson with the discussion of the main strengths and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.540
limitations of white box testing. So that you will know, when to

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.950
use it? How to use it? And what to expect from it?
