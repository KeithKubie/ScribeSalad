- Doesn't Obama know he won't
be able to get anything done

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.240 line:0%
in his last two years?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.309 line:0%
(laughs)

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.079 line:0%

No wonder he's throwing

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.495

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.598
Jupiter's got more moons, man!

Yes!
(audience laughs)

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.734
- When you meet people
in D.C., politicians,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.369
and they put one face
out to the public,

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.604
and then behind the scenes,

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.339 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're devious
lunatics, you know?

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.144 align:start position:0%
And they're head cases, and
they're broken, garbage people.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.379
(laughter)

- In all your interviews
with Obama, okay,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.886 align:start size:94% position:6%
did you ever have a
moment where you thought,

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.387
"This guy's an ass (beep)"?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.622
(laughter)

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.456
- [Person] Keep it 100.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.725

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.496
