00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
- [Lecturer] Where we left
off in the last video,

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.587
we saw a Muhammed being
born into a tribal Arabia.

00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.454
He's born into a powerful
tribe, the Quraysh,

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.436
who are in control of Mecca.

00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.504
But his early life is difficult.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:18.274
His mother dies when he's six.

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:20.521
His grandfather who's taken charge of him,

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.831
dies when he's eight years old.

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.012
But he's able to, under
the care of his uncle,

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:26.608
become a merchant.

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:30.775
And at the age of 25, he marries
a wealthy merchant widower

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.370
named Khadija who is 15 years his senior.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.537
Then we saw at age 40 in 610,
while meditating in a mountain

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:45.826
outside of Mecca, he receives
the first revelations

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:49.723
of the Quran, according
to Islamic tradition.

00:00:49.723 --> 00:00:52.850
And he's skeptical of it at
first, but he's reassured.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.052
And then he soon receives
many more revelations.

00:00:57.052 --> 00:01:00.658
And within roughly three
years, he starts to preach

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:02.158
those revelations.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:05.380
Now as we mentioned in that last video,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.003
what he was preaching did not
sit well with his own tribe,

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.586
those who ruled Mecca, the Quraysh.

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:15.489
He was preaching a mono theistic tradition

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.009
based on Judaism and Christianity.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.788
He was preaching that
there's no God but God.

00:01:21.788 --> 00:01:26.582
But Mecca's power, it's
economy was based on people

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:31.553
making pilgrimages there to
worship the idols at the Kaaba.

00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:35.308
So the Quraysh did not
like Muhammed's revelations

00:01:35.308 --> 00:01:37.745
and they did not like these early Muslims,

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:39.298
and they persecuted them.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.766
They killed them, they tortured them,

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:45.933
and we saw in 615 the
migration of some of Muhammed's

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:52.604
followers to Abyssinia,
the Kingdom of Aksum,

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:54.919
modern day Eritrea and Ethiopia,

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.527
to escape some of that persecution.

00:01:57.527 --> 00:01:59.406
Things got worse for Muhammed.

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:02.220
We saw in that last video,
the death of his first wife

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.010
and up to that point, his only wife.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.384
And this is where we start
to see a bit of turning point

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:11.967
for Muhammed and his followers.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:17.750
In 620 and this is according
to Muslim traditions,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.079
there isn't historical evidence for this,

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.011
and this is one of the
more metaphysical events

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:25.478
that we'll talk about in this narrative.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.429
But according to the Islamic faith,

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.262
in 620 Muhammed has a
night journey from Mecca

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.711
to the farthest mosque,
which today is believed

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.873
by many Muslims to be the Al-Aqsa mosque,

00:02:39.873 --> 00:02:42.804
which was built later in Jerusalem.

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:44.387
So right over here.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:52.326
So a night journey according
to the Muslim faith,

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:55.395
to Jerusalem where he
ascended with Gabriel

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.978
to the heavens and he conversed

00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:01.635
with some of the prophets of old.

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:04.843
And once again, this is
clearly a metaphysical thing,

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:09.509
but it's significant
event in the Muslim faith.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:13.093
Now the Quraysh continued
to persecute Muhammed

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.652
and the early Muslims in Mecca.

00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:19.181
We have some of them that are
now in the Kingdom of Aksum.

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.560
And Muhammed learns that
there's a community,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.018
a growing community of Muslims
in the town of Yathrib,

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:31.307
who are starting to follow
Muhammed or his revelations.

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:34.115
And they come to him and they invite him

00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:37.329
to come to Yathrib because
there's actually a lot

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.662
of fragmentation, there's waring tribes.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.942
And they're seeking an outsider
to help bring some peace

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.424
and authority to this place
where there is already

00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:51.283
a burgeoning Muslim community.

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.616
So in 622, you have the famous migration

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.192
of Muhammed and his followers to Yathrib.

00:04:00.394 --> 00:04:02.472
Which is renamed Medina.

00:04:02.472 --> 00:04:04.932
And Medina literally means The City.

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:08.059
And from then on it
really becomes the base

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:10.892
of Muhammed and the early Muslims.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.793
And Muhammed, once he's in Medina,

00:04:14.793 --> 00:04:17.781
he is no longer just a prophet.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:21.563
He isn't just continuing
to have his revelations

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:23.029
according to Islamic tradition.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.252
But he essentially rules
over Medina, and governs it.

00:04:27.252 --> 00:04:31.335
So he's starting to become
both a political ruler

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.687
and a spiritual ruler.

00:04:34.687 --> 00:04:38.627
Now the Quraysh in Mecca
are still not happy.

00:04:38.627 --> 00:04:40.654
Because Muhammed is continuing to preach,

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:43.998
and he's continuing to get
more and more followers.

00:04:43.998 --> 00:04:47.481
And so you start having, at
first, a series of skirmishes

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:49.935
between the armies of the Quraysh,

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:51.956
or the members of the Quraysh,

00:04:51.956 --> 00:04:53.636
and some of the early Muslims.

00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:55.457
But these skirmishes eventually

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.874
emerge into full on conflict.

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:02.459
And here are some of
the significant battles

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:05.295
that occurred between the Quraysh tribe,

00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:07.749
remember that's Muhammed's own tribe,

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.456
and the early Muslims, the
early followers of Muhammed

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:13.546
and his revelations.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:18.459
So most famously perhaps,
you have the Battle of Badr.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.739
Because this is the first time
that you have a significant

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.656
confrontation between a very small,

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:27.210
you wouldn't even necessarily
call this an army,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.556
a small group of Muslims,
roughly a little over 300

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:33.132
according to Muslim tradition,

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:37.875
versus 900 or a little over
900 on the Quraysh side.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.967
And the Muslims are
outnumbered three to one.

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:43.369
But this results in a Muslim victory.

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:45.917
And so you can imagine the
early Muslims start to see

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:47.149
this as a turning tide.

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.827
They were able to defeat
the powerful Quraysh tribe.

00:05:49.827 --> 00:05:52.512
Now the Quraysh weren't happy with that.

00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:56.044
And roughly a year later
you have another battle

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.711
outside of Medina on Mount Uhud.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.659
And once again, the Muslims,
which are now larger,

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.518
but they continued to
be outnumbered even more

00:06:05.518 --> 00:06:08.330
than three to one, this
is closer to four to one

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.312
right over here.

00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:12.479
And this results in a Quraysh victory.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.441
This is right over there.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.936
Outside, on the northern side
of what is now called Medina.

00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:23.796
But then a few years later
you have a significant battle.

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:27.040
Where the Quraysh have
built a confederacy.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.951
And they wanna end the
teachings of Muhammed,

00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.288
they wanna end these
Muslims who are threatening,

00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:37.663
who's preachings are
threatening the pilgrimage,

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:41.323
the legitimacy of the
Quraysh tribe in Mecca.

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:45.695
And so they laid siege
to the city of Medina.

00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:49.259
And as a defensive measure,
the Muslims in Medina,

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.676
create a trench around the city.

00:06:51.676 --> 00:06:54.626
And that's why this is called
the Battle of the Trench.

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:57.899
And once again, according
to Islamic tradition,

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:01.054
the Muslims are outnumbered three to one.

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:05.221
So this is right over here,
the Battle of the Trench.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.731
In which the Muslims are victorious.

00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:12.418
And this is a significant
blow to the legitimacy,

00:07:12.418 --> 00:07:15.822
the prestige of the Quraysh tribe.

00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:19.217
A year later, you have
the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah,

00:07:19.217 --> 00:07:22.751
between the Quraysh and the Muslims.

00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.384
And this is significant
because it's starting

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:28.360
to put these early Muslims
on the same footing

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.378
as the powerful Quraysh tribe.

00:07:30.378 --> 00:07:34.773
It has some allowances for the
Muslims to make pilgrimages

00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:35.856
to the Kaaba.

00:07:37.111 --> 00:07:41.278
But then as we go into 630,
there's an incident in which

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.451
one tribe kills some
members of another tribe.

00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:49.940
Remember we're still in
a very tribal society.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.081
And the other tribe, the one
that had some members killed,

00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:56.507
was aligned, was friendly
with the early Muslims.

00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:59.185
So the early Muslims
did not appreciate this.

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.645
They send an ultimatum to the Quraysh.

00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:06.215
And the Quraysh essentially
say well that doesn't matter,

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:08.770
we don't really take what
you have to say seriously.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.142
And they take one of the
options of the ultimatum,

00:08:11.142 --> 00:08:15.590
which is making the Treaty
of Hudaybiyyah null and void.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.240
So now that the treaty is
not there, and once again,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.446
this is according to Muslim traditions,

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:23.904
which are our main accounts
that we have of this time.

00:08:23.904 --> 00:08:26.821
We then have in 630, 10000 Muslims,

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:29.550
which is a very significant number.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.164
Remember only six years ago,
we're talking about only 300

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:34.182
Muslims in the Battle of Badr.

00:08:34.182 --> 00:08:36.932
But 10000 Muslims march on Mecca.

00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:41.682
And they're able to take
the city peacefully.

00:08:41.682 --> 00:08:45.073
And what this results in is
essentially most of the city,

00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:46.740
converting to Islam.

00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:51.007
And famously Muhammed goes into the Kaaba

00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:53.424
and destroys the idols there.

00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:56.850
And according to Islamic tradition,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.600
makes the Kaaba a center
of the Muslim faith.

00:09:01.585 --> 00:09:04.157
And it is even today.

00:09:04.157 --> 00:09:08.324
Now from that point, the
spread of Islam continues.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.370
You have Muhammed and his
armies, this green area

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.441
is essentially what they
were able to conquer

00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:17.858
in the remainder of his life.

00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:25.466
He lives for another two years after

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:28.216
the acceptance of Islam by Mecca.

00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:34.271
And they're able to conquer
most of this dark green area

00:09:36.146 --> 00:09:38.949
here and as we'll see,
shortly after his death,

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:41.485
most of Arabia and even Persia,

00:09:41.485 --> 00:09:42.914
and within a few hundred years,

00:09:42.914 --> 00:09:46.047
a large chunk of the world were able

00:09:46.047 --> 00:09:48.877
to be conquered by these Muslim armies.
