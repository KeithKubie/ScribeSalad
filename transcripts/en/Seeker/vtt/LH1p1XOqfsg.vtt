00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.080
He's a cold-hearted snake (OOO) look in to
his eyes.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
Uh-oh.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.559
He's been lying on a rock to get warmth from
his environment.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.020
Sup meatbags, Trace here for DNews to talk
about why you're all SO HOT.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.280
But really, you're hot.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.260
Have you ever thought about why?

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Thermoregulation.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.250
Science divides thermoregulation into endothermic
or ectothermic; homeothermic or poikilothermic

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.250
(poiˈkēləˌTHərmic).

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.180
Endo and ecto thermic describe an animal that
either makes it's own heat or gets it from

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
the environment.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.260
Homeo and Poikilo describe whether the temperature
is constant.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.560
A cute siamese cat is an endotherm and homeotherm,
it makes it's own heat, and maintains a constant

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.240
body temperature; most mammals and birds are
endothermic homeotherms -- what elementary

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.130
school would call warm-blooded.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.989
Fish, amphibians, reptiles and most invertebrates
are ectothermic poikilotherms; they get heat

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.500
from the environment and let their body temperature
fluctuate -- what the youths would call cold-blooded.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.830
But that's only part of the picture!

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.250
They make their own heat, but don't always
maintain it.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.970
Some fish maintain a constant temperature
and create heat by swimming from cold to warmer

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.590
water, but can't generate it themselves; leatherback
turtles and lamnid sharks do this too!

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.560
All I'm saying is, it's a wider world than
the black-and-white of cold versus warm blood!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.960
But that's not all!

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.690
Dinosaurs used to be thought of as cold-blooded
terror lizards that would obviously make AMAZING

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.100
PARK ATTRACTIONS DON'T WORRY NOTHING COULD
GO WRONG.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.810
// But a study in Science found dinosaurs
were likely mesotherms -- they used a combination

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.060
of internal processes and environmental factors
to adjust their overall body temperature!

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.020
Plus, animals that hibernate like chipmunks
and some bats are heterothermic!

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.020
Whew.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.390
Yeah, It gets confusing,.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.610
The reason we simplify it to warm and cold
blooded is because temperature, which is mainly

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.500
circulated by the blood, affects things like
muscle function and brain size.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.440
Colder muscles react slower, meaning ectothermic
animals have to behave sluggishly when the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.510
environment is cooler.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.869
They have no choice!

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.460
Even if a predator is around.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.780
According to Spring and Holley's Introduction
to Zoology, with a 18 degree F (10C) change

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.670
in temperature, muscles contract three times
faster, pulling three times the power.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.660
Knowing this, you can understand why yellowfin
tuna evolved to be poikilotherms!

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.920
Warmer muscles react better, allowing them
to keep their bodies at a slightly higher

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.290
temperature than the surrounding water; thus
they maximize their power and catch prey.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.791
Mammals and birds range in temperature from
97 to 104F (37-40C) and that has a cost; we

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:37.100
have to eat to live and regulate metabolism!

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.450
Pandas spend 10 to 16 hours a day eating,
and the British Medical Journal recorded hunger

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900
strikers who lasted 40 days without food.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.910
But that's child's play; pythons can go a
year between meals.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.950
So why aren't we just SLIGHTLY regulating
our temperatures like tuna?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.980
Seems like a big waste to burn all that energy
and stay hot all the time, right?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.540
All that heat keeps our muscles ready for
action.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.580
Endothermic animals can almost always outrun
ectothermic animals; assuming they survive

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.620
the initial strike.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.580
Ectothermic animals are better at that initial
attack… think a snake or fast-fish!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.270
Insects with cold muscles can't fly, the Sphinx
Moth vibrates its muscles before takeoff to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.270
get them warm.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.960
Plus, cold animals may miss opportunities
to use their muscles to get all up ons and

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960
mate!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.340
Warm-blooded animals can mate ANYTIME.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.420
Which… you know.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.420
That's fun.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.440
PLUS all that energy and heat allows for the
evolution of more complex brain structures,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.830
which allowed me learn to talk to you right
now!

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.519
That being said, it's hot.

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.519
It's real hot.

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.489
And sometimes it's just TOO hot… or too
cold!

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.311
So animals that evolved to be homeothermic
-- maintaining temperature -- had to ALSO

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:50.360
evolve fur or blubber to stay warm and sweat
glands or panting to cool off.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.980
But that's a whole other video.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.319
Want to know why we sweat and how AWESOME
we are at it?

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:10.629
Check out this video Do you have 
a science question you want us to answer?

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.540
YouTube gave us the comments for a reason,
so y'all could troll, but you could ALSO use

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.199
them to ask me a science question.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.309
Maybe try that?

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.309
And please subscribe!

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.939
We're here every day for our subscribers,
and I love my job.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.849
So from the bottom of my heart, thanks!
