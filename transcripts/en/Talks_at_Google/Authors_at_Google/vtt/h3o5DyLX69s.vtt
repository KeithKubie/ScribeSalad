00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:09.080
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.100
And welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.414
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Benjamin Schwartz.

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:20.210
He joins us today to discuss
his book "Right of Boom:

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.620
The Aftermath of Nuclear
Terrorism." "Right of Boom"

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.510
asks what if.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.890
What if a nuclear
weapon exploded

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.560
in a major American
city, and no one

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.390
can prove who was responsible?

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.650
The devastation is horrifying.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.910
But even more alarming
are the limited responses

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.020
available to the United
States government.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.220
What happens next?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.830
In the book, the explosion
occurs in downtown Washington,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.470
DC.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.820
Ben maps out the
likely ramifications

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.080
while going deep into
history to explore

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.345
the limited range
of options available

00:00:58.345 --> 00:00:59.345
to a commander-in-chief.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.940
Ben has served in a variety
of national security positions

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.790
within the US
government, including

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.950
in the Department of State,
Department of Defense,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.920
and Department of Energy.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.910
This is his first book.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.135
Please join me in
welcoming Ben Schwartz.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.880
BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ: Thank you
for the kind introduction.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.950
I spend a good deal of
time in Washington, DC

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.500
in meetings in buildings
like the Pentagon, the State

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.530
Department, and the White House.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.180
But after today, I'll be able
to tell my friends and family

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
that I've really seen the
center of global power,

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230
because I've been to Google.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.660
The forces that this company
has unleashed are truly amazing.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.350
And it's an honor to be
here to speak a little bit

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.180
about this book today.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.360
I'll go into my book talk
probably for about 25 minutes.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.890
Then I'm happy to
field some questions

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.510
and entertain some discussion.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.580
As a current employee of
the Department of Defense,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.830
however, I am compelled to
begin with two disclaimers.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.490
So please excuse them.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.250
The first is that
I'm here speaking

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.190
in my personal
unofficial capacity,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.320
and my remarks don't
necessarily reflect

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.430
the positions of the Defense
Department or any other US

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.450
government agency.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.289
And as a lowly civil
servant, my remarks

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.830
are in no way meant
to be interpreted

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.850
as a criticism of the policies
of the Obama administration.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.410
So again, please
excuse me if I don't

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.610
get into any critical
comments about current policy.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.740
Now, the book.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.480
Let me begin with an explanation
of the title. "Right of Boom."

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.980
As many of you here
probably are aware,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.580
the most deadly threat to
US servicemen and women

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.660
in Iraq and Afghanistan
came from roadside bombs,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.230
or improvised explosive devices.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.350
In the defense community, when
we talked about this problem,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.091
we often refer to the
need to get left of boom,

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:05.340
to distinguish the kind of
actions that could be taken

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.410
before an attack occurred,
from the response activities--

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.080
evacuation, casualty
assessment, things like that,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.740
that would take place
after an attack.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740
Well, "Right of
Boom" is about what

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.610
happens after a bomb goes off.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.780
And the kind of bomb that
my book is focused on

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.600
is an atomic bomb.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.610
The book is fundamentally
about a question.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.350
And that is, what could be done
if an atomic weapon went off,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.250
and you couldn't
effectively attribute it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.820
to a foreign government?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.090
A situation in which the
perpetrators deny involvement.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.590
And it's just not possible
even with evidence,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.540
to convincingly prove
who was responsible.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.500
10 years ago, Graham
Allison, a professor

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.020
at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, a senior official

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.940
in the Reagan
administration as well as

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.990
in the Clinton
administration, wrote a book

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.455
on nuclear terrorism.

00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:56.830
What he called the ultimate
preventable catastrophe.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.000
And in this book he put forward
a doctrine of three no's,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.240
or three red lines.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.176
And he asserted that if these
red lines were breached,

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:05.800
the kind of scenario
that I've laid out

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.160
would be a significant
possibility if not

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.330
an inevitability.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.680
Those were his words,
not necessarily mine.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.200
But the first no is no
new nuclear weapon states.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.010
And he was focused
primarily on North Korea.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.230
The second no was no new
national capabilities

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.950
to enrich uranium or
produce plutonium.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.510
And he was focused
primarily on Iran.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.060
And the third no
was no conditions

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.890
that could allow for
loose nuclear weapons.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.590
Like many others, at the
time he wrote this book,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.390
he was focused on the dispersed
arsenal of the former Soviet

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.130
Union.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.070
Well, as I've said, a decade
has passed since the publication

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.130
of his book.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.270
And today, North
Korea is indisputably

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.700
a member of the
nuclear weapons club,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.710
having conducted
effective nuclear tests

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.070
in 2006, 2009, and 2013.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.640
As we've read quite
recently in the paper,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.600
Iran has a well-established
nuclear program

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.800
composed of multiple facilities,
some of them very deeply

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.040
underground to make it
difficult for foreign militaries

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.176
to hold those sites at
risk to put them in danger.

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:12.550
And while there have been some
very positive developments

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.780
with respect to the arsenal
of the former Soviet Union,

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.317
I would attribute this positive
trend in significant part

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:21.650
to the efforts of what was
called the Cooperative Threat

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.570
Reduction Program.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.780
This was a program that
used your tax dollars

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.220
to pay for the destruction
of dangerous materials,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.190
the security of special nuclear
materials in the former Soviet

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.400
States, and even the salary
of some former Soviet atomic

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.770
scientists.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.980
This positive
development has been

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.610
accompanied by quite
concerning trends in Pakistan.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.720
According to Feroz
Khan, a 30-year veteran

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.030
of the Pakistani
military, and someone

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.580
that rose to the very height of
his country's nuclear weapons

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.260
program, Pakistan is in the
midst of a massive expansion

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.630
of its nuclear
arsenal, and plans

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.970
to deploy tactical
nuclear weapons

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.780
in ready-to-use conditions.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.720
We can understand
this is a reaction

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.240
to Indian conventional
military superiority.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.390
India being the country
that Pakistan has always

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.460
been most concerned about
from a security perspective.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.140
But it's also a quite
troubling development

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.705
when one considers the
inherent risks associated

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:21.870
with tactical nuclear weapons,
particularly the risks of theft

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.730
or loss of those materials.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.490
And I would add, especially
so in a country like Pakistan.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.550
And so we've gone from a
world of three no's-- Graham

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.094
Allison's framework--
to three yes's.

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.760
And when thinking
about the three yes's,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.530
it's worth keeping in
mind that the atomic bomb

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.880
is 1940s technology.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.330
And there are real
limits to what

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.890
can be done to prevent
the proliferation of 1940s

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.660
technology.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.256
This is not a novel point.

00:06:49.256 --> 00:06:51.130
But I do think it's one
that's not adequately

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.140
considered in current
debates and discussions

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.120
about nuclear weapons
and nuclear security.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.110
Now I think that for
someone like myself

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.360
to come up here and say that
this is a genuine threat,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.290
they should acknowledge
it at the outset

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.220
that there were reasonable
grounds for skepticism.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.540
Over the years, we've heard
senior government officials

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.450
and others repeatedly issue
warnings of threats-- dire

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.080
threats at times-- and then
seen that those threats were not

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.580
resonant.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.210
That they really didn't exist.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.770
And in the aftermath of
the truly colossal failure

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.270
regarding the assessment
of Saddam Hussein's weapons

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.680
program, it's
reasonable for people

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.570
to question the competency
or trustworthiness

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.980
of US government
officials, especially

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.680
those focused on WMD.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.770
And so I don't believe
that looking at this

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.990
and questioning it
is-- or in another way

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.690
of putting it-- accusations of
Chicken Little-like behavior

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.870
among officials like myself
are flippant responses.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.400
And yet, we still are left
with some troubling facts.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.970
I mentioned threats associated
with Iran, North Korean,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.610
and Pakistan.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.780
But the problem goes beyond
those three countries,

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.710
and really dates back to
the dawn of the nuclear age.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.540
And the problem is,
dispersed nuclear materials

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.660
and the inability to control the
secret behind weaponizing them.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.860
At the very dawn
of the atomic age,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.590
there was actually
great skepticism

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.830
among the scientific community
that the secret behind the bomb

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.160
could be kept a
secret for very long.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.430
But it's actually still
surprising in retrospect

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.960
that some of the most
important disclosures

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.110
occurred through official
US government reports.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.040
One scientist that had
participated in the Manhattan

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.809
Project testified before
the US Congress in 1947.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.190
And he said, half the
secret behind the bomb

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.700
was exposed when the bombs went
off in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.450
And I believe the other
half of the secret

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.990
was released when the
war department published

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.740
its first report on
the Manhattan Project.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.740
And so the secret
behind the bombs

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.215
spread through the loose
lips of scientists,

00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:55.290
in part, and through
espionage, but also

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.070
through these
public disclosures.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.100
So much so that by
the 1970s, it was

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.680
possible for a handful
of post-doctoral students

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.590
with rudimentary
training in physics

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.360
to actually design a viable
weapon without access

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.070
to any classified materials.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.140
This fact compelled the
Department of Energy at one

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.840
point to acknowledge
publicly in a report that--

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.660
and I'll quote
that report here--

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.680
"Classification may delay, but
cannot prevent the acquisition

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.390
of a first generation
nuclear weapon."

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.960
And the secret
behind the bomb was

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.420
accompanied by the spread
of the actual ingredients

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.050
for a weapon.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.370
The weapon was spread first
from the United States

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.680
to the Soviet Union.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.090
The United Kingdom, France,
China, Israel, India, Pakistan,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.990
North Korea.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.860
And the materials themselves
moved as well, in a way.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.990
Today, public
estimates place around

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.550
2,000 metric tons of
weapons usable material

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.760
to be in the global stockpiles.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.260
And this material is dispersed
across at least 25 countries

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.060
in hundreds of locations.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.620
Some of these locations not
being adequately secure.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.530
The global standard for securing
these materials is called--

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.212
and I use the term
standard loosely--

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.045
is the Convention on
the Physical Protection

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:17.160
of Nuclear Materials.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.150
But this actually
doesn't precisely

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.930
define the requirements
for securing

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.780
materials, what would be
considered a baseline standard.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.160
And it really only
applies to about 15%

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.420
of global stockpiles-- those
deemed to be associated

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.140
with civilian programs.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.730
The remaining estimated 85%
are deemed military materials,

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.270
and aren't even subject
to these basic safeguards.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.160
And so what this means to
me is that the material

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.380
and the know-how is now
so widely dispersed that

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.690
it's plausible for a government
to claim that it cannot

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.380
control, and is therefore
not responsible,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.020
for preventing nuclear
warfare or nuclear terrorism.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.940
This is a problem because
the most powerful force

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.470
that's prevented the
use of atomic weaponry

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.800
since World War II has
been the credible threat

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.960
of effective retaliation.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.270
The belief among governments
and citizens that

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.930
in the event that their
country, their territory.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.370
their resources, or fellow
citizens from their nation

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.600
are used to enable
or conduct an attack,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.840
that they're going to
pay a price, that there's

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.970
going to be consequences.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.520
And the reason that
the book focuses

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.430
on what happens right
of boom is my concern

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.100
that we're getting
to a tipping point,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.450
if we haven't already reached
it, in which nuclear warfare

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.230
becomes plausibly deniable.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.580
I'm gonna just note an
example of my concern.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.850
In 2007, the Israeli Air Force
struck a facility in Syria

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.750
that was being built with the
assistance of North Korean

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.100
nuclear engineers.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.110
A facility that was
intended eventually

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.380
to produce plutonium.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.210
What I wonder is,
what would've happened

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.690
if this strike hadn't occurred.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.960
The facility went online.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.520
Plutonium was
produced and acquired

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.550
by one of the numerous
violent groups

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.610
resident in the maelstrom
of today's Syrian Civil War.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.830
And what I wonder
is, would North Korea

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.900
be held accountable?

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.020
And I wonder if the North
Korean officials that

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.560
made the decision to provide
this kind of assistance

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.350
before 2007 believed
at that time

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.740
that they would be
held accountable

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.410
if their actions resulted
in the proliferation

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.630
of the atomic bomb, and
even to a non-state actor.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.837
I also wonder about less
direct forms of assistance,

00:12:24.837 --> 00:12:27.420
say the failure of a government
official in a friendly country

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.780
like France or Japan, to
allocate sufficient funding

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.700
for securing
facilities that possess

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.570
special nuclear material.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.930
What are the standards
of culpability?

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.510
What are the mechanisms to
hold people accountable?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.710
I want to be very clear.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.134
I'm not suggesting here
that nuclear terrorism is

00:12:45.134 --> 00:12:46.550
inevitable, or
that it's something

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.560
that's likely to happen
tomorrow or next year.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.240
But during the
Cold War, a hot war

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.300
between the United States
and the Soviet Union

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.330
wasn't inevitable either.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.690
And people nevertheless
spent considerable time

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.130
focused on that question.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.250
And governments invested
significant resources

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.130
in planning for such a scenario.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.130
And it's my opinion
that it's time

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.650
to think seriously
about what happens right

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.060
of boom-- right of an atomic
blast-- as Cold War strategists

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.360
thought about that scenario
during the standoff

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.550
between the capitalist system
and the communist system.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.390
Now what would occur right
of boom is unknowable.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.230
This is a hypothetical.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.990
But the range of
realistic response options

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.520
is not inconceivable,
because those options

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.660
would be extensions and
adaptations of past policies

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.120
and approaches.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.250
And while nuclear terrorism
would be unprecedented,

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.850
it actually is a
threat that combines

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.280
different types of challenges
that have been effectively

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.140
managed in the past.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.090
And what this means is that
it's possible to use history

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.570
to think comprehensively
about this problem.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.470
And that's the
methodology of my book.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.750
It's to use historical case
studies to surface lessons

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.720
about the choices that
decision-makers would

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.840
be confronted with, and
the tools that they would

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.590
have available to respond.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.520
I'll go through briefly
the historical topics now

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.150
that the book delves into.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.930
The first topic, understandably,
is the history lessons

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.490
of efforts in non-proliferation
and counter-proliferation.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.980
Non-proliferation really deals
with international cooperative

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.720
activities, while
counter-proliferation

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.800
tends to be coercive actions,
and often more unilateral.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.590
When it comes to
nuclear weapons,

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.350
non-proliferation
can be traced back

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.210
to the Truman administration
and their support for an entity

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.000
that they called the Atomic
Development Authority.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.210
This entity was
intended eventually

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.830
to have access and
control of the world's

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.150
special nuclear materials--
uranium deposits, thorium

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.650
deposits, facilities
that produce plutonium.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.140
Now this entity never
came into being.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.990
But the idea behind
it-- the idea

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.420
of international cooperation
against this threat--

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.940
has lived on in the alphabet
soup of international regimes,

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.330
treaties, and the sort of
numerous United Nations

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.046
Security Council resolutions
focused on nuclear weapons

00:15:07.046 --> 00:15:07.920
and nuclear security.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.510
Say for example, the
work of the IAEA,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.150
the non-proliferation treaty,
and things of that nature.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.610
And these are voluntary efforts.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.170
And in the current
political environment--

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.920
left of the kind of catastrophic
event that I've referred to--

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.430
this may represent the very best
that's possible with respect

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.630
to non-proliferation.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.950
But right of boom, there
could be a new willingness

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.780
among people and
governments to empower

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.010
an organization like the IAEA
with the expand authorities.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.200
The ability to do things
like confiscate and secure

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.500
nuclear material, issue
fines against those

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.300
that do not adequately
store their capabilities,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.320
or even grant such an entity
access and some degree

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.450
of control over nuclear weapons.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.190
Walter Lippmann wrote that
it's a disease of the soul

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.430
to be in love with
impossible things.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.925
And proponents of
grand proposals

00:16:02.925 --> 00:16:06.500
that commit nations to surrender
their abilities to organize

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.315
violence-- their military
capabilities-- history

00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:11.400
has not been kind
to such proposals.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.370
But it is possible that right of
boom, that these kind of things

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.710
could be politically feasible.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.900
Now counter-proliferation.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.850
There's a long
history of governments

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.860
using coercive means
to try to prevent

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.360
the spread of dangerous weaponry
and dangerous materials.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.290
My book, for example,
cites an operation launched

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.860
during World War
II by the British

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.790
to sabotage a heavy water
reactor in Norway that Hitler

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.570
was having
constructed, as well as

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.330
instances of commando
raids against vessels

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.980
on the high seas engaged
in the transportation

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.080
of WMD-related materials, air
strikes like the Israeli air

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.290
strike that I've mentioned, as
well as more recent allegations

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.150
of sabotage like
the Stuxnet virus

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.830
allegedly that we read
about in the press.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.320
In the aftermath of the kind
of scenario I've laid out,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.337
these kind of activities
would certainly expand.

00:17:04.337 --> 00:17:05.920
And I think there'd
be some similarity

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.970
from the kind of expansion
we saw with respect

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.910
to counter-terrorism.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.109
Before the events of 9/11, most
counter-terrorism activities

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.880
that the US government
engaged in inside of countries

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.260
in which we were not
at war took place

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.700
through law
enforcement cooperation

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.880
or under intelligence
authorities--

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.650
covert action findings.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.940
But after 9/11, the US military
in acknowledged operations,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.770
began participating in coercive
counter-terrorism activities

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.460
in a significant way.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.010
And I think that one
of the possibilities

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.120
that my book explores
is that right of boom,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.130
you could see a
similar expansion

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.230
of coercive activities, but
one focused on nuclear threat

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.310
networks more broadly.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:51.970
Now a second historical topic
that the book delves into

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.480
are the lessons of the
70 years of Brinkmanship

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.980
between nuclear weapons powers.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.540
The debates and ideas that
went into the doctrines

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.190
of massive retaliation--
mutually assured destruction,

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.750
and flexible response, as
well as the interaction

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.910
between these doctrines
in the official statements

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.392
of government officials-- their
warnings to foreign countries--

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:12.850
and the capabilities
that countries

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.590
have in terms of
their intelligence

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.340
and military arsenals, and
the reputations that countries

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.370
have for using these
capabilities-- how all this has

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.720
come together to either
produce credible defense

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.910
commitments to
establish deterrence,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.350
or fail to do those things.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.020
The history of that tells us
a lot about some of the things

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.390
that policymakers have
struggled with with respect

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.630
to nuclear terrorism.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.480
And I'll just give
you one example.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.700
A central lesson of the
history of the Cold War

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.900
is the supreme importance
of communicating

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.310
red lines-- actions
that constitute

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.530
a threat to a country's vital
national security interest,

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.380
and actions that would provoke
a response by a government.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.530
During the Cold
War, these red lines

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.580
were typically
international borders.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.440
And they were literally crossed
when armies marched over them.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.290
And a great deal
of time was spent

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.980
developing defense treaties
that committed countries to work

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.530
together if their sovereign
territory was violated.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.430
Well today, neither
international law

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.890
nor the US Defense policy
communicates red lines

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.810
associated with
nuclear proliferation

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.087
as effectively as we
communicate red lines associated

00:19:20.087 --> 00:19:21.920
with the violation of
international borders.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.610
And that's understandable,
given the historical context.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.450
But that's something that would
likely change right of boom.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.660
And one way that
it could change is

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.920
that there could be a
new concept regarding

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.450
the presumption of
guilt of countries that

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.640
don't participate in
international cooperative

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.444
efforts against
nuclear terrorism.

00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:43.360
So one of the things
that would be very useful

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.450
is to have a database
of signatures

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.630
of special nuclear material, so
that in the event that a blast

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.310
goes off, you could use
forensics information

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.060
to try to identify where
the material came from.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.590
But for that to
be a viable tool,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.710
you need countries
to willingly provide

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.350
that kind of information
about their programs.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.170
Well, the idea that I
put forward in the book

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.290
is that there could be
a presumption of guilt

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.000
even in the absence of
airtight evidence of complicity

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.090
for those countries that
refuse to participate

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.240
in these kind of
cooperative efforts.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.890
And that is an idea
that you'll find

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.340
in some depth in this book.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.720
A third topic-- historical
topic the book goes into

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.974
are the enduring lessons
of countering terrorism.

00:20:28.974 --> 00:20:30.390
And the aspect of
terrorism that's

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.290
relevant to the
scenario laid out here

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.930
isn't the fact the
terrorists conduct

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.840
brutal violence
against civilians,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.660
or that the terrorist
groups that we

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.440
tend to be most focused on today
adhere to radical ideologies.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.050
Rather what's
relevant is the fact

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.300
that terrorists don't
occupy fixed territory that

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.720
can be pacified.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.350
And so they can't be
managed in the same way

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.230
that a government responds
to adversarial countries.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.310
But fortunately there's a long
history of effective response

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.490
to violent non-state groups.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.570
And some of the lessons that
one finds from this history--

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.200
and the book goes into a
lot of detail on this--

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.300
are the following.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.910
The importance of establishing
barriers to movement,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.510
from the Great Wall of China
to today's TSA checkpoints.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.340
The importance of using
economic leverage sanctions

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.730
and preventing the movement
of materials and goods

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.950
that would enable violent
non-state actors to operate.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.820
The promotion of some
type of accountable

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.640
governmental institutions
inside of territories where

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.944
violent groups find sanctuary.

00:21:34.944 --> 00:21:36.360
And the development
of specialized

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.650
paramilitary forces.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.290
In the historical case
studies the book delves into,

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.370
we find that
governments inevitably

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.140
end up creating some type
of paramilitary capability

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.180
that is more mobile
than a police force.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.100
Police forces tend to be manned
by people that live in a town.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.720
And so those people don't go
on expeditionary operations.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.090
They don't leave that
town too frequently.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.700
But paramilitary
forces are also less

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.020
costly than conventional,
large-scale military forces.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.390
And therefore they're able
to operate in terrain that's

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.950
more difficult to penetrate.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.204
And they're able to operate
for longer periods of time.

00:22:14.204 --> 00:22:16.120
And finally, one of the
lessons of the history

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.700
of dealing with terrorist
groups is the importance

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.640
of punitive and preventative
military expeditions.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.620
And the reason that
these things are unique

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.910
is that such operations are
distinguished by the fact

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.460
that they don't
have the intention

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.450
or aim to destroy the enemy.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.000
They recognize that
sometimes problem solution

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.390
is a hubristic conceit.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.140
And problem management is
really the only realistic course

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.394
of action.

00:22:39.394 --> 00:22:41.810
This is often the case when
dealing with terrorist groups.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.110
And when you try to solve
a problem absolutely,

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.695
you often create more problems.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.020
I'll give you one example of
what I'm getting into here.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.430
When it comes to the use
of unmanned aerial vehicles

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.700
for counter-terrorism
purposes, for some years

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.180
now there's been a bifurcated
debate between those

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.214
that say these capabilities
are very effective

00:23:04.214 --> 00:23:06.630
and should continue, and those
that say these capabilities

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.630
are ineffective and
create problems,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.390
for instance, killing
non-combatants.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.940
Well, what I would suggest
based on the history

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.940
that I've referred to is that
sometimes these kind of actions

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.800
are necessary, and
should continue,

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.700
but that we should
be under no illusion

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.370
that they're going
to solve the problem,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.840
that they're going to
win the war on terrorism.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.790
They're just actions that are
necessary to mitigate threats

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.800
until broader developments
occur that change the larger

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.340
strategic environment.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.430
The final historical
topic I'll mention

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.990
is a topic that I don't
think national security

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.296
specialists focus on enough.

00:23:46.296 --> 00:23:47.920
And that's the role
of dominant notions

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.260
of morality and legitimacy when
it comes to military actions.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.090
And the reason this
is an important topic

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.720
is because the
notions of legitimacy

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.860
that are prevalent
in a society directly

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.910
affect the political
feasibility of policy.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.680
And in this scenario
I've laid out what

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.130
I mean by policy is the
retaliatory response that

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.190
would be possible.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.260
For decades now, US
government officials

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.040
have made a lot of
threats and warnings

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.540
about what the United States
government would do in response

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.230
to nuclear proliferation
or assistance

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.520
with respect to
nuclear terrorism.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.377
But it's not clear to
me that these threats

00:24:25.377 --> 00:24:26.960
and these warnings
are always believed

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.126
by those that hear them,
or that they're believable.

00:24:29.126 --> 00:24:31.240
That they're credible.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.970
In 2001, the CIA director
George Tenet flew to Islamabad.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.820
And he threatened the
Pakistani President there.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.530
He said, quote-- "The full
fury of the American people

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.730
will be brought to bear
against anyone that assists

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.720
Al Qaeda in its efforts.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.699
Especially its efforts to
acquire a nuclear weapon."

00:24:47.699 --> 00:24:49.990
I wonder, what is the full
fury of the American people?

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.890
What did President Musharraf
think that this meant?

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.860
And I wonder, what did
Tenet think that it meant?

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.100
I delve into this question
in some depth in the book

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.790
by placing it in the context
of what it's meant historically

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:07.720
in the context of American
national security.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.860
Now pundits and
politicians often

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.730
use the term unprecedented
to describe the unfamiliar.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.850
But the kind of scenario
that the book delves into

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.330
is certainly
something that would

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.400
be truly new under the sun.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.480
And so there are limits to
the lessons of the past.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.330
I try to transcend this
problem somewhat in the book

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.677
by beginning each chapter
with a fictional narrative.

00:25:26.677 --> 00:25:28.510
So there's a scene of
the Secretary of State

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.640
on the phone speaking with
our foreign counterparts.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.680
Another with the
Secretary of Defense

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.940
conferring with the Special
Operations commander,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.050
discussing what are the range
of the authorities that he has?

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.520
Which countries
are Special Forces

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.704
authorized to operate in?

00:25:44.704 --> 00:25:46.370
What are the risks
that the government's

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:51.000
willing to consider with respect
to countries like India, China,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.130
and Russia?

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.430
The purpose of this drama
is not to be dramatic.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.560
This is not a thriller novel.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.520
The purpose is to highlight
real dilemmas, and challenges,

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.560
and complexities
that decision-makers

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.330
would be confronted with.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.120
And the other purpose of the
fictional aspect in the book

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.940
is to inject a temporal
element into the analysis--

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.730
the role of time.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.260
The opportunities
and constraints

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.690
that policymakers would face
in the immediate aftermath

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.290
of an attack would be
different from those that would

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.580
exist months and years later.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.360
In the immediate
aftermath of an attack,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.651
there would be tremendous
political pressure for the US

00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:29.130
government to
visibly demonstrate

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.670
its ability to project power.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.050
And this would likely result
in things like air strikes,

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.020
and commando raids, and visible
law enforcement actions.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.300
Things that while
necessary, would

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.660
be unlikely to fundamentally
address the problem of say,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.470
plausibly deniable nuclear
warfare, more broadly.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.860
These things would just deal
with immediate political

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.900
requirements.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.060
If you look historically,
cataclysmic wars

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.550
tend to begin with
the development

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.700
of new forms of technology, new
forms of organizing violence,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.140
and only end when new political
arrangements are developed

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.980
that are capable of
managing that technology--

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.870
those new threats.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.190
And that would certainly
be the case with respect

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.869
to nuclear terrorism.

00:27:14.869 --> 00:27:16.910
And that would be the work
not of days and weeks,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.090
but of months and years.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.860
Creating new military
intelligence,

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.750
law-enforcement
capabilities, and forging

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.160
new diplomatic coalitions
and promoting new norms

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.050
with respect to
international law.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.550
So those are some
of the questions

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.510
that you'll find
raised and addressed

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.930
in some way in the book.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.360
Let me close my
remarks by telling you

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.690
where this book came from.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.200
It really came from one
judgment and two questions.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.979
The judgment is my
view, as I've said,

00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.270
that we're getting close to
a tipping point in which we

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:51.730
enter a world where nuclear
warfare is plausibly deniable.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:57.250
And the questions that I had
after reaching this conclusion

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.760
were first, what
could realistically

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.350
occur if the kind of tragedy
I've mentioned happened?

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.640
And what lessons
from the past would I

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.760
want decision-makers
to have on the shelf?

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.740
My work in national
security has convinced me

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.430
that we don't use history as
frequently or as effectively

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.390
as we should when
formulating national policy.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.010
While the problems
of today never

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.490
are exactly the same as
the problems of the past,

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.810
there are often similarities.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.690
And it's useful to
look and consider

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:32.660
what's been done that's
been effective before?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.070
And what does that mean
for our way forward?

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.770
And that was partially
why I wrote this book.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.757
And so the book was really about
satisfying my own curiosity

00:28:41.757 --> 00:28:43.090
with respect to those questions.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.040
And my hope is
that others find it

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.870
to be at least an interesting
exploration of a troubling--

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.410
but I find unfortunately--
all-too-plausible scenario.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:58.867
And with that I'll close
and field some questions.

00:28:58.867 --> 00:29:01.450
AUDIENCE: Mr. Schwartz, thanks
for coming to talk to us today.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.850
You mentioned the
effectiveness of red lines

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.650
historically in
containing the Cold War.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.400
We're not in that error
anymore, but we're

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.330
also visibly not in the error
of effective redlines either.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.875
I think right of boom we would
have some political consensus

00:29:16.875 --> 00:29:18.750
where we could actually
enforce these things.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.030
But left of boom, we've seen
in the last couple of years

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.040
the President's ability
to project a redline,

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.960
but not enforce it due
to political dysfunction

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.520
in our Capitol.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.820
How do think that
contributes to the likelihood

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.617
of these sorts of scenarios?

00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:36.950
BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ: So for the
history buffs in the room,

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.980
you might recall that there's
a long history of the US

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.060
government and American
government officials

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:46.170
establishing redlines, even
in the absence of capabilities

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.215
to enforce them.

00:29:47.215 --> 00:29:50.470
You think about the
Monroe Doctrine.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.840
Present Monroe basically
committed the United States

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.105
to expelling all European powers
from the Western hemisphere

00:29:56.105 --> 00:29:59.930
at a time where the American
Navy was a small fraction

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.610
of what the British had.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.330
And so this is in one
sense not a new problem.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.650
But you're right
to highlight it,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.440
because when the gap between
what we say our defense

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.400
commitments are and what we're
actually capable of doing

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.500
grows too wide, it
invites adversaries

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.690
to probe at our redline.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.410
And that has the
potential to result

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.910
in unintended escalation,
which is dangerous.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:28.770
Because foreign powers
will think, well.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.620
I hear what the American
government says,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.560
and I see what they've
done in the past,

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.844
and I see what budget
cuts they're undergoing.

00:30:34.844 --> 00:30:36.760
And I don't think they're
going to do anything

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.460
if I take this step forward.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.350
And that's a
dangerous situation.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.960
So I think you raise
a very good point.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.330
Usually at these talks somebody
asks, so what's the good news?

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.500
Because this is sort
of a heavy subject.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.050
So I think I'll interject with
a little bit of a good news

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.430
point, because this
is a serious topic.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:02.230
The good news is that
during the Cold War,

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.260
our parents lived
at a time where

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.660
the threat of a truly
apocalyptic scenario

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.730
could arise.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.160
I mean, when you look at the
history of the Cuban Missile

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.522
Crisis-- particularly some
of the information that

00:31:14.522 --> 00:31:15.980
has come to light
in recent years--

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.346
you find out that small
miscalculations or decisions

00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:22.220
on both the American
side and the Soviet side

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.190
really could have resulted
in the launch of weapons

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:28.450
and the deaths of hundreds
of millions of people.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.310
And we don't face that today.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.310
The kind of scenario
described in the book

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.270
is a single weapon
going off-- a 15 kiloton

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.780
weapon-- which would
potentially kill 100,000 people.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.940
But we're not facing Armageddon.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.810
And we've lived through,
in certain respects,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.600
the most dangerous period when
it comes to nuclear weapons.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.760
But the threat has
adapted and changed.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.020
And it's important that I
think we change as well,

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.060
in terms of how we address it.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.950
AUDIENCE: So you've spoken
about unattributable attacks.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.780
How plausible do
you think that is

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.980
versus groups
standing up and just

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:10.450
having a land rush of claimants
for this sort of attack?

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.380
BENJAMIN SCHWARTZ:
So the question

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.690
of who would want
this weapon to go off

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.630
without being able to take
credit for it is a good one.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.130
I can think of a
number of scenarios

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.760
in which groups would do that.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.480
But the problem I'm
focused on is really

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:31.220
about response--
retaliatory response.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.320
So what you find in the
book is that there's

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.170
some ambiguity even when a
government may enable or assist

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.300
some type of attack.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.090
I'll give you an
example in recent years.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.620
So for a significant
period of time,

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:47.090
the Syrian government was
utilizing chemical weapons

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.870
against the opposition.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:53.040
And this was very apparent.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.910
You could look at YouTube
and see this stuff

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.470
for months and months.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.620
But it took at least
a year for a number

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.330
of governments in the
world to acknowledge

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.720
that this was in fact being
done by the Assad regime.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.110
Imagine a scenario where
it's a lot less direct.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.230
It's not is if a government is
using the weapons themselves,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:17.165
but they simply allow a
facility to be poorly guarded.

00:33:17.165 --> 00:33:20.050
Or they tell a couple of
people that, hey, there's

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:21.550
special nuclear
material going to be

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.800
transported from
one place to another

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.840
on this date at this time.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.970
I think it would be effectively
impossible to prove.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.640
And even if you had
a lot of evidence,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.810
it would be very difficult to
establish a political coalition

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.410
that would legitimate
a retaliatory response

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.982
in that scenario.

00:33:39.982 --> 00:33:41.690
And so that's the
problem that I'm really

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.170
focused on in the book.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.160
But your point about a
lot of claimants is valid.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.960
And it actually could result
in a similar anonymity.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.820
When you have many
people claiming things,

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.810
it's almost similar
to no one claiming it,

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.760
because you still can't respond.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.026
Well, thank you for having me.

00:33:58.026 --> 00:33:59.900
As I said, it's a real
honor to be at Google.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.620
This is an amazing place.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.490
And thank you again.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.840
[APPLAUSE]
