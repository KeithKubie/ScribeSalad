for example we build 10 hurricane

00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:13.739
for example we build 10 hurricane

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:19.489
shelters which never existed before so
the problem is every time you had a

disaster well the people the most
 

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.870
disaster well the people the most
vulnerable people went into shelters

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880
vulnerable people went into shelters
 

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.789
vulnerable people went into shelters
that happened to be schools so when the

00:38:30.789 --> 00:38:30.799
that happened to be schools so when the
 

00:38:30.799 --> 00:38:33.859
that happened to be schools so when the
disaster would last a long time the

00:38:33.859 --> 00:38:33.869
disaster would last a long time the
 

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:35.269
