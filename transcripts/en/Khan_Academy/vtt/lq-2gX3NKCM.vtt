00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.720
- Let's do a few examples
of writing expressions

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.620
to help us solve word problems.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.990
So they tell us Susie ran a race.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.950
She ran five miles an hour, and the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.890
race took her t hours to complete.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.950
How long was the race?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.480
Write your answer as an expression.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.590
Alright, if we're trying to
figure out the number of miles,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.290
you'd want to take her speed,
which is in miles per hour,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.490
so five miles per hour
times the number of hours.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.550
So the number of hours is t, so

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.250
you can literally just
write that as five t.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.950
Five t literally means five times t.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.420
Now another way you could have done it

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.190
is you could have used this
little dot symbol here.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.720
This is not a decimal, it
sits higher than a decimal,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.290
and it means multiplication,
five times t, either of these,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.690
five dot t or five t means
five times t, it makes sense.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.650
You take your speed times your time,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.750
and you'll figure out how
far you actually went.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.080
Let me check my answer here.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.390
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.390
The Running Aces card team won $548

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.250
playing poker in tournaments last year.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.450
The winnings were split
evenly among the p players.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.250
How much of money did each, I guess you'd

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.520
say how much money, not how much

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.320
of money, it's a grammatical error.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.120
How much money did each player receive?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.720
Write your answer as an expression.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.950
So they had $548, and they
had to split it evenly

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.610
among the p players, so
they're gonna split it,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.320
so I'm just gonna go backslash here,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.720
or I literally could have just clicked

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.420
on this as well, 548 divided by p.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.950
I'm gonna divide the
amount of money we got

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.090
amongst the number of players.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.790
So that's how much money each
player actually receives.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.190
Let's check the answer,
we've got it right.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.350
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.420
Phil received a prize of x
dollars from a poker tournament.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.500
The tournament cost him $100 to enter.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.750
What were Phil's net
winnings from the tournament?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.350
Write your answer as an expression.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.510
Alright, his net winnings, okay.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.950
He gets x dollars, but
it's not like he just

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.090
walks away with x, I means,
he does get the x dollars,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.350
but he had to pay something
to enter the tournament.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.350
He had to pay $100 to
enter the tournament,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.950
so for example, if x
was $105, he wins $105,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.920
but if he had to spend $100
to enter the tournament,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.120
then his net would be 105 minus 100,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.480
or five dollars, so this
is giving us the net.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.850
We're getting how much he got,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.000
but we're subtracting how
much he actually had to spend.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.880
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880
Hillary made 48 chocolate chip
cookies and y sugar cookies.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.890
How many total cookies did Hillary make?

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.150
Well, 48 chocolate chip cookies, and then

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.550
you add that, the number of sugar cookies

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.850
she made, and there you have it.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.290
That's the total number
of cookies she made.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.320
If she made two sugar
cookies, y would be two,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.990
and she would've made
a total of 50 cookies.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.950
If she made 100 sugar
cookies, then this would be

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.450
100 plus 48 which would
be 148 total cookies.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.080
So hopefully that gives you
a little bit of practice,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.980
and I encourage you to do this exercise

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.810
so you get a lot more practice.
