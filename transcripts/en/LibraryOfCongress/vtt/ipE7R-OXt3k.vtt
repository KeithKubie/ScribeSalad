00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.040
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Brown: Well,
good morning.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.680
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carolyn Brown: I'm Carolyn Brown,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.850
Director for Area Studies
Collections at the Library

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.270
of Congress which means the
Foreign Language Collections here.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.150
And I'm delighted to
welcome you this morning

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.870
to our Symposium on
Islam in America.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.960 position:56%
Over the last two years, I think the
first one was maybe April in 2000,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.980
we have been doing a series of
programs on Muslim societies.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.850
Most of our focus has been abroad.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.010
I guess there have
been seven of these.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.240
We've looked at the things,
Globalization in Muslim Societies,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.650
who looked at issues of identity
of women, minority communities,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.140
civil society, et cetera.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
Some of these were funded by
the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.520
Others were variously funded.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.450 position:56%
So we've had a long, relatively long
conversation about Muslim societies.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.090
This morning's program,
instead of looking outwards,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.520
we're now taking a look
at Islam in America.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.280
But it's part of really that
ongoing thinking and concern really

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.990
which began with our
perception two years ago

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.280
that Americans didn't understand
very much about the Muslim world

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.260
and that we needed to do
sort of our part in trying

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.040
to bring that greater awareness.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.920
I think we thought we had
greater time than it turns out.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.020
The imperative has
increased but the problem is,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.630
or the issue is not a new one.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.940
It's one, a long-standing one.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.780
Why at the Library of Congress?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.760 position:56%
A number of reasons for this series.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.460
We collect materials
in over 460 languages

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.560
of the world and in all scripts.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.620 position:56%
So we have a long-standing
collection whereby readers can study

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.040 position:56%
all parts of the world where
Muslims are a significant percentage

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.510
of the populations, whether
you're talking about Africa,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.730
the Middle East, Asia,
Pakistan, India, Indonesia,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.860
Central Asia, even Europe.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.890
We have materials from
all parts of the world,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.570
so actually theoretically
your limitations in terms

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.330
of research are only those of
the languages that you read.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.020
Also another point here
is that when you collect

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.440
that broadly you're also
assembling multiple perspectives.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.190
It's not one view;
it's multiple views.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.290
And there's an opportunity
then to get broad thinking.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.380
As we've looked at current
events, most recent ones,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.130
but more long-standing, it's
clear that you can only understand

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.170
so much, and some people
might say not much,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.120
if you don't have a rich background
in the culture and histories

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.370
in the particularities of
individual places and peoples.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.420
And, as I said, the
collections support all of that.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.810
But it's also recognition
that, although we're sitting

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.030
across the street from the U.S.
Congress which is very focused

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.310
as it needs to be on the
current moment, we need to bring

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.160
to the Capitol a deeper historical
cultural understanding rooted

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.940
in the languages and perceptions
of the peoples in the areas

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.370
of the world that we're
thinking about.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.210
And that includes our
own United States

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.690
which is what we're
focused on today.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.370
As we look to the future, this is
not the last of several programs.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.860
We also have fellowships for
the study of Globalization

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.910
in Muslim Societies and there will
be other programs coming along.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.620
So if you enjoy this morning's
program, keep your eyes open.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.110
There'll be more programs.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.460
This morning's program is
being recorded for Webcasting,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.120
and you'll find some of our
earlier symposium are on the Web.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.850
So there's a reach

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.020
and an opportunity beyond just
what you receive in this room.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.850
I did want to take a moment to
thank all of you for coming today.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:16.400
A special thanks to our
panelists who are joining us,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.170
to the also Scholarly Programs,
especially its Director,

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.270
Pross Gifford, over there at the
back of the room, the African

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.550
and Middle Eastern Division
and all of the staff involved,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.250
and especially to our World
Area Specialist Mary-Jane Deeb

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.090 position:56%
who has been the, I'll say the
brains, really, behind all of these.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.820
We may have the idea but
in terms of executing it

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.630
with intellectual integrity and
wisdom we've relied on Mary-Jane.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.420
So she's kind of the
silent one around here.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.850
Although if you have
a chance to talk

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.620
to her you'll find she's
anything but silent --

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.170
a great store of knowledge
and wisdom.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.900
And with that said, why don't
we move on to the first panel.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.270
The panelists are here and Rita
Harper is going to be the Chair

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.290
of that panel, [inaudible] with the
African Middle Eastern Division.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.100
Thank you.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.450
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Good
morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.090
You are welcome to our symposium
this morning on Islam in America.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.520
My name is Marieta Harper,
Area Specialist for Africa,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.320
in particular the francophone
countries.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.350
I have the distinct honor of being
the Chair for today's first panel,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.080
Historical Roots of Muslim
Immigration to the United States.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.410
Each panelist will
speak for 15 minutes.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.550
At the end of the panel we
will have time for questions.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.120
Our first speaker will
be Derrick J. Beard.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.400
He's widely recognized to be a
preeminent collector of 18th, 19th,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.560
and early 20th century African
American decorative arts,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.470
photography, rare books,
and one-of-a-kind documents.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:24.600
He owns over 10,000 items of
African American material culture

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:34.290
that includes furniture, books,
paintings, and memorabilia.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.010
Chief among his achievements
has been the reconstruction

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.260
over the last decade
of the Art Institute

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.870
of Chicago's collection
of African American art.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.300
He was responsible for the
Institute's acquisition

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:54.950
of Horace Pippin's Cabin
in the Cotton done in 1935,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:01.040
the most important 20th century
painting by an African American.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.950 position:56%
He studied at the Art Institute of
Chicago, the Crane Hook Arts Academy

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:12.010
in Michigan, and graduated with
a degree in Urban Economics

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.910
from the University of Illinois.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.180
He and his family are
the current owners

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:24.740
of the unique African manuscript
in Arabic of Omar ibn Said,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.840
which you'll get chance
to see later.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.230
Derrick Beard.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:34.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard: I think first I
think I would like to give a moment

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:42.070
of silence for all of the
victims of 911 and all the victims

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.580
of terrorism throughout the world.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.870
So that we can at least
give a moment of silence.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.070
And I would like to thank the staff

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.410
of the African Middle Eastern
Division here at the Library

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.590
of Congress, the staff of
the Scholarly Programs,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.740 position:56%
and our government for offering the
first Symposium on Islam in America.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:13.410
After 911 I was thinking that
there was a very important Arabic

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.940
manuscript which could
help us as Americans

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.910
to have a better understanding
of Islam

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.060
and our American Islamic heritage.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.300 position:56%
So, therefore, I felt that it was my
duty as an American to come forward

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.730
with the manuscript of
the life of Amar ibn Said.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:39.060
And what we'll find with the life
of Omar will help to shatter many

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.440
of the stereotypes and
prejudices about Islam in general,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.260
and Muslims in particular.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:53.020
I believe one important question
has kind of recently arisen.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:00.110
Can Islam be synonymous
with patriotism?

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:07.650
And I say absolutely because Islam
represents a critical consciousness

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.790
which personifies itself
in high moral character.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.400
It starts with the
individual, then to the family

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.390
and the community, and
then to the nation.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.360
In fact, if we look across the
Pacific, particularly to China,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.510
we'll find many of the Chinese
Muslims who are minorities

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:35.040
in China were great citizens and
they had contributed immensely

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.960
to the development of
Chinese civilization

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.090
over the last 1000 years.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.230
And here in America we have
many patriotic acts of Muslims,

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:49.040
particularly such as an
African Muslim by the name

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.990
of [foreign words] who was at
Sapelo Island in Georgia where he

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.900
and his fellow Muslims
prevented the British

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.230
from invading the coast of Georgia.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.310
And then we have Nicholas
Said who was

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:07.170
from the famous 54th Massachusetts
Regiment, and as we know

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.960
in the movie <i>Glory </i>, which turned
the tide of the whole Civil War.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.500
And, of course, we have Muslims
who have contributed militarily,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.180
to science, to medicine,
and many areas which helped

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.630
to develop our great country.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.260
So which brings me today to bring
my presentation, which is the story

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:36.780 position:56%
of Omar ibn Said, a Muslim slave and
evidence of early Islam in America.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.390
And I guess I should
greet you in the words

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.110
of Omar would have greeted
you, Assalamu-Alaikum.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.970
&gt;&gt; Assalamu-Alaikum.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.710
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard: Al-Islam

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.690
in the Americas is not a
20th century phenomenon.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.440 position:56%
Many people have been led to believe

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.310
that it did not have
many followers here,

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.040
until the large-scale
movement spearheaded largely

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.670
by Malcolm X in the 1960s.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.950
It is true that during this time
Islam gained prominence in America

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.100
in a way that it had not
previously done before.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.330
However, it did exist,
and in some cases,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.170
thrived in the Western Hemisphere.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.970
In the past, scholars have ignored

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.250
or simply failed to
mention this fact.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.630
This is probably because many

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.470
of them did not have sufficient
enough understanding of or interest

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:34.580
in Islam to accurately document and
access its New World's presence.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.880
This is beginning to change.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:43.680
The legend of Abubakari
II of Mali was reported

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.210
in [foreign words] places
his journey to the Americas

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.400
in the year 1312 according

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.530
to Professor Ivar van
Surderman [assumed spelling]

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.680
at Rutgers University.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.890
And because of the explosion,
the expulsion I should say,

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:06.690
of Muslims from Spain, and Jews,
during the years of 1609 to 1614,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.920
a large number of them
fled to Spanish Americas

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.930
which Spanish Americas included
here in the United States Florida,

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.170
South Alabama, and parts
of Louisiana depending on,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.210
you know, dates and time.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.310
This resulted because many
Muslims living in Spain

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.220
at this time were forced
to convert to Christianity

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.940 position:56%
which Muslims would call it Moriscos
and Jews would call it Marranos,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:44.380
but continued to practice, covertly
practice their Islamic faith.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:49.990
Islam intolerance persisted even
after those people were identified

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.120
as Muslim had been
banished from Spain.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.960
The southern part of this
country for a long time required

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.010
that its citizens keep
its doors open

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.920
on Friday prevent possible
Jumu'ah congregations.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.820
There are numerous other clues
that would alert the observant

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.670
to the existence of Muslim
communities in early America,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:18.540
from the Spanish Inquisition
into the Transatlantic

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.310
and the Transpacific slave
trade which is very interesting.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.620
A Transpacific slave trade.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.920
There's a book called the <i>History</i>

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.470
<i>of the Manila Acapulco Slave
Trade </i>by Father Jose Maria Luengo

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:40.750
which this Transpacific slave
trade which spanded [sic]

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:49.230
about three centuries included the
shipment of Filipinos, Indonesians,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.600
and South Asians to the Americas.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.180
These bits of evidences, material
evidences, that we find --

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.430
the presence of foods and spices
such as dates, sate, cumin,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.440
cunderdin; architecture such as
the corbel technique and the use

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.530
of interior courtyards; and
the documentations of names

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:17.440
such as Bolelli, Belau, Mamadu,
Abdel, Fatima, Omar, Mecca, Medina.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.250
These are quite common names,

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.640
particularly in the Caribbean
and in Latin America.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:28.100 position:56%
One of the most important remaining
articles of Islamic material culture

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.910
from early America is a manuscript
written by Omar ibn Said.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.590
So this is a frontage
slide of the manuscript

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.430
which you can take a look
at after the conference.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.090
It's in this display case here.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:52.370
It was written in 1831 and it is
the only existing autobiographical

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.730
manuscript that is known
to exist in the Americas.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:01.050
Omar was born in Futa Tooro.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.780
And this, of course -- this is the
Arabic writing of the front page

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.840
of the manuscript by Omar.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.250
So Omar was born in area of Futa.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.320
This is -- actually I was in Futa
in May, so I took some photographs.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.780 position:56%
So just give a the viewer -- give
us a little visuals of the landscape

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.330
of what Omar came from
and his environment.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.960
Futa is an area in --
along the Senegal River

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.300
which encompasses Senegal,
Mauritania, and Mali.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.910
It's an area where
Islam actually thrives

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.230
and existed for over 1000 years.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.580
He was born in Futa
in the year of 1770.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.960
He was a devout Muslim and a member
of a family of impressive wealth

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.060
who represented from the
-- who were represented

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.490
from their strict adherence
to the laws of Islam.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.960
Omar ibn Said had made Hajj
and he was also a trader

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.360
who probably spoke many languages
as was the case with most people

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.990
of similar social standings.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.420
During the 18th and
19th century Islam

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:27.280
in Africa was undergoing
a series of changes.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.910
There was simultaneously
expansions, jihad of the faith,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.480
throughout the regions
of Senegal, Gambia,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.770
and the Gulf of Guinea
alongside the collapse of older,

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.500
some established Islamic empires

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.290
because of European military
expansions and the development

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.820
of the Atlantic slave trade.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.870
The fall of these communities
resulted in the capture

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.630
of many Muslims as well as
non-Muslims for the sale of chattel

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.340
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.710
Omar was captured around 1807.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:07.970
This was a result of a battle that
took place about the same time,

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.940
which we pretty much believe
is a result of his capture,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:17.890
the Battle of [foreign words],
who was defeated by his cousin,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.810
[foreign words] who was -- with
the aid of the French was able

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:28.510
to defeat [foreign words] and he
controlled that area of Senegal

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:32.900
and Omar describes this in his
manuscript, that he was captured

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.710
as a result of a big battle,
that many people had died.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:38.130
So we largely believe
that this, in fact,

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.790
is the Battle of [foreign words]

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.410
that resulted in the
capture of Omar.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.160
And he was brought to
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.330
Upon his arrival in North
America his name was contorted

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.830
to such various pronunciations
and spellings

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.730 position:56%
such as [speaking foreign language].

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:05.530
Despite his shift in status, being
removed from his native land,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:12.140
Omar remained an individual noted
for his -- I should say, quote,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:18.220 position:56%
whole person and gaunt bearing marks
of considerable refinement according

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.740
to Reverend William S. Plummer, a
Presbyterian pastor or professor

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.770
in the Western Theological
Seminary from 1854 to 1862.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:35.650
The following is a brief
account by Omar, written by Omar,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.680
to a man by the name
of Shake Hunter.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.790
In fact, this manuscript was
written and given to Shake Hunter,

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.970
but also known as Layman
Kaaba [assumed spelling].

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.490
He was another fellow Muslim
from that area of Africa, Mbundu,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.660
who was living in New York City.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.440
And it was given to him around 1836
and then subsequently it was given

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.210
to Theodore de White
who was the brother

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.530 position:56%
of the President of Yale University.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.340
And I'll read -- this
is the Introduction

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.850
of the actual manuscript itself.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:13.460
It says, "In the name of God, the
Grace, the Glorious, the Merciful,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.770
thanks be to God, supreme
and goodness and kindness

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:26.110
and who's worthy of all honor, who
created all things for his service,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.640
even man's power of
action and speech.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.570
You asked me to write my life.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.610
My name is Omar ibn Said.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.080
My birthplace was Futa
Tooro, between two rivers,

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.270
the land between two rivers.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.740
I sought knowledge
under the instruction

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.390
of a sheik called Muhammad
Said, my own brother,

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:54.960
and Sheik Solomon Kaaba,
and Sheik Gabriel Abdel.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.070
I continued by studies 25
years," which was the tradition,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.090
"and returned to my home
where I remained six years.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:11.400
Then came to our place a large army
which killed many men and took me

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.160
and brought me to the great
sea, and sold me into the hands

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.210
of the Christians who bound
me and sent me onboard.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:29.630
We sailed upon the great sea a
month-and-a-half when we came

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.490
to a place called Charleston
in the Christian language.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:39.070
Before I came to the Christian
country, my religion was one

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.960
of Muhammad's, the Apostle of God.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:47.240
May God have peace upon
him and give him peace.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.320
[Foreign word] have mercy
upon him and give him peace.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:58.450
We walked to the mosque before
daybreak, washed my hand and face

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:07.320
and head and feet, prayed at
noon, prayed in the afternoon,

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.520
prayed at sunset, and
prayed in the evening."

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.310
Throughout the course
of Omar's life,

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.380
Omar's Dean was relentlessly
challenged by the insistence

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.680 position:56%
that all slaves imported to the
Americas were to accept Christianity

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.100
or face dire consequences.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.480
And I'd like to quote from the
late Reverend Howard Thurman,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.450
which is one of our great African
American theologians who was,

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.260
in fact, the mentor
to Martin Luther King

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.190
when he was a student at Morehouse.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.960
And this is what the
Reverend Howard Thurman says.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.240
"The slave was cut off from his
religion, whatever kind it was.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.190
It is quite beside the point to
say that he was given Christianity,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:03.660
an infinitely better religion
than anything he had known before

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.900
when the Master gave to
the slave his Master God.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.340
For a long time it had
meant it was difficult

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.680
to disentangle religious
experience from slavery sanction."

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:25.750 position:56%
Thus, Omar was forced to replace
the writings of the Koran with those

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.390
of the Bible, and eventually
began to go regularly

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.690
to the Presbyterian Church.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.690
Soon Omar did not publicly
acknowledge that Islam was a faith

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.830
that he had been born into.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.300
He began to hide it and thereby
making Christians observe

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.410
[Inaudible] assume that he
had -- his soul had been won.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:46.350
In fact, Omar's Christian
studies ended up being a bridge

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.290
that reinforced what was being
challenged, his Islamic faith.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.110
And I'll mention this from --

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.490
there's this quote
from Omar's manuscript.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.500
Jim Owens, who was his -- General
Jim Owens, who was his owner,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.030
and the wife used to read in
jail the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.090
"They read to me -- did very
much allow Lord I create a King

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.530
who regulates all circumstances,
our health and wealth,

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.240
who bestows His bounty willingly

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.950
without constraints exceeding
according to His powers.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.900
Open my heart to the
way of guidance.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.740
All praises are due
to allow the Lord

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.930
of the World with abundant praise.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.030
He is putting us in his blessings
and abundant in His goodness.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.770
For this reason the laws of
Moses, one most act further.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.060
The blessings and trust by
made by the Jesus the Messiah.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.090
First and foremost is Muhammad."

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.240
And then he opens up with "[foreign
words], praises due to Allah,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.400
the Lord of the World's
munificent to most

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.120
of the king of the dear judgment.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.860
And it is that you worship and you
alone that we see for assistance,

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.320
guide us to the straightway,
the straight path,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.380
those of the path upon
whom have blessed,

00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.760
not those who have earned anger.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.060
Know those who have go astray.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.720
Amen." And then he goes
into the words of --

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.790
and now in the words
of Jesus, the Messiah.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.450
And this is quote again
from Omar's manuscript.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:16.780
"Our Father who art in Heaven, holy
be your name, your kingdom come,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.980
you will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.060
Give us our daily bread, forgive
us as we have forgotten those

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.240
who have done harm, done us harm.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:30.790
Do not enter us into
temptation but redeem from evils.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.820
To you belong the kingdom, the
power, the majesty forever.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:41.930
Amen." So, again, at the
time of Omar's death,

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:48.300
he had fully rededicated
himself to Islam and as a Muslim.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.430
It is undoubtedly the countless
numerous other followers

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.980
of Islam shared a religious
experience similar to Omar

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.560
in Islamic communities
throughout the Americas.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.030
It was tolerated to
a much lesser degree

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:08.810 position:56%
than some other non-Islamic religion
such as Voodon and certain parts

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.110
in particular, Santeria,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.700
and Candomble in certain
parts of the Americas.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.230
In some rare instances it
was absorbed into practices

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:21.110
such as Voodon and Candomble.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:25.580
In Northwest Haiti there presently
exists, according to a friend

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:31.020 position:56%
of mine who's a professor there, a
Voodon ceremony performed in Arabic.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.400
And there are also
Voodon Santeristas

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.500
or ceremonies in Cuba
and Puerto Rico.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.200
Also performed in Arabic.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.040
Such is an example found
in Salvador, Brazil.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.180
The architect, Manual
Ferandez [assumed spelling],

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.450
and African Muslim of [inaudible]
descent build a church what looks

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.100
very Christian on the
outside and an interior

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.410
which transforms into a mosque.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.840
The interior walls were molded
with prayers from the Koran

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.090
and also the great [foreign
word] and Muslim [foreign word]

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:03.250
from Haiti wrote and spoke Arabic
along with many other languages.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.630
He organized the slave
insurrections of the 1740s.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.190
And through his fluency in
many languages were able

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:14.620
to mobilize the enslaved Africans
to fight the oppression of slavery.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.620
Many other Muslims sought to
return to their native homelands.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.470 position:56%
For example, Jonas Mohammad Bathe, a
Mandingo Muslim leader in Trinidad,

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.050
asked the Queen of England to
provide him and his community

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.800
with a ship so that
they could return.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.750
His request was denied.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.330
And there are other Muslims
who were able to return.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:38.490
Prince Abdul-Rahman of Mississippi,
Joe bin Solomon here in Maryland,

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:43.390
Mohammad [foreign word] who took
their jihadists upon landing

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.950
on the African Continent
despite the fact

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.510
that they had converted
to Christianity.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.980
It was their so-called conversion

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.780
that provided a means
to return to home.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.480
Al-Islam had faced many
challenges in the Americas,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.390 position:56%
but it has endured those challenges.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:07.970
We may learn from the history of
these early Muslims who help us

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:13.120
to understand the illustrious
nature of our multicultural,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.030
multi-religious American heritage.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:20.930 position:56%
And I would like to end this with
the words of Reverend Howard Thurman

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.280
from his book, <i>Deep River </i>.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.260
And this is quote from
Reverend Thurman.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.490 position:56%
"At the moment" -- in fact, this was
written in 1945 right during the --

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.550
end of the climax of World War II.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:41.880 position:56%
And he writes, "At the moment we
stand as the graphic masters of much

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.530
of the Earth, particularly America,

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:49.000
by virtue of our vast
resourcefulness

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.090
and material resources.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:55.750
The techniques by which we have
reduced great conglomerates

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:01.360
of nature to simple units
of control and utility.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:07.780
It is a terrifying truth that
life in its own restraint

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:13.250
and that the moral laws that
bind in judgment the life

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.510
of the individual by insinuation.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:22.060
No amount of power, wealth, or
prestige can stay this judgment.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:29.820
If we would be love, we must share
that kind of spirit of expression

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.800
of the true genius of our
democratic government."

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.100
Thank you and God bless.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Thank you Derrick

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.470
for that informative
discussion on Omar ibn Said.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.770
And later we'll have opportunities

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.620
to actually see the
manuscript over in the case.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.890
Our next speaker will
be Dr. John Hunwick,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:02.040 position:56%
Professor of African History and
Religion at Northwestern University.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:08.680
He holds a PhD in Islamic Studies
from the School of Oriental

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.270
and African Studies at
the University of London,

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:18.100
and is a world-renowned expert on
Arabic manuscripts from Africa.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:24.380 position:56%
He began his work in the 1960s at
the University of Ibadan in Nigeria,

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.650
and later helped with the
establishment of the Center

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:30.000
for Documentation in Timbuktu.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.700
He was a Director of the Fontes
Historiae Africanae project

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.890 position:56%
of the International Academic Union.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:45.190
He has published extensively in
the field including West Africa

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.490
and the Arab World, Arabic
Literature of Africa,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.520
and the writings of
Central Sudan, Africa,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.390
and edited a two-volume
catalog of Arabic manuscripts

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.210
of the Nigerian National Archives

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:08.050
for the Furqan Islamic
Heritage Foundation.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.350
Dr. Hunwick.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.710
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick: In Islam
there is no parallel as we

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.690
onto the Prophet Muhammad.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.270
He is rather the messenger of God.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.810
For the message he brought to
mankind, the Koran, may be regarded

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.030
as the word of God made book.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.560
The Koran, which is often referred

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.320
to in Arabic religious
writings simply

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.940
as The Book [foreign words]
is considered by Muslims

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.620 position:56%
to be literally the word of God and,
hence, portions of its text are used

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.510
as a protection against evil
and as a cure for sickness.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.990
This is generally in
the form of talismans,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.680
verses of the Koran written out
in the original Arabic, folded up,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.300
encased, and attached to the
body while hung up in a home.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.640
In some societies,
especially in Africa,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.850
the word of God made book
may be treated rather

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.330 position:56%
like communion wine in Christianity.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.060 position:56%
Appropriate healing verses of the
Koran are written on a special board

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.940
and washed off and then drunk
by the afflicted person.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.100 position:56%
Just as communion wine is
considered the blood of Jesus Christ

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:10.810
so the swallowing of Koranic words
in water is effectively an imbibing

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.400
of divine blessing and power.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.410
The Koran then is terrestrial
manifestation of the divine.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.930
As such, it may not be touched

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.510
by a Muslim unless he has
undertaken ritual washing

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.290
to cleanse himself
physically and spiritually.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.800
Also as the word of God, it must be
recited and written in the language

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.810
in which it was downloaded from
God to the Prophet Muhammad.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.830
That is, Arabic.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:39.730
Not only is the Koran then the core
of and key to all things Islamic,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.750
but acquaintance with the Arabic
language is an essential task

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.340
for believers.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.980
Literacy and then learning
have forever been hallmarks

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.180
of Muslim societies.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.640
When Islam was introduced to West
Africa through the activities

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.020 position:56%
of North African merchants it
brought with it a system of literacy

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.830
and the basis for a
system of education.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.470 position:56%
Arabic played a role similar to that
played by Latin in Medieval Europe.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:08.100
And just as the Roman script
was used in Europe for people

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.640
to write their own languages,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.790
so in West Africa the Arabic
script was eventually used

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.320
for writing some African
languages spoken by Muslims,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.760
most notably Fulfulde, the
language of the Fulani people,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.810
while widely disseminated
over West Africa from Senegal

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.120
and Guinea to the Cameroon.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.890
Hence, through Islam, much of West
Africa became literate and members

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:33.010
of such societies became
educated and even [inaudible].

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.390
Koranic learning with ability to
read the Arabic script was begun

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.070
by children from about the
age of six to eight years old.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.460
And the idea of receiving
education was so compelling

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.300
that Koranic classes even
attracted some non-Muslims

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.520
to send their children to them.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.060
The later 18th century
Scottish traveler, Mungo Park,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.250
observed this while
staying in a village

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.900 position:56%
if what is now the Republic of Mali.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.970
He said, "I've observed the peoples
at Kamalia where most of them --

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:05.030
I have observed that the
peoples at Kamalia where most

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.140
of them, the children are pagans.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.670
Their parents, therefore,
have no predilection

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.830
for the doctrines of Mohammad.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.580
Their aim was their
children's improvement."

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.520
He noted, too, that young
people graduated, quote/unquote,

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.570
from their schools in a
manner he seemed familiar

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.940
with from his European experience.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.620
And he put it this way.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.390
"When any of them has
read through the Koran

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.280
and performed a certain number of
public prayers, a feast is prepared

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.350 position:56%
by the schoolmaster and the
scholar undergoes an examination or,

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.190
in European terms,
takes out his degree.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.310 position:56%
I attended three different
inaugurations of this sort and heard

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.260
with pleasure the distinct
and intelligent answers

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.060 position:56%
which the scholars frequently have
to the bushreims [assumed spelling],

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.500
that is, the men of religion,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.780
who assembled on these
occasions and acted as examiners.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.760
Education clearly thus brought
people into the Islamic faith just

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.470
as in the colonial area
it brought some of them

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:00.950
into the Christian faith.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:06.270
And it helped them more -- to have
more extensive literacy in Arabic.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.340
As Mungo Park further noted,

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.470
where the Mohammedan faith is also
introduced the Arabic language

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.800
with which most of the
Fula's, that is the Fulani,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.440
have a slight acquaintance.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.390
Another European traveler,
some two decades later,

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.960
the Frenchman [foreign words]
observed Muslim education

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.150
in Senegal, the Kingdom of
Kyor [assumed spelling],

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:29.780
and how a man came to be
considered part of the class

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.630 position:56%
of religious instructors or [foreign
word] as they are called in French.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.670
He said, "Two conditions
are indispensably necessary

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.540
to procure admission into the
class of [foreign word] --

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.230
an irreproachable character
and an acquaintance

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.080
with the Arabic language.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.480
The candidate also knows several
chapters of the Koran by heart.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.050
And to combine with these
requirements a knowledge

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.650
of certain Arabic books
which treat of the history

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.390
of the world and of arithmetic."

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.930
Mohammedan priests are always
called upon to divide inheritances

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.960
which is one of the reasons why
they need arithmetic, of course.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.230
African [inaudible] scholars
therefore had to be able

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.590
to use the Arabic language
and have wider knowledge

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.330 position:56%
than just memorizing the Koran even
though this was the foundation stone

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.310
of the Muslim educational system.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.750
Of all the sentence of
advances dynamic education

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.240
in West Africa before
the 20th century,

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.300
Timbuktu was undoubtedly
the most celebrated.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.990
And its scholarly tradition was
widely disseminated throughout

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.920
the area.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.490
Timbuktu is situated at the
point where the Sahara intersects

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.730
with the great Niger Waterway,
grew from being a nomad's camp

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.000
around 1100 to being a major
center of both commerce

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.640
and learning in the 16th century.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.100
Scholars migrated there from North
Africa and from Saharan oases,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.910
and their presence
attracted students

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.080
from a wide range of
regional locations.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:56.870 position:56%
One of its most famous scholars was
Ahmad Baba, born in 1864, died in --

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.970
sorry, born in 1564, died in 1627.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.020
A member of a family that provided
the city with Islamic judges,

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.690
[foreign word], for
a century-and-a-half.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:11.500
He was a prolific writer, composing
some 70 works, mainly dealing

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.180
with aspects of Islamic law,
but also including treatises

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.380
on Arabic grammar and a large
biographical dictionary.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.100
His teachers were at first
from among his relatives.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.560
But his primary professor,
his sheik,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.870
was a man called Mohammad [foreign
word], a [inaudible] scholar

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:33.000
from [foreign word] some
500 miles south of Timbuktu.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.830
With him he studied
Islamic law very deeply.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.020 position:56%
But also many other fields including
[foreign word], the sayings

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:44.590 position:56%
and actions of the Prophet, exegeses
of the Koran, logic and astronomy.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.890
Both Mohammad [foreign word]

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:49.520 position:56%
and his student Ahmad Baba assembled
great libraries of their own.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.000
Mohammad [foreign word] had a
great reputation for lending books

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.390
to students while Ahmad
Baba reported

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.530
that his library contained
1600 items.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:03.700
But he stated that it was the
smallest of those in his family.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.640
Timbuktu in the 16th century
had such a number of teachers

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.400
and students at the higher
level of Islamic learning

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.020
that some writers have referred

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.940
to it quote/unquote
University of Timbuktu.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.420
Although the Islamic tradition of
learning is individualized rather

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.170 position:56%
than institutionalized, the advanced
nature of much of the instruction

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:26.090
in Timbuktu and the fact that it
produced qualified teachers does

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.140
to some extent justify use
of the term University.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.260
This type of learning
was also to be found

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.610
in other West African Muslim towns

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.480
but Timbuktu was the
Harvard of West Africa.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.590
And its tradition of scholarship
still exists as do some

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.690
of its scholarly libraries.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.500
The same is true in many
other West African locations,

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.930
from Senegal towns such as Dakar,
Louga, Saint Louis, Kaolack,

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:57.660
to Nigeria towns such as Sokoto,
Katsina, Kano, Zaria, Ilorin.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.700 position:56%
The breadth and depth of Islamic
learning in this region is reflected

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.240 position:56%
in the literacy and learning of some

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.170
of those otherwise quote/unquote
ordinary persons who were captured

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.860
in conflicts, enslaved,
and eventually exported

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.140
to the Americas, South and North.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.780
Noteworthy among these
was the member

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.840
of a Guinean Fulani ruling
family, generally known

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.150
under the anglicized form
of his name, Job ben Solomon

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.990
who was shipped out of the
River Gambia to Annapolis

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:25.740
in Maryland in the year 1730.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.900
As one of his recent
biographers put it,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.790
"When Job appeared before surprised
and sympathetic Europeans prior

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.490
to the rise of both anti-slavery
and anti-black theories,

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.980
his impressive manner and
mind and his strong African

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.170
and Muslim identity attracted
the serious attention of a number

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.820
of colonial Marylanders in
the old country Englishman."

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.980
One of these sympathizers,
Thomas Bluett,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.420
persuaded Job to relate the story
of his life, and this was published

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.310 position:56%
in London in 1733, and was to
become, in the view of Allan Austin,

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.060
a model, in part at
least, for later African

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:03.380
and African American memoirs
or freedom narratives.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.090
A devout Muslim who could not deal
with the limitations placed on him

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:11.090
by slavery, Job wrote a letter
to his father in Arabic,

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.970
and this letter eventually
came into the hands

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.580
of the philanthropist James
Oglethorpe who was so impressed

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.210
by this display of literacy
and Job's firm religious faith

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.810
that he arranged a
bond to release him.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.510
In 1733 a group of Annapolis
gentlemen, also evidently impressed

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:31.770 position:56%
on similar grounds, arranged for Job
to travel to London and from there,

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.780
after being feted in learned
and political circles,

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.060
he was allowed to return to Africa.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.360
Religious devotion and Arabic
literacy undoubtedly played an

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.260
important role in gaining respect

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.540
and ultimately freedom
for this Muslim slave.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.590
Another Muslim slave, and Derrick
Beard has just been talking

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.140
about Omar ibn Said,
was literate in enough

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:55.610
to write his own autobiography in
1831 whilst in slavery in America.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.730
He originated in Futa
Tooro in Senegal

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.920
and spent some 25 years studying
in various parts of the region.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.430
In slavery he had the good
fortune to end up in the hands

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.530
of a sympathetic master, John
Owen, and his brother James Owen,

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.980
a one-time Governor
of North Carolina,

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.140
who together spared him hard labor
and did their best to convert him

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.300
to Christianity -- though
whether they succeeded

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.130
or not has been contested --

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.650
giving him an Arabic
translation of the Bible.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.060
Omar gained respect not only
from his masters but more broadly

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.300
from members of the communities
of Fayetteville and Wilmington

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.530
in North Carolina on
account of his manifest piety

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.920
and his ability to write Arabic.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.330
In addition to his autobiography
he wrote many smaller items include

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.130
copies of prayers, even including
"The Lord's Prayer" and a document

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:45.550
in 1890 in which he returned
a prayer for his return

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:49.150
to Africa is enshrouded in
numerous quotations from the Koran

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.360
and from other Arabic writings,
including the opening lines

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.120
of a 12th-century versed work on
Arabic grammar, the [foreign words]

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:02.610
which he must have memorized
during his studies in Senegal.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.280
Such slaves, therefore, were
the first representatives

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.040
of the Islamic faith to
live in the United States,

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.630
and in some cases the faith was
retained by their descendants.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.100
However, slaves were not the only
African path for the dissemination

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.410
of Islam in the United States.

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.340
Early in the 20th century
a Sudanese preacher

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.830
and teacher called Satti Majid came
to America after a brief period

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:30.520
in Britain where he had been
acting as a Muslim missionary.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.970
He was attracted to
come to America --

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.000
-- because he had heard that Islam
had been coming under attack.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.530 position:56%
So he resolved to go and defend the
faith, and ultimately to promote it.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.240
Satti Majid spent some years in
New York where he devoted himself

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.700
to supporting Muslim
seamen, Arabs and Indians,

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.540
who had become stranded
there and weren't able

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.450
to get jobs to return them home.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.200
He appealed to both the
British Consul in Washington

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.500
and John D. Rockefeller for help.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.370
And to administer such
a project he set

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.330
up the Islamic Benevolent Society.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.750
And other times he also established
other Islamic organizations.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.570
These included the
Muslim Unity Society,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.110
the Islamic Missionary Society,
and the Red Crescent Society.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.750
He became known as the Shaykh
Islam of America and remained

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:27.390 position:56%
in the United States until 1929,
when he left for Egypt and then home

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:31.670
to the Sudan where he died in 1963.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.540
Regrettably we do not
yet know much detail

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.940
about his activities
in the United States.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.650
But the little we do know indicates

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.400
that he was an active
promotor of the faith.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.800
In an interview with a Cairo
newspaper in 1935 he said

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.480
that he had converted a number
of persons living in America

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:54.570
to Islam -- Afghans, Indians,
Africans, and Americans.

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.310
The latter term presumably
meaning Euro-Americans.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.670
The role of Africans in
the implantation of Islam

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.350
in America then is significant.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:06.070
There's undoubtedly much still
to be learned about the role

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.640
of [inaudible] African
slaves in this process

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.580
for as Michael Gomez has suggested,

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.320
there may have been
some hidden linkage

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.990
between the Islamic practices
of such early African residents

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:20.250
in America and the later
expressions of the faith promoted

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:25.650
by such African Americans as Noble
Drew Ali and Elijah Muhammed.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.270
Thank you.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.260
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: She specializes

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:35.100
in contemporary Islamic
issues including Islam

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.170
in America and Women in Islam.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:43.190
An author and edited more than a
dozen books, among them <i>The Muslims</i>

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:47.380
<i>in America </i>and <i>Gender
and Social Change </i>.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:52.880
With John Esposito, Haddad
co-edited the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia</i>

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.880
<i>of Modern Islamic World </i>in 1995.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:04.800 position:56%
She has taught, lectured in numerous
universities in the Middle East,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.320
Asia, and Africa, and sits on
the Advisory Board of the Council

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.570
of Foreign Relations, the
American Council for the Study

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.670
of Islamic Societies,
as well as many others.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.970
Haddad.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.700
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: Thank you.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.570
I am speaking out of sequence

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:30.570
and I think Professor Diouf
should have been on this panel.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:35.100
I'm going to talk about
the immigrants mostly.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:42.340
And I'm going to talk about
the situation prior --

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:52.160
you know, how we got here post 911,
who are they, what are they up to,

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.810
and what has America done to them?

00:45:55.810 --> 00:46:02.170 position:56%
And the question, the last question
is sort of something that came to me

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.540
after -- I mean I recollected
this question

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.380
because I had once an
interview with a reporter

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.250
from <i>New York Times </i>and
he was asking me, you know,

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.150
"These people do not share our
values," which is something

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.060
that came up a lot after 911.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.270
And he said, "You know,
why don't they go back

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.980
to where they came from?"

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.670
And so I asked him, "What
values are you talking about?"

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.800
And he said, "Well, you know, they
don't believe in premarital sex

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.510 position:56%
and homosexual lifestyle and drugs."

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.610
And I said, "Well, okay.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.410
Let's send them all
back to the Middle East.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.400
What are you going to do with
all the Jews who agree with them?

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.670
Maybe we can send them
back to Israel.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.270
What are you going to do with all
the Christians who agree with this,

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.850
you know, who condemn
this kind of lifestyle?"

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.860
And his question is, what
are they doing to America?

00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.290
And I told him that my research
into Muslims in America started

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.000
by studying the work of Sayyid
Qutb who came to the United States

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.490
as an agnostic and went back as a
member of the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.080
and eventually wrote the text
<i>Milestones </i>which became sort

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.640
of the bible of Islamic
Revolutionary Movement.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.400
And I wanted to know what has
American done to this Muslim person

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.310
and to others who have
come to America.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.520
Let me start with 911.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.020
The immediate response
of the Muslim community

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.490
to 911 was one of apprehension.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:39.460
There was this fear that the
American people or the public,

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.190
American citizens, would take
this terrible opportunity,

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:50.420
the horrible act of what happened,
and attack Muslims to pay for it.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.200
And they were very gratified

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.980
that President Bush
took a very strong stand

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.920
in which he distinguished
between acts

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.640
of terrors, terrorists, and Islam.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.130 position:56%
They were gratified that he met with
Muslim leaders, they were gratified

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.150
that he went to the mosque.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.500
It was only the second time

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.010
that an American President
had gone to a mosque.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:14.820
The first one was President
Eisenhower when the mosque here

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.330
in Washington on Massachusetts
Avenue was inaugurated.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:24.120
It was a long time in-between in
which an American President felt

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.020
that it was okay to go
to a mosque because up

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:31.520
until then America had identified
itself, unconsciously maybe,

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.910
or consciously in some people's
mind, as a Judeo-Christian country.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:38.130
America is changing.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.980 position:56%
It's not only that Muslims are here.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:44.430
We have Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs,
and a variety of other religions

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:50.170
that are now part of the
American, you know, environment.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:54.320
And America has not
addressed this issue.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.020
Quite a few of our Senators and
Congressmen continue to talk

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.920
about America as Judeo-Christian
country as though there is no room

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.680
for other people to have an input.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:11.730
Now there were some incidents
against Muslims and Arabs and,

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:18.460 position:56%
you know, first incident was against
an Egyptian Copt who was Christian.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:24.610
And the majority of Arabs in
the United States are Christian.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.230
We expect, you know,
somewhere estimate

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:30.390
about 2 million Arab Christians
live in the United States

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.710
and about 1 million Muslims.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:37.840
But the Arabs and Muslims
seem to be interchangeable

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.150
in the mind of many Americans.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.320
The majority of Muslims in
the United States, you know,

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.950
some people think that
they are African Americans.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.700
Others think that they
are from South Asia.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:54.210
But it is definitely from, you
know, from a variety of surveys

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.880
that people have conducted, Muslims
in the United States are a minority

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.040
in Islam, just as they are
a minority in the world.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:07.070 position:56%
And a Muslim community in the united
States reflects the composition

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:12.650
of the Muslim community
in the world.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:20.700
Now, what happened is, right after
911 is that the American press went

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.280 position:56%
into a special mode of trying to
explain Islam to the American people

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.260
because suddenly the American
people woke up and discovered

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.000
that their next door
neighbor is a Muslim,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.780
and they were sort of scared.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:39.140
I remember one time about 10
years ago I got a phone call

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.200
from a reporter from the <i>Christian
Science Monitor </i>, and she said,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.530
"I want to write an article
about Muslims in America."

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:48.370
And I said, "Why do you want to
write on this topic and why now?"

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.690
And said that her next door
neighbors have just moved

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.600
in and they were Tunisians.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:57.720
And she was worried that while they
were playing with their, you know,

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.700
guns and bombs, that her
whole place would blow up.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.700 position:56%
And I said, "Well, you know, I think
you should go and talk to them."

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.390
And she said, "Can I do that?"

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.690
And I said, "Why not?

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.700 position:56%
Just knock on the door, tell them
you're writing an article on Muslims

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.710
in America, and interview them.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:18.590
And ask them about their
grenades and bombs."

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.040 position:56%
So she went and knocked on the door.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.340
And I forgot about her.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.710
A few days later she called
and said, "Dr. Haddad,

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.620
thank you very much for that
very important suggestion."

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.860
She knocked on the door,
they invited her to dinner.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.520
She had a great time.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.700
And then she said something that
still -- I can still hear it.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.870
She said, "You know, they're people
like us, they're people like us."

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:43.870
And I think that the first reaction

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:50.050
of the American press was what
I increasingly call Islam 101.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.900
And, basically, it was
this introduction to Islam,

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.380
the five pillars of Islam.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.810
This is what Muslims believe.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.740
They pray five times a day.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.050
There are five schools
of Islamic Law,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.490
and so everything is
five's and five's.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.090
And so all Islam can
be reduced to that.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:11.820
But it was an effort to explain
Islam to the American people.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.110
And there was a great deal of
support from a variety of areas

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.320
within the American population.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.610
There were the women in Michigan
who put on a headscarf and went

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.270
to school that day in
solidarity with Muslim women

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.670
that felt constrained, that
people had spat at them and tried

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.840
to pull their headscarf off.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.910
There were women from various areas
that offered to do the shopping

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.190
for Muslim women who
wearing a scarf,

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.090
or walk with them to
the grocery store.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.450
There were people from mosques --

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.620
from churches and synagogues
who offered to stand vigil

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:51.470
to protect Muslim institutions
in the United States.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:55.410
And there were Muslims who
were elated at what happened.

00:52:55.410 --> 00:53:00.710 position:56%
And I heard one Muslim say, "We
couldn't have spent $1 billion to do

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:05.680
as much dowah, which is
Islamic propagation in America.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.770 position:56%
In a sense there was a by-product of
101 in which America was introduced

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:17.110
to Islam, and all the Korans sold
out, and translations of the Koran,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.960
and books on Islam were being
bought all over the place.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:33.250
Now what happened after that is
about three months after 911.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:34.960
Something happened.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.700 position:56%
And, you know, so those of us who've
been monitoring this have an idea

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:40.000
of what happened.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.470
But basically let me say that the
press switched into Terrorism 101.

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:50.480
So that in asking -- rather
than asking who are the Muslims,

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.710
suddenly the question is
why are Muslims terrorists?

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:55.690
What is it in Islam
that is terrorists?

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:56.990
What is jihad?

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:58.870
Why do they hate us?

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:03.140
Now the question of why do
they hate us was there even

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.430
when the press was doing Islam 101.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.830
And what happened is that
you had a variety of people,

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.710
most of them from the think
tanks around the Washington.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:19.440 position:56%
I'm not wearing any armor to protect
me, but basically what they said,

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.840
one after the other, is they
hate us because of our values,

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.130
not our policies, but our values.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:30.830
And then they identified
the value as, you know,

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:35.480
because we have a democracy,
because we are --

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.620
you know, we have a very
progressive country,

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.700
we have human rights, et cetera.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.430
And what was interesting
was almost every one

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:46.370
of them was a policy-maker.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:50.080
And every one of them was
defending the policies

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:54.580
that he had instituted
that brought us to 911.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:59.720
And probably the best way that
it has been categorized --

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:04.440
I heard Vergam [assumed spelling]
yesterday say it out loud,

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.350
and it's the first
time I hear it on TV.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:10.380
But there are quite a few of
us have been whispering it.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.370
It's the policy, stupid.

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:19.340 position:56%
There was been several policies that
the United States had propagated

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.370
in the last 10 years or so,

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:27.640
since the Madrid Agreement,
which led us to 911.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.220
And there are people in the policy
industry, whether think tanks

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:36.050 position:56%
or former administration people, and
I apologize to anybody who's here

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:42.010
in the audience who was involved
in these, who gave us some policies

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.240
to let -- that led to that event.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:50.930
But the question is, is there
a difference between the ones

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.370
that perpetrated that act
and the Arab Muslims who live

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:59.300
in the United States, because most
of them, as far as we can tell,

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.700
most of the people
who have been accused

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:08.920 position:56%
of perpetrating the act were here
illegally, they were not immigrants.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.100 position:56%
Now, who are the Muslims of America,

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.940
people who have put roots
in the United States?

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:21.890
Today we have our -- probably sixth
generation of American-born Muslims

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:24.220
in the United States,
immigrants who came

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.950 position:56%
from Lebanon and Syria in the 1870s.

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:32.770
Some of them will tell you
that the first language spoken

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:36.210
in the United States when
it was discovered was Arabic

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:41.160
because Luis de Torres,
who was on the ship

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:46.500
that brought Columbus was the first
one to address the American Indians

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.760 position:56%
who came to meet the ship in Arabic.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.560
Columbus was looking
for Prester John.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:56.720
He was looking for the
other people who are going

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.560
to have a pincer operation
to contain Islam

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.470 position:56%
and he brought Luis Torres with him.

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.850
Now, I've seen some
Jewish sources that say

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.440
that he was a Jewish person.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.830 position:56%
But the point is he spoke both
Hebrew and Arabic, and we know that.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:13.470
And so some people speculate that
his Arabic name is [foreign words].

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:15.300
That's not the point.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:21.180
The point is that we know that
immigrants started coming in 1870s.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.860
Their children have
fought in American wars.

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:31.520
We have -- I have collected a whole
set of pictures from Detroit area

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.010
where you have people who
fought in the First World War.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.250
You have some communities
that were totally decimated.

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:39.930
Cedar Rapid, Iowa sent
its young people.

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.230
They never came back.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.870
And, you know, 1911 you
have in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.230
one of the first mosques built.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:49.360
There were over a hundred
Lebanese Muslims there

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:58.060
and 1978 the mosque was demolished
and there were no Muslims left.

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.230
But most of them went
to the First World War.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:03.250
Some of them died and
the rest probably settled

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:06.850
in Dearborn or in Ohio.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:11.160
And what you have is a people who
fought in the Second World War.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.400
Yeah. In the first days
during the Second World War

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.290
in the Air Force was Mr. Igram
who started the Federation

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.780
of Islamic Associations
of North America.

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:27.790
He came out of South Dakota.

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:31.580
You have -- then you have people
who fought in the Viet Nam War

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:36.840
and they have been American, they
have been -- as Americans you can.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.900
They have fought for American wars.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:45.390
Now that is the immigration
that was stopped in 1924

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:51.610 position:56%
when America changed its immigration
laws to keep a lot of people out.

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.890
But then we have a different
kind of immigration that starts

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:57.730
after the Second World War,
and that is the beginning

00:58:57.730 --> 00:58:59.450
of the coming of the brain drain.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:01.810
There were Arab students
that were recruited from all

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:06.240
over the Arab world and brought
to the United States to be trained

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.540
to be sent back with the hope

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:10.150
that they are going to
become pro-American.

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:15.750
Anti-Communist was part of our
strategy during the Cold War.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:20.060
By 1965, when the Asia
Repeal Act was instituted,

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:26.570
basically the immigration was
open to people of Asian background

00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:30.320
and we have a continuation of
the brain drain with the coming

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.070 position:56%
of Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis
who were doctors and engineers

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:36.560
and a part of the brain drain.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.430
If you go to San Jose there
is one mosque which has

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:45.330
over 325 computer engineers
with MAs and PhDs.

00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:47.470 position:56%
So there have been -- and, you know,

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:54.210
the Pakistani Medical Association
has over 2000 medical doctors.

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:57.640
The Arab Medical Association
has thousands of doctors.

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.480
So they have been part
of the people ministering

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.040
to the needs of the United States.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.500
What happened is, and after that
we have a new sort of immigration

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.890 position:56%
because there were laws that were --

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:13.270
you know, our immigration laws
were changed so that Muslims

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.710
from South Asia couldn't
come to the United States

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.120
in the numbers they did after '65.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.670
And that was by an act of Congress
in which they restricted the coming

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:25.480
of people with a British passport.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.780
Up 'til then we were welcoming
people with a British passport

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.250
and then because Pakistanis
and Indians who had lived

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.200
in the United Kingdom were coming

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.950
on this immigration
loophole if you want.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:48.350
So it was stopped and instead we
shifted to importing Irish people.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:53.800
What happened after that
is we have then most

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.100
of the newer people have been
coming either as chain migration,

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.600
coming to live with their
relatives, or as refugees.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.740
And there is a great deal of
difference between the immigrants

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.290
who came as part of the
brain drain and the refugees.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:12.650
And the refugees have come from
Somalia, from Iraq, from Palestine,

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:16.490
from Afghanistan, from
Bosnia, and Lebanon.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.190
Some of the Lebanese refugees
who came from South Lebanon

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:23.780
after the Israeli invasion of
South Lebanon are illiterate

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.330
in both Arabic and
English when they came.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:31.270
So that you get PhDs on one side
and illiterate people, you know,

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:36.010 position:56%
from Afghanistan and Somalia also
that have come to the United States.

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.070
How have they fared
in the United States?

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:41.810
Well, the United States had
special stereotypes for them.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.860
I personally -- who
-- I'm not a Muslim.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.210
Yesterday somebody asked me that.

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:49.850
I should go teach Islam in Cairo
because he thought I was a Muslim.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:51.500
And I had to correct him.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:55.000
But, you know, it's part of this
misinformation that everybody

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.120
with an Arab name must be a Muslim.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.250
Anyway, when I first emigrated
to the United States in 1963,

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:07.280
the dominant stereotype of Muslims
and Arabs in the United States was

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.960
of the camel jockey, somebody
on the periphery of America.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.590
And I remember going on
a trip with wives from --

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:19.070 position:56%
faculty wives from Princeton because
my husband was teaching there.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.710
And one woman asked me, she
said, "You have a slight accent.

01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:23.010
Where are you from?"

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:25.590
And I said, "Jordan," because
my husband's Jordanian.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.390
I had a Jordanian passport.

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:28.760
And said, "Georgia?"

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.650
"No, Jordan."

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:35.390
"Oh, King Hussein, Lawrence of
Arabia riding into the sunset."

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:36.970
And then she turned
to me and she said,

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:41.050
"Whoever civilized you did
a very good job" [laughter].

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:47.590
And that is, that is the stereotype
that Muslims and Arabs have had

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:51.870
to live with in the '60s, one
in which they were uncivilized,

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:56.630
and if they could speak English,
somebody must have civilized them.

01:02:56.630 --> 01:03:02.910
By the '70s the stereotype
shifted and they became all part

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:07.920
of the oil sheik syndrome because
it comes after the 1973 oil boycott

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.960
and suddenly the Muslims
are a threat

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.020
to America's economic welfare.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:18.800
And you have these cartoons
in which every Muslim walks,

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.290
and then he has four
wives sort of, you know,

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:24.850
sort of traipsing behind
him a few steps behind.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:30.520
And probably the best description
of that would be the cartoon

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.390 position:56%
of "Dennis the Menace" in which he
runs home and he says to his mother,

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:38.280
"You know, the Arabs have
stolen the Thanksgiving dinner

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.590
of our neighbors."

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:41.620
And what happened is they
were eating hamburger

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.060
because they couldn't
afford the turkey.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.120
Why? Because of the price of oil.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.150
So Arabs became a threat to
America's economic welfare.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:56.640
By the 1980s it shifted and they
became the terrorists over there.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:01.680
And the press had a great
deal of terrorism movies.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:07.290
I won't go over them but anybody
who's interested in how Arabs

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.030
and Muslims have been
depicted in American movies,

01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:14.620
there is a recent book published
by Dr. Shaheen in which he goes

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:22.770
over 990 movies from the time of
the silent movies in which Arabs

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:24.780
and Muslims have been depicted.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:31.290
And in over 990 movies
he finds only three,

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:35.230
only three in which they're
depicted as, you know,

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:38.770
sort of regular guys,
regular human beings.

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.860
In all the rest they are, you
know, what he calls the bombers,

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.540
the rag-heads, and
the belly dancers.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.880
But basically they are all --

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.460
and the name of the book
is <i>Reel Bad Arabs </i>and the

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.230
"Reel" is R-E-E-L.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:57.530
And I recommend you look at
it because it tells you how

01:04:57.530 --> 01:05:03.030
over a century Muslims and Arabs
have been stereotypes and depicted

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:08.200
in these sort of parts of the
unconscious of the American people.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:14.430
By the 1990s the stereotype
shifted again,

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:20.040
and they became not only terrorists
who are a threat to some people

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:27.960
over there, but also part of an
evil that has to be wiped out.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.700
And there's a difference between
a terrorist that you can bring

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:38.520 position:56%
to justice and try and execute, and
to somebody's who identified as evil

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.180
that has to be eradicated.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.170
And it becomes your
duty, your divine duty.

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:48.160
I mean, all religions have
asked people to get rid of evil,

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:54.700
so that increasingly in the
press this terrorism 101

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.500 position:56%
that has taken place -- increasingly
you will find that people, you know,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:05.530
that Chris Matthews on MSNBC or
O'Reilly on FOX or Linda Gradstein

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:12.750
on NPR, basically there
are questions, there can --

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:15.500
contextualization, their attacks,

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.510
are definitely what
is wrong with Islam.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.090
Why are they terrorists?

01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:22.560
And so and so forth.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.590
Now -- two minutes, okay.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.930
I'll try and finish before then.

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:32.490
How have the Muslims
adjusted to America?

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:36.430
When they came, America
was, you know, it was --

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:41.240
the dominant theme of
America was this is a country

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.490
that demanded Anglo conformity.

01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:46.030
And they did.

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.340
If you look at the records, they
called their imams "our minister,"

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.560
or the Koran "our Bible,"
mosque, "our church."

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.590
Part of it is because the American
public had no idea what they were

01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:00.060
talking about if they
used the Arabic words.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.160
And part of it is because
they wanted to meld.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.860
That was part of the melting pot.

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.040
And you will see that -- if
you look at the architecture

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.490
of the first mosques they built,

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:13.030
they looked like congregational
churches.

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.850
They tried to fit within
the environment.

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:21.160
It's not until the '70s and
'80s that you begin to have,

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.400
except for the mosque in
Washington, D.C., which was built

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:31.000
by the Embassies, you begin
to have purposeful mosques,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.480
mosques that looked -- you know,
or cathedral mosques or mosques

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.620
that looked Islamic and you begin
to have people saying, "Well,

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.190
I want to put a dome
on top of the mosque,"

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.250
or put a minaret on
top of the mosque.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:48.210
But basically identify
it publicly as Islamic.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:51.100
And there were several things
that brought this about.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.970
Part of it was there was some
funding from foreign sources

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:58.340
to support the building of
mosques in the United States.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:05.070
That came to an absolute
and total end by 1990.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:10.010
And then there was this feeling of
confidence of belonging to America

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:14.080
and trying to find a niche
where Muslims can fit

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:20.630
within the American mosaic and
create the space for themselves.

01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:24.200
Nineteen-ninety, during the Gulf
War, there was pressure from Saudi,

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:30.130
Arabia for Muslims to condemn --
not only to condemn Saddam Hussein,

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:33.370
that is for Muslims in the
United States, they all did,

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:35.850
but also to support
American intervention.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:39.290
And they brought a sheet of
paper and asked them to sign,

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:42.710
and they were against it, so Saudi,
Arabia, forthwith [inaudible].

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:46.880
And for a few years the Muslim
community in North America stumbled

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.510
and didn't know what to do.

01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:51.950
A headquarters in Indiana, you
know, they had to shut it down.

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:55.480
Basically, they couldn't afford
somebody to answer the phone even.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.420
And then they said, we
don't need them anymore.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:04.390
And basically they went
into their own pockets

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:08.580
and started rebuilding --
building, constructing mosques.

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.680
So then I have a list here
of the mosques that --

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.120
and development of mosques.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.900
One I [inaudible] in 986.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.470
These are mosques and centers.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:23.140
There were 598 mosques in 1986

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:29.380
and about five months ago I got
the information from Dr. Nimmer

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.450
who is writing a book on Muslim
institutions in North America

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:39.190
and his calculation is at
present there are 1372.

01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:43.870
So you have a major growth
in the number of mosques

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:46.410
and centers in the United States.

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:50.390
And a lot of this has come from
the fact that Muslims began

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:53.180
to feel comfortable
in the United States,

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.850
most comfortable during the
last election where they came

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:59.070
out from the mosques
and decided they wanted

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.140
to participate in the
election process.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:08.270
They endorsed George Bush and
about half of them voted for him.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.840
Many people believe that
the vote of the Muslims

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.210
in Florida was what delivered
the election to George Bush

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:21.960
because there was a greater deal of
support for George Bush in Florida

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.410
from the Muslim community.

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:30.410
Today the Muslims are still
eager to belong in America.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:36.590 position:56%
The question is whether America is
going to be able to accommodate them

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:42.230
on equal terms, because at the
moment there is still a feeling

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.380
that when President Bush
said "You're either with us

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.400
or with the terrorists,"

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.140
he definitely left no
wiggle-room for anybody.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.950
And there is this feeling that
the press believes that, too.

01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:01.550
And that the -- there is this
special division between us

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:06.250
and them, good and evil, and it's
gliding over, so that if you look

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:09.140
across the Muslim world
today you will see

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:14.320
that the United States is losing
the propaganda war because of some

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:17.950
of the statements that our
policymakers are making.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:20.120
And I think I better stop.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.830
I see her eyes staring at me.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.240
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
Thank you, Dr. Haddad.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.700
At this point in time I'd

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.800
like to entertain some
questions from the audience.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.330
We'll have about 15
minutes to do that.

01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:40.170
And also an opportunity for you

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.920
to have a little coffee
break if you want.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.520
Where are the mics?

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.540
Okay. We have one.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.970
Where are the questions?

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.750
All right.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:56.970
So the gentleman over
to my left, over here.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.270
I have -- I have two -- well,
that wasn't a gentleman,

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:06.940
but we'll take you for right now.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.830
Then the gentleman up front.

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.130
&gt;&gt; Should I start here first?

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.430
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Yes, you may.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:13.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:16.760 position:56%
Well, I would like to thank all the
panelists for their representations.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.140
And I have a [inaudible] on Dr.
Yvonne Haddad's presentation.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.370
The Muslim block vote
that was done in the 2000,

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:26.240
it was not done by the mosques.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.260 position:56%
It was done by the National American
Muslim Political Organizations

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:34.980
which have a coordinating
council that did back,

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:39.870 position:56%
and according to that they did make
a choice between the two candidates.

01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:41.300
And because of the responsiveness

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.950
of then Governor Bush
they did endorse him.

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:48.090
So just to set the record straight.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:49.390
Thank you.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:50.690
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: I accept that.

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:51.990
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Okay.

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:53.290
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: No problem.

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.560
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: The
gentleman up front.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.860
Okay.

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.160
&gt;&gt; My question, too,
is to [inaudible].

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.130
It is on your last comment,
whether America will abate Muslims.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:11.130 position:56%
Now the one -- the way Muslims are
being treated after the 911 event --

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:16.300
and, really, I have lived in this
country for a quarter century.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.510
I did not see this America.

01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:21.830
Now Americans are very tolerant,
much more than France and some

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:26.280
of the European countries so
far as religion is concerned.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.810
But yet a neighbor started
talking to neighbors.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:33.440
People never stared at me
during the last quarter century.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.420
For the first time after 911
I saw people staring at me.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:42.790
My -- a Pakistani boy who is friend
of my daughter, he was [inaudible].

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.780
Now to what do you attribute that?

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.250
It is kind of -- is it
-- it is not religion.

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.700
People are very tolerant,
as you said.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.090
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad:
Well, I really don't --

01:13:54.090 --> 01:14:00.600
I mean, I think it's a combination
of racism and also what kind

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.870 position:56%
of religion is tolerated in America.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:07.340
Because I was at a meeting of
the World Council of Churches,

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.670
which was on Christian-Muslim
relations in Cairo, in December.

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:16.480
And there was one person who came
from Gatare and he was responsible

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.540
for schools for the Organization of
the Islamic Conference in Africa.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:26.540
And he told me that the American
Embassies were escalating what they

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:31.160
are teaching in their schools,
what they're teaching about Islam.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.680
And he was very distressed about
it, and he said, "You know,

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.010
they can ask the -- the can
interview the professors,

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:43.820
they can interview the principal,
they can interview the students,

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.670
they can look at the textbooks,

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:50.750
but they cannot tell me
how to interpret Islam."

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:54.500
And, basically, there is this
effort to say that this kind

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.440
of interpretation of
Islam is unacceptable.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:02.010
And the question is, who
decides what Islam is acceptable?

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:07.670 position:56%
And given the fact that there are no
-- there is no Pope in Islam, okay?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.510
Who is going to decide?

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:13.180 position:56%
I mean, for example, I've heard some
Muslims say that President Bush went

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:16.970
to the mosque and said, "Islam
is a religion of peace."

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:20.180
A lot of Muslim's believe
it's a religion of peace.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.230 position:56%
But it's also a religion of justice.

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:24.940
And unless you have
justice, you have no peace.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:28.280
And so if the issue
of justice is missing,

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.070
then [inaudible] interpreted
right at --

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:34.220
or sanctioned by the
President of the United States

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.020
in the way Muslims see it.

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.710
I know what I'm saying
is controversial.

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:39.010
Don't attack me.

01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:41.560
I'm just reporting to you what
I gather, the information.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.980 position:56%
Now what this one guy said to me is,

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:48.680
"Are they checking the
Jewish schools in Brooklyn?

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.460
Because Brooklyn produces the
settlers that go to the West Bank

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:54.620
and people who go who
hate Christians

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.490
and Muslims carry Uzi machine guns.

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:58.470
They call them the
Brooklyn Cowboys."

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.110
And the question is, what kind

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:02.690
of Judaism are they
teaching in Brooklyn?

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:05.080
He said, "Are they
also checking what kind

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.890
of Christianity is being taught
by the Fundamentalist Christians?"

01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:10.990
So he had some issues.

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:14.150
The other thing I want to
report to you that came

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:20.000 position:56%
out of a conference I attended in
January, just a couple of weeks ago,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.760
and it was sponsored by Tony Blair
and the Archbishop of Canterbury,

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.240
and it was Christian-Muslim
relations.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.320
And there was one guy who is a
PhD in Islamic Law, from Egypt,

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.990
and he was asking about
American racism in the treatment

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:43.070
of the prisoners, or the detainees.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:47.870
How come Walker is put into a
building where no one can see him

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.660
and how come the Muslims are
paraded like animals in cages?

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:56.370
And this is the way
they perceive it.

01:16:56.370 --> 01:17:02.240 position:56%
So that they perceive that there is
an innate racism in American policy.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:07.390
And they see that America has
sanctioned a certain type of Islam,

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:10.850
but not the type of
Islam that they want.

01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:12.830
I mean, I'll tell you one
more thing and I'll shut up.

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:15.110
Let other -- please
ask the other people.

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:16.850
I got some phone calls.

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.320
There was, you know, they kept
asking a certain type of questions

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.710
and the press runs in herds.

01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:24.940
And, you know, a new question comes

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.060
and then everybody's
asking the same question.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.360
And the question was, who
is the moderate Muslim?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.510
And <i>Newsweek </i>wanted
to put him on the,

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.850
on the front page of <i>Newsweek </i>.

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:38.570
And I wondered, you
know, the poor guy.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.270
The minute we identify
him, he's gone.

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:42.580
I mean, who is the moderate Muslim.

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.880
And I asked him?

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.180
I said, "What are you looking for?"

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.550
He said he wanted somebody
who separates religion

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:51.190 position:56%
from state, who privatizes religion.

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:53.910 position:56%
That would be the acceptable person.

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:58.970
Will the Muslims of the world
accept that definition of Islam?

01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:04.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Hunwick.

01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:07.650
For those of us who
are still in Islam 101,

01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:11.060
I first of all thank you
for your essay there.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.380
But I'd like to ask -- you
mentioned the incursion of Islam

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.740
into early Africa by the merchants.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:23.000 position:56%
Now some of us have heard that there
were also several violent conquests

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.130
where people were converted
by violence.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:31.750
You spoke to the impact of
the Arabs going into Africa

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:34.600
and how the literacy was improved.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.350
But were there other conditions

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.940
which historically might
have attributed to our,

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:45.210
some of our stereotypes and
beliefs as of this time?

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:50.340
Are those things true about
the conquest, the violence?

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:56.180 position:56%
I've heard Islam is a religion of
peace, but still somehow in the back

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.490
of my mind I have, from my
history, that there were conquests,

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:06.200
that the converts were gained
through these kinds of things.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.500
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick:
Well it's certainly true

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.710
that North African was
subject to conquests.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:14.300
I'm not even going to say
it was an Islamic conquest.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.330
It was an Arab conquest where
the Arabs happened to be Muslims.

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:20.530
And maybe that was what
also inspired them to do it.

01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:23.500
But Sub-Saharan in
Africa, black Africa,

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:26.450
was never attacked
in that kind of way.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.350
It's entirely -- came across
-- I said West Africa --

01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:32.910
by merchants who were doing
trade, particularly trade in gold,

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:35.300
from North Africa into West Africa.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.600
They were Muslims.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.900
And they came.

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:41.540
It was their influence that
brought Islam to the societies

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.970
in the West African regions.

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:57.880
&gt;&gt; What made you interested
in studying Islam?

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.080
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
Could you repeat that?

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.720
Can you repeat that?

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. John: What made you
interested into studying Islam?

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.710
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad:
Why did you study Islam?

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:08.010
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] interesting.

01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.510
&gt;&gt; What made you to study Islam?

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:15.060
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick: Well, very
early in my career I worked

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.890
in a Muslim society which really
caught my imagination and interest.

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:28.130
That was -- of course I'm British
by origin though I'm American now.

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:32.730
That was back in the 1950s when I
was serving in the British Army.

01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:35.530
That was in what is now Somalia.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.910
It was then British Somaliland.

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:42.580 position:56%
And so I decided when I came back
from there that I would study Islam.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.530
And the best way to do
that was to learn Arabic.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:47.970
That's why I went to the School
of African Studies in London

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:50.270
and did my first degree in Arabic.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.870
&gt;&gt; I have a question
directed to Mr. Beard.

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:04.300
I spent 20 years in the military.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:10.460
I was stationed in Panama, pre
and post so-called just cause.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:17.940
And I came across information
that the --

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.620
there were a tribe of Africans

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:27.610
who were present in
a area called Darian.

01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:36.780
And that they are mentioned in the
explorer or the exploiter Balboa.

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:42.350
That in his diaries that he saw
black people, or he saw black men,

01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:47.200
and they were [inaudible] any
background on these Africans

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:54.130 position:56%
who obviously made the Transatlantic
trade before the slave trade?

01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:55.460
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard: Ah, let's see.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.970
Somehow. It's interesting that
you mentioned Panama because along

01:22:00.970 --> 01:22:06.980 position:56%
with the manuscript of Omar ibn Said
which was collected by [inaudible]

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:13.960
like there was a collection of
three Arabic manuscripts written

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.080
by a Sheikh [foreign word].

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.390
Sheikh [foreign word] was a
Sheikh Muslim from Sierra Leone

01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:25.610
who was living and
working in Panama,

01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:28.410
working there with
the Panama Railroad.

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.850
And he wrote a series of
four manuscripts in Arabic

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:35.450
in the year of 1854 to about 1856.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:39.900
I have three, and I could
share with you the manuscript

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.930
and also the translation
of those manuscripts.

01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:49.300 position:56%
I'm familiar with Panama and Panama
at that time was a part of Colombia.

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:56.970
And in Colombia, particularly
Carta Haina which was a slave port

01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:00.830
for South America, or particularly
that region in South America,

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:02.760
you had a number of [inaudible]
that would come in and people

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.410
that were brought from
Senegal, Mali, Cambia,

01:23:07.410 --> 01:23:09.830
the Gulf of Guinea, Guinea.

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:14.330
And, again, many of these
people were Muslim --

01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:24.480 position:56%
Hausas, Fulanis, Mandingos,
Mendes, Fulas, et cetera, et cetera.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.230
And there are -- presently
there are retentions

01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:29.490
of Islam in South America.

01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:32.110
I know of one guy who
was actually Colombian.

01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:33.410
His name is [foreign words].

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:36.750
And he lives on the Pacific.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:41.880
That whole region, particularly
the Pacific Coast going

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:47.750
from [inaudible] all the way
along the Pacific of Colombia,

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:54.160
Ecuador all the way to Northern
Peru is about 90% African today.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.950
Okay. These people were Maroons.

01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:04.000
They fled from the plantations
of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama,

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.190
et cetera, and they fled to the
jungle along the Pacific Coast.

01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:09.090
And they stayed there,
isolated, up to the 20th century.

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:15.530 position:56%
And only recently they had roads and
people, Christians, missionaries,

01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:18.170
that came in there and began to
convert a lot of these people.

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:20.830
But they still have their African,
many of the African traditions.

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:24.300 position:56%
And you will find elements of Islam.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:26.840
As I mentioned, this
guy's [foreign word].

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.880
His - which we trace
that name to Mali.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.790
And his family was able
to retain their name

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:34.380
for almost four centuries.

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:37.500
And you have quite a few people
down there that have those name.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:41.410
And in Panama, the area
you're speaking about there,

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:48.090
I talked to Panamanian Muslims and
there apparently there is a mosque,

01:24:48.090 --> 01:24:51.210
they say, somewhere in the jungle.

01:24:51.210 --> 01:24:57.620 position:56%
But I have not gone there nor have
I seen any actual physical evidence.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.980
A friend of mine, Mustafa
Benema [assumed spelling],

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:02.120
he's a teacher at Brooklyn College.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.740
He was in Panama last year doing
research on Sheikh [foreign word].

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.880
But unfortunately, you know,

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.710
Panama doesn't have any vital
statistics prior to like 1900.

01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:16.350
So if you want records
you have to kind of go

01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:20.030
into the church, you know.

01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:22.350
And then there's just
this folklore legends

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:25.210
that you have to kind of explore.

01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:27.510
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: We
have two more questions.

01:25:28.810 --> 01:25:31.100
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] of America Radio.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.830
It's wrong also to think that the
other side does not have the same

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:37.240
debates we're having right now.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.590
Basically I'll go back
to Mrs. Yvonne Haddad.

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:43.140
The other side is also asking.

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:45.080
It includes also the
African countries.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.000
It's not only the Middle
East itself.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.200
What type of Islam do they want?

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.940
I'm just translating here
basically word-to-word.

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.520
How did daily editorials
have the daily tentatives

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.850
to explain what America wants?

01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:05.900
It seems to me they think Europe
has [inaudible] understanding,

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.870
probably for [inaudible] reasons.

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:12.120
But so far the other side, the
Muslims all over the world,

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.260
including these we just -- which is
just a tiny portion of the whole --

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.970
of all that [inaudible]
is still asking what type

01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:22.570
of Islam America wants
now, in the future.

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:25.750
And also they seem to
be surprised at the --

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:31.290
to what some describe as a naïve
question, why do they hate us?

01:26:31.290 --> 01:26:36.500
They answer, both, the
[inaudible] and institutionalized.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.800
We do not hate you.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.100
Who created that?

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.400
Who created the [inaudible]?

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.040
Therefore, knowing all what you
know, and I'm sure if you go

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.340
to the other side within --

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.430
your peers on the other
side of the world --

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:50.370
there wouldn't be too
much differences.

01:26:50.370 --> 01:26:53.020 position:56%
What is the solution to [inaudible]?

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.320
Is it in the school level?

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.500
Should we go back to the ABCs of
schooling on both sides to bring

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.370
up basically both worlds.

01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:06.430
Because the same questions are
being asked on the other side.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:09.180
And nobody seems to
have answers so far.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.960
Not the institutions, rest,

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.170
and politicians basically do not
have it according to what it seems.

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:17.310
Thank you.

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.610
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: Do
you want to answer him?

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:21.770
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: [Inaudible]
a question over here.

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:23.070
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick: No.

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:24.370
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y Haddad: No.

01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:26.970 position:56%
I don't think that there are answers
for this because what I read --

01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:29.760
you know, I read the
<i>Arab Press </i>too.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.450
They're asking, why
does America hate us?

01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:36.820
Yeah. And I think that
there is some kind of a gap.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:40.180
I think one of the things
that's worthy of looking

01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:43.830
at at the moment is the fact
that America is in the process

01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:45.760
of defining itself again.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.430
In the '60s it became fashionable
to have a hyphenated identity.

01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:52.990
So you became, you know,
I'm Irish-American,

01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:55.830
a Jewish-American, and whatever.

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:59.960
If you look at the ads that
are being put on television,

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.190
there is no room for hyphenation.

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:07.530
They all say, I am American,
regardless of who they are.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:10.200
And I think that we are going
through some kind of process

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.550
of brainwashing ourselves, that
we want to get away from any kind

01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:21.310
of identity with wherever people
left behind, and, in a sense,

01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:23.960
get rid of history
which is something

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.100
that the United States
has had before.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.970
I mean, the United States is
a country that is constituted

01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:31.580
of people from all over the world.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.440
They come with a lot of hatreds
for each other and with a lot

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:40.220
of histories of genocides and wars.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.180 position:56%
And one of the ways in which the
United States has constituted itself

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:49.250
and was able to sort of
create an American society is

01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:50.970
to say let's forget
about that history.

01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:53.820
And that's why they don't
teach a lot of history.

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:57.070
They teach social studies
and conflict management

01:28:57.070 --> 01:29:00.000
and the peaceful solutions,
and that kind of stuff.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.630
The question is that, you know,
in the rest of the world part

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:07.210
of their identity, part
of their national identity

01:29:07.210 --> 01:29:11.570 position:56%
as they were formed into nation
states is a particular understanding

01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:12.870
of history.

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:17.640
And generally it's anti-colonial
history because all countries

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:21.700
of the Muslim world have been ruled
by Britain or France or Germany

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.160
or somebody, except
for Saudi, Arabia,

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.780
and part of Iran and Afghanistan.

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.800
But all of them have known the
boot of a foreign occupier.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.960
And so part of their identity is
getting rid of foreign occupation.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.720
And what has happened is that a
lot of American policy right now --

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.620 position:56%
all you have to do is turn on the
TV and they get CBS and NBC and CNN,

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.780
and they hear the policymakers
saying it's all right

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.090
to be hypocritical, you know.

01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:52.390
Look at the British.

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:55.240
All empires of the world
have been hypocritical.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.950
The British were hypocritical,
the French were hypocritical.

01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:59.250
I'm sorry [laughter].

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:00.550
But that's what they're saying.

01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:01.970
I'm just quoting.

01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:05.500
And so -- I mean I take
refuge in being a historian

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.950
and not a political scientist.

01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:09.720
I can't tell you where
we're going to go.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.300
&gt;&gt; Do you believe African
countries within [inaudible] also?

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.600
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: Some of them.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.900
Some of them.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.200
It would --

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you think it's also in Africa?

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.800
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad:
It's everywhere.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.100
It's everywhere every day.

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.050
And it is within Islam itself.

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:24.020
What kind of an Islam do we want?

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:29.720
But part of it is there are nation
states reacting to colonialism.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:32.660
And the unfortunate thing is
that we've had people like --

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.330
you know, the President
of the United States

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:40.020
and Secretary Powell have said
they -- we in the civilized world.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:41.730
That means that they
are uncivilized.

01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:47.830
That is a no-no word because it
brings back the French colonial

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:49.140
civilizing mission.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:52.770
And what was part of the
civilizing mission in Algeria?

01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:54.310
Get rid of Islam.

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:57.410
The only way that an Algerian
could become a citizen is

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:59.430
if he renounces the Sharia.

01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:01.470
Are we asking the same thing?

01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:03.850
I think it is unconscious.

01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:07.690
But for them it is not unconscious
because they are grounded

01:31:07.690 --> 01:31:09.800
in this anti-colonial history.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.590
And we've been using terms that
come right out of a century ago,

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.350
whether it's, you know,
Huntington's you know --

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:17.680
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick: Civilization.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.160
&gt;&gt; Yvonne Y. Haddad: Yeah,
The Civilization Struggle.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.620
That was what the missionaries went

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:24.470
with at the beginning
of 19th century.

01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:27.990
It was this conflict between
Islam and the Christian world,

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:30.410
and they wanted to
Christianize everybody.

01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:33.710
And so we're resurrecting demons

01:31:33.710 --> 01:31:35.920
that people have thought
have been put to rest.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.680
And we are unconscious
because we have,

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.880 position:56%
as Americans, no concept of history.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.890
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick: But
this is where President Bush

01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:47.790
and Osama bin Laden have
a similar point of view.

01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:51.440
The world consists of two
kinds of people, us and them.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.820
And the clash of civilizations
is taking place.

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.990 position:56%
So that's a view they share I think.

01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:59.880
But let me just make
one other remark

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.970
as regards how the United States
is beginning to look at Islam.

01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:09.440
Nowadays the word Islam has
become part of our vocabulary

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.210
and you find it on the
news, on the television,

01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:13.510
in the newspapers, and so on.

01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:16.610
Nobody things they have
to kind of explain it.

01:32:16.610 --> 01:32:21.580
But even more than that words like
Ramadan and Hajj have also come

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:26.490
into our vocabulary, which shows
that little by little the notion

01:32:26.490 --> 01:32:31.670
of Islam as an American
religion is being accepted.

01:32:33.150 --> 01:32:34.450
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper:
The last question.

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:36.350
&gt;&gt; I won't keep you
from your coffee break,

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:39.160
so I'll just ask a brief
question from Derrick.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.950
Derrick, I'm grateful you
shared your information on Omar,

01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:44.390
a fascinating historical figure.

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:46.910
I've been a great admirer
of Omar the caliph,

01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:49.190
and my own son is called Omar.

01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:53.010
My question is, where can one get
information about Omar or Umar.

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:57.210
Is there some book or
accessible literature available?

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:59.470
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard:
Well we did a symposium

01:32:59.470 --> 01:33:04.850
about three years ago I guess,
1998, at Harvard University,

01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:07.930
which was sponsored by
the Longfellow Institute.

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:10.160
And, yeah, there we go.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.460
In fact --

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.760
&gt;&gt; Say it again.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.300
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard: -- people here
on the panel was a part of that.

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:17.530
That's Sylvaine's book, Diouf's
book, <i>Servants of Allah </i>.

01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:19.010
She's here, the author.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:24.660
She has quite a bit of information
about Omar and other slave Muslims.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.620
There is a new book out called
<i>The Multilingual Anthology</i>

01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:34.610
<i>of American Literature </i>which was
edited by two Harvard professors,

01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:38.590
Marc Shell and Professor Werner
Sollars, and that's available

01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:41.220
through New York University Press.

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:47.090
The Longfellow Institute is
doing a monogram on Omar itself.

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:50.430
And I'm not sure of the exact date

01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:51.790
when that's supposed
to be published.

01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:54.160
It's coming out through John
Hopkins University Press.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.210
But, again, that could
be, hopefully, this year.

01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:00.510
&gt;&gt; John O. Hunwick:
Yeah, I wish I knew,

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:01.810
because I have an article
[laughter].

01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:03.120
&gt;&gt; Derrick J. Beard:
That's right, uh-huh.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:08.430
But -- and if you want to get
a translation or Arabic copies,

01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:11.600
Eric's copy, you can contact
me and I can give you a copy.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.900
No problem.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.200
Thank you.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.500
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Thank you.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.800
With that, you have five minutes

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.550
to have some coffee before
we go to the second panel.

01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:27.080
Thanks. Let's give a hand to our
panelists for the first panel.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:28.380
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: Thank you.

01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.980
We're now in for a second treat.

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:36.720
Marieta Harper, whom you saw was
the Chair of the first panel,

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:41.080
had a significant role in
putting this whole thing together.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.610
And although she was quite
modest and didn't indicate that,

01:34:44.610 --> 01:34:46.970
I think you should all know that.

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.980
We are, again, going
to have an order

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.960
that is not really
strictly chronological.

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.440
I don't think that makes a
great deal of difference.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.500
But it is occasioned by
the fact that a number

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.320
of our eminent panelists
have to teach and, therefore,

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.130
have to squeeze these
presentations here in

01:35:10.130 --> 01:35:14.850
and around a very busy
schedule and other commitments.

01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:21.590
We begin with Akbar Ahmed who
holds the Ibn Khaldun Chair

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:24.630
of Islamic Studies, School
if International Service

01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:26.320
at the American University.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:29.720
I apologize for reading what
you have on your yellow sheets,

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.210
but the yellow sheets are not on
the camera, so I really do have

01:35:33.210 --> 01:35:39.670
to indicate something by way
of an introduction on camera.

01:35:39.670 --> 01:35:43.180
Professor Ahmed holds a PhD
for the University of London,

01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:48.240
has served as Pakistan's High
Commissioner in the United Kingdom.

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.720
He's the author of many books

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.830
on contemporary Islam
including <i>Discovering Islam,</i>

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:58.370
<i>Making Sense of Muslim
History and Society </i>which,

01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:00.100
as many of you probably know,

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:05.630
was the basis of a BBC
six-part TV series.

01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:11.810 position:56%
And his Jinnah Quarter consists of
a feature film about Jinnah who was,

01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:17.790
of course, the prime
creator of Pakistan,

01:36:17.790 --> 01:36:21.960
the documentary <i>Mr. Jinnah, the
Making of Pakistan </i>, his book,

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.750
<i>Jinnah, Pakistan, and Islamic
Identity </i>, and a graphic novel

01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:29.280
about which I'm ashamed
to say I don't know much.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.670
He is a recipient of a number
of awards including the Star

01:36:32.670 --> 01:36:39.180 position:56%
of Excellence from Pakistan, and the
Sir Percy Sykes Memorial Medal given

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:43.500
by the Royal Society for
Asian Affairs in London.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.800
So, Professor Ahmed.

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:51.200
[ Applause ]

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.500
&gt;&gt; Akbar S. Ahmed:
Thank you, Professor,

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.740
for that very warm introduction.

01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:01.840
A key question that will face
all of us in America and abroad,

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.640
all human societies, will be
how are we able to live together

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:13.500 position:56%
as a multi-cultural, multi-religious
entity, because the processes

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.370
of globalization are
creating so much turmoil

01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:20.270
through all sorts of processes.

01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:23.620
And this idea will
relate to what I'm going

01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:26.740 position:56%
to be sharing with you this morning.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.780
My title for those of
you who looked at this --

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:35.910
the proceedings for this morning
will note is "A New Andalucía?"

01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:41.610
You will also note I have put a
question mark after the title.

01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:44.110
For me, Andalucia symbolizes
something

01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:47.230
in our history and world history.

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:53.930
It symbolizes a time almost a
thousand years ago when Jews,

01:37:53.930 --> 01:38:00.070
Christians, and Muslims were able
to live together in great harmony.

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:04.730
This wasn't just an ideal
construct, a theory.

01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:06.280
But it created something.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:12.830
If you look at the literature,
the art, the level of thought

01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:15.970 position:56%
at that time, you will be astounded.

01:38:15.970 --> 01:38:18.810
Some of the greatest
writers and thinkers come

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:21.860
from that era in world history.

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.460
Above all, it was a society

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:26.970
where people were able
to talk, talk freely.

01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:28.850
There was open debate.

01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:32.660
So Jews, Muslims, Christians,
talked to each other.

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:37.050
It was through this civilization
that Europe and the West learned

01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:41.960
of its own history and its
own foundations, the Greeks.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:47.010 position:56%
If there'd been no Muslims in Spain
perhaps the Renaissance may not even

01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:48.460
have taken place.

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:56.940
And I came across several great
scholars, American scholars,

01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:02.860
scholars like Professor Tamara
Sun, Professor John Esposito,

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:07.500
Professor Dinah Eck, who were
exploring this idea of America

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:12.480
as a New Andalusia,
America as a society

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.430
which was relatively comparatively
but very advanced in terms

01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:20.250
of peoples and cultures
living together.

01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:25.110
There was a genuine feeling
of welcome to the immigrant

01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:27.570
because America essentially
is a society

01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:30.380
of immigrants welcoming
other immigrants.

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:35.060
And that gave it a certain flavor
and a character in America.

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:38.320
I discussed this with a colleague
of mine at Princeton University

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.640
in making a comparison between
European experiences with Islam

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.570
and American experiences.

01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:49.250
And he told me, a very wise
Professor of Anthropology

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.800
who studied the Muslim world,
he said the difference is

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.280
that in America the door's open.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.580
There is no restriction.

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.050
You want to make a mosque,
go and make a mosque.

01:39:58.050 --> 01:40:00.810
You want to make an Islamic
center, go and make it.

01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:02.390
Of course, that is on one level.

01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:07.040
We know that on another level
there are three distinct streams

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.890
in the American Muslim community --

01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:11.240
the Afro-American stream
of which we've heard

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.930
with such eloquence this
morning, the Arab stream

01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:17.360
from the Middle East,
and then the Asian stream

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:19.590
which came more recently.

01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:22.680
We also know that these
three streams run parallel,

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.060
sometimes they fuse, sometimes
they maintain their own identity.

01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:30.750
We also know that there are
individuals in the first stream,

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:32.810
individuals who are towering,

01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:36.530
who are in a sense gigantic
figures acting as bridges

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.190
between not only the
three streams but outside.

01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:42.580
And I refer to figures like
Malcolm X and Muhammad [inaudible]

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.540
as much an Afro-American stars.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:45.840
He is an American stars.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.700
He's much a Muslim star.

01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:49.750
So for someone in Pakistan,
my country,

01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:52.400
he'd be a complete superstar.

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:56.600
Now, September 11 and
Osama bin Laden --

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.520
Osama bin Laden challenges
many things on September 11.

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.640
And I believe one of the great,

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:09.280
great ideas that he challenges
is the idea of the New Andalusia.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.900
He does challenge that.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.420
And as a result of this
we have immediately

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:17.790
after September 11 three
things happening --

01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:22.030
the levels of ignorance about
Islam, the levels of understanding

01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:26.420
about Islam, and the levels
of hatred against Islam.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:29.000
These three things become
immediately apparent

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.020
after September 11.

01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.320
And you have so many cases.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.710
You have men with beards
wearing a turban.

01:41:34.710 --> 01:41:38.160
Sometime Sikhs, not even
Muslim, being attacked.

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.800
You have women wearing the hijab
being abused or humiliated,

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.160
or forced to take their hijab off.

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:47.010
And we suddenly have
a great challenge

01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:50.380
to the idea of a New Andalusia.

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.290
At the same time, with
this great challenge,

01:41:52.290 --> 01:41:57.450
we also have a new opportunity
because there is a genuine interest

01:41:57.450 --> 01:41:59.700
in Islam after September 11.

01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:01.640
People want to know about Islam.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.100
So matched with the great ignorance

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.780
on one hand there is
a great interest.

01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.670
And the ignorance cuts
across at all levels.

01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:14.780
Sometimes I aghast at the media
and the experts on the media.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:19.710
Recently I heard a commentary
on the prisoners in Cuba,

01:42:19.710 --> 01:42:23.370
and one of the experts was
explaining why the beards

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.010
of these prisoners were shaved.

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:27.190
And the expert was
saying they were shaved

01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:29.240
so that they could become purer.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.460
It was a purification process.

01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:32.760
And I was aghast.

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.490
How do you respond to something
which is this level of ignorance?

01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:40.750 position:56%
And, really, in a sense that is what
we are up against, the challenges

01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:43.040
of trying to create understanding

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.530
and mutual dialog between
the communities.

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:49.880
So our work as scholars
interested in Islam

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:52.680
in America is really cut out.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:57.630
The great challenge today is how
to explain Islam in an environment

01:42:57.630 --> 01:43:03.920
which is, A, volatile,
B, often hostile, and C,

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:09.360
accumulation of so many years
and years and years of prejudice,

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.310
history, and negative images.

01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:15.180
We've heard the negative images
that have come from the media,

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.840
particularly Hollywood and the
films, so I won't go into that.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.740
So Muslims are in a
sense in the dark.

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:28.330
Whether people accept that or do
not accept it, anyone I ever name

01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:30.660
which ends with Ahmed or Amed.

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:34.870
Try going to a check-in counter at
an airline with the name like that.

01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:36.650
You're going to be looked
over very carefully.

01:43:36.650 --> 01:43:38.490
You're going to be
asked to step aside.

01:43:38.490 --> 01:43:43.240
You've suddenly become aware that
whatever you are, whoever you are,

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.920 position:56%
you are suddenly representative of
the Islamic civilization as a whole.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.220
And why not?

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.520
Just look at what's happening.

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.820
Look at the media.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:55.600
Constantly Islam or
Muslims are in the news.

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.770
There's a Muslim story
all the time on the media.

01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:02.690
[Inaudible], Muslims;
Philippines [inaudible] Muslims.

01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:03.990
Where are we going next?

01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:06.990
Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Muslim,
Muslim, Muslim, Muslim.

01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:08.530
Captives, all Muslims.

01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:09.830
All captives.

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.180
Johnny Jihad.

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.480
Muslims, Muslims, Muslims
are always in the news.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.240
So however much we pretend
that we as scholars,

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.220
we live in our own world, we write
our books, we have nothing to do

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.480
with the real world, we
are part of the debate.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.780
I see all of us facing
several crises.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:35.150
The first crisis, for of these
crises is the crisis of identity.

01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:38.110
I believe that this has
thrown open the issue

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:40.910
of identity in Muslim society.

01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:42.210
Are we Arabs?

01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:43.510
Are we Pakistanis?

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.810
Are we American Muslims?

01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:48.460 position:56%
Are we part of the world [inaudible]
or are we only American Muslims,

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.930
defined politically
and geographically

01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:52.580
by the borders around America?

01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.910
Number one, identity.

01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:57.280
Number two, theology.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.680
The debate about Islamic self.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.670
Does the Koran encourage violence?

01:45:02.670 --> 01:45:04.580
I'm asked that all the time.

01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.750
And I'm sure other Muslims
are asked that all the time.

01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:08.550
We need answers.

01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:11.750 position:56%
It is not good enough for me to say,
well, you must know we are peaceful,

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.050
we love you, we love America.

01:45:13.050 --> 01:45:14.630
Islam is a peaceful religion.

01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:19.350
That has been the Muslim
response and that just will not do

01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:20.650
because no one is buying that.

01:45:20.650 --> 01:45:23.340
After you kill 5000
people or 4000 people,

01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:26.240
you blow up the [inaudible] you
can't simply say there is no

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.540
violence [inaudible] there.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.180
We need explanations.

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.040
We don't need cliches.

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.340
So theology.

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:34.230
We need the theologians
and the scholars

01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:38.260
to be giving us the answers rooted
in their knowledge of the Koran

01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:41.080
and the Hadis and Islamic history.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.290
The questions people asking.

01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:45.900
Three, Muslim leadership.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.900 position:56%
I believe there's a crisis of Muslim
leadership in America right now.

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.280
Who are the Muslim leaders?

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.890
I simply hear people in the
media saying Islam is peaceful,

01:45:55.890 --> 01:45:57.490
Islam is peaceful.

01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:59.970
This chant, this incantentiation
[assumed spelling]

01:45:59.970 --> 01:46:01.270
which doesn't mean anything.

01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:03.580
What does this mean Islam
is a peaceful religion?

01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:05.190
It doesn't explain anything.

01:46:05.190 --> 01:46:09.050
We need the Muslim leadership
to connect with the community,

01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:11.240
number one, their own
community and, number two,

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.280
with the larger American community.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.080
That is not happening.

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.140
Number four, education.

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.240 position:56%
Muslim education and larger American
education, where do they meet?

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:27.110
Where do they divert?

01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:29.720
We hear so much talk
about the madrassa.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.300
Have we had position
papers on the madrassa?

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.490
Do we know anything
about the madrassa?

01:46:34.490 --> 01:46:36.050
What is the madrassa?

01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:38.030
The madrassa is the
religious system,

01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:42.740 position:56%
the religious education system,
that eventually created the Taliban.

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.690 position:56%
But at the same time the madrassa is
the foundation for Islamic learning

01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:49.470
and has been for the
last thousand years.

01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:51.690
So does that needed information?

01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:54.410
What do we need to do
about the madrassa?

01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:58.640
We also know that there's a
crisis, not only in Muslim society

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.930
in analyzing non-Muslims,

01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:03.910
but in non-Muslims
looking at Muslim society.

01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:07.070
There's also a failure in
non-Muslims studying Muslims

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:09.010
or commenting on Muslims.

01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:11.990
I see four experts,
all four non-Muslims,

01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:13.930
commenting on Muslim issues.

01:47:13.930 --> 01:47:16.500
And all four having
the same opinion.

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.160
So A will say Islam
is a violent religion.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.680
B will say yes, it's a
terribly violent religion.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.890
C will say it's an even
more violent religion.

01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:25.990
And D will agree with this.

01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:27.780
I don't see much debate.

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:30.070
I don't see much interaction
of ideas.

01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:32.370
And when a Muslim expert
often appears

01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:35.110
in the media he's often
shouted down.

01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:38.450
There's a tendency to
simply dismiss him or her.

01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:42.040 position:56%
So there is a problem of
communication right now in the media

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.520
and we may again say the
media doesn't have an impact.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.490
It's just the media.

01:47:46.490 --> 01:47:48.820
But I would like to remind you

01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:52.880
that the media determines
how ordinary people think

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.680
in any country.

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:57.570
And the power of the
media is so great

01:47:57.570 --> 01:48:02.960
that this may damage those people
like me who are talking of dialog

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.500
of civilizations of understanding.

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:10.300
It is a very frustrating moment to
be a Muslim in America at this time

01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:13.430
because I feel that the
challenge is so great.

01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:16.300
I also know that there are
millions and millions of people

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.280
on both sides, Muslims
and non-Muslims,

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:25.020 position:56%
who are taking this challenge as an
opportunity to move towards the idea

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.170
of dialog, to try to
create understanding.

01:48:28.170 --> 01:48:31.610
And I would like to
end with the notion,

01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:34.880
with the idea of New Andalusia.

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:38.690
Remember that the 21st century
itself will be a century

01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:43.140
of change, of turmoil, of conflict.

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:47.310
We've heard the professors talking
about the clash of civilizations.

01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:50.800
We are seeing in some ways,
whether we agree or not,

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:53.430
a clash of civilizations
taking place.

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:55.320
It is happening and
there's no reason

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:57.260
to pretend it is not happening.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:02.510
And, therefore, the idea and
ideal idea of a New Andalusia,

01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:05.680
a land where people are
respected for what they are,

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.980
a land that respects difference,
a land that we are able

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.560
to say I am different,
my color is different,

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.590
my religion is different,
and yet I have respect.

01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:17.290
I think that is a great ideal.

01:49:17.290 --> 01:49:22.040
And as a Muslim I would
like to share the vision

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.540
that the Holy Prophet in the
seventh century gave of this ideal

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:31.400
of New Andalusia in the last
great address that he presented

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:36.240
to humanity in which he said,
"There is no Arab or non-Arab,

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.460
there is no black or
there is no white."

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:40.300
And this was the seventh century.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:44.610
This was a thousand years before
anyone was talking about equality.

01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:48.120
This is the vision that
drives Muslim society.

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:53.910 position:56%
And I believe at that point it meets
the American ideal of New Andalusia.

01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:55.210
Thank you.

01:49:55.210 --> 01:49:57.230
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford.

01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:58.530
Thank you very much.

01:49:58.530 --> 01:50:02.310
An appropriate series of
thoughts from somebody

01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:05.510
who holds the Ibn Khaldun Chair,

01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:10.150 position:56%
the first really great sociologist
I think it's fair to say, historian,

01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:13.280
of course, great historian
of the Berbers.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:19.010
But the first great sociological
theorist of the movement

01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:23.460
of peoples in Northern Africa.

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:27.830
We now turn back to a more
historical presentation.

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:30.140
At least I believe that's
what it's going to be.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:35.290
Sylviane Diouf is the Content
Manager for the Schomburg Center

01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:36.790
for Research in Black Culture

01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:41.120
on the African American
Migration Experience Project.

01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:48.580
And she has done a lot of work on
camera for the PBS series <i>This Far</i>

01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:52.920
<i>by Faith, African American
Spiritual Journeys </i>.

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:58.070
And it was her book that was held
up at the end of the last panel

01:50:58.070 --> 01:51:02.490
as evidence that there is indeed
in print a good deal on the subject

01:51:02.490 --> 01:51:05.460
of her book, <i>Servants of Allah,</i>

01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:09.280
<i>African Muslims Enslaved
in the Americas </i>.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.980
That book received a number of
awards and she holds a Doctorate

01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:19.250
in Les Sciences Humaines,
Human Sciences,

01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:21.380
from the University of Paris.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:25.960
She's an Adjunct Professor at New
York University, Research Associate

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:29.200
at the Center for Historical
Analysis at Rutgers,

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:34.560
and a former Diplomat from the
Senegalese Diplomatic Service

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.230
in both the U.S. and in Italy.

01:51:39.230 --> 01:51:41.530
Sylviane, it's yours.

01:51:42.570 --> 01:51:48.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sylviane A. Diouf: So I'm going
to take you back to the first panel.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.230
I will be speaking about the
African Muslims were enslaved

01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:53.530
in the Americas.

01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:56.790
And when we look at the situation
today we see that about 7%

01:51:56.790 --> 01:52:02.530
of the Muslims in the United
States are Sub-Saharan Africans.

01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:06.860
But there was a time when they
represented 100% of the Muslims

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:12.750
in this country as well as in the
Americas at large in the Caribbean.

01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:16.510
Those were the first 400 years.

01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:20.240
Now between the really early
years of the 59 [inaudible]

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:26.180
until the 1860s hundreds
of thousands

01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:30.240
of Sub-Saharan Muslims were
brought to the Americas.

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.540
There were prisons here but
between 15 and 20% of the 12

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:42.470
to 15 million Africans were swept
in the Atlantic slave trade.

01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:46.750
About 600,000 Africans
were sent to --

01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:49.900
but they came to the United
States so we can think

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:56.160
that about 100,000
of them were Muslims.

01:52:56.160 --> 01:53:00.740
Those people were men,
women, children.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:05.070
They were [inaudible] Muslims,
farmers, musicians, cattle herders,

01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:10.430
craftspeople, any category
that you can think of.

01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:14.500
But there were also categories
that were specific to the Muslims.

01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:21.920
For example, they were students
and teachers in Koranic schools.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:25.790
They were scholars, Imam,

01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:28.400
[inaudible] were memorizers
of the Koran.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.750
They were judges in
Islamic [inaudible].

01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:34.910
They were political
religious leaders and clerics.

01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:40.270
Some just like Omar [inaudible]
Said were enslaved here mentioned

01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:44.470
that before they were brought
to the Americas they had gone

01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:47.560
to Mecca to make the pilgrimage.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:52.760
Some studied in Egypt
also or in Morocco.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.990
Here, in the Americas and the
Caribbean, they did all the work

01:53:57.990 --> 01:54:01.110
that people were enslaved to do --

01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:06.300
picking cotton, tobacco,
rice, et cetera.

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:09.910
But there is also evidence
that many Muslims were employed

01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:16.290 position:56%
as professionals, as slave
drivers, as craftspeople, et cetera.

01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:19.950
What -- but there was one
thing that differentiated them

01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:21.360
from the rest of the population.

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.300
Not only the other
people were enslaved,

01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:30.070
but also many of the unslavers,
and this is the fact as mentioned

01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:35.550
by Professor Hunwick that some of
them could read and write in Arabic

01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:40.550
but also in their own language
written in the Arabic script.

01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:44.650
Now it's one thing to
know how to read and write

01:54:44.650 --> 01:54:46.520
and to come here knowing that.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.290
It's another thing to continue
to do so when you're enslaved.

01:54:52.290 --> 01:55:01.390
And especially in countries that
forbid slaves to read and write.

01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:05.550
So, obviously, even though they
kept their skills in the Americas

01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:09.360
and there are many documents
not only in the United States

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.080
but in Latin America that
mention that slaves --

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:15.360
I mean Muslims were writing.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.870
It was a difficult endeavor.

01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:20.880
Of course they could
not buy paper and ink.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.090 position:56%
It was a very -- it was very hard to
do, not only for financial reasons

01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:27.170
but also because if you were
[inaudible] you were just not

01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:32.100
supposed to do -- buying
ink and paper.

01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:36.210
So we have an example of
Ibrahim [foreign words]

01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:39.540
from Guinea was a slave in
Mississippi for 40 years

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:44.220 position:56%
and what he did was when he was --
when the people were taking a break,

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:49.180
he was a cotton picker, he
used to write on the sand

01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:53.550 position:56%
of the plantation just to make sure
that he did not forget how to write.

01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:55.840
But in some other countries,
and maybe here

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:57.180 position:56%
in the United States also, it's just

01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:59.890
that I haven't found
the documentation,

01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:02.800
people were also making
their own implements.

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.390
They were making ink
as people do in Africa.

01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:13.500
I found an example of people
from Nigeria would be enslaved

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:18.460
in [foreign words] who were
described as making ink

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.020
and making wooden tablets.

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:28.300
This is very interesting because
as Professor Hunwick mentioned the

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:33.080
tablets, the Koranic tablets
are used either for talismans

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:38.570
or they also are used as a
slate in Koranic schools.

01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:44.230
So these may indicate that
there were Koranic schools

01:56:44.230 --> 01:56:46.120
in [foreign words] during slavery.

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:52.090 position:56%
And even though it may seem a little
bizarre this is not the only case.

01:56:52.090 --> 01:56:54.590
There were many Koranic schools

01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:58.000
which operated underground
in Brazil.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.470
And there was a big mass
enterprising in 1835 in Brazil.

01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:09.590
And the police went, of course,
through the houses of the Africans

01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:13.410
and they found the slaves and
they found books, et cetera.

01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:17.510
And it was revealed that those
schools had been operating

01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:18.810
for years.

01:57:18.810 --> 01:57:21.550
And I must say that there
were quite sophisticated.

01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:23.510
We are talking about
some people were free,

01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:25.880
but the majority of
them were slaves.

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:33.660
I have an interesting quote by the
French Ambassador in Rio who wrote,

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:40.230
and I quote, "The Koran was
sold in Rio at 15 to 25 queseros

01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.150
by the French [inaudible]
for showing [inaudible].

01:57:42.150 --> 01:57:44.400
We import copies from Europe.

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.180
Slaves who appear to be
quite poor are willing

01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:50.520 position:56%
to make the greatest sacrifices to
acquire this volume, going into debt

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:54.130
to do so, and sometimes taking a
year to pay off the bookseller.

01:57:54.130 --> 01:57:57.590
About a hundred copies of the
Koran are sold every year."

01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:02.840
So you can see that even though
people were enslaved what leads all

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.090
time in urgent money they had,
they [inaudible] separated

01:58:07.090 --> 01:58:09.820
that to buying the Koran.

01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:13.510
We also have mentions of
Korans in the United States.

01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:19.260
Some were given by
priests to the Muslims.

01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:24.630
Some were smuggled,
if you will, here.

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:29.290
There were also people who wrote
-- did not have access to a Koran,

01:58:29.290 --> 01:58:32.660
and they wrote their Koran by rote.

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:34.830
I mean this is one thing that
people should be able to do

01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:38.130
after good Islamic education.

01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:44.170 position:56%
John [inaudible] that was mentioned
before wrote two copies of the Koran

01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:49.540
as he was going to London
back from -- back to Senegal.

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:53.650
Another in Jamaica,
also that we know of,

01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:57.980
wrote his own copy of the Koran.

01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:00.950
[Inaudible] Muhammad from
Guinea, who was enslaved

01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:07.530
on [inaudible] wrote a
13-page manuscript in Arabic

01:59:07.530 --> 01:59:10.440
on paper that has been analyzed.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:16.510
And it's been shown that this
paper was manufactured in Italy

01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.490
for the Muslim market
of North Africa.

01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:25.220
So we have this Muslim from Guinea
in Georgia writing a manuscript

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:30.050
on paper coming from
-- I mean made in Italy

01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:33.070
and which had been then sent to
North Africa and then smuggled

01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:38.470
in some way by what I call Islamic
networks of traders and sailors

01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:44.400
to Georgia, to a remote
plantation on the Sea Islands.

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.160
What is important to see is

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:51.120
that Muslim literacy
introduced a subversive element

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.890
in those slave societies because
they were based on the idea

01:59:55.890 --> 01:59:59.060
that Africans were
kind of a sub-species,

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:04.540
incapable of any intellectual
pursuit.

02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.150
So the idea was that,
well, you know,

02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:10.130
if these people came here
knowing how to read and write

02:00:10.130 --> 02:00:11.900
in Arabic, what does it mean?

02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.840
That there are schools in Africa.

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:18.660
There's paper, there's ink,
there are teachers, students.

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:23.220
So what about the idea that all
those people are just savages

02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:26.280
running around naked
hitting one another.

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:31.990
So these opened questions in
the slave societies to the point

02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:37.650
that in many cases these
Muslims were Sub-Saharan Africans

02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:42.310
from Senegal, Guinea, Mali,
Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana,

02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:48.050
were described as not being
Africans but as being Arabs.

02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:50.140
Now there was also another problem.

02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:54.130
The fact that paper
was smuggled out,

02:00:54.130 --> 02:00:58.270
books were also smuggled
in some way.

02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:01.810
And the fact that there
were Koranic schools --

02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:08.640
evidence that there was a well-run
organized underground community.

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.310
And this community
could do something else

02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:18.020
than just pursue religious
and literary things.

02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:19.980
It could be used in a
more practical manner.

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:25.590
And, of course, we've seen in
Guyana, in [foreign words],

02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:29.290
in Brazil, maybe not -- not in
the United States as we know of,

02:01:29.290 --> 02:01:34.840
but in other countries a
literacy in Arabic used

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.810
by the slaves to plot revolts.

02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:47.970
From 1807 to 1835 there were many
Muslim conspiracies enterprising

02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:49.270
in Brazil.

02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:51.780
And we found -- I mean
the documents exist.

02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:53.150
They are still here today.

02:01:53.150 --> 02:02:00.200
And they show maps in Arabic --
maps, blueprints for the revolts,

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.880
plans, et cetera, of people who
were planning those revolts.

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:11.150 position:56%
They were also writing of another
type which were talismans as they --

02:02:11.150 --> 02:02:14.620
as you, as well as
I explained earlier.

02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:20.720
Those [inaudible] talismans
are mainly used by the Sufi

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.620
and they are like, if
you will, I don't know,

02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:26.810
a saint medal in Christianity.

02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:30.310
They are not revered, but they
are supposed to, you know,

02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:33.660
to help the person who wears them.

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:40.230
So what we've seen is that we have
many documents that are still --

02:02:40.230 --> 02:02:45.920 position:56%
exist today that were talisman,
that were used during those revolts.

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:50.910
So, in fact, the talismans were
also kind of a weapon, if you will,

02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:55.570
that helped people feel
more secure and more sure

02:02:55.570 --> 02:03:01.530
of the outcome of the fight.

02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:06.900
So in the specific
situation of bondage,

02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:14.340
the literacy of the Africans
provided them an efficient tool

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:15.940
that could be used as a weapon.

02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:19.190
And, of course, it was
discrete because the plans

02:03:19.190 --> 02:03:26.040
and the letters could go rather
far and very few slaveholders

02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:30.640 position:56%
and overseers wrote and read Arabic.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.700
On top of it some of those papers
were written in also Mandingo,

02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:38.810
written in the Arabic script.

02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:42.810
So it was very difficult
to decipher.

02:03:42.810 --> 02:03:49.260
Were there written
denunciations of slavery,

02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:56.890 position:56%
a kind of a protest literature if
you will in -- written by those men?

02:03:56.890 --> 02:03:58.190
We don't know.

02:03:58.190 --> 02:04:03.050
But what we can safely say
is that they were writing

02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.690
for other African [inaudible]
were enslaved,

02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:08.630
so there was no use
denouncing the situation.

02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:11.400
Everybody knew exactly what it was.

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.250
But it's interesting to look
at texts which were written

02:04:15.250 --> 02:04:17.350
by African Muslims for the rest

02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:22.850
of the population,
the white population.

02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:25.850
I won't go into the
texts by Omar Said

02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:28.650
because I don't think
I would have time.

02:04:28.650 --> 02:04:33.950 position:56%
But I will just like to mention one
text which was written in 1834 by --

02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:37.180
a man from Mali was
enslaved in Jamaica,

02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:42.230
and he wrote his autobiography
in Arabic.

02:04:42.230 --> 02:04:47.220
He wrote the first version
while he was still in Jamaica

02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.960
and one part is interesting.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:55.360 position:56%
He wrote it and then he translated
it into English saying, and I quote,

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.460
"We were three months at sea
before we arrived in Jamaica

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.460
which was the beginning of bondage.

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:04.570
I have no one to thank but
those who brought me here."

02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:05.870
End of quote.

02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:09.670
Now, the second version
he wrote when he was free

02:05:09.670 --> 02:05:14.030 position:56%
in London before going back to Mali.

02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:19.800
And the second version --
this paragraph reads --

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:25.250
"This was the beginning of
my slavery until this day.

02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:29.880
I tasted the bitterness of slavery
from them and its oppressiveness.

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:34.050
But praise be to God, under
whose power are all things."

02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:40.020
So once he was safe, he meant --
he made sure that people understood

02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:43.600
that some people were at
fault for him being enslaved.

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:46.570 position:56%
And he was not thanking them at all.

02:05:46.570 --> 02:05:52.610
Can we say, as some
people mentioned,

02:05:52.610 --> 02:05:57.330
that the Muslims were
reclaiming their humanity

02:05:57.330 --> 02:05:58.750
through the [inaudible].

02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:01.710
I would say that people
have to be careful

02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:04.270
about saying things like that.

02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:08.090
We've seen -- I mean, many people
have seen Africans and blacks

02:06:08.090 --> 02:06:14.490
in general who [inaudible]
which for [inaudible]

02:06:14.490 --> 02:06:19.530
in 500 years of stereotypes.

02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:26.070
And there is no indication
at all that Muslims

02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:30.880
and non-Muslims were
enslaved in the Americas.

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:33.180
[Inaudible] themselves
as not human at all.

02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:38.070
On the contrary, French,
Portuguese, Spanish, British,

02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:43.160
American sources consistently
mentioned that the Africans thought

02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:48.860
that they were equal or superior to
the people who had enslaved them.

02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:51.130
The Muslims have no reason
to think of themselves

02:06:51.130 --> 02:06:55.400
as pagans, as sub-humans.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.240
They certainly felt oppressed.

02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:00.460
They do not feel -- some of
them do not feel inferior

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:05.660 position:56%
but they certainly felt oppressed as
human beings as well as [inaudible].

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:12.100
And literacy had them fulfill
their needs, not only spiritual --

02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.060 position:56%
intellectual, political, and social.

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:18.500
It was a marker, I think, of
identity, not of humanity,

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:24.170
of identity as Muslims,
as clerics, as scholars.

02:07:24.170 --> 02:07:28.260
It meant continuing to be
in the situation of bondage

02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:32.130
where they had been before,
before they had status,

02:07:32.130 --> 02:07:34.660
before they had been
teachers or students.

02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:39.790
And they continued to remain so
even though they were enslaved.

02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:47.430
Given the number of Muslims
throughout the Americas,

02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:51.390
why don't we find more manuscripts?

02:07:51.390 --> 02:07:54.750
And, of course, I mean they
are the limitation that's,

02:07:54.750 --> 02:07:56.050
you know, you can imagine.

02:07:56.050 --> 02:08:02.780
But I must also say that more and
more manuscripts are cropping up.

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:08.280
We found some recently in
Jamaica and in Trinidad.

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:12.800
Besides the Omar [inaudible]
there are hundreds

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:16.460
of manuscripts in Brazil.

02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:21.420
And as the topic becomes more --

02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:25.850
I mean as more and more scholars
are looking into this topic,

02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:29.240
more and more things
are being discovered

02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.810
that were there all along
just in boxes somewhere.

02:08:33.810 --> 02:08:45.050
And you know, to conclude, I will
say that a tradition of reading

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:47.160
and writing, which in some areas

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:52.580
that being established 500 years
even more the slave trade started

02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:56.530
found a new utility in America.

02:08:56.530 --> 02:08:58.900
Islam was the fourth behind that.

02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:04.660
But literacy here had
its own dynamics.

02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:08.060
It served also other
purposes than just reading

02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:10.610
of the Koran and the text.

02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:17.480
In the very harsh [inaudible] were
that they were forced to live in,

02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:20.040
the literate Africans used
their knowledge to defend

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:24.080
and protect themselves, to regain
control through, for example,

02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.500
the talisman and the revolt, over
their lives and over their --

02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.320
the present and future
of their communities.

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:35.780
And they also tried
to get their freedom.

02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:41.030
Their knowledge may have
seemed worthless in these --

02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:47.560
in the Western environment, but
it proved to be extremely useful

02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:52.170
as well as extremely
threatening to the enslavers.

02:09:52.170 --> 02:09:56.300
And those are not the only things

02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:00.140
that the African Muslims
have left in the Americas.

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:07.100 position:56%
There are many others that can still
be found today in the religions even

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:12.250
of people of African descent
who are not Muslims today.

02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:19.430
As mentioned also earlier,
Vodou has some very distinctive

02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:22.180
Islamic elements.

02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:28.590
So does Santeria and Candomble,
as well as other religions.

02:10:28.590 --> 02:10:34.200
So for 400 and sometimes 500 years,

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:38.260
the African Muslims have
been a cultural, social,

02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:40.940
and spiritual force in America.

02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:44.240
They have left their mark,
including their written mark,

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.950
in a society that negated
and rejected them.

02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:50.720
They were Africans,
they were Muslims.

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:54.070
They became African Americans.

02:10:54.070 --> 02:10:59.240
And their story has to be
heard an unearthed if we want

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.490
to better understand the various
cultures that have made America.

02:11:03.490 --> 02:11:06.440
Thank you [applause].

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:07.960
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford:
Thank you very much.

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:15.830
Let me just, before I introduce
Amir Al-Islam, let me just try

02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:21.920 position:56%
to briefly pull together a couple of
the threads that we've heard so far,

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.700
because Professor Hunwick,

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:30.130
by emphasizing the Islamic
learned tradition in Timbuktu,

02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:34.950
which of course came
down from North Africa,

02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:39.360
helped to establish the very
kinds of learning and network

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.970
that we've just heard
from Professor Diouf.

02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:51.570 position:56%
And what Professor Ahmed emphasized,
the new Andalucia ties back

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:57.510
to that also because not only was
Andalucia symbolically a society

02:11:57.510 --> 02:12:03.450
of tolerance, but it was a society
of intellectual inclusiveness.

02:12:03.450 --> 02:12:06.740 position:56%
And it was not only the Greek
learning, but the Byzantine learning

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:13.530
that came through Islam and
eventually not only through Spain,

02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:18.870
but also through Sicily, and
through the North Africa people

02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:21.020
like Ibn Khaldun himself.

02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:27.480
So there is a -- this tradition
of learning, of inclusiveness

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:33.180
to discovery from the
ancient classical West

02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:40.870 position:56%
and from the Byzantine world of what
is now Turkey in Eastern Orthodoxy.

02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:46.490
All of that is incorporated in
the tradition of Islamic learning.

02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:49.630
And these networks, as has been
suggested several times today,

02:12:49.630 --> 02:12:53.390
these networks were expanded
by sailors, and traders,

02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:57.110
and others all over the world.

02:12:57.110 --> 02:13:04.500
Now Amir Al-Islam, who will be our
sort of cleanup batter for today,

02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:07.670
is presently the Executive
Director of the Center

02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:11.440
for Professional Education
at Medgar Evers College

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.430
where he also teaches
African American History

02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:15.650
and World Civilization.

02:13:15.650 --> 02:13:20.110
He holds graduate degrees from NYU,
New York University, from Princeton

02:13:20.110 --> 02:13:23.150
in Islamic Studies and
African American History.

02:13:23.150 --> 02:13:25.110 position:56%
And was Director of Domestic Affairs

02:13:25.110 --> 02:13:29.980
at the Muslim World League
Office at the United Nations.

02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:34.820
He's been actively involved in
interfaith activities in many parts

02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:38.490
of the world, Poland,
Japan, Sierra Leone, Turkey.

02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:41.820
He's organized and conducted
interfaith dialogues throughout

02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:43.120
this country.

02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:48.800
He has several publications
on African American Islam

02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.420
and has coauthored a number of
U.N. documents, including "The Role

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:55.080
of Religion in Social Development."

02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.600
So it is I think quite
appropriate for him

02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.270
to be our final speaker
this morning.

02:14:10.070 --> 02:14:12.450
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:20.140
I would like to begin by
an invocation that is part

02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:25.060
of the tradition of the Muslim
community in praising Allah

02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:33.110 position:56%
and sending out peace and blessings
upon his prophet Muhammad in Arabic.

02:14:33.110 --> 02:14:34.730
[Speaking in foreign
language] Praise be

02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:37.270
to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:40.720
Peace and blessings upon
his final prophet, Muhammad.

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.510
I would first like to take this
opportunity to thank the organizers

02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:50.600
for inviting me to come today and
share with you some of my views,

02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:55.460
ideas, perspectives,
and research on Islam

02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:58.780 position:56%
and the African American experience.

02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:05.080
I have -- we tried to in the
beginning get the order switched,

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.720
because Akbar Ahmed
is one of my mentors,

02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:10.800
a person that I read and study.

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.930 position:56%
And I thought that he -- it would be
more appropriate for him to be last,

02:15:13.930 --> 02:15:16.770
as well as the chronological order
would be, I think, more consistent.

02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:21.750
But we are consistent in
somewhat of our inconsistencies.

02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:26.870
So what I'm going to do very
briefly today is give you kind

02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:33.370
of an overview of the African
American Islamic experience.

02:15:33.370 --> 02:15:36.510
And as I was researching some
information for this presentation

02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:38.710
at the Chamburg [assumed
spelling], I realized that there's

02:15:38.710 --> 02:15:46.120 position:56%
such a shortage of material about
such a profound and dynamic subject.

02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:53.260
And as I listened to Yonne Haddad
and Professor Akbar Ahmed talk

02:15:53.260 --> 02:16:00.010
about the idea of 9/11, in many
instances within the discourse

02:16:00.010 --> 02:16:02.400
within the Islamic community,

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.910
we are framing our
experience pre- and post-9/11.

02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:10.920
And we are not really clear
on what to make of the change

02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:14.300
that is taking place after 9/11.

02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:20.210
But I think it's ironic around
the idea of civilization project

02:16:20.210 --> 02:16:24.810 position:56%
and the idea of civilizational
dialogue, as Dr. Ahmed talked about,

02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:30.860
is that we have to actually go back
to a period in our history to refer

02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:37.370
to a point or a period where we
can draw from that will allow us

02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:39.040
to be more civilized
with each other.

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:47.230
I think that is indicative of the
failure of our ability to cope

02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:55.000 position:56%
with the reality of the plurality of
our existence here on this planet.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:00.170
Having said that, I would also
like to say about the idea of 9/11,

02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:06.820
African Americans are not
new to racial profiling.

02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:10.780
The term was coined
by our existence.

02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:13.190
African Americans are not new --

02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:16.020
we're not neophyte to
the idea of oppression,

02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:20.500
and marginalization,
and misrepresentation.

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.770
This all happened pre-9/11.

02:17:23.770 --> 02:17:27.480
This has been the sum total of
our existence and our struggle

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.050
as we strived, and continue to
strive, to establish a sense

02:17:31.050 --> 02:17:37.000
of social justice for people
in general in America.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.020
This is not new to us.

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:47.370
And as an activist scholar -- I
was going to say scholar activist,

02:17:47.370 --> 02:17:49.050 position:56%
but really I am an activist scholar.

02:17:49.050 --> 02:17:54.780
More activist than scholar,
actually, because I feel

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:59.980
like Gramsci has told us,
somewhat as -- when he talks --

02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:02.640
when he characterizes
the organic intellectual,

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:08.500
that theory is grounded
and actualized in praxis.

02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:11.090
So having had the experience
of working

02:18:11.090 --> 02:18:14.410
within the African American Muslim
community for over 20 years,

02:18:14.410 --> 02:18:17.320
it has actualized much
of my understanding

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:20.460
of the theoretical framework.

02:18:24.570 --> 02:18:30.700
Let me say that as African
American Muslims, there is no way

02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:37.040 position:56%
that I could convey to you the
trials, tribulations, the struggles,

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.520
the difficulties, the pain, the
anguish, the contradictions,

02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:52.720 position:56%
the alienation, the marginalization
of a people who have embraced Islam.

02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:57.930 position:56%
And after embracing this great faith
of 1/5 of the entire human race,

02:18:57.930 --> 02:19:04.940
now have taken on another burden
where we are, in many instances,

02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:10.650
doubly margined -- doubly
marginalized for being black --

02:19:10.650 --> 02:19:16.130
punished for being black in a
society that privileges whiteness,

02:19:16.130 --> 02:19:19.450
that -- where racism continues
to permeate individual minds,

02:19:19.450 --> 02:19:24.220
and consciousness, and
imaginations, and institutions.

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:28.010
And being Muslim in a society
where Ibn Said characterizes

02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.820
that the Islam that is represented
or, quote, misrepresented,

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:39.670
or covered, or miscovered [sic],
is more about a conception

02:19:39.670 --> 02:19:46.230
and a construction of a
demonized group rather

02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:51.600
than the profound religion that is
represented by such a large number

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:58.440
of people, a great religion that
is embraced by such a large number

02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:02.730
of people on this planet,
a religion that teaches

02:20:02.730 --> 02:20:05.840
such beautiful teachings of love,
and compassion, and understanding,

02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:09.400
and respect for human beings,
and respect for human life,

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:14.920
and respect for the dignity of
human beings and human existence.

02:20:18.250 --> 02:20:22.760 position:56%
My topic was, of course,
contemporary African American Islam.

02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:26.760
And for the few minutes that I have
left here, I want to talk to you

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:33.120
about some aspects of that.

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:36.380
When we say contemporary African
American Islam, we have to --

02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:39.640
I have to make a disclaimer
because the concept

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:45.010
of contemporary African American
Islam is problematic for Muslims,

02:20:45.010 --> 02:20:48.520
because in most cases Muslims would
argue that there's no such thing

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.660
as African American Islam, nor is
there such a thing as Arab Islam,

02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:57.890
or Pakistani Islam, that
there really is one Islam.

02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:05.190 position:56%
But I would argue that that one
divine and revealed religion and way

02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:08.040
of life that was revealed
to the Prophet Muhammad,

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:10.030
peace and blessings be
upon him, by the Creator

02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:16.610 position:56%
of the universe immediately changes
as soon as human beings claim agency

02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:22.950 position:56%
over it, as soon as individual human
beings embrace it, it now is changed

02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:28.340
from the pristine purity of its
revelation to its interpreters

02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:33.460
and interlocutors who nuance
it with their culture,

02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:35.520
who nuance it with
their hermeneutics,

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:43.330
who nuance it with their
worldview and continue the process

02:21:43.330 --> 02:21:45.090
of its misrepresentation.

02:21:45.090 --> 02:21:49.030
Not only does the Western
media often misrepresent Islam,

02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:53.220
but in many instances Muslims
themselves misrepresent Islam.

02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:58.470
So when I talk about
African American Islam,

02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:02.490
what I'm really saying is
Islam among African Americans.

02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:06.660
I think that is a much more
appropriate title And I don't need

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:09.070
to go into detail, and I don't
have time to go into detail

02:22:09.070 --> 02:22:11.600 position:56%
about the delineation of the history

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:13.880
or chronicling the
history of the experience.

02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:16.710
I have basically divided the
experience into three phases.

02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:21.880
One is what I call the
pre-emancipation phase,

02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:24.170
African Muslims in
antebellum America.

02:22:24.170 --> 02:22:27.560
In this experience alone
one sentence will, I think,

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:29.870
be appropriate for you
to capture the essence

02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:32.030
of what the experience is about.

02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:40.190
The slaves, a Muslim who left the
mosque in the Senegambian region

02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:47.120
to go home to his family,
captured, chained, enslaved,

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:51.900 position:56%
taken from his homeland, his family,
his loved ones, his community,

02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:56.130
and brought to the shores of
North America to be dehumanized,

02:22:56.130 --> 02:23:00.350
to be demasculated [sic] and sold.

02:23:00.350 --> 02:23:06.130
And out of this horrific
experience, this individual --

02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:09.590 position:56%
or these individuals like Omar,
like Saliba Lada [assumed spelling],

02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:12.730
like so many others that we
have not even discovered,

02:23:12.730 --> 02:23:16.560
but whose spirit we embody,
particularly as African Americans,

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.710
who lived that experience.

02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:21.720
These people were able to
maintain the Islamic practice

02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:25.900
within the context of the
horrific experience of slavery.

02:23:25.900 --> 02:23:28.460
That's pre-emancipation slavery.

02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:31.390
Painful, painful.

02:23:31.390 --> 02:23:36.220
There are not even enough texts
to explain the pain that existed

02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.070
to the experience of slavery.

02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:41.720
One can read it, but the
reality of the experience

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:44.830
of it is something
altogether different.

02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:48.900
The second phase is what I call
the early Islamic communities,

02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:52.580
from 1900 to 1960.

02:23:52.580 --> 02:23:54.420
And in this particular phase

02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:57.430
of the Islamic development
we see the evolution

02:23:57.430 --> 02:24:00.280
of what I call proto-Islamic
movements.

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:03.610
And I call them proto- to
qualify the fact that many

02:24:03.610 --> 02:24:08.210 position:56%
of these movements did not
articulate nor practice the orthodox

02:24:08.210 --> 02:24:11.750
teachings of Al-Islam, but
in fact appropriated --

02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:16.770
selectively appropriated various
theological teachings of Islam,

02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:23.440
to use, to construct, to
develop, to construct tools --

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:29.250
as tools to be deployed to
oppose racism and oppression.

02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:35.650
And within that period of time we
did have individual communities

02:24:35.650 --> 02:24:39.590
that evolved and emerged,
that became closer --

02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:44.150
that emerged closer to what
we call the Islamic orthodoxy.

02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:48.080
So movements like the Nation of
-- I mean, the Noble Drew Ali,

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:52.820
the Moorish Science Temple, even
organizations like Marcus Garvey

02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:56.350
who was influenced by Duse
Mohamed Ali when he went to London,

02:24:56.350 --> 02:24:59.130
before he came to the United
States, that Muslims involved

02:24:59.130 --> 02:25:04.580
in the Marcus Garvey
movement, Muslims, of course,

02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:08.350
African Americans,
emerging from that movement

02:25:08.350 --> 02:25:11.290
into what is called the Nation
of Islam with Fard Muhammad

02:25:11.290 --> 02:25:17.280
and eventually Elijah Muhammad,
using the teaching of Islam

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:21.720
to fight oppression and racism.

02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:26.740 position:56%
And the final phase is the phase
that I call the contemporary period,

02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:31.170
which is basically
from 1960 until now.

02:25:31.170 --> 02:25:35.110
If you look at the movements
in 1960, the Dar al-Islam,

02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:38.560
the Muslim International
Brotherhood, Sheik Daud --

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:40.900
not Shake Daud [inaudible],
I'm sorry --

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:44.020
other Islamic movements and
Islamic party during that period,

02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:48.250
these movements were fired by the
spirit of the Black Power Movement

02:25:48.250 --> 02:25:51.210
and the Civil Rights Movement,
and much of their interpretation

02:25:51.210 --> 02:25:56.220
of Islam was nuanced and
influenced by the radicalization

02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:01.430 position:56%
and the rebelliousness of the people
at that time who were fighting

02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:03.630
and continued to fight racism.

02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:06.240
As you might notice in my comments,

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:09.860
race and racism is
the meta-narrative

02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:12.690
that permeates every aspect
of our history and experience

02:26:12.690 --> 02:26:14.500
as African Americans
in this country.

02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:16.810
And it continues to do so.

02:26:16.810 --> 02:26:21.380
Now finally, let me say that
in spite of the difficulties,

02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:23.930
in spite of the suffering,
in spite of the indignities,

02:26:23.930 --> 02:26:26.960
in spite of the challenge, of
example, of the Muslims who have --

02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:30.760
a Muslim who has reverted to Islam,
reconnected with their heritage

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.630
and history, who has
often be alienated

02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:36.480
from their own Christian family
because now they have new names.

02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:38.070
They have new dress.

02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:39.590
They have new food.

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:42.110
They have all of the
things that now have --

02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:46.570
the things that have transformed
them into a new person.

02:26:46.570 --> 02:26:52.740
We're talking about an
experience, an Islamization process

02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:57.050
that creates havoc in a
community, in an individual family,

02:26:57.050 --> 02:26:59.900
in a society that continues
to suppress

02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:02.770
that evolution and development.

02:27:02.770 --> 02:27:04.640
In spite of all of
these difficulties,

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:08.470
African American Muslims,
by the grace of the Creator,

02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:13.570
are now functioning in every
aspect of the American society.

02:27:13.570 --> 02:27:18.470
Muslims are -- African Americans
are doctors, lawyers, judges.

02:27:18.470 --> 02:27:19.870
We have several Muslim --

02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:22.000
African American Muslims
who are elected officials,

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.320
who are -- who have formed mosques.

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:27.350
I think for the most part, out of
the 1300 mosques in this country,

02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:31.130
at least 30% of them are
African American mosques.

02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:32.890
We have leaders like
Imam W.D. Mohammed

02:27:32.890 --> 02:27:36.030
who has probably the largest
number of African American Muslims

02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:38.460
in this country, probably
over 2 million,

02:27:38.460 --> 02:27:42.350
and other African American
traditional Sunni communities

02:27:42.350 --> 02:27:44.300
like the new organization that's
established called the Muslim

02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:48.130
Alliance of North America
that was formed not long ago,

02:27:48.130 --> 02:27:50.840
which represents part of the
traditional Sunni community.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:52.670
But the Islamic community
is emergent and is --

02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:55.740
and evolving, and the largest
number of Muslims who are coming

02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:59.560
into Islam are primarily
African American.

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:03.230
And the people are saying
[inaudible] questions,

02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:06.140
"What is this about?"

02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:08.500
And I don't know about
you, but I know many

02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:12.040
of my African American Muslim
friends say, "Well, we're surprised

02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:18.260
that we didn't see any African
American with the Taliban,"

02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:21.160
because that's all
they needed to see,

02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:23.780
because the Muslim communities
-- the last week we were --

02:28:23.780 --> 02:28:25.250
I was in a mosque in Brooklyn,

02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:28.780
and they found a listening
device at the mosque.

02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:32.140
We're almost strip-searched
every time we go to the airport.

02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:38.310
So now racial profiling
is very, very --

02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:42.110
is a serious burden on us as
we move around the country.

02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:45.170
But in spite of this, as Muslims,
because we believe in Allah,

02:28:45.170 --> 02:28:50.620 position:56%
and fear Allah, and want to practice
Islam, we love this country --

02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:54.230
in quotes love, because there
are some conditions for love.

02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:59.130
We've suffered in pain, but we
do have strategic patriotism.

02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:02.750 position:56%
But the reality is we're going to
change this country, as we have done

02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:05.530
as part of our African
American experience.

02:29:05.530 --> 02:29:06.830
But we're going to
change it in a way

02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:11.120
that creates a dialogical process,
that engages American people

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:16.170
in discursive networks, that
allows us to evolve the existence

02:29:16.170 --> 02:29:20.550
of a humanity that
represents a plurality.

02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:22.080
We're not going to throw bombs.

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:24.720
We're not going to kill anyone,
because it is against Islam for us

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:30.330
to kill anyone that does not try
to kill, or maim, or harm us.

02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:31.680
We're going to change this society.

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:33.110
We're going to continue
to change this society.

02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:36.530
And I don't think we need to look
at Andalus -- al-Andalus for that.

02:29:36.530 --> 02:29:40.810
I think we should have enough
within our creative imagination

02:29:40.810 --> 02:29:48.870
and within our own humanity to
create a sense of -- of embrace.

02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:50.170
Not tolerance.

02:29:50.170 --> 02:29:52.770
Tolerance is an inappropriate word.

02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:54.070
Are you tolerable?

02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:55.370
Can you tolerate me?

02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:57.620
I'm just tolerable to you?

02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:00.920 position:56%
We're going to create an environment
that embraces difference,

02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:06.300
that transforms us, that allows us
to create collectively an America

02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:10.870
that we envision, that I
envision, that Dr. King envisioned,

02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:14.660
that all of us would like to
see, that embraces all of us

02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:15.990
and celebrates our difference.

02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:18.430
Thank you very much [speaking
in foreign language].

02:30:18.430 --> 02:30:19.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone.

02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:21.930
Thank you very much
for your presentation.

02:30:21.930 --> 02:30:24.350
I have a historical
question for Ms. Diouf --

02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:27.080
how do you pronounce your name?

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.380
&gt;&gt; Sylviane A. Diouf: Diouf.

02:30:28.380 --> 02:30:29.890
&gt;&gt; Diouf, excuse me.

02:30:29.890 --> 02:30:35.600
I know in many West African
societies there is a very engrained

02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:40.220
caste system where the slave case
has existed for thousands of years

02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:44.960
in these societies, and
that it was common practice

02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:48.380
for well-established people
to have slaves in their house,

02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:50.580
in their fields, and whatnot.

02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:54.830 position:56%
I'm just very curious if there's any
documentation of any of the slaves

02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:57.780
that had been brought to
America had been, in fact,

02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:02.340
slave owners in Africa already,
because I'm very curious

02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:05.400
because of the presentations
we have heard of Omar Ibn Said,

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:08.440
and other scholars, and
very well-respected people

02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:09.740
in their communities.

02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:14.020 position:56%
Based on other historical studies
I've done, these people usually are,

02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:17.440
in fact, slave owners in
their communities as well.

02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:19.000
&gt;&gt; Sylviane A. Diouf:
Yes, of course.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:26.290 position:56%
In fact, Omar mentioned that his
father owned, I think, if I'm not --

02:31:26.290 --> 02:31:29.280
if I'm correct, 70 slaves.

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:30.600
No?

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:32.200
&gt;&gt; Seventy?

02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:33.500
&gt;&gt; Sylviane A. Diouf: Seventy.

02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:36.060
I think that's what he mentioned.

02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:41.120
And I mean, in the -- it's
evident that there were people

02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:45.160
who were enslaved here
who had been slaveholders,

02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:47.870
whether they were Muslims
or not Muslims.

02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:50.650
But you have to make a distinction

02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:54.590
between American slavery
and African slavery.

02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:57.330
And those are two very,
very different things.

02:31:57.330 --> 02:32:01.600
They have the same
name, and you know,

02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:06.050
in some ways people are not free.

02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:09.990
And that's, you know, what
-- but bondage exists --

02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:12.910
I mean, people who are in
jail are not free, either.

02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:14.210
They are not slaves.

02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:19.480
Okay, so there are differences
between enslavement in Africa

02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:24.500
or in Asia and in America.

02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:33.820 position:56%
And in West Africa, this bondage was
more similar to servitude in Europe

02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:36.340
than to what was going on here.

02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:38.750 position:56%
And there were categories of slaves,

02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:43.760
those who could never be
sold, and those who could.

02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:49.260
So beyond saying just
people held slaves,

02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:56.220
there is a whole history behind
that that has also to be brought,

02:32:56.220 --> 02:33:01.730
because otherwise it
kind of gives a slant

02:33:01.730 --> 02:33:05.160
that kind of excuses everybody.

02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.460
"Well, you know, if
they held slaves,

02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:11.070
so after all if they became
slaves themselves, so what?"

02:33:22.700 --> 02:33:26.300
&gt;&gt; This morning I was earlier
at a competing conference

02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:29.060
over at the Capitol Hill
Club where they were --

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:33.240
the topic was immigration
and national security.

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:36.260
And I'm, yeah, hearing
very different messages

02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:38.320
over there from here.

02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:39.620
But I'm --

02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:40.920
&gt;&gt; Amir Al-Islam: I can imagine so.

02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:43.990
&gt;&gt; -- wondering now, one of the
speakers there talked about --

02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:46.010
I'm not sure where
he got the statistic,

02:33:46.010 --> 02:33:49.880
but if I heard him correctly,
he said only one in 10 Muslims

02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:54.660
in America -- in the united States
identifies more with America

02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:59.460
than with some specific
Islamic nation.

02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:02.830
And you know, I really sensed
that for the majority over there

02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:06.480
that was very problematic.

02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:12.640
And I'm wondering if any
of you would, you know,

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:15.260
want to try to give any kind
of explanation for that.

02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:20.660
You know, I'm wondering if there
is a certain security and comfort

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:25.760
with Islamic law, and even, you
know, what seems to me to be,

02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:29.510 position:56%
you know, oppression and
repression of people that, you know,

02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:31.950
may be identified as
Infidels, or you know,

02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:37.630
not faithful to Islamic
teaching or law?

02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:41.920
But you know, it seems like it --
the root of this country, you know,

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:48.400 position:56%
in -- with Christianity there is a
real sense of freedom, and you know,

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:53.080
on one hand may, you know,
allow something like immorality

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.380
in decadence which, I mean,

02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:56.570
I sense even these terrorists
were struggling with, you know,

02:34:56.570 --> 02:35:01.010
even just the night
before their act of terror.

02:35:01.010 --> 02:35:07.630
But on the other hand, you
know, maybe there's, you know,

02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:13.020
some reason that there's -- do
you think there is a comfort

02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:17.230
and security with this
as far as, you know,

02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:20.640
wanting the Islamic law
imposed upon everyone?

02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:30.570
&gt;&gt; Amir Al-Islam: Well, let me say
this -- let me respond to that.

02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:35.570
That's an excellent question, and
one that is extremely complex,

02:35:35.570 --> 02:35:37.320
and one that requires
a few conferences.

02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:42.210
This is probably part of the
discourse that will be --

02:35:42.210 --> 02:35:47.220
that we will be engaged in within
the next few years about the idea

02:35:47.220 --> 02:35:50.920
of Muslims, and Muslim
immigrants, and even Muslims

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.200
who are indigenous in this country.

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.030
And they -- and their challenge,
the issues around their loyalties

02:35:58.030 --> 02:36:02.850
and sense of patriotism around
and commitment to America.

02:36:02.850 --> 02:36:04.150
But let me draw this.

02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:06.110
I'm not -- I can't answer that
question, but let me put this

02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:09.070
in some kind of context and
frame it for you so that

02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:10.680
at least you can think about it,

02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.310
because it requires
some serious thinking.

02:36:14.310 --> 02:36:19.040
There is part of what we call
a kind of a mythologized notion

02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:26.120
of an America that also permeates
the minds of many American people.

02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:27.980
Yvonne Haddad talked about this.

02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:30.900 position:56%
And then -- and she alluded to this.

02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:38.850 position:56%
And that is this sense that makes us
believe that America stands for all

02:36:38.850 --> 02:36:44.710
of the wonderful qualities
of democracy, and equality,

02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:48.510 position:56%
and egalitarianism that is espouses.

02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:52.760
The reality is, I would say
from my own point of view --

02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:55.820
I'm not representing a community,
nor am Imam, and I'm not talking --

02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:58.000
speaking on behalf of all
the African American Muslims.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.740
Please don't quote me on that.

02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:05.750
The point is, for the most part
most Americans, in my own view,

02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:07.640
who are Judeo-Christians,

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:13.870
who are not Muslims basically
are decent, peace-loving people.

02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:21.600
And there is a small percentage
of policymakers and people

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:30.060
that influence policy based
upon a paradigm that has to do

02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:32.390
with strategic national interests.

02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:34.540
Now we can question that
strategic national interest,

02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.950
but having studied
international relations,

02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:39.000
we understand that policymakers
do also have the responsibility

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.190
of maintaining a sense
of security and stability

02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:44.340 position:56%
within the confines of this country.

02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:47.550
Just, for example, let
all of the Arab countries

02:37:47.550 --> 02:37:49.920
who sell oil stop selling oil.

02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:52.900
Tomorrow you will be angry,
as a Muslim in America,

02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:56.690
with Arabs because for the most
part you have to heat your house.

02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:58.930
You want to drive your car.

02:37:58.930 --> 02:38:02.230
So when you talk about the idea
of Muslims and their commitment

02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:06.130
to America in this society, in this
country, we're going -- we're --

02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:08.090
for the most part from what
I've done in my own research

02:38:08.090 --> 02:38:11.130
and my interviews with Muslims,
typically African Americans,

02:38:11.130 --> 02:38:13.320
I find that African Americans
for the most part who have come

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:16.400
out of this 1960s movement -- this
is probably the largest percentage

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:20.070
of African American Muslims --
well, probably their children are,

02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:22.640
but that generation of Muslims who
came through the '60s and those --

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.620
and that what we call that
period of the contemporary period

02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:29.450
from the '60s on -- have
had experiences in America

02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:34.690
that have subjected them to
COINTELPRO programs, oppression,

02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:38.260
racism, and assassinations.

02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:40.920
So we come from a bloody
history in terms

02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.350
of the way African
American/Muslims see America.

02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:49.890
However, if you have any American
or African American Muslim

02:38:49.890 --> 02:38:55.190
who is traveling abroad, the first
thing they actually flash is their

02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:56.490
American passport.

02:38:56.490 --> 02:38:58.810
It's like an American Express card.

02:38:58.810 --> 02:39:01.610
So there is a patriotism
that is there.

02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:03.040
We are Americans.

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:05.940
And I say to my immigrant brothers
and sisters when I am invited

02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:08.650
to speak to them, I am an
African American Muslim.

02:39:08.650 --> 02:39:12.630
My grandmother and
great-grandparents died

02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:16.210
and struggled to give us the
right to vote, for example.

02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:18.360
My great-grandmothers and
grandfathers fought in this country

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:19.800
to give us the rights that we have.

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:22.130
Yes, we are Americans.

02:39:22.130 --> 02:39:25.730
Now we do not embrace everything
that America has to offer

02:39:25.730 --> 02:39:27.030
in terms of its policies.

02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:30.730
We disagree with it policies, and
we have the freedom to be able

02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:34.780
to demonstrate our objection
to these policies based

02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:38.200
within the context of civil
society and democracy,

02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:39.500
which is a wonderful thing,

02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.720
and which in most cases
Muslim countries don't have.

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.590
So we're not in any denial
about that, although,

02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:48.950
I think some Muslims are in
denial about that reality.

02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:53.170
But now -- so let us make a
distinction between policymakers --

02:39:53.170 --> 02:39:54.670
and I don't want to
demonize policymakers,

02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:56.400
because they're critical.

02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.230 position:56%
But let us differentiate between the
people that make policy for America

02:39:59.230 --> 02:40:05.450
that impacts Muslims abroad and the
general populace of American people

02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:07.630
who basically are -- in many
instances are influenced

02:40:07.630 --> 02:40:10.640
and understand Islam by
virtue of the media and all

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:13.240
of its misrepresentations
and soundbites,

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:18.690
not necessarily always
negatively intentioned, however.

02:40:18.690 --> 02:40:20.570
So let us make a distinction
between that group

02:40:20.570 --> 02:40:24.090
and the American policymakers
and the --

02:40:24.090 --> 02:40:27.200
and let us not misread the
sentiments and the feelings

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:30.100
of the Muslims in this country,
because for the most part,

02:40:30.100 --> 02:40:32.110
if you talk to Muslims
in this country,

02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:35.200
the immigrant Muslim
population, they love America.

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.680
They have no delusions about
the fact that if they --

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:40.650
they're not ready to go back to
their countries, because they --

02:40:40.650 --> 02:40:43.380
what America has to offer
-- and I say this --

02:40:43.380 --> 02:40:45.620
and my nationalist friends
cringe at me saying this.

02:40:45.620 --> 02:40:47.150
And they'll probably see this
on the film and say, "Amir,

02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:50.500
what were you doing in
Library of Congress talking --

02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:52.550
praising America like this?"

02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:56.240
But as an old pan-Africanist,
and influenced

02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:58.340
by black nationalist
thought, and being an activist

02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:00.960
in the black community,
the reality is

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:05.390
that Muslims embrace the wonderful
opportunities that we have

02:41:05.390 --> 02:41:07.180
in this country, no question.

02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:09.190
And the -- and all the
Muslims that I know --

02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:11.840
the majority of Muslims are
not about to destroy this.

02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:13.140
Don't even think about it.

02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:14.610
This is the greatest
thing happening.

02:41:14.610 --> 02:41:16.610 position:56%
So why would you want to destroy it?

02:41:16.610 --> 02:41:21.300
So we have to really be clear,
finally, on making the distinction

02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:26.600
between the actual -- the
passion and the anger with Muslims

02:41:26.600 --> 02:41:29.640
who constantly see themselves
misrepresented in media,

02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:32.000
misrepresented in the press,
misrepresented in terms

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:35.220 position:56%
of the way people interpret them,
because others are interpreting them

02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:39.360
as opposed to them having voice of
their own to express themselves.

02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:41.150
So as the policyholders
over there --

02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:43.060
they wouldn't have a Muslim
over there explaining that.

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:46.200
Now they think they understand at
a policy meeting about the majority

02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:48.910
of Muslims of America and
have not done any research.

02:41:48.910 --> 02:41:53.370
But they have concluded that based
on their conclusions that nine --

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:57.450
one out of every 10 Muslims
really has no relationship

02:41:57.450 --> 02:41:58.900
or loyalty to the American country.

02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:00.200
They're here.

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:01.500
They're raising their kids here.

02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:02.800
And their kids are
going to stay here.

02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.100
The kids are Americans.

02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:05.630
We are Americans.

02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:10.370
Hyphenated, which represents an
identification that has to do

02:42:10.370 --> 02:42:11.670
with our cultural continuity.

02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:13.630
And we don't want to deny that.

02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:14.930
No one else does.

02:42:14.930 --> 02:42:17.760
No one else wants us to -- and
no one should want us to do that.

02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:19.060
But we are Americans.

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.360
But we have some serious issues

02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.560
about the way America
is dealing with Muslims.

02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.200
And we're going to do
everything we can to change,

02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:28.230
to make sure that the way they deal
with Muslims in the future is going

02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:30.360
to be one that's reflective

02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:33.150
of the great democracy
that America stands for.

02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:37.510
It's kind of long, but I'm sorry --

02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:53.230
[ Applause ]

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:54.530
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:57.780
I'm a social studies teacher,
and these are my students --

02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:03.200
some of my students that we've
brought from Clara Mohammed School.

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:07.790
And I wanted, as the Principal
wanted, an opportunity

02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:14.770
for our students to observe what
is going on in the real world

02:43:14.770 --> 02:43:19.060
and how they can make a
difference, inshallah, God willing,

02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:24.710
amongst those -- or because
we are, they are all American.

02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:26.450
They were born here.

02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:30.590
I had two comments
that I wanted to make.

02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:32.820
I don't really have a question.

02:43:32.820 --> 02:43:37.570
What I wanted to say real quickly
in response to the question

02:43:37.570 --> 02:43:43.610
that the lady back here had on
conquest, one of things I remember

02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:49.160
that Bishop Desmond Tutu
said about South Africa is --

02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:53.960
and this is in regard to
Christianity, "When the Dutch

02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:58.680
and the British came to
South Africa, or Anzania,

02:43:58.680 --> 02:44:01.500
they had the Bible, and the people

02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:05.270
in South Africa, Anzania,
had the land.

02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:09.970
Now they have the land
and the Africans,

02:44:09.970 --> 02:44:13.310 position:56%
the black Africans, have the Bible."

02:44:13.310 --> 02:44:15.650
Talk about conquest.

02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:20.280
I teach social studies, and I teach
history, and I teach geography,

02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:25.080
which is most important because I
know that many Americans, students

02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:31.980
and adults, have so little
knowledge about what country is

02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:37.710
in what continent, and actually
act like they don't care.

02:44:37.710 --> 02:44:42.980
Now we're on -- for U.S. History,
my eighth graders are dealing

02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:46.060
with religious tolerance right now.

02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:51.280
And somehow a lot of times
we have selective amnesia.

02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:53.360
When most of the people
came from Europe,

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:58.580
they came for religious reasons,
because they were not able

02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:04.690
to practice their religion the
way they wanted to in Europe.

02:45:04.690 --> 02:45:10.710
So I'm just giving to all of you a
reminder that this has been going

02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:15.940
on for a long time, way before
Europe, way before what's happening

02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:21.200
in Palestine and Israel, and
way before the United States,

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:23.960
or America, as it was named.

02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:28.140
So we need to read
and study history.

02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:29.470
And one of the things I know

02:45:29.470 --> 02:45:33.810
that we do not do well is we
don't read and we don't study.

02:45:33.810 --> 02:45:37.990
We need to get that together, and
perhaps maybe that will answer some

02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:41.510
of the problems that we're
having in this world.

02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:56.900
[ Applause ]

02:45:56.900 --> 02:46:03.360
&gt;&gt; [Speaking in foreign language]
I just had just one brief comment.

02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:07.090
As I said earlier that I was --
spent 20 years in the military.

02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:12.900
I'm a cardiovascular technologist,
and I deal with people one on one.

02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:15.570
And in the time that
I was in the military,

02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:17.340
most of the time I did
[speaking in foreign language].

02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:20.280
In other words, I propagated Islam.

02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:23.660
As it says in our religion,
there's no compulsion.

02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:27.020
Our only duty is to
deliver a clear message.

02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:31.990
But being honest -- I want to be
as completely honest as possible.

02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:36.510
In my travels and in my activities
in [speaking in foreign language],

02:46:36.510 --> 02:46:42.420
I found one consistent
response to Islam

02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:48.310
from a particular ethnic community.

02:46:48.310 --> 02:46:52.360
And I don't want to label
everyone this way, but the majority

02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:57.260
of Caucasian, people
of European decent,

02:46:57.260 --> 02:47:02.670
the response has been very
condescending toward the Islam.

02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:05.460
This is well before 9/11.

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:11.300
And I've given opportunity to say
extracts from Quran as Allah says

02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:16.740
in Quran, "Do they not consider
the Quran if it had been from other

02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:21.090
than God, they would have found
many discrepancies in it."

02:47:21.090 --> 02:47:24.350
That's an open invitation
to let's debate it.

02:47:24.350 --> 02:47:28.270
If -- let's come out
in the light of day.

02:47:28.270 --> 02:47:35.270
If your God is the God of
technology, of science,

02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:40.260
of information, let's
debate the issue.

02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:46.030
So the -- it still to me seems
like there's not a willingness

02:47:46.030 --> 02:47:53.820
on the part of Caucasians to
want to redress wrong, justice.

02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:57.710
I think Durban, South
Africa was an opportunity,

02:47:57.710 --> 02:48:01.240
but I think a clear message
was sent to the world.

02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:05.320
So I don't think the world
has been completely shut,

02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:10.960
but if you do shut the door,
Almighty God, he is slow in anger.

02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:14.610
But let there be no doubt
that judgment doesn't come

02:48:14.610 --> 02:48:18.690
from human beings, that there
is someone who is in control.

02:48:18.690 --> 02:48:21.880
And let us seek to
understand one another.

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:24.130
And that's my only comment.

02:48:24.130 --> 02:48:26.970
And if someone wants --
on the panel would want

02:48:26.970 --> 02:48:30.710
to maybe make any comment,
I'd greatly appreciate it.

02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:32.510
Thank you for your time.

02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:44.410
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:48:44.410 --> 02:48:45.840
&gt;&gt; Prosser Gifford: -- all morning.

02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:48.700 position:56%
It will be available on the website.

02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:51.200
Not instantly, but soon.

02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:59.370
And it will join the other
morning colloquia that we've had

02:48:59.370 --> 02:49:01.020
on various aspects of Islam.

02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:06.050
It can be found by going to the
Library of Congress homepage

02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:07.350
and looking at the
library [inaudible],

02:49:07.350 --> 02:49:12.510
and you will get a dropdown
menu of the sessions on Islam.

02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:15.670
So in conclusion, let's
thank the panelists,

02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:18.970
one in absentia on this panel.

02:49:18.970 --> 02:49:23.510
And thank you all for being with us
patiently all morning [applause].
