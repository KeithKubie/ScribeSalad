00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
&gt;&gt; Product in Google Apps.
&gt;&gt; NICHOLS: Great. Thanks, David. Appreciate

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.190
the introduction. My name's Ryan. I'm from
Appirio, a cloud solution provider working

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.740
with Google on bringing these Gmail contextual
gadgets to the enterprise. So if we switch

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.730
to the demo, I'm going to show you what it's
like to run your entire enterprise in the

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.369
cloud. That's not just what we do, uh, for
our customers at Appirio, it's how we run

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.670
our own business. And now with Gmail contextual
gadgets, in a new product called PS Connect

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:41.280
from Appirio, I can do that all from Google
Apps. This is the best integrated app in the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.290
Marketplace. So I manage a team of consultants
at Appirio. Uh, I need some serious Enterprise

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.000
applications in order to keep tabs on my people,
my projects, my customers, my financials and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.970
I do all of that in the cloud. Here are my
operational applications. You see that I use,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.640
um, salesforce.com to manage my leads and
my opportunities. You see that I use, uh,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.850
PS Enterprise. It's a force.com-based application
to manage my people and my projects. There

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.920
is a lot of data in all of these Enterprise
applications. But, of course, this isn't really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.580
where I run my business on a day-to-day business--uh,
day-to-day basis. This is--my Google Apps

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.370
inbox. I mean, this is where I make dozens
of decisions every day that impact every part

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.020
of my--my, uh, my operations. But I make these
decisions without having access to all the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.729
business data that's in all those other business
applications. What if I could use Google Apps

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.380
as the front-end to those operational applications?
Well, now with Gmail contextual gadgets and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.490
PS Connect, I can do exactly that. Let me
show you how it works. When I go into my inbox

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.210
in the morning, first thing I do is hone in
on emails from customers. Here's an email

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.450
from a customer of mine. Looks like he wants
to grab lunch. Now, normally, I might not

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.130
prioritize responding to this particular email.
Doesn't seem urgent. I certainly wouldn't

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.840
go and look up Carl Customer in our CRM Database
to find out what's going on with that account.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.439
That's just not what I'm doing right now.
I'm doing my email. But that would be a mistake.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.690
Look at the bottom of this email. You see
something new. It's called PS Connect. It's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.719
a contextual gadget that's taken this email--who
it's from, who it's to, what it's about--and

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.579
gone and fetched the information from all
those different systems that I need to make

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.469
the right decision about how to reply to this
message. So I see that Carl Customer actually

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.049
has five opportunities open with us right
now. One of those opportunities--this office

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.190
relocation service--is actually on hold until
the New York office move has been finalized

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.919
at the customer. Well, guess what? I just
learned in the email that the New York office

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:46.469
move has been finalized. This is great news.
Now I can take action on that insight right

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:52.150
from Google Apps. I can change the stage of
this opportunity, and qualify it, and say

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.099
"This is now qualified because the office
move's been finalized." I can add this email

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.841
to my CRM system so that the entire account
team is up to speed on what's going on in

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:05.730
this account. Normally, I wouldn't have done
either of these things until the night before

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.480
our weekly sales call. But it's not just CRM.
PS Connect also exposes capabilities from

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.849
my transactional applications. You see this
button down here "New Resource Request." This

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.451
is functionality in our PS Enterprise product
that allows me to give my staffing team a

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:24.139
heads up. But I'm gonna need a little bit
of support from an analyst next week to help

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.200
me prepare for this customer lunch. Again,
normally, I wouldn't do this until our weekly

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.730
staffing call. But now I can trigger a set
of actions across my organization as I'm going

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.700
through my email in sales and now in staffing.
And because I've taken those actions, I can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.120
now reply to this customer with an appropriate
degree of urgency. Right? I can tell him "Sounds

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.799
great. Let's meet next week." This is more
than just saving me clicks. This is actually

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.730
helping me make a different decision about
how to respond to my emails as I go through

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.159
my day. So far, so good. Let's see what's
next in my email inbox. This email doesn't

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.379
look like it's such good news. It's from a
customer who seems to be a little upset about

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.319
the status of their project. Now, normally,
this would trigger a flurry of activity across

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.239
my organization. "Whose project is this? What's
the status? What's the plan to get these guys

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.729
back on track? A lot of that data is actually
in my PS Enterprise application, but PS Connect

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.759
can bring that to my attention in the context
of the email. You see that we actually have

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.419
three projects open with this customer right
now. Looks like this development project is

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.490
the one that's giving me trouble. I have the
status and a note from the project manager

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.199
right here. We're going to remain behind schedule
until we're able to extend the engagement

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.210
of it--uh, the architect. I also have data
that PS Connect has brought to help me decide

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.630
whether extending that engagement is a good
business move. I see that while a couple of

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.250
our projects are out of budget or over budget,
this project actually has some extra budget

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.250
associated with it. So, um, maybe I can extend
the team. Well, I'm right here in Google Apps.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.900
I can go ahead and, uh, and--and chat with
our staffer here and say, you know, "Can I,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.949
uh, can I extend Acme?" If he says yes, then
I can go ahead and take action on this, right?

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.680
I can go ahead right in the context of Google
Apps, bring up, like, another piece of PS

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.720
Enterprise functionality. This time, it's
my project planner. This is a view of all

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.340
the projects that I have open at this account
where I can drill in. I can take a look at

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.440
this Acme Development account, and all the
people assigned to it, and take a look at

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.699
our architect here, his schedule, and right
in the context of my, uh, uh, of my email,

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.070
extend his engagement. I can update the schedule,
go back to this email, and again, reply right

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.220
away. I've not just saved clicks going from
one tab to another, I've made a different

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.710
decision. The team is extended. Customer will
be thrilled to hear this. So you can see that

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.780
things are a little different when you run
your entire business in the cloud. You are

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.530
able to bring together context for multiple
different business applications and use them

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.439
right in the context of your day-to-day work.
Thanks to Gmail contextual gadgets and Appirio

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:14.310
PS Connect. PS Connect is, uh, in Beta right
now with some of, uh, the customers of Appirio

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:25.089
PS Enterprise. You can learn more at appirio.com
or in the Google Marketplace. Thanks. [pause]

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:29.409
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ryan. You just saw some of the--the
deeper integration that's possible as we keep

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.430
adding more and more extensions into Google
Apps--more places for more--more of you as

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.009
developers to have your apps add more great
functionality into Google Apps. This list

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.979
of extension points is gonna keep growing
over time with suggestions from you all. We're

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.490
looking forward to seeing all the great ideas
that--that you come up with to take advantage

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.840
of this. So let me recap what you've seen
tonight. We walked you through the three steps

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.480
that it takes to have you as a company--as
a developer-- take part in the Google Apps

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.600
Marketplace. First step: build your applications.
Take a-- have an idea. Build an application

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.289
that does something useful for your business
customers in the cloud. Second step, integrate.

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.259
Take advantage of as few or as many of the
points of integration that are available in

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.849
Google Apps to solve your bus--your applications'
needs. To do what makes sense for your customers,

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:23.219
your use cases, on how they integrate with
Google Apps. And then third, once you've built

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:28.610
your integration and tell Google about it,
in the--in the Marketplace, list your application

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:34.449
and start reaching out to new customers. Start
doing business. Start making money selling

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.849
apps to your customers in the cloud who are
our customers in the cloud, working together

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:45.639
to make the world of Google Apps bigger and
have more capabilities for more users. Talking

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.319
about customers, talking about the business
opportunity, I'd like to bring up Dave Girouard,

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.940
the President of our Google Enterprise Division
who's been leading Google forward as we do

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.819
that up into the right growth of Google Apps.
And--and--and is working with all of us. And

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:02.349
is looking forward to working with all of
you to do the same with the Google Apps Marketplace.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.860
Dave.
&gt;&gt; GIROUARD: Thank you. Thanks, Dave. Good

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.911
to be here. I'll be brief. I have neither
slides nor demos. Um, but you've--maybe you've

00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:16.530
seen enough of those. I-I just want to, uh,
say a few words. When I joined Google several

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:22.750
years ago, uh, not only was there no Google
Apps, there was no apps. Um, Gmail launched

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.319
as a product on April Fools' Day in 2004 soon
after I joined. And, uh, that was our very,

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.770
uh, controversial launch into our apps business.
Um, it was really--it's really been about

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.919
three years. And I should say, by the way,
I-I joined to lead our enterprise initiative--which

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.000
is really a unique thing for Google and I
think a thing that a lot of people don't understand

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.620
that well--uh, really with the goal of taking
innovation that happens typically very quickly

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.390
on the consumer side in a way that is very
focused on the end user experience and delivering

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.840
that in a business context to small businesses,
large businesses, cities, towns, governments,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.151
schools. Um, really trying to take the best
of both worlds--the innovation and the user

00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:05.780
centricity you find in the consumer world,
but then also layering in the things that

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.090
businesses, and schools, and others care about,
which is security, manageability, cost, et

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.141
cetera. And this cloud computing thing seems
to be the right formula to do just that. So,

00:09:15.141 --> 00:09:20.200
uh, we started about three years ago--as most
of you that are here today probably know--

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.640
um, with a very modest effort. And, uh, in
the first week, Google Apps signed up 9,000

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.910
businesses, uh, in--in, uh, February of 2007.
So we--we kind of knew we were on to something

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.310
and it has grown really quickly since then.
Um, as you heard earlier from Vick, we now

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.670
have 25 million active users of Google Apps,
uh, across businesses and schools. Uh, we

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.100
have more than 2 million businesses. And the
growth rate has accelerated. There's about

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.230
a 300% increase in the sign-up rate, um, for
our premier products just in the last year.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.500
So we are in a fairly dramatic acceleration
period. We've also done a lot of things I

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.670
think are pretty compelling. The higher education
market, which is never, you know, known as

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.160
really the--the aggressive, first adopters
of technology, has really moved to the cloud

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.950
wholesale. We've bec--
