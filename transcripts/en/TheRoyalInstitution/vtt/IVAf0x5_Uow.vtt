00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.000
So have a look at the clip of this video
here. This is an animation but see if you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.660
can think about it in another way.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.500
There we go.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.240
So given the choice which you 
think is the more friendly object?

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.200
Hands up for green.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.100
Hands up for yellow square.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.820
It's amazing really! It's just an animation yet we 
think of these things as having personalities.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.040
In fact babies when they watched this were
given the choice between a square and a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
triangle and when they saw the square
being helpful they prefer to play with

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.780
the square object. So these babies are interpreting
them and giving them rich personalities.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.570
From the very beginning we
see the world as populated with others

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
who are acting with goals and intentions.
We even apply that reasoning to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.680
inanimate objects. I mean do you ever
speak to your toys or if you have a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.660
computer do you get frustrated and shout
at it when it crashes?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.960
You say "Don't crash! I haven't saved my homework!"

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.869
You know this is exactly what we do we give

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.170
inanimate objects these qualities to
make it easier to interact with them.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
It's another way that our brain is
making assumptions about the world and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.090
adding extra information. 
Movement provides not only a rich source of what

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.280
someone is like but a channel of
communication where no words are exchanged.
