00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
&gt;&gt; The question today is: What one thing do
you think that

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.350
countries, companies, or individuals must
do to make the world a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.570
better place in 2008?

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.800
&gt;&gt; Well, I think they should concentrate on
the neglected areas of

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.330
the world which, uh, do not get the attention
they should have ranging

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:24.710
from, let us say, Darfur, to, uh, the Horn
of Africa to, uh, points of

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.160
the subcontinent which are outside the mainstream,
the made trade

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.170
link -- the made trade link of information
of our policy because they

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.609
don't seem to be beneficial at this moment
but they have a way of

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:46.370
eventually imposing themselves on consciousness
through things that

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.549
happen that affect many people.
So therefore I think a sur -- a careful survey

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:59.449
to pick out -- the
hardest and most urgently which must be done

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.519
which are crucial and
obvious but that's the problem.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:10.399
It's too hard and therefore the great exercise
we need to say what are

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.169
the most urgent and neglected places we should
help?

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:19.320
&gt;&gt; But don't you think mass media and wide
exposures is one step

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.859
actually to address the problem?
So we need to get the neglected issues out

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:24.859
into the mainstream?

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:30.210
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the mass media tends to follow
events rather than

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.369
lead them.
It's very unusual that they take the lead

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.650
and send people to places
that are so remote enough and not particularly

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.310
in the major focus and
the media tend to follow the great divine

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.409
and the public gesture of
the world leaders and the world leaders have

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.220
great power in that
sense.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.909
&gt;&gt; Anything else that you would like to add?

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.319
&gt;&gt; No.
That's the thought -- one little thought for

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.799
[unintelligible]
