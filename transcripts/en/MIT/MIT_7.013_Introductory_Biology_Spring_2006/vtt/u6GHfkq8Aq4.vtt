00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
end of last lecture I got an interesting question about apoptosis  

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which I covered very briefly towards the end of that lecture.  And the  

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
question was this:  Do healthy cells tell sick cells to die?  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Or in turn, do sick cells tell healthy cells to die?  

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, is there some kind of communication between cells as to  

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
who is healthy and who is not healthy?  For those of you who are  

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
just coming in, there is a handout outside,  

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and up front, it's the same thing. And that's actually a very  

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
interesting question because they really does seem, in the body, to be  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
some sense of monitoring whether cells are healthy or not.  

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now, a lot of the time, cells that are not healthy  

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
intrinsically activate their own death program,  

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
or they have the ability, they gain the ability to respond to  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
some kind of extrinsic signals.  And in fact, signals could be sent both  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
ways, we believe, where sick cells will tell healthy  

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
cells to die under conditions that are obviously not favorable to the  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
organism, but more important, that healthy cells can tell sick  

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
cells not to survive. So, the balance of apoptosis and  

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
cell survival is a very delicate one and regulated by many,  

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
many things.  So, it's a good question.  All right,  

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we move on.  We move on to a new module.  So, you have, in fact, covered  

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the foundations of modern biology. You've covered them in a very  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
superficial way.  And I want to emphasize that.  You should,  

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
by now, know how to take a piece of DNA, conceptually turn it into RNA,  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and conceptually turn that into a protein.  You should know what to do  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
if the DNA sequence is changed.  You should have the expectation that the  

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
RNA and protein that are made from it will be changed,  

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
too, and you should have various other nuggets of information that  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
are covered by foundations. These foundations are not going to  

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
go away.  We're going to use them throughout the rest of these  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
uncovered black boxes.  And I'm going to assume that you  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
remember a bunch of stuff as I go through the material in the next  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
several lectures.  But we are going to move in to the  

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
formation module.  And today, we are going to talk about  

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
things in a kind of overview way. And I'm going to tell you five  

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
major things that are important. And I'm going to write them on the  

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
board, and some of the things they need to know about them.  And  

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
we will use the slides as well.  So, what is formation?  What is this  

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
module all about? Well, it's about something called  

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
"development," where development is the process by which one cell,  

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the fertilized egg or the zygote goes on to make a multi-cellular and  

00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:00.000
complex organism.   

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is not about squishy little embryos.  OK, this is about life as  

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it began, as it continues in your own bodies.    

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And it has immense applications for multiple biomedical and  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
bioengineering processes that I'll talk about as we go through.  The  

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
first thing you need to know is what's written up here is that the  

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
development occurs over time and space.  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And that's one of the things that makes it an incredibly complex set  

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of processes to think about.  The overtime can be a long time.  And  

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
what's important to understand is that developmental processes occur  

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
throughout life. Initially, in the formation of the  

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
organism from a single cell, the fertilized egg, the zygote,  

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and later on, early in the formation of the embryo,  

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and later, in the renewal of the adult.  

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And this is where the stem cells come in.  And  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
we'll have a lecture on stem cells later on.  But  

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
development is something that occurs throughout life.  And  

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in fact, I teach an upper-class course on development to graduate  

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
students.  And the first thing I tell them when I  

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
start to teach them is really there is no such subject as developmental  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
biology because it covers, it includes, it encompasses  

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, protein structure,  

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and many different disciplines. And it occurs throughout life.  So,  

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
it really covers everything.  But we have put these things together in  

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the formation module, and I think you will find them  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
interesting.  OK, so here's a schematic of how things  

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
work courtesy of Picasso.  And really, this whole process is quite  

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
remarkable.  It starts with two dying cells.  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The egg and the sperm, haploid cells that have a half-life  

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that have a life of about 12 hours up to which they are dead.  But  

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
when they fuse, there's magic that happens, and you get a viable cell,  

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the zygote, that has the capacity to go on and divide many,  

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
many times to form an embryo and ultimately an adult organism.  And  

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
as we've mentioned many times, it is estimated that there are about ten  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to the 14th cells in the human. In the adults,  

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and even in young adults, there is much replacement of cells  

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
throughout life.  And this whole process obviously takes place over  

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
time.  But that's important because the time component means that things  

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
change over time.  And in order to understand this entire  

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
slide, you have to factor in this fourth dimension.  

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, what are some of the things that we're going to cover in this module,  

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and why are we bothering to talk to you about the subject?  

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Well, one of the things that's of interest is the effect of chemicals  

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
on the formation of a normal body. So, there are these things called  

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
teratogens, which are chemicals that affect formation of early steps in  

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
development of the embryo.  This is a famous one, the effects of a  

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
famous one called thalidomide that was given as an anti-nausea  

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
medication during pregnancy some decades ago.  

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It has no effect on rodents on which it was tested,  

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but it was not tested on primates before you give it to people,  

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and it has the devastating effect of preventing limb formation,  

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and a number of people were born in the late 1940s,  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
early 1950s, who lacked limbs because of the effect of  

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
thalidomide.  And I have to tell you,  

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
this is very interesting for those of you who are interested in  

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
chemistry.  Thalidomide has a pretty simple chemical structure.  It has  

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
been studied for many, many decades. It's a very interesting drug because  

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
it turns out it prevents cachexia, which is the wasting that occurs  

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
with many disorders including HIV-AIDS infection.  So,  

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
thalidomide is a very, very useful drug.  It has a simple chemical  

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
structure.  It's been studied for decades, and we do not know its  

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
mechanism of action.  OK, here's another one that you might be  

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
familiar with, the drug, not the syndrome, I hope.  

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So, fetal alcohol syndrome, so, a normal brain, this is a brain  

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
taken from a fetus.  That is the late stage gestation human whose  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
mother drink excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.  So,  

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
during the early stages of pregnancy the first few months,  

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
alcohol is devastating to formation of the brain and also to the bones  

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of the face.  And even a reasonable number of drinks,  

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
apparently, just a few can significantly lower the IQ points of  

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
a baby.  And so, it's a good reason not to drink if  

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
you're pregnant. This was a very devastating case.  

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You can see the brain is very smooth.  It doesn't have those nice  

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
valleys and hills, the sulci and the gyri,  

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that the normal brain has, and this fetus would not have been able to  

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
survive.  Here's one.  This is the dream of all biologists,  

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
developmental or otherwise. It's a dream of bioengineers.  It's  

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
probably the dream of everybody. Someone cuts off their arm in an  

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
accident: can we grow a new one? Well, newts can.  So, in this  

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
example, newts can.  So, in this example, the newt limb,  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
this poor animal was amputated just above the elbow.  But over a period  

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
of a few months, another limb grew back,  

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
smaller than the original but perfectly functional.  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
We can't do that. How do newts do it,  

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and how could we use that information to help people grow new  

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
limbs, or new hearts, or new eyes?  Fish, for example,  

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the fisheye work on zebrafish can grow a new heart.  You can cut the  

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
heart into two.  Take away half of it.  It'll regenerate a new heart.  

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There are animals were you can remove half of the retina or all of  

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the retina, and it will regenerate a new retina.  We do some  

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
regeneration.  You can take away two thirds of the liver, and new  

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
liver will grow back. And that's one of the principles  

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
behind liver transplants.  But we can't do things like regenerate  

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
eyes, and hearts, and limbs.  It's been the focus of  

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
study for a long time to try to figure out how newts do it,  

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and to ask whether we can capitalize on that knowledge.  And  

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I have to tell you, it's been a very tough area of biology,  

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
still wide open.  And that's where the great god of stem cells comes  

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in.  Because it's been so difficult to get limb regeneration,  

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for example, and heart regeneration, there is a sense that perhaps we  

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
could get groups of cells to repair damaged organs.  

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And stem cells are the things that hold this promise.  And  

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
we'll have a whole lecture on this later.  And part and parcel of stem  

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
cells is the very newsworthy issue of human cloning,  

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
making identical replicas of things. And we'll talk about this also in  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
a separate lecture. OK, all right,  

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
so let's move on to the next set of things that you need to know.  And  

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that's the notion that there are multiple processes that are involved  

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in setting up development formation of any multi-cellular organism.  

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So, multiple processes are involved. And these are cell division,  

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
right, a single cell, so, ten to the 14th cells.  You figure out how many  

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
rounds of cell division at us. Actually, that's a tough question.  

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You could go and do that, OK, and over spring break if you're  

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
lying on the beach or hanging out on a mountain, if you can find any snow  

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
you can go and figure out how many cell divisions it takes to get ten  

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to the 14th cells. But it's not so easy because cells  

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
don't just divide from one to ten to the 14th.  As they are dividing,  

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
there's a balance of cell division, and as we talked about last lecture,  

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
of cell death.  OK, so cell division versus cell death,  

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and so I can't tell you how many divisions that takes because there  

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
are a lot of cells that die along the way to those ten  

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
to the 14th cells. Here's another one: cell type.  

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
What's cell type? Different kinds of cells in the  

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
body, we mentioned this right at the beginning of the course.  Skin cells,  

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
cells that produce the hair, nerve cells, red blood cells,  

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and so on.  There are probably 500 different cell types,  

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and these each have specific functions.  And  

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the definition of a cell type really is a group of cells with  

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
a particular function. Something else that's interesting  

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
about turning that single cell into a multi-cellular organism is the  

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
notion of position.  So, if you look at yourself in the  

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
mirror with all your imperfections, you likely have your arms coming out  

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of your shoulders, and your head coming up above your  

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
shoulders also.  Something has made the decision to put those parts of  

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
your body in their correct place. And that system is a set of  

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
positional information.  It's kind of like a map.  And as you're going  

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
from a single cell to a multi-cellular organism,  

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
there is a set of molecular information that really puts the  

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
coordinates on a map just as it you had a blank map of the world and you  

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
put on the Cartesian coordinates. So you would do that to the  

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
developing embryo.  So, there's something called positional  

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
information, and the final thing is three-dimensional structure.  

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And we'll have a whole lecture on 3-D structure.  But  

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
suffice to say for now, cells do not work as single  

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
entities.  The blood subsystem, the hematopoietic system, is the  

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
only real example in the body of cells working as single systems.  

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And even there, they don't really.  In all cases,  

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
cells group together to form tissues, and is tissues grouped together  

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to form organs. And the precise three-dimensional  

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
structure by which they form is really important.  So,  

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
here are some examples.  I'm going to show you a movie of some stages  

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
of human development.  This is taken from material collected a long time  

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
ago.  And what I want you to see is that over a period of a few weeks  

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
how the sides of the embryo changes due to cell division.  OK, so --  

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So these are all taken at the same  

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
magnification.  And you can see that as time progresses,  

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the size of the embryo changes, and this was all due to cell  

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
division.  You can see that shape changes as well,  

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and this is due to various processes including modeling through cell  

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
death.  One of the interesting things about this,  

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and this will be on your website. You can look at it.  

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
One of the interesting things about this is that early human embryos  

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
have a tail.  So, you had a tail, a really pretty good  

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
tail until you were about 56 days old.  And then,  

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
it disappeared.  And in these early embryos,  

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
if you go back and look at this again, you will see the embryo has a  

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
tail.  So, this is a manifestation over the tremendous change in size  

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
of a human embryo caused by changes in the number of cells.  This cell  

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
death, duck feet, chicken feet, chicken feet are not  

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
web. Duck feet are webbed.  They start  

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
off looking almost identical.  And the difference is that between the  

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
digits, between the fingers or the toes, the cells die in the case of  

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the chicken, and they do not die in the case of the duck.  And  

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
if you go back and look at this, you will see that there are little  

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
dots between the digits of the chick, and not the digits of the duck,  

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and those are the cells dying.  So, there is a controlled process of  

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
cell death that's very important. Tissues, cell type,  

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
this is really one of the most extraordinary examples in the body  

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
of different cell types, and different cell types working  

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
together to a common function.  This is a diagram of the retina that I  

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
took from your book, and it exemplifies two things: one,  

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
a bunch of different cell types. These are all nerve cells that are  

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
in the retina, and they are nerve cells that in  

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
various ways, either sense light or transmit the signal of the light  

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
once the light has been sensed to other nerve cells.  

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
You can see, firstly, there are these different cell types,  

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and you can see secondly, represented by colors, you can see  

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that they're organized in layers. There is a very precise and very  

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
important layering of cell types in the retina.  If you disrupt that  

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
layering, the retina doesn't work. And in many cases of retinal  

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
degeneration, the retina doesn't work because the cells have,  

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
the layering has been disorganized, and the cells can't make the proper  

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
contacts with one another. Position: we talk about axes in the  

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
animal, and in the adult as well. We talk about an anterior,  

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
posterior axis, which is the set of organs from the head to the tail.  

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
We talk about a dorsal, ventral axis from the back of the  

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
animal to the belly.  And we talk about a left-right axis from  

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
the left to the right.  So, if you look at yourself in a mirror  

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
again, you'll look pretty symmetric. If you were to peel back your body  

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
wall and look at your organs inside, you will see that you are not  

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
symmetric at all.  You have an asymmetry along your left-right  

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
axis.  OK, so you will need to know these terms: anterior,  

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
posterior, dorsal, ventral, and left-right is easy.  And  

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
finally, here's three dimensional structure.  Here is the heart.  

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
The heart is a muscle.  It's actually got several different cell  

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
types.  But it is mostly muscle where the muscle is arrayed in  

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
various, precise, organization.  And  

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
it's this precise organization of the cells that allows the heart to  

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
pump.  How do you get this organization?  We'll talk about that  

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
later on in the course.  Can you regenerate this organization either  

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
artificially, or in some kind of tissue culture system?  

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Very tough to do, and as you may know, there is no good artificial  

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
heart out there right now. This is a great thing for some of  

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
you to think about for your future careers.  It's wide open.  Are there  

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
circumstances where we could regenerate a human heart in a test  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
tube or in a large test tube on a Petri plate, for example?  

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
It would have to be a very large test tube, right,  

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
a box, a test box? I don't think so.  I think that is  

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
really going to be very, very tough to do, and I think we  

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
have to think more carefully about how we are going to repair  

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
damaged hearts. Again, we'll talk more about this.  

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So, what I'm going to do now is to show you a movie of the development  

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
of an early fish embryo.  The kind of fish is called a zebra fish.  I  

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
work on these in my laboratory.  I have about 10,  

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
00 of them there, and I'm going to use them.  Yes,  

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I have 10,000 fish.  If you want to come and visit my laboratory and see  

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
my fish, you can.  It's a fantastic model system.  

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And I'm going to use this movie and this embryo to show you something  

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
about the sequence of events that take place during development.  I  

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
want you to look for cell division, and I want you to look for  

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
structural changes as you watch the movie.  Let's look at the movie  

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
again without the music.  And let me show you what you're looking at.  So,  

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
to zebra fish, like the chicken,  

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
and actually almost like the human develops as a disk of cells,  

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
or from a little disk of cells. I'll show this to you again when it  

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
starts again, that sits on top of a yolk cell.  Chickens have got a yolk  

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
cell.  That's the yolk of egg. Humans don't.  But otherwise things  

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
are very similar.  Let me try to start that.  OK,  

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
good.  So, we're going to look at this again.  Here is the yolk cell.  

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
This big round ball here is the so-called yolk cell,  

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
and that's going to be the food of the embryo.  These two bumps  

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
on top are two cells. This is a two cell stage embryo.  

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And as you watch the movie for the last time, and I'll post it on your  

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
website so you can watch it as much as you want, you'll see these two  

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
cells divide into four cells, and eight cells, and 16 cells,  

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
and so on, until they've made a little dome of cells sitting on top  

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
of the yolk cell.  And then, at that point, suddenly at some  

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
point, and this is very interesting. That group of cells realizes that  

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
there's enough of them, and they start to move.  And they  

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
spread out to cover the whole yolk cell.  

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
And as they do this, a bunch of them also move to the  

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
right hand side of the board.  And if you watch, you could see stuff  

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
happening.  And at the end of the movie,  

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
you could see something that might have been somewhat recognizable to  

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
you as a developing little animal in that it had an eye,  

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
and I'll point this out, and it had a tail.  So, let's watch  

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
it again and I'll stop it at various points, and I will point out stuff.  

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Where did my mouse go? There it is.  OK, so here's the  

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
cell division.  Cells are dividing. They are dividing,  

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
they're dividing, they're dividing, and making this little dome on top  

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
of the embryo on top of the yolk. So, this little group of cells is  

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
going to give rise to the whole fish.  And although humans don't  

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
have a yolk cell like this, human embryos look very similar.  

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
And now, this group of cells is going to spread out.  You will see a  

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
kind of haze spreading out over this yolk cell.  

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
That's the cells moving.  There they go.  They're moving,  

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
moving, moving, moving, moving down.  And at the same time,  

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
a bunch of them are moving to the side of the embryo.  And as you  

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
watch, take a look.  Here is the high.  This oval is the eye and the  

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
brain is going to develop up here. And watch these little shiver and  

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
shaky things on the side as well. Those are the developing muscles.  

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
OK, and so, there it goes, a lot of shape forming.  

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And we are going to move on from there.  OK, so go and take a look at  

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
this at your leisure.  We are going to talk about some of those  

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
processes again.  So, let's move on to the next point that  

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
we need to deal with, and that is a point that I've called  

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
here cell fate requires differential gene expression.  But  

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I'm going to state it more simply on the boards, which are  

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.000
now not responsive.   

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
OK, here's an easy way to state this.  Genes control development.  

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 OK, well, that doesn't sound so  

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
surprising.  Genes control everything as far as you've been  

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
told, but let's talk about that in a bit more detail.  And  

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
there are three things you should know about this.  Firstly,  

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
the function of a cell depends on the specific proteins present.  

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:15.000
So, cell function depends on specific proteins.  

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Second thing: all cells contain the  

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
same genes or the same set of genes --  

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And the third thing is that only  

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
some of those genes are used in each cell type.  

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And I'm going to use the term  

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
expressed, which we've encountered before.  Only some genes are  

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000
expressed in each cell type. And I'm also going to introduce to  

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
you a term called fate where the term is similarly used to the  

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
English term fate, but not quite, where fate and  

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
development refers to the final form and function of a cell.  

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 All right, so let's see what we  

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
have.  Here's something we've seen before, this kind of tiresome  

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
diagram that's useful and that should be really familiar to you,  

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
the passage of information from DNA through an RNA intermediate to a  

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
protein product.  And the formation of the final product  

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
from the gene is termed gene expression.  Cell types are  

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
different because they make different proteins.  We've talked  

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
about these three cell types previously.  

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Erythrocytes are so because they're making globin,  

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
which carries oxygen around the body.  Neurons are making proteins,  

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
which send out the filaments, and chemicals that allow nerves to  

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
communicate with each other and so on.  Number 15 on your hand out,  

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
the first slide on your handout, you need to know this really,  

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
really clearly.  This is important.   

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And part of the deal here is something I'm going to write on the  

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
board, firstly, that in any process of figuring out  

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
what a cell is going to become, there are multiple steps to a final  

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
fate.  It doesn't just happen at once.  

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And secondly, I want to make the distinction between regulatory genes  

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and differentiation genes --   

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
-- where regulatory genes, we can rephrase this, control cell  

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
fate, and differentiation genes affect cell fate.  

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
They carry out cell fate.  And here is a litany that I've written  

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
out for you that is important that you know.  In the life of a cell,  

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
as it's deciding what to become, it goes through multiple stages.  It  

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
starts off not knowing what it's going to become,  

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
and we call those uncommitted cells. Kind of like you when you came to  

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
MIT, you were uncommitted and perhaps still are as to what you're  

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
going to do next. But over time,  

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
through the passage of time, you get various inputs and you  

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
decide what you are going to become either as a cell or as an MIT  

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
student.  And at that point, you are called committed or  

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
determined.  That's the jargon.  You need to know it.  It's very  

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
important.  Committed or determined cells have made the decision what to  

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
be.  But they haven't gone on and become the final thing that  

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
they're going to be. So, maybe you are premed,  

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
and by now you have committed to being premed.  So,  

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
you are different than when you came in here, but you certainly are not a  

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
qualified physician at this point. In order to do that,  

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
you're going to have to go through another bunch of steps and find your  

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
final form.  You're going to have to differentiate into a physician or  

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
into a cell type.  So, this uncommitted-committed  

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
differentiated litany triad is something we're going to talk  

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
about over and over. It's going to come up throughout the  

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
course probably in most of the lectures that both I and Professor  

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Jacks will give you.  During this passage, and you've got the slide,  

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
this is the slide you actually have, is two sets of genes are activated,  

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
regulatory genes and differentiation genes.  As the uncommitted cells  

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
decide what they're going to be, regulatory genes are activated.  

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
As the committed cells go on to read out the final thing,  

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
their final function, the activation of differentiation  

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
genes takes place.  So, how does it work?  How does a cell  

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
decide what to become, and how do different cells decide to  

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
become different things? Well, this is the way I think about  

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
this.  This isn't the way your book thinks about it,  

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
but this is the way I think about it.  I think that there is a  

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
combinatorial regulatory code that controls cell type.  

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And so, let's have an example of the three cell types I've talked about  

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
before, your erythrocyte neuron and sperm.  And let's look at the  

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
regulatory genes that each expresses.  You can look on the  

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
screen.  You have this in front of you as a handout.  So,  

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
I've arbitrarily said that an erythrocyte is expressing regulatory  

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
genes, R, F, and K, the neurons expressing A,  

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I, and K, and the sperm is expressing A, F, and K.  

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
OK, now let's look at those.  Those three groups of three letters are  

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
different from one another.  And so, for each of these cell types, there  

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
is a unique set of letters or a unique regulatory code.  What's this  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
code made up of? Well, it's made up of cell type  

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
specific factors, or cell type specific regulatory  

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
genes, regulatory gene products. RNI are expressed in just the  

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
erythrocyte, or just the neuron. They are cell type specific  

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
regulators.  General factors, K is expressed in all of the cells,  

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
and restricted factors, F and A, are expressed in just two of the three  

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
cells.  And you can do that for any cell type.  You can come up with  

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
some kind of combinatorial code of gene expression of regulatory genes  

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
that control cell fate. Now, these regulatory genes will go  

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
on to activate the expression of a whole bunch of differentiation  

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
genes.  And usually a small set of regulatory genes will activate a  

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
large set of differentiation genes that carry out the final function.  

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
So, here I've given you an example for erythrocytes.  It's,  

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
again, on your handouts.  The regulatory code for erythrocytes,  

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
RFK, a small regulatory code, actually it's probably about 20  

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
genes, will go on and activate at least a hundred genes which will be  

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
the gene products that actually carry out the function  

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
of red blood cells. OK, so regulatory genes activate  

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.000
differentiation genes.  What's all this regulatory stuff?  

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
What are these regulatory genes? So, here you have to think back to  

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
previous lectures.  Remember this diagram?  You have it.  

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
You've had it several times.  This is the hierarchy of things that  

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
happened from the gene in the nucleus to the final,  

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
modified, localized protein products.  You can control,  

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
the cell can control gene expression at any point along this hierarchy.  

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
It can control transcription, initiation, or termination, RNA  

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
splicing, stability or exports, translation, the initiation or  

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
elongation.  It can control export of proteins to different parts of  

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
the cell through protein trafficking, modification and control  

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
of protein stability. And there are more.  OK,  

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
this is some of the list of steps at which gene expression can be  

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
regulated.  And those hypothetical regulatory  

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
factors I told you about in the last couple of slides can be anything  

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
that affect any of these steps from the gene to the final product.  OK,  

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
all right, so here's another one that you need to know.  

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Complexity increases with developmental age.  

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And what I'm going to tell you  

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
about is how as development proceeds, as you get different cell types  

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
forming, you have to make groups of cells with specific  

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:25.000
regulatory codes.   

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And these cells --   

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And these regulatory codes will lead to a specific fate.  So,  

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
here's a nice example just by looking at development of an organ,  

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
for example, and this is important if you're going to try to engineer  

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
an organ through tissue engineering. You have to understand there are  

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
normally many, many steps involved.  These are the  

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
beginning steps in formation of the eye.  

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And it doesn't matter what each of these steps are,  

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
but if you look at the progression of cells, each of these lines are  

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
groups of cells.  You can see that they organized in different ways.  

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
They fold.  Bits break off, and you'll end up with a structure  

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
that's a lot more complex just in a pictorial way than it was in the  

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
beginning.  And that is true in terms of every aspect of this organ.  

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
It is more complex at the end than at the beginning.  And  

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
somewhere through here, you have to increase the complexity of  

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
this developing tissue. So, how do you do it?  

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
This is the way I like to think about this, and this is number 20 of  

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
your handout.  Here's an egg or a zygote, if you like,  

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
a one cell embryo.  It's one cell. There's only one kind of cell there.  

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Or, I like to think in terms of territories.  There's only one  

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
territory there.  Now, I've also put a red dot in the  

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
cell. And this red dot can be anything.  

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But it really is in terms of our conversation a group of regulatory  

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
gene products, or one regulatory gene product.  

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Watch what happens when in my hypothetical example the cell  

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
divides.  The red dot goes to one cell, and not the other cell.  And  

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
so, now I've got two different kinds of cells.  The regulators are in one  

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
cell and not in the other cell.  And then, I've gone through  

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
this and done it again. When the cells go to four cells,  

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
suddenly I've magically put a blue dot in one of the cells,  

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
and there's a red dot in another cell, and there's some cells with no  

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
dots.  And those give me three different kinds of cells,  

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
or if you like, three different kinds of territories.  And  

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
for territories, you can read regulatory code, set of regulatory  

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
gene products. So, what have we done?  

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
What we have done in this example is to take a zygote or an egg,  

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
if you like, that is symmetric at least along one axis,  

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
and to divide it so that it's now got two daughters cells that are  

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
different from one another.  So, there is a breaking of symmetry  

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
somewhere in this process.  Now, in actual fact, if you look at the  

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
egg, it's really only symmetric in one axis.  And so, it's not  

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
uniformly symmetric. But one of the things we think  

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
about in development is that every time you make a new cell type,  

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
you have to break symmetry.  You get two different kinds of cell from one  

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:51.000
kind of cell.  All right --   

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
So, I'll come back to that diagram in a moment, but I want to,  

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
the fifth point I want to give you is that regulatory factors act  

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:19.000
within cells and between cells.   

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Really important, that's why it's up on the screen and  

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
it's on the board.  I'm going to tell you about three things.  I'm  

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
going to tell you about regulatory factors that are given the term,  

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
determinants that work in a cell autonomous way.  That means with  

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
inside the cell that carries them. I want to tell you about regulators  

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
called inducers that act between cells or in cell-cell signaling.  

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And I'm going to tell you about a subset of inducers called morphogens,  

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000
which work in a concentration dependent way.  

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 So, this is a kind of magic,  

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
and it isn't a kind of magic.  The molecules I'll tell you about our  

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
molecules that you've heard about previously, OK?  

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 The phrasing, the jargon is a little  

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
different and you need to learn it because this is jargon that's used  

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
throughout biology.  Let's first of all talk about these things called  

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
determinants.  And the notion here is that cells become  

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
different because of what they inherit.  And  

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
I've drawn for you here, and this is number 21 on your  

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
handout, I've drawn for you here a cell, this blue thing  

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
with squares in it. The squares are determinants,  

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
and determinants are some kind of regulatory factor.  They may be one  

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
regulatory factor, maybe more than one regulatory  

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
factor.  They may be transcription factors.  They may be splicing  

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
factors.  They may be micro-RNA's. They may be all the things we've  

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
talked about in previous lectures, but I've drawn them as squares.  

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And here's a cell with those little squares.  And I've drawn it so that  

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
all the squares are on one side and not the other.  And  

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
of course, you're sitting there asking, how did the squares get on  

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
one side but not the other? And that is a really good  

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
question.  And I'm not going to tell you how to get  

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
on one side but not the other.  But there is a whole system in the cell  

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
of pulleys using things like microtubules where specific squares,  

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
specific molecules, can actually be pulled to one side of the  

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
cell or the other. And then, you're going to ask me,  

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
well, how do they know which side of the cell to move to?  

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
And that's another great question that I'm not going to answer.  But  

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
suffice to say there is a whole molecular machinery that can move  

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
regulatory molecules to different places in the cell.  But  

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
let's go back to our cell that's got squares on one side and not on the  

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
other.  When it divides, it gives rise to a cell that's got  

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
lots of squares, lots of determinants,  

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
and another cell that doesn't have any.  

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
The cell with the determinants goes on to make cell type one because it  

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
has a specific set of regulatory factors.  The cell without them goes  

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
on to make another cell type.  It's not that it doesn't have any  

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
regulators; it just doesn't have the ones in the squares.  So,  

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
cells are different because of what they inherit.  Here is a fantastic  

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
example.  These are early worm embryos, early embryos  

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
of [scientific name]. We mentioned this last time that  

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Professor Horvitz in the biology department got the  

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Nobel Prize for it several years ago.  And this is an example of  

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
determinants moving to different cells during development.  So,  

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
the top row are cells that have been stained for their nuclei.  And  

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
you can see one cell, two cell, and 32 cell stage embryo.  These bottom  

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
pictures are florescent pictures of things called pea granules.  These  

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
are determinants. And you can see even at the one cell  

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
stage, there are all located on one side of the cell.  At the two cell  

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
stage, they all go to one of the two cells.  And at the 32 cell stage,  

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
they are all in the cell over here. And those cells or that cell is  

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
going to give rise to the egg and sperm of [scientific name] 

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
, and those pea granules are determinants for the germ cells.  

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Here's the other big thing. Cell-cell signaling: cells  

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
may secrete an inducer. This is a ligand.  Remember signal  

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
transduction that you talked about in cell biology II?  

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Those same ligands that are secreted by cells bind to receptors  

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
on target cells.  Receptor ligand interaction leads to activation of  

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
signal transduction pathways, again, from cell biology II.  And  

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
that over time can change the genes that a cell is expressing and  

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
changed the fate of the cell. So, we call these things inducers  

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
because of the specific assays involved.  But really,  

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
they're ligands, often proteins, sometimes lipids, that bind  

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
receptors, activate signal transduction, and change cell fate.  

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
This is number 23 on your handout. So, induction: a process by which  

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
cells become different because their neighbors tell them to do so,  

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
and a variation of induction, oh, here's an example of induction, sea  

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
urchin embryo, the induction is everywhere.  

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
But I've picked this one example. Sea urchin embryo goes on through  

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
time to make this little thing called a pluteus larva.  If you  

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
remove the bottom half of the embryo, it goes on.  The rest goes on to  

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
make a kind of a round thing with lots of cilia sticking out.  And  

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
you can take four little cells that were right on the bottom of the  

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
normal embryo called micro-mirrors and stick them back on this top half  

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
of the embryo that didn't make a normal one.  

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And it will restore a pretty normal embryo.  And it's not that the red  

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
cells have made all the parts of the embryo that we're missing,  

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
or the parts of the larva that were missing.  It's that those red cells  

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
have sent out a signal, and that signal has told other cells  

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
what to become.  And in the case of the sea urchin,  

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
part of that signal is something called the delta protein.  This is a  

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
micrograph of the a sea urchin embryo at a very early stage,  

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
and this brown-purple group of cells here are those cells that contain  

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
the delta protein. These are the micro-mirrors,  

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
and these are involved in inducing the rest of the embryo to become  

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
what it does.  Now, inducers, ligands, can be tricky.  

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
They can act in different ways at different concentrations.  And  

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
this is one of the big questions of biology.  How do they do this?  

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
So, for example, if you have a lot of an inducer,  

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
it may tell cells to become cell type one.  If you have a little bit  

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
of an inducer, it may tell cells to become cell  

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
type two. And we'll talk about in a  

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
subsequent lecture the molecular basis for this.  So,  

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
an inducer that can induce different fates at different concentrations is  

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.400
terms a morphogen --
