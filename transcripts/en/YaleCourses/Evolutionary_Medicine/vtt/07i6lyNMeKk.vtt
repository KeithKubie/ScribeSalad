1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.393
Okay.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 1>One of the big concepts in evolutionary medicine,
uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.450
probably almost as important as trade off is the concept of mismatch.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The key thing going on with mismatch is the fact that rates are different rates

5
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.980
of different processes can be fast or slow.

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.660
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.660
<v 1>There are important consequences of the fact that we humans have constructed our</v>

8
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:32.290
own ecological niches.

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.930
This has produced diseases of mismatch.

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.250
There are different kinds of environmental change that are going on that

11
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.270
produced mismatches.

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.830
<v 1>And some of these are effecting the Microbiota in the human body and that has</v>

14
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:54.740
knock on consequences for our health and disease.

15
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.850
So the underlying idea here is that adaptation is rarely precise and it is often

16
00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:04.360
leggings.

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360
So biology is often lagging behind environmental change because genetic change

18
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:10.894
takes time.

19
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.610
Selection is only producing a really good match of organisms to environment when

20
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:20.710
it's acting for a long time in a stable environment,

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.760
in a population without much gene flow.
Well that doesn't happen very often.

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.170
<v 1>If the environment changes,</v>

24
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
some of the phenotypic states and some of the genetic variation that produces

25
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:36.270
them will be mismatched until selection can catch up.

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.340
Well selection may never catch up.

27
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.850
<v 0>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.930
<v 1>And so mismatched describes the situation in which there's both a poor fit,</v>

29
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:45.310
a phenotype to environment,

30
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.230
and it also means that selection is acting to improve that fit.

31
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.960
So in a way,
anytime a person uses the word mismatch,
you can think,
oh,

32
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:59.560
it's an indication that natural selection is going on in that population.

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.490
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 1>Now what about relative rates?</v>

35
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.980
Cultural change has become a very potent source of mismatch because cultural

36
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.770
change is so much more rapid than biological change.

37
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.000
<v 1>We continue to evolve biologically,</v>

39
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.770
but biological changes occurring on a chip on a scale of hundreds of
generations.

40
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
Cultural Change occurs on a scale of one generation or even less.

41
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.250
Culture is likely to continue to outpace biology and biology is likely to

42
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.260
continue to struggle to keep up with it.

43
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.600
So mismatch is going to remain an important element of our condition for the

44
00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:41.680
foreseeable future.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.160
No humans have been constructing the world that they live in.

46
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.070
We've done that with agriculture,
urbanization,
the medical system,

47
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.310
air and water pollution,
and with glide climate change.

48
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.110
So they're on many different scales.
We've been changing our environment.

49
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.350
This has resulted in less exposure to parasites,
pathogens and symbiotes.

50
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.730
More exposure to artificial light,
profound changes in our diet,

51
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.470
a more sedentary lifestyle,
less temperature fluctuation,

52
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.380
and much more salt,
sugar,
alcohol,
tobacco,

53
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.170
and other addictive drugs available in our environment.

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.140
The environmental changes are complex and their biological effects are usually

55
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.720
mediated by genotype,
by environment interaction,

56
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.780
so simple explanations are often going to mislead.

57
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.620
Here are some of the mismatch diseases.
I won't read through all of them.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.480
You can look them up in the book.
These are things like acne,

59
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.350
anxiety,
asthma,
Bunyan's,

60
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.010
tooth cavities,
chronic constipation,

61
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.510
coronary heart disease,
Crohn's disease,
diaper rash,

62
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.690
emphysema,
flat feet,
gout,

63
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.670
polycystic ovarian syndrome,
scurvy,
stomach ulcers.

64
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.270
These are all important kinds of conditions associated with mismatch.

65
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.290
You can think of that as being dis evolution.

66
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.570
Now there are different kinds of environmental change and just because we're

67
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:24.040
constructing our environment,

68
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.940
that doesn't mean we can predict the results because many of the things that we

69
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.920
do have surprising consequences,

70
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.800
individual decisions that we make accumulate to have population level

71
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.540
consequences and these population consequences are hard to anticipate.

72
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.920
For example,

73
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.210
the fact that we are generating climate change through our consumption and

74
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:51.100
reproductive behavior was not at all clear and that was a hard thing to

75
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:51.934
anticipate.

76
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.350
Emerging diseases are often unpleasant surprises that come from our habitat

77
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.060
destruction in our population expansion,

78
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.460
our niche construction has particularly affected our own microbiota.

79
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.670
So what are some of the roles of the Microbiota in human health?

80
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.970
Our interactions depended in part on things going on in intestines,
skin,

81
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.390
upper respiratory tract and genital urinary tract where Commensal Microbiota are

82
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.900
inducing the development of the immune and the gastrointestinal systems in.

83
00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:34.420
In infants,
they're helping to maintain normal immune functions.

84
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.570
In all of these tissues,
they,
in our gut,

85
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.660
they synthesize some of the vitamins that are essential.

86
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.740
They mediate the digestion of fats and carbohydrates,

87
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:47.110
so they have a role to play in obesity.

88
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.210
And when their function is disrupted by modern environments,

89
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.230
that is one of the major reasons that we become mismatched.

90
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.280
So to summarize in this introduction,

91
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:04.870
mismatched describes both a poor fit of organisms to the environment and

92
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.210
selection that is acting to improve that fit.

93
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

94
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.910
<v 1>Many of the current mismatches result from the inability of biology to change as</v>

95
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:15.560
fast as culture changes.

96
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.030
<v 1>Recent changes include less exposure to microorganisms,
more artificial light,</v>

98
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:25.900
better temperature controlled housing,
profound changes in Diet,

99
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.920
less physical activity,
and more exposure to addictive drugs.

100
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

101
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.480
<v 1>Mismatch might be contributing to at least 50 diseases and other health issues,</v>

102
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.670
and many of these issues are related to changes in the Microbiota.
