00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.970
How are you doing, man?
- Yeah, what's up, bro?

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.104
How you doin', man?
- Good to see you, man.

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:06.339
Man, my life is

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.607
- Incredible?
- Yeah.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.875
I'm trying to be
unaffordable real soon.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.043
Before you get
unaffordable, let

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.844
me tell them where you're from.
- OK.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.379
Ron G was born and raised
in Columbia, South Carolina.

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:14.881
Ay.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.049
You started comedy in Atlanta.
Right?

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:16.850
I did.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:18.184
And when you were
in Atlanta, you

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:19.419
were encouraged to
try stand-up comedy

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.620
for one night by your cousin.
- Yes.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.621
Is that correct?

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.056
Yeah, it was Apollo night--

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.190
Uptown Comedy Club, when
it was on Peachtree.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.124
Uptown?

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:26.025
On Sunday night.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:27.059
Uptown.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.195
And yeah, I had one
joke, and it was terrible.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.930
And I got on stage, and
halfway through my set,

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.098
all I heard was, boo!

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.101
And then I walked outside,
and this dude was like, man,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.135
you terrible.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.370
You ain't never gonna
be funny, little nigga.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.638
- Wow.
- And I was like--

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:39.872
that was back when
I used to curse.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.006
I was like, F you there, man!

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.909
He was like, F you gets
you killed, and walked off.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.077
I was like, you know what?
I'ma just go to the car.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.211
You just going to go
about your business?

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.212
Yeah, that's-- yeah, yeah.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.980
Ron, you moved from
Atlanta to Los Angeles.

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.182
RON G: Yeah.
- Is this true?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.116
Because I heard this.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.451
And if it is true,
I'm blown away by it.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.218
- OK.
- I heard you won an Emmy.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.186
I did.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.887
You won an Emmy?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.388
I won an Emmy.
Yes, I did.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.090
For what?
What did you win an Emmy for?

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.925
I was a consulting producer
for a show called "United

00:00:58.958 --> 00:00:59.992
Shades of America" for CNN.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.193
Wow.

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.096
And we won our Emmy season
two, "United Shades" for CNN.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.364
And I won an Emmy on
my first producing gig.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:06.399
- That's unreal.
- Yeah.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.300
I wrote the funny for the show.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.401
Unreal, man.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.869
Yes, sir.
I heard you won one, too.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.003
Did you win one?

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.872
No, I didn't win
no damn Emmy, man.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.307
- Wait.
- What kind of mess is that?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.274
You didn't win an Emmy?

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.508
I didn't win no damn Emmy.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.144
All these TV and movies you've
done, you never won an Emmy?

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.412
No, I ain't never
won no god damn Emmy.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.413
Well, I'll let
you borrow mine.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.415
Ain't this about a bitch.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.150
Ain't this about a--

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.251
I'm just saying.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.185
Now I want an Emmy.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.053
RON G: OK.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.087
I want one, now.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.322
[laughs]

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.356
No, I love it, man.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.925
Listen, Ron, first and
foremost, I'm a friend.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.193
Always been a fan, man.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:35.461
And you know what?

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.063
I think your style of
comedy, dude, is amazing.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.364
I think you've
grown as a comedian.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:39.632
Thank you.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.335
I think that right now, it's--
it's obvious that you're ready

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.436
for the next level.
RON G: Absolutely.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.904
This is no-brainer, man.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.038
I'm trying to be unaffordable.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.440
Go out there and
make yourself happy.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:48.341
Man-- hey, man.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.275
Make god proud, man.

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.476
Man!

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.345
Hey, you better go
flippy-floppy flip it.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.479
All right?

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:56.949
[inaudible] Ron G,
get out of here!

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:59.218
I didn't mean to stand
in your V. I'm sorry.

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.052
Get out of here, man.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.120
It's all right.

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:04.290
He said, I didn't mean to
stand in your V, he said.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:07.523
