00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, you might say that the answer will depend in part on what we see the response

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is being but to simplify this let's assume that 55% still will support candidate A.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well that won't quite be right. So to answer this question, we'll need to solve this formula for n.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's call the margin of error e.  We can actually simplify this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If we just square and divide, we get e²/1.96² is equal to the old variance 0.55&lt;i&gt;0.45/n.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We actually know e. We specify that is going to be 0.05.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That gives us, if we multiply through by n, so if we calculate this out we get 380.3.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now since it's pretty hard to ask a fraction of a person, we actually have to ask a bit more.

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We have to ask 381 people.
