Hey, Matt. Got your email with
the report.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:04.504
Thanks so much for sending.

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.172 align:start size:94% position:6%
Question, did you CC John on
that?

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.607
Uh, yes, I believe I did.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.474
You didn't.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.277 align:start size:84% position:16%
-[John] You BCCed me.
-You always CC

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.578 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
both John and I on all work
emails.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.448 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Cause if you BCC him, then I
can't check

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.083
to make sure that you CCed him.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.118
-I made a mistake.
-Great! Question,

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.154
why did you make that mistake?
