00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.040
Hey folks, Phil Plait here. In the last episode
of Crash Course Astronomy, I talked about

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.760
the eventual fate of the Sun, and other low mass stars
like it. After a series of expansions and contractions,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.600
they blow off their outer layers, become white dwarfs,
and fade away over billions of years. The end.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.280
Except not so much. First, white dwarfs are
pretty awesome objects, and worth investigating.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.340
And second, when a star becomes a white dwarf
it produces what is, quite simply, one of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.600
the most gorgeous objects in space.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.120
To recap, when the Sun ages, it undergoes
a series of changes in its core. It’s fusing

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.040
hydrogen into helium now, today, and will
eventually fuse helium into carbon, and it’ll

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.740
make a dash of oxygen and neon too. But when
it runs out of helium to fuse, it’s in trouble.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.180
It doesn’t have enough mass to squeeze the
carbon nuclei together, so they can’t fuse.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.500
Fusion is the Sun’s energy source. Once the core
is nearly pure carbon, that power is switched off.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.460
By this time, nearly 8 billion years from
now, the Sun’s outer layers are gone, expelled

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.120
by all the shenanigans going on in the core.
What’s left of our star is just its core,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.320
exposed to the dark of space. Over the next
few billion years it’ll cool and fade to black.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.420
That might seem like the end of the story.
But I skipped a step, and it’s a beauty.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
When helium fusion stops, the Sun’s core
will have about half the mass of what the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.459
Sun does today; the rest will have blown away
into space around it. What remains is basically

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.339
composed of electrons and carbon nuclei, mixed
with a small amount of a few other elements.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.560
So what kind of an object are we left with
here?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.240
You may know that like charges repel; electrons
have a negative charge and repel each other.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.860
The tighter you squeeze them, the stronger
that pressure.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.560
There’s also a second force, called electron
degeneracy pressure. It’s a result of some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.840
of the weird rules of quantum mechanics (for
you QM nerds, it’s The Pauli Exclusion Principle).

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.540
This describes how sub-atomic particles behave
on teeny scales. One of these rules is that

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.360
electrons really hate to be squeezed together,
above and beyond simple electric repulsion.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.470
This resistance is phenomenally strong, and
becomes the dominant force in supporting the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.190
core of a star once helium fusion stops.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.520
By the time this electron degeneracy pressure
balances the core’s immense gravity, the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.080
core is only about the size of Earth, 1% the
original width of the Sun.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960
And it’s called a white dwarf.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.200
Listing its characteristics is enough to melt
your brain. Ironically, everything about it

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.410
gets amplified as its size shrinks. It becomes
ridiculously dense; a single cubic centimeter

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.430
of it, the size of a six-sided die, has a
mass of a million grams — one metric ton.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.950
An ice cream scoop of white dwarf material
outweighs 60 cars.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.940
Because it’s so dense, the gravity at the
surface of a white dwarf screams up, easily

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.670
topping 100,000 times the Earth’s gravity.
If you have a mass of 75 kilos, you’d weigh

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.410
7,500 tons if you stood on the surface of
a white dwarf.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.430
Not that you can. Stand there, I mean. You’d
be flattened into a greasy smear.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.620
But not for long. Newborn white dwarfs are
hot; they can glow at a temperature of upwards

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.870
of 100,000 degrees Celsius. If you were on the
surface, you’d be a vaporized and ionized smear.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.770
Their intense heat makes them white, and they’re
small. Hence their name.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.810
They’re so hot they also glow in the ultraviolet,
even in X-rays. Weirdly, though, because they’re

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.650
so small, they’re actually quite faint.
The closest one to us, Sirius B, can only

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.280
be seen with a telescope even though it’s
nine light years away, one of the ten closest

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.260
known stars! Over 10,000 white dwarfs have
now been found in our galaxy.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.500
Still, any gas near a newly formed white dwarf is likely
to be affected by the intense radiation pouring out of it.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.560
And hey, wait a sec. When a star like the
Sun is in its final death throes, it expels

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.589
its outer layers as a gaseous wind. You don’t
suppose…?

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:04.040
Yup. By the time that white dwarf forms, the
gas blown off hasn’t gotten very far from it,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.460
at most a light year or two. That’s plenty close
enough to get zapped by the white dwarf radiation,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.640
causing that gas to glow in response.
What does something like THAT look like?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.460
Why, it looks like this.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.920
This object is what we call a planetary nebula.
It’s a funny name, and like so many other

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.800
names it’s left over from when these objects
were first discovered. The astronomer William

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.960
Herschel — the same man who discovered infrared
light and the planet Uranus — gave them

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.840
that name, because they appeared like small
green disks through the eyepiece.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.440
The first planetary nebula was discovered
in 1764 by the French astronomer Charles Messier,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.010
who spent years scanning the skies looking for comets.
He kept seeing faint fuzzy objects that he mistook for

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.770
comets, so he decided to make a catalog of them, a sort
of “avoid these objects” list. That list is now a staple

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.480
of amateur astronomers, because ironically it contains
some of the best and brightest objects to observe.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.000
Among them is M 27 — the 27th object on Messier’s list
— one of the biggest planetary nebulae in the sky,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.200
and one of my favorites; I love seeing it through
my telescope when it’s up high in the summer.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.400
Planetary nebulae can be a bit tough to observe;
most are small and faint. On film, even with

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.880
long exposures, they can appear to be little
more than disks. For a long time, they weren’t

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840
thought to be terribly complicated; when a
star becomes a red giant and blows off its

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.230
outer layers it’s rotating very slowly, so the wind
should blow away in a sphere surrounding

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.190
the star. Many planetaries (as we call them
for short), are round and look like soap bubbles,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.610
pretty much what you expect when you look
at an expanding shell of gas.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.810
But with the advent of digital detectors, their
fainter structures became clearer, and the

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.390
true beauty of these phenomenal objects was revealed.
Some are elongated. Some have spiral patterns.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.440
Some have jets shooting out on either side.
Some have delicate tendrils streaming away from them.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.000
In fact, only a handful of the hundreds 
known are actually circular!

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.840
Clearly, there’s more to planetaries than meets the eye.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.300
If the wind from a star blows off in a sphere, how
can planetaries come in all these fantastic shapes?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.620
It turns out the real situation is more complicated.
As usual.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.280
When a star is a red giant, it spins slowly,
and blows off a dense but slow solar wind.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.980
If there’s nothing else happening to the
star, then that wind will blow outward in

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.930
all directions, spherically. However, as those
outer layers of the star peel away, they expose

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.160
the deeper, hotter part of the star. The star
starts to blow a much faster, though far less

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.280
dense wind. That wind catches up with and
slams into the slower wind.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.860
When that happens, you get that idealized
soap bubble nebula.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.460
But some stars are binary; two stars that
orbit very close together. We’ll go into

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.840
detail on them in a later episode, but, if
the dying star has a companion, they may circle

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.060
each other rapidly. That will shape the wind,
forcing more of it outward in the plane of

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.380
the stars’ orbits due to centrifugal force.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.520
The overall shape of the expanding gas is
flattened, like a beach ball someone sat on.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.300
When the fast wind kicks in, it slams into
that stuff in the orbital plane and slows down.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.900
But there’s less stuff in the polar direction,
up and down out of the plane. It’s easier

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.690
for the wind to expand in those directions,
and it forms huge lobes of material stretching

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.750
for trillions of kilometers. That’s a very
common shape for planetary nebulae.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.970
But to explain the shapes we see, the two
stars would have to orbit improbably close.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.130
Most binaries aren’t that tight. So what
can cause these shapes?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.300
When I was in graduate school, my Master’s
degree advisor, Noam Soker, came up with a

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.870
nutty idea; maybe the stars had planets, like
in our solar system. If the star expanded into

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.460
a red giant and swallowed them, it would take
millions of years or more for the planets

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.470
to vaporize. And for all that time they’d
be orbiting INSIDE the star, moving faster

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.199
than the star itself. Like using a whisk to
beat eggs, the planets inside the star would

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.779
spin it up, causing it to rotate faster…
fast enough to explain the shapes of planetaries.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.460
That was in the early 1990s. A few years later,
the first exoplanets were found, and we saw

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.600
that massive planets orbiting very close to their
stars were common. I suspect this is why we see

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.580
so many weird and fantastic shapes in planetaries;
their progenitor stars swallowed their planets.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:13.300
So planetary nebulae really may owe their
existence to planets! And we come… full circle.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.520
The glow in a planetary nebula is due to
the hot central white dwarf exciting the gas.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.520
Most of the gas is hydrogen, which glows in
the red. However, a lot of the gas is oxygen.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.590
There’s not nearly as much oxygen as hydrogen, but
kilo for kilo oxygen glows more brightly than hydrogen

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:35.160
due to the atomic physics involved. This oxygen glows
green, giving planetaries their characteristic hue.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.740
Funny: When this green glow was first analyzed
spectroscopically, astronomers couldn’t

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.880
identify the responsible element making it.
They dubbed it nebulium, but eventually figured

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:47.309
out is was just extremely tenuous oxygen.

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:52.440
Other colors can be found, too. Nitrogen and
sulfur glow red, and oxygen can emit blue

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:56.589
as well, all adding to the beauty of these
celestial baubles. But these aren’t just

00:08:56.589 --> 00:09:01.410
pretty pictures: The structure, color, and
shape of a planetary nebula tells us about

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:07.060
the life of the star that formed it. We learn even more
about stellar evolution by studying how stars die.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.439
Mind you, the gas in a planetary nebula is
still expanding, cruising outward from its

00:09:11.439 --> 00:09:16.139
initial momentum of being thrown off the star.
Eventually, the gas expands so much it thins

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.780
out, and it stops glowing. That takes a few
thousand years, so when you see a planetary

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.660
nebula you’re seeing a very short snapshot
of the life, the death, of a star. And that’s

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.480
why we don’t see many; though there are
billions of stars in the galaxy that die this way,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.340
this phase is very brief. Enjoy looking at
them while you can. And what of the Sun?

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.780
Will it, one day in the distant future be at the
center of a planetary nebula it expels as it dies?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.040
Ehh probably not. When the Sun becomes a white
dwarf, it most likely won’t be energetic

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:52.019
enough to make the surrounding gas glow; most
planetaries start off as stars more massive

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:57.419
and hotter than the Sun. When our Sun dies,
it’ll go quietly and without a lot of visible fanfare.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.800
Alien astronomers, if they’re out there
in 8 billion years, may not even notice.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.620
But more massive stars do make quite the spectacle.
And if they’re really massive, more than

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:13.240
about 8 times the Sun’s mass, they really and truly
make a scene when they die. They explode.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.640
But that’s for next week. Mwuhahahaha.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.420
Today you learned that when low mass stars
die, they form white dwarfs: incredibly hot

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.980
and dense objects roughly the size of Earth.
They also can form planetary nebulae: huge,

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.280
intricately detailed objects created when
the wind blown from the dying stars is lit

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.320
up by the central white dwarf. They only last
a few millennia. The Sun probably won’t

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.280
form one, but higher mass stars do.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.379
