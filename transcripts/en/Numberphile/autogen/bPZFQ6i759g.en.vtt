00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 align:start position:0%
start is with coin flipping okay so this

start is with coin flipping okay so this
is<00:06:28.820><c> like</c><00:06:28.970><c> a</c><00:06:29.000><c> toy</c><00:06:29.590><c> example</c><00:06:30.590><c> of</c><00:06:30.770><c> the</c><00:06:31.040><c> sort</c><00:06:31.280><c> of</c>

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.779 align:start position:0%

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 align:start position:0%

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 align:start position:0%
a game with a coin and we're gonna think

a game with a coin and we're gonna think

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 align:start position:0%
flip the coin three times and we're
 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.029 align:start position:0%
flip the coin three times and we're

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
thinking we're looking for what happens
 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.490 align:start position:0%
thinking we're looking for what happens
after<00:07:16.490><c> something</c><00:07:16.729><c> so</c><00:07:17.030><c> here's</c><00:07:17.240><c> the</c><00:07:17.389><c> game</c><00:07:17.539><c> I</c>

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
after something so here's the game I
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.070 align:start position:0%
after something so here's the game I
flip<00:07:19.250><c> the</c><00:07:19.400><c> coin</c><00:07:19.699><c> and</c><00:07:20.000><c> then</c><00:07:20.599><c> we're</c><00:07:20.900><c> going</c><00:07:21.020><c> to</c>

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
flip the coin and then we're going to
 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
flip the coin and then we're going to
write<00:07:21.349><c> down</c><00:07:21.380><c> what</c><00:07:22.070><c> happens</c><00:07:22.880><c> after</c><00:07:23.599><c> I</c><00:07:23.810><c> flip</c>

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 align:start position:0%
write down what happens after I flip
 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.339 align:start position:0%
write down what happens after I flip
ahead<00:07:24.500><c> so</c><00:07:25.280><c> if</c><00:07:25.550><c> I</c><00:07:25.669><c> flip</c><00:07:25.820><c> tails</c><00:07:26.240><c> we</c><00:07:26.960><c> don't</c><00:07:26.990><c> think</c>

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:27.349 align:start position:0%
ahead so if I flip tails we don't think
 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
ahead so if I flip tails we don't think
about<00:07:27.560><c> anything</c><00:07:27.949><c> then</c><00:07:28.099><c> I</c><00:07:28.130><c> flip</c><00:07:28.460><c> the</c><00:07:28.580><c> heads</c>

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 align:start position:0%
about anything then I flip the heads
 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.969 align:start position:0%
about anything then I flip the heads
we'd<00:07:29.270><c> become</c><00:07:29.389><c> alert</c><00:07:29.840><c> then</c><00:07:30.349><c> flip</c><00:07:30.770><c> something</c>

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:30.979 align:start position:0%
we'd become alert then flip something

eight of them so I think I got all eight
of<00:08:06.979><c> them</c><00:08:07.099><c> and</c><00:08:07.250><c> let's</c><00:08:07.610><c> look</c><00:08:08.060><c> at</c><00:08:08.389><c> what</c><00:08:08.780><c> we</c><00:08:08.960><c> would</c>

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
something so let's see what fraction had
 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
something so let's see what fraction had
heads<00:09:47.459><c> so</c><00:09:48.089><c> in</c><00:09:48.420><c> the</c><00:09:48.660><c> first</c><00:09:48.930><c> one</c><00:09:49.110><c> the</c><00:09:49.680><c> fraction</c>

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.130 align:start position:0%
heads so in the first one the fraction
 

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:54.209 align:start position:0%
fraction is zero and the third one the
 

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:57.260 align:start position:0%
fraction is zero and the third one the

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.270 align:start position:0%
fraction is one again we have a zero
 

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.260 align:start position:0%
fraction is one again we have a zero
here<00:09:58.079><c> we</c><00:09:58.110><c> have</c><00:09:58.410><c> a</c><00:09:58.440><c> heads</c><00:09:58.740><c> and</c><00:09:58.920><c> a</c><00:09:58.980><c> tails</c><00:09:59.279><c> half</c>

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.270 align:start position:0%
here we have a heads and a tails half
 

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.449 align:start position:0%
here we have a heads and a tails half
the<00:10:00.510><c> time</c><00:10:00.750><c> we</c><00:10:00.930><c> saw</c><00:10:01.170><c> heads</c><00:10:01.440><c> half</c><00:10:01.829><c> the</c><00:10:02.040><c> time</c><00:10:02.279><c> we</c>

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
the time we saw heads half the time we
 

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
the time we saw heads half the time we

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
saw tails that's 0.5 and here a hundred
 

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.579 align:start position:0%
saw tails that's 0.5 and here a hundred
percent<00:10:05.880><c> of</c><00:10:06.149><c> the</c><00:10:06.209><c> time</c><00:10:06.300><c> we</c><00:10:06.720><c> saw</c><00:10:06.959><c> a</c><00:10:06.990><c> heads</c><00:10:07.290><c> again</c>

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:07.589 align:start position:0%
percent of the time we saw a heads again
 

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:09.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the time we saw a heads again
so<00:10:07.770><c> we</c><00:10:07.860><c> have</c><00:10:08.040><c> a</c><00:10:08.070><c> one</c><00:10:08.339><c> so</c><00:10:09.000><c> we</c><00:10:09.180><c> take</c><00:10:09.420><c> these</c>

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:09.630 align:start position:0%
so we have a one so we take these
 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.540 align:start position:0%
so we have a one so we take these
numbers<00:10:09.930><c> their</c><00:10:10.320><c> average</c><00:10:10.890><c> represents</c>

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.550 align:start position:0%
numbers their average represents
 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.810 align:start position:0%
numbers their average represents
expectation<00:10:12.329><c> so</c><00:10:12.990><c> I</c><00:10:13.350><c> add</c><00:10:13.770><c> them</c><00:10:14.010><c> up</c><00:10:14.160><c> I</c><00:10:14.399><c> get</c><00:10:14.550><c> 1</c>

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
expectation so I add them up I get 1
 

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.250 align:start position:0%
expectation so I add them up I get 1
plus<00:10:15.300><c> 1/2</c><00:10:15.480><c> plus</c><00:10:15.899><c> 2</c><00:10:16.350><c> that's</c><00:10:16.860><c> 2.5</c><00:10:17.820><c> the</c><00:10:18.779><c> average</c>

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
plus 1/2 plus 2 that's 2.5 the average
 

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.940 align:start position:0%
plus 1/2 plus 2 that's 2.5 the average
is<00:10:19.560><c> equal</c><00:10:20.160><c> to</c><00:10:20.310><c> 2.5</c><00:10:20.899><c> over</c><00:10:21.899><c> 6</c><00:10:22.290><c> which</c><00:10:22.890><c> is</c>

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:22.950 align:start position:0%
is equal to 2.5 over 6 which is
 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
is equal to 2.5 over 6 which is
definitely<00:10:23.790><c> less</c><00:10:24.000><c> than</c><00:10:24.209><c> 1/2</c><00:10:24.420><c> 6</c><00:10:24.990><c> is</c><00:10:25.140><c> the</c><00:10:25.290><c> number</c>
