to today's presentation titled, The
Unlinking of Language and Identity--

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.920
Puerto Rican identity-- pardon me.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.280
Which is also the name of the
book authored by our guest,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.540
Dr. Brenda Dominguez-Rosado,
from the University

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.370
of Puerto Rico at Bayamon.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.090
Her book melds portions
of her autobiography

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.970
and her doctoral studies into
a wonderful introspection

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.850
and examination of sociocultural
linguistics and transculturation,

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.510
specifically the role of
language and identity.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.880
Dr. Dominguez-Rosado
was born in Fairbanks,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.490
Alaska to a Puerto Rican mother

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.310
and a Mexican-American
father from Texas.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.610
Go Texas [laughter].

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750

at the University of Puerto Rico.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.290
She has participated
amply at various regional

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.300

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Brenda Dominguez-Rosado.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.520
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.820
&gt;&gt; Brenda Dominguez-Rosado:
Thank you so much.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.550
&gt;&gt; Francisco Macias: I switched
on languages [laughter].

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.850
Very appropriate.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.150
&gt;&gt; Brenda Dominguez-Rosado:
Thank you.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.450
Thank you so much.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.750
Well, welcome.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.580
It's a pleasure for me
to be here and thank you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.400
for coming to my presentation.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.740
Although my book is focused--

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.780
focuses on the Puerto
Rican experience,

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.530
I invite you to insert your
own experiences in life

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.840
with language and identity.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.650 position:56%
It doesn't really matter what
heritage language you might have had

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.710
experience with in
your family history.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.620
And ask yourself, is this happening
in my own community as well?

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.660
And please share your comments and
your observations or your thoughts

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.490
at the end of the presentation.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.670
It will be a whirlwind
30 minute presentation.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.990
I'm going to go fairly quickly, so
some of the slides are text heavy.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.580
Okay? So, hopefully
I won't go too fast.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.550
It's a lot to cover.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.430
The book is based on my
doctoral dissertation

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.940
and it is a streamline
version of it.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.030
So, I have made it
more user-friendly

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.450
and it has the essence
of my research.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.340
Okay? So, anyway, let
me turn on the control.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.530
All right.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
So, I'd like to start with a
really quick introduction to some

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.620
of the concepts and terms that I
use in my research, in my book.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.850
First of all, we must acknowledge
that there is a historical link

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.440
between language and identity.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.560
Okay? I think we can
all agree on that.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.290
Many, many studies done on that.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.930 position:56%
But I would like to clarify that
the book addresses more the identity

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.690
that is our ethnic
or national identity.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.380
And just to clarify, what I mean
by identity is it's the sense

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.210
of belonging to some group.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.890
What we feel we are
or where we belong.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.520
Okay? We must also agree, or
we may agree, or we may know,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.410
that language may be a
core value in cultures.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.470
Okay? Culture is transmitted
through language.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.500
So, it is essential, okay, and
is linked to culture as well.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.410
Attitudes about languages.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.180
The book has to do a
lot with attitudes.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.040 position:56%
So, it, we, you know, attitudes
about languages are assessments made

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.820
about the value of a
particular language.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.490
They can be either positive
or negative attitudes,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.900
and that is very important,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.080
because that influences
the outcome of a language.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.430
A language can be born, a language
can also die because of attitudes.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.960
So, if we have positive attitudes,
that means that we respect,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.660
we admire, we preserve
the language, we use it.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.230
If we don't, then that
means that we don't use it.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.530
That we don't preserve it.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.650
That we don't respect
it and it might die out.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.610
We must also assume that
attitudes are not static.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.100
Okay? They are changing constantly

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.190
because of our surrounding
circumstances.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.830
So, we must assume that
they can or should change,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.830
and language policy must
take that into account.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.980
Prevalent language attitudes
provide social indicators

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.660
of changing beliefs.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.310
Okay? They're like the thermometer.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.730
They're taking the temperature.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.170
What's going on?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.470
Okay? Are we-- ?

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.870
Is it because we're in war?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.620
Is it because we're in peace?

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.920
Times of peace, times of war.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.220
I mean, what's going on?

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.520
Why is it changing?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.670
Nowadays, the need to confront
and eradicate negative attitudes

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.850
and stereotypes may
actually be leading us away

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.320
from that traditional stance
of one language, one identity.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.740
Okay? So, times are a changing,
although, if we go back in history,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.160
that's what everybody
said at the time

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.460
that they were learning, as well.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.800
A lot of transformation going on.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.100
All right.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.620
So, continuing, some
of you may be familiar

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.710
with Puerto Rico, some
of you may not.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.720
So, I'm going to try to
summarize in a nut shell a little

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.330
about the history of Puerto Rico
and why we have these two languages

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.460
on our island, because we
have Puerto Rican Spanish

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.610
and we have American English.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.910
All right?

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.980
Now, we also have what we
call the Hispanicisation

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.470
and Americanization processes

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.900
and they have affected attitude
towards both attitudes towards

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.150
those languages.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.370
So, Hispanicisation process
began when the Spaniards arrived

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.930
on the island in the
fifteenth century.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.170
They colonized the
island, they were--

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.650
they brought their own varieties
of Spanish from the Canary Islands,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.760
from the Andalusian area of
Spain, which is to the south.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.430
They had different varieties.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.020
They had to reach a
common ground in language.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.620
They were greeted by the indigenous
population that already existed

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.120
on the island, the Taino.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.320
And, basically, decimated the
Taino population [laughter].

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.940
But, you know, some did run for the
hills, okay, and they did survive.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.240
Some of them did.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.240
We still have DNA of the
Taino in Puerto Ricans.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.690
So, they didn't really influence
the language all that much.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.320
But, we do have place
names that exist today

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.830
that come from their language.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.800
We also have the Africans,
the slaves that were brought

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.580
to our island in the
sixteenth century,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.150
and they also had their
own languages.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.690
They came mostly from the
West coast, the Gold Coast.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.730
They Uribi, the Igbo, people
were the ones who were more--

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.360
the ones that arrived the most.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.280
And so, their languages
also had influence

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.830
on this emerging new
variety of Spanish

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.940
which is known as Puerto
Rican Spanish.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.300
And also, the new and
emerging people known

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.880
as the Puerto Rican people.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.750 position:56%
Okay? So, we're a lovely mixture of
many beautiful people and languages.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.320
And that's Puerto Rican Spanish,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.450
400 years of Puerto Rican
Spanish evolving on the island,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.060
creating a link to identity
for the Puerto Ricans.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.870
And then-- that was 400 years--

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.420
and then, we had the
Spanish-American War, where,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.590
as part of the aftermath of
that, Spain handed Puerto Rico

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.690
over to the U.S. and
that was in 1898.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.380
And so, it's been about
118, 119 years since then.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.300
The U.S., once they
arrived, immediately said,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.680 position:56%
Spain is out, U.S. is in [laughter].

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.570
Okay? So, now, you're
going to speak English.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.530
And everything is going
to be the way we do it.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.960
Okay? So, that's how it was.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.260
So, the attitudes then, where we
have the positive attitude towards

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.170
Spanish, because this is what
we have known for 400 years,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.580
then became a negative
attitude towards English

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.760
because it's being imposed.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.630
It wasn't a choice.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.640
It was today you speak--
yesterday you spoke Spanish,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.940 position:56%
today you're going to speak English.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.010
And schools are in English,
government is in English,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.650
holidays are ours,
everything is ours.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.480
And what you did before
doesn't count anymore.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.240 position:56%
So, this is where we stand nowadays.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.540
Attitudes are changing.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.700
I just wanted you to know this
because this is why I felt, okay,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.270
there is a change going
on after 100 years.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.570
All right?

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.870
So, this is where we stand.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.620
Now, at the bottom, I
have a little comment.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.260
I've noticed, and many
people have noticed,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.230
that there is a global
tendency towards multilingualism

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.070
and pluriculturalism, so I
mean, is it that we're special?

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.060
I mean, is this change going on in
Puerto Rico only, or is it going

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.690
on in the world and we're just
following a global tendency?

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.990
All right?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.570
So, that's one of the
important questions.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.290
Okay. So, the selection of my
topic for the dissertation/book,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.020
because the book is based
on the dissertation,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.400
I've had my own struggles with
identity related to language.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.320
And very briefly, my dad was
Mexican-American from Texas,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.950
as was explained already.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.690
My mother from Puerto Rico.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.460
My household, we were not
raised speaking Spanish,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.490
even though my parents
were Hispanic.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.790
They only spoke Spanish
to each other

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.090
when they didn't want the children

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.670
to know what they were
talking about [laughter].

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.660
Okay. So, my first
language is English,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.700
but I look Hispanic, I think.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.760
Right? And my father
was in the Army.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.230
We were at a base, we were
living on a base in Texas.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.660
Although, at that point, when
this experience happened,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.960
we were off base.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.090
So, I was at a school where it
was a public school, but off base,

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.630
so everybody from other--
the community.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.510
Not people necessarily related to
the Army were attending the school.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.840
One student-- I was
in the seventh grade--

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.790
one student approached me and she
asked me something in Spanish.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.880
And, I just blankly stared at her.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.980
I had no idea what she was asking.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.280
So, she thought I hadn't heard her,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.180
so she repeats the
question in Spanish.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.460
And, I was just, again,
and she says--

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.880
and then she said to me in
English, don't you understand?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.190
And I said, no.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.440
And she says, what kind
of a Mexican are you?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.540
[laughter] And I said, oh my-- .

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.850
I was just shocked.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.150
I didn't know-- .

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.460
I didn't say anything.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.950
I was thinking, I had never thought
of myself, you know, as Mexican,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.580
as Puerto Rican, as
I was just American.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.890
I was just an Army brat.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.470
I was just in middle school.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.860
I really had no idea, but it
was like a slap in the face.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.760
And I'm thinking, my goodness,
what kind of Mexican am I?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.060
I don't know.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.360
I don't know.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.660
I don't know.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.960
I guess I'm not a Mexican.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.920
But then we moved to
Puerto Rico when I was

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.180
in the ninth grade and
my parents divorced.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.980
My mother returned to Puerto Rico.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.310
And I was immersed into
a Spanish speaking world.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.290
Because even though our language is
the official languages are English

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.610
and Spanish, English is not used
that much in the official sphere.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.290
I mean, it's just the
federal court, for example.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.880
We do have English
taught from kindergarten

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.390
to the University levels, but
people, the majority who study,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.510
basically, and study, who study in
public school do not become fluent

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.130
in English, unfortunately.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.610
So, it's a struggle.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.740
So, anyway, I was immersed
into the Spanish speaking world

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.370
and then it became a question of
what kind of Puerto Rican are you?

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.230
You don't speak Spanish [laughter].

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.880
Okay. And I was immediately
labeled Nuyorican [laughter].

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.920
They'd say, oh, that Nuyorican.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.600
Okay. I had never been in New York
[laughter], hadn't been born there.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.850
No. So, anyways, what do you mean?

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.150
So, I was labeled.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.640
I was discriminated against.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.580
I was also called gringa.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.170
Okay. That American girl, you know.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.500
So, I felt like an outsider.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.700
It was a huge incentive
to learn Spanish.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.080
Let me just tell you
that [laughter].

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.610
I learned it very quickly.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.960
But, I felt like an outsider.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.380
So this is part of it.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.860
And since I lived this experience
myself, I know what it feels like.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.770
And I could, because I've been
an educator for the past 32 years

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.130
and I started teaching--
I'm an English professor--

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.990
I started noticing these attitudes
changing in my own classes

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.000
when I started teaching
high school in 1984,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.190
the students were not
that eager to learn.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.940
You know? It was like
the rebellious thing.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.660
It was the oppressor's language.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.890
You know? So, but things
have changed.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.190
And I said, you know what?

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.490
This is a wonderful topic.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.000
I feel so personally, that
it's a personal thing for me.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.540
So, I think that when
you're passionate

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.870
about something, it
works out better.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.180
Okay. So, I did a pilot study and
that showed interesting trends.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.130
The pilot study is
documented in the book.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.430
Okay? Research question.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.030
So, is Puerto Rican Spanish still
seen as a fundamental requirement

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.820
for Puerto Rican identity?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.940
Number two, if people cannot
speak Puerto Rican Spanish, PRS,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.730
were not born or do
not live on the island,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.080
can they call themselves
Puerto Rican?

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.470
Okay. What-- is there a changing
attitude towards American English

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.930
and Puerto Rican society?

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.640
Number four, what are the
attitudes towards the importance

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.290
of Puerto Rican Spanish and
American English as linked

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.040
to identity among our younger
university educated generation

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.730
versus the attitudes of
the older generations

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.680
who are university educated or not,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.460
who are not educated at
the university level?

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.760
Or even less than that?

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.360
What are the causes of any change
in attitude that may be detected?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.700
Can people identify
themselves as Puerto Rican

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.010
if they have native
fluency in English?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.750
How much has U.S. culture
influenced Puerto Rican culture?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.190
Is there a harmonious integration?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.630
And number nine - - there were
more questions, by the way, okay--

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.520
can Puerto Ricans take their
place on the international stage

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.400
by becoming proudly multilingual

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.520
yet maintaining their
identity as Puerto Ricans?

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.270
So, all of those questions
were answered, and more.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.400 position:56%
Now, I just wanted to, very quickly,
go over my theoretical framework.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.020
This is dissertationese,
okay, from the dissertation,

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.230
but I just wanted you to know
that I did look at things

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.080
from a historical perspective.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.700
I wanted to see if I could detect
change from different generations.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.470
So, I wanted to start with
grandparents, then parents,

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.350
then the university students,

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.020
to see if over this 100 year
period there was a change

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.010
and if I could actually
document it that way.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.980
And that's why I have focus groups.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.010
Functional theory, I noticed that
well, it affects peoples' wallets.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.750
So, if you make money by knowing
English, if job opportunities open

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.870 position:56%
up for you because you're bilingual,
then this is something positive

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.730
that is affecting the change.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.840
Then I also have the
cognitive dissonance theory

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.580
where when you have
opposing-- sorry--

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:32.000
opposing attitudes
that are not congruent,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.080
you want bilingual
education for your children,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.550
but you don't like
the English language,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.610
okay, something has to change.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.950
Okay? So, if you--
then you have sort

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.920
of a new positive attitude
towards the English.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.550
And language and identity ties
that do not necessarily bind.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.920
There is a tendency now
of unlinking language.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:57.470
It's not as like, oh, that's
the main requirement globally.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.920
Okay. I use a questionnaire.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.360
And the questionnaire had a double
purpose; it was for results.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.720
I asked the questions,
people answered.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.250
But, also, I wanted to
recruit the families

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.860
so I had very strict requirements
that they had to fulfill.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.810
They had to be of Puerto
Rican ancestry.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.810
They had to reside on the island.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.230
They had to be literate.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.120
And they also had to
be willing to cooperate

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.170
with no incentive whatsoever
[laughter].

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.590
Okay? Just a snack and some
water or something, you know.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:32.800
So, and be able to meet on
the same day, same time.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.340
So, it was a difficult process.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.100
I also had, as I said, the focus
groups that were recruited.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.980
This is the methodology
very quickly.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.470
I had to get authorization,
obviously.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.770
The questionnaire.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.730
I had to-- .

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.470
This-- I had problems encountered.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.210
You'll see that at the
bottom, the little list.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.250
I had to go out into the hallways
and find people to participate

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.810
that were 21 years and older.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.680
And I work at an undergrad
institution,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.050
so the majority are
not older than 21.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.350
It was difficult.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.650
We were at the end of the semester,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.450
because by the time I
had received permission,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.320
it was already final exam time.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.050
So, I was like, oh no!

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.060
I was wondering the hallways
[laughter], stopping people

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.040
and then, show me your
I.D. [laughter].

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.200
No, I'm not the police [laughter].

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.170
So, the thing is that I was
finally able to get enough people

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.390
to answer the questionnaire to
be able to recruit my families

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.130
because they had to be willing to
collaborate and cooperate with me.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.130
Okay? So, the initial
plan was to have 20.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.820
Then I was only able to get-- .

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.240
I said, no, 20 is too
many, too many, too much.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.970 position:56%
10, and then that dream was slashed,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.760
and then I finally
was able to get 5.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.130
And then, finally, at the very
end, 2 families had difficulty,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.350
so I ended up with 3 families.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.650
So, anyway.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.030
But, I was able to then
have the focus groups.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.750
And then the students were
one female, two males.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.050
Parents were three males.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.290
Grandparents were two
females and one male.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.590
I interviewed them.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.890
I gave them a choice
of Spanish or English.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.400
They all chose Spanish.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.510
So, once I finished the interviews,
I transcribed, by myself,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.270 position:56%
no machine, no helper, no assistant.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.650
These were hours of tapes.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.820
And then I had to translate
from Spanish to English.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.180
And then analyze and
choose, you know,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.830 position:56%
what I thought were more appropriate
quotes than-- for the book.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.010
Okay? So, it was a lot
of work, in other words.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.260
Anyway, my salient findings.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.220
That speaking Puerto Rican Spanish
is not an essential requirement

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.490
for Puerto Rican identity.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.800
And I have some quotes
that I have included.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.890
I'm going-- I'm not going
to read all of them.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.860
But, just so you know,
these were some

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.840
of the things that they expressed.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.070
And all were in agreement.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.800
So, this is from the questionnaires
and from the focus groups.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.510
The link is not necessarily
present because an individuals

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.680
or Puerto Rican society's identity
is defined by more than a language.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.820
Language is clearly important,
but there are other things,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.980
like culture, religion, customs,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.370
that also help form a
personal and social identity.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.360
So, I don't consider
it to be essential.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.110 position:56%
There's more demographic information

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.290
about all my participants
in the book.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:16.570
Okay? But, I was allowed to
identify them by their initials.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.880
Number two, to be able to claim
Puerto Rican identity does not

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.630 position:56%
require you to be born on the
island or even reside on the island.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.790
And E.R., the grandparent, said,
even if you are born American-- .

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.850
Okay, I don't have time to
explain [laughter], yeah.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.040
But yes, there is that,
if you're not-- .

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.260
If you're from over here,
then you're American, okay,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.150
and live in the U.S. If you're
parents are Puerto Rican,

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.110
they're always going to
instill in you feelings

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.710
about being Puerto Rican.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.560
In other words, you have to feel
it like the singer Marc Anthony,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.320
who was born and raised over there,
the U.S., but who always talks

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.770
about his Puerto Rican roots.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.050
I don't believe that
that impedes anything.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.570
I'd like to read the other quote,

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.270
because it also shows how the
younger generation is thinking.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.510
I have family members
in New York and some

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.660
of my cousins have never
even visited Puerto Rico,

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.740
but they are proud to call
themselves Puerto Rican.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.780
And they don't have a
complete mastery of Spanish,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.790
but they follow many of our Puerto
Rican customs and defend them

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.620
and are even prouder
of them than we are.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.870 position:56%
Okay. And, American English is
being seen in a more positive light.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.170
This is a grandparent.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.460
He says, well, in the
past, the attitude was one

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.900
of complete rejection, because
we lacked human resources

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.190
who could teach us and we preferred
to speak our vernacular instead

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.990
of the imported language.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.850
It is still being rejected by my
generation, but to a lesser extent,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.180
because we need to use
it in our daily lives

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.570
because it's practically
a universal language,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.150
and it's necessary for everything.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.570
And then the younger generation.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.890
They, the older generations,

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.800
might have associated learning
English while leaving their Puerto

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.980
Rican-- with leaving their
Puerto Rican identity behind,

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.600
but our generation is more open
and we can understand that just

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.860
because we learn another
language, we're not going

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.740
to stop being Puerto Rican.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.270
And we can still feel
proud of who we are.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.690
So, having a university
education is not a major factor

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.270
in the new attitude towards
English on the island.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:19.630
They all agreed and they were
of varying levels of education.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.790
Number five, the use of technology
has been instrumental in the change

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.320
of attitude-- in attitude
towards American English,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.460
and that includes social
media and film and tv.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.630
Okay? So, we are bombarded by
all of the media that comes

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.630
from the U.S. and English.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.470
Native fluency in English or
being multilingual does not appear

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.070
to affect Puerto Rican identity.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.220
So, the parent said, even
if you speak perfect English

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.520
and you're Puerto Rican,
it doesn't mean

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.820
that you stop being Puerto Rican.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.780
That has nothing to do with it.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.090 position:56%
I think we can integrate more
languages and still be Puerto Rican.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.600
Number seven, a new
culture with American

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.020
and Puerto Rican components may
be in the process of formation.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.790
This is an interesting phenomenon
and I'd love to do a, you know,

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.680
further study on that topic.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.570
And I'm sure that here
in the diaspora as well,

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.480
a new culture is forming.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.910
You have-- you use what you
have available and you make,

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.580
you know, you make it your own.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.800
Right? Something new.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.260
So, at the bottom, we have
the grandparents saying, yes,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.070
we have been influenced, sometimes
dramatically, such as in food.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.590
Before, we didn't know
what fast food was.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.470
People ate rice and beans at
their local rustic restaurants.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.830
In la fonda, as we
say in Puerto Rico.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.900
But now, it's hot dog,
hamburger, sushi, sirloin,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.530
and who knows what the
devil else [laughter].

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.830
Okay? He was really fun to
interview, let me tell you.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.130
He was great.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.610
Puerto Rico-- oops, sorry--
Puerto Ricans enjoy brotherly

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.860
or neighborly relationships
with other Caribbean nations,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.110
but they are perceived
differently by them

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.670
because of their relationship to
the U.S. Becoming multilingual

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.170
in pluricultural will not
change this perception.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.960
So, I'm going to read the
one from the grandparent.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.450
We're all neighbors and if
some people speak one language

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.240
and others speak another,
it doesn't mean anything.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.570
We're still neighbors.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.230
Okay? They do see us as
different, very different, however,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.370
because we depend on another
nation, the United States.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.080
They, other Latin Americans
from neighboring islands,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.070
call us the kept people
of the Caribbean,

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.390
lo monte nebo la Caribe [laughter].

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.920
It's a pseudonym that
we've been assigned

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.670
and it's definitely affecting
attitudes towards us.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.550
It's a give and take with the
U.S., but we're still dependent.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.160
This is something very deep.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.880
It's something you can barely touch
upon because it bothers us so much.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:53.400
Okay? And so, on that
note, the implications.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.610
The findings mentioned here
are the result of a study

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.090
with a limited number
of participants.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.730
I do not wish to imply
that the opinions

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.280
of the participants represent
the majority of Puerto Ricans.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.250
To do so would be an absurd claim.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.330
However, the present study and
its findings do open the door

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.040
into future research
into the topics analyzed.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.650
The results appear to
indicate that language

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.460
and identity issues are
changing on the island.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.760
The findings also indicate

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.820
that at least some Puerto
Ricans are aligning themselves,

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.640
both with their Caribbean
and global neighbors,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.830
in terms of attitudes
towards language and identity.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.880
An apparent change in progress has
been documented in the responses

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.460
of the participants from three
Puerto Rican generations reflecting

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.940
a shift from a monolingual,
monocultural identity

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.210
to a bilingual, bicultural
one and a willingness

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.720
to accept multilingualism and
pluriculturalism as tools needed

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.050
to survive in a world
that is becoming smaller

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.850
and more accessible
because of technology.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.840
Update. Okay.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:02.420 position:56%
So, my new 2016 study is not related
directly to language and identity,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.120
but it was about Puerto
Rican Spanish and prestige.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.890
Okay? I presented this, the
results, last year in Spain.

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:16.130
But, I snuck in a question
about language and identity.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.620
So, on this online survey,
I had 979 participants,

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.920
but I only considered the ones

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.710
that were complete
responses; that was 902.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.850
Some people were non-Puerto Ricans.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.620
Okay? So, those were 50; 50 people.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.580 position:56%
So, the majority were Puerto Ricans.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.300
These are the results.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.450
If you take a look at the red
bars, those are the Puerto Ricans.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.200
The tan or the beige bars are--

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.880
well, I don't know
if you can see them--

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.170
but they are the non-Puerto Ricans.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.290
And you'll see that for
agree and completely agree,

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.760
we have 291 agree,
273 completely agree.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.420
And if we add those up it's
564 out of 881 Puerto Ricans

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.130
who corroborate my previous
findings in 2010 and 2012.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.380
There is a new tendency
towards unlinking

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.790
because of a large diaspora
that doesn't speak Spanish

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.000
yet claims a Puerto Rican identity.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.220
The non-Puerto Ricans also
mainly supported the idea.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.660
Okay. Recommendations.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:28.750
A broader study needs to be
completed where the apparent change

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:33.270
in progress concerning attitudes
towards the link between languages

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.880
and identity in Puerto Rico
can be more fully documented.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.540
And I am on it, okay [laughter],

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.370
because I have already
created a new survey.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:43.670
It's online.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.150
It's waiting for permission
at my campus

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.620
and at the other ten UPR campuses.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.460
So, I am expanding out to
the other ten campuses to see

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.340
if they also reflect the same
findings to have a larger sample.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.000
And, I'm waiting for permission,
so I'm still in the process,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.080
but it's going to be done.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.220
Number two, more studies
should be conducted

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.580
in the Puerto Rican diaspora.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.210
Okay. And concerning
language and identity, do--

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.810 position:56%
my question is, do they see the link
the same way as islanders do or not?

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.110
Okay? What is their
essential requirement

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.880
for establishing a
Puerto Rican identity?

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.920
My next major project will be
to visit the diasporan cities

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.280
in the U.S. and in Saint Croix

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.870
where there is a large Puerto Rican
diaspora, U.S. Virgin Islands,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.360
in order to replicate
the original study

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.340
with the questionnaire
and the focus groups.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.670
Although, I'm thinking it will
probably be the questionnaire.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.190
The focus groups is--
was very up hill.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.380
Okay. And, conclusion.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.790
The quest for determining the
link between language and identity

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.960
on the island of Puerto Rico has
lead to thought provoking results.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.290
The traditional viewpoint of
promoting Puerto Rican Spanish

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.770
as the bearer of Puerto Rican
identity and American English

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.490 position:56%
as the bearer of unwelcome
intrusion now appears to be evolving

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.670
into a modern attitude
of acceptance of the idea

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:14.810
that languages can function
independently of identity.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:19.050
Also, the two cultures present on
the island seem to be entwining

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.300
and creating a syncretic new
variety unique to Puerto Rico.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.550
To all appearances, it seems that
a new identity is being forged.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.430
One that is not linked to
any particular language,

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.860
but rather includes
the heart of a people

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.560
and their evolving traditions,
customs, and beliefs.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.250 position:56%
And you may access the dissertation.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.330
It's a really long
title, it's not the same.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.690
If you put my name on, Brenda
Dominguez-Rosado, it will--

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.690
the title will come up on
ProQuest at your favorite library;

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:51.290
probably the Library
of Congress [laughter].

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.200
Okay? All right.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.740 position:56%
Or, you can purchase my book online.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.040
It's on Amazon.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.460
I was looking for it and,
you know, this weekend.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.760
It's disappeared from other stores.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.060
I don't know.
