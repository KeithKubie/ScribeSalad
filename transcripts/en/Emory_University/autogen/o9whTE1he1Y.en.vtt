rich diversity which i think is a
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.080
rich diversity which i think is a
wonderful thing but it's a change we are

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
wonderful thing but it's a change we are
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.179
wonderful thing but it's a change we are
very fortunate I think and we also have

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189
very fortunate I think and we also have
 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.179
very fortunate I think and we also have
had a diversity in our influences we see

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189

over the world and we have to be
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.039
over the world and we have to be
vigilant about that but now our

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049
vigilant about that but now our
 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.069
vigilant about that but now our
lifestyle patterns emerge and so that

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079
lifestyle patterns emerge and so that
 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.369

we're focusing on a very difficult area
which is birth to 48 hours and how to

00:25:59.840 --> 00:25:59.850
which is birth to 48 hours and how to
 

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.750
which is birth to 48 hours and how to
improve survival in that window but if

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760
improve survival in that window but if
 

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.820
improve survival in that window but if
we're successful then this can be used

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:04.830
we're successful then this can be used
 

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.530
we're successful then this can be used
for any aspect of public health or any

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:06.540
for any aspect of public health or any

other kind of community effort for that
 

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.000
other kind of community effort for that
matter is a systemic approach so in any

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.010
matter is a systemic approach so in any
 

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.950
matter is a systemic approach so in any
event we are sort of halfway through

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960
event we are sort of halfway through
 

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.169
event we are sort of halfway through
this process now we are in

00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179
this process now we are in
 

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:20.419
this process now we are in
aged very actively in the community our

00:26:20.419 --> 00:26:20.429
aged very actively in the community our
 

00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:23.239
aged very actively in the community our
team is in the field a lot we are

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:23.249
team is in the field a lot we are
 

00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:25.519
team is in the field a lot we are
holding learning sessions every every

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:25.529
holding learning sessions every every
 

00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:28.940
holding learning sessions every every
quarter the teams identify ideas about

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:28.950
quarter the teams identify ideas about
 

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.590
quarter the teams identify ideas about
you know their own creative solutions to

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600
you know their own creative solutions to
 

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.710
you know their own creative solutions to
identifying pregnancy identifying or

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720
identifying pregnancy identifying or
 

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.389
identifying pregnancy identifying or
labor notification follow-up and so

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399
labor notification follow-up and so
 

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:37.129
labor notification follow-up and so
forth and then they test their ideas

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:37.139
forth and then they test their ideas
 

00:26:37.139 --> 00:26:39.619
forth and then they test their ideas
looking at outcome measures are they

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:39.629
looking at outcome measures are they
 

00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:41.180
looking at outcome measures are they
really increasing the number of women

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.190
really increasing the number of women
 

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.180
really increasing the number of women
who are identified and so forth and then

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:44.190
who are identified and so forth and then
 

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.950
who are identified and so forth and then
we'll compare across all of the

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960
we'll compare across all of the
 

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.080
we'll compare across all of the
districts in the project and look for

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.090
districts in the project and look for
 

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.730
districts in the project and look for
the most robust ideas and come up with a

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740
the most robust ideas and come up with a
 

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.529
the most robust ideas and come up with a
package of care that includes the

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539
package of care that includes the
 

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:53.180

practices but also the processes of
 

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:58.669
practices but also the processes of
getting that care into the home what we

00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679
getting that care into the home what we
 

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:00.200
getting that care into the home what we
hope to see at the end of the day is a

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:02.920
piece that's challenging is creativity
 

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.160
piece that's challenging is creativity
because you do believe that there's

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.170
because you do believe that there's
 

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.169
because you do believe that there's
business acumen that can be used here

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:07.179
business acumen that can be used here
 

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:08.880
business acumen that can be used here
but it's not business as usual so

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:08.890
but it's not business as usual so
 

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.500
but it's not business as usual so
someone's got to look at the problem and

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:10.510
someone's got to look at the problem and
 

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.110
someone's got to look at the problem and
think the same but different you know at

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120
think the same but different you know at
 

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.400
think the same but different you know at
the same time so you want to kind of

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:14.410
the same time so you want to kind of
 

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.590
the same time so you want to kind of
encourage that appropriate creativity

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600
encourage that appropriate creativity
 

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.299
encourage that appropriate creativity
and then I think the final piece that's

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:18.309
and then I think the final piece that's
 

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:20.310
and then I think the final piece that's
that's probably the biggest challenge

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320
that's probably the biggest challenge
 

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.049
that's probably the biggest challenge
not just for the business global the

00:31:22.059 --> 00:31:23.490
not just for the business global the
world at large is once you have these

world at large is once you have these
 

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.620
world at large is once you have these

distribution of returns it made you

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.090
distribution of returns it made you
 

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.460
distribution of returns it made you
excited it was actually kind of working

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:44.470
excited it was actually kind of working
 

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.930
excited it was actually kind of working
now you look at it this kind of

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:45.940
now you look at it this kind of
 

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.490
