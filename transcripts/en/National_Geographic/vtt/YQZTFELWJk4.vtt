00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.879
( applause )

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.848
Thank you for coming
out tonight.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.415 line:0%
It's a great group.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.884 line:0%
And let's take a step

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:20.619 line:0%
into my most favorite world,

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.821
away from the world of
human beings,

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:25.124
into the world of the jaguar.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:29.329
<i> I've been working on
 big cats and other species
 for over 30 years.</i>

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.331
<i> But nothing in the
 tropical jungles</i>

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:35.301
<i> has ever made my hair
 stand on end</i>

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.169
<i> like one particular sound.</i>

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.539
( Jaguar growl )
This is the guttural growl

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.407
of the jaguar.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.810
This is saying stay away.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.845
You've wandered too close.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.348
I've heard that sound
five times in my life.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.417
And it's never gotten
any easier.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.053
( audience laughter )

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:57.089
<i> The oldest jaguar we have
 on record</i>

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.192
<i>is that of the European jaguar.</i>

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:03.729
<i> In reaction to the
 Pleistocene ice ages</i>

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.432
<i> started doing what we
 now know is</i>

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.702
<i> a true characteristic
 of jaguars.</i>

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.137
In response to adversity,

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.474
in response to
environmental perturbations

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.409
the jaguar moves.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.079
<i> And it moves, and it moves.</i>

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.649
<i> Traveling thousands of miles
 eventually</i>

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.451
<i> throughout the Pleistocene</i>

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.354
<i> scattering in all directions.</i>

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.656
<i> Now by the mid-Pleistocene</i>

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.425
<i> the European jaguar
 went extinct.</i>

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.095
The earliest evidence we have

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:40.333
of early man and
jaguars together

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.869
comes about
4,000 to 11,000 years ago

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.806
where skeletons of early man
and jaguars

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.942
are found in the same place.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:52.411
In a cave in Texas
called Schultz Cave.

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.247
<i> There were at least
 12 civilizations</i>

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:59.251
<i> going from Mexico
 into South America,</i>

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.421
<i> but one of the
 earliest civilizations,</i>

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.290
<i> and where what I call</i>

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.793
<i> the Jaguar Cultural Corridor
 was born</i>

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:11.664
<i> was among a group of people
 called the Olmec.</i>

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.198
One author who studied them

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:15.267
called them "jaguar psychotics".

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.369
( audience laughter )

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.204
What the Olmec did,

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:22.208
they actually would deform
the heads of their babies

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.878
<i> in order to make them look
 more like cats.</i>

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:29.649
<i>They believed that children born
 with Down Syndrome</i>

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.450
<i> weren't anomalies</i>

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.152
<i> they were almost God-like.</i>

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.955
They believed that
Down Syndromes children

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.891
looked like those cats.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:41.427
And were a cross
between a female,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:45.531
a human female mating with
a male jaguar.

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.300
<i> Following the Olmecs,</i>

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.570
<i> the Maya carried jaguar
 iconography to new heights.</i>

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.374
<i> Always depicting jaguars
 never as just an animal,</i>

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:57.610
<i> always as something more.</i>

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.746
<i> Not just animal-human
 but beyond that.</i>

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:04.350
Jaguars controlled the
world that the humans
couldn't control.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.286
And if people wanted to control
the wild

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.523
they had to somehow
do it through jaguars,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.458
become one with the jaguar.

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.795
This was taken to its heights

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.964
with jaguar shamans.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:21.567
<i> And one of the things
 that the jaguar shamans</i>

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.836
<i> always sought to get,</i>

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.273
<i> to absorb were the eyes
 of the jaguar.</i>

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.041
<i> The eyes of a jaguar</i>

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:32.978
<i>were believed to be able to see
 into the spirit world.</i>

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:35.314
<i>Jaguars guarded the underworld,</i>

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:38.150
<i> jaguars were a link to the
 spirit world.</i>

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.286
The modern day Maya
still believe

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.955
if you wanted to see ghosts,

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.591
you-- animals can see ghosts,

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.360
you go and take
tears from an animal,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.295
rub your finger in an
animal's eyes

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:51.697
and then rub it on your eyes,

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.766
it's one of the most
unhealthy practices

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.434
( audience laughter )
in the world

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:58.637
and you can see, see ghosts.

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:01.441
Now all of this came to
an abrupt end

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.909
in the 15th century

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.644
<i> when the Spanish
 and Portuguese colonists</i>

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:09.148
<i> came and conquered the
 New World.</i>

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:12.418
<i> Now what the Spanish
 also brought with them</i>

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.855
<i> were just big, dumb
 hunks of meat on a platter...</i>

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.890
( audience laughter )
cattle.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.292
<i> And their version
 of cattle management</i>

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.961
<i> was to allow large numbers
 of cattle</i>

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.599
<i> to free range into wild areas.</i>

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.269
<i> The jaguar had no idea
 what this animal was</i>

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.970
<i> other than a big chunk of meat
 that stood there</i>

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.940
as the jaguar swatted it and
knocked it down.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.408
( audience laughter )

00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:38.210
So, what happened,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.614
jaguars were not seen
as semi-deities now anymore.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.249
<i> They were seen as vermin,</i>

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.750
<i> seen as pests.</i>

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.853
<i> And the only way
 to get rid of them</i>

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.387
<i> was to kill them.</i>

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:52.191
<i>And you value them as trophies.</i>

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.893
What really happened,

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:57.530
which almost destroyed
the jaguar

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.999
was the fashion industry.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.770
<i> In the 1960's,
 interestingly</i>

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.505
<i> in the 1960's</i>

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:10.409
Jackie Kennedy came out wearing
a leopard skin coat.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.078
In fact the man who created it

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.980
for her,
Oleg Cassini later said

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.151
it was one of the worst things
he ever did in his life.

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.386
Because he had no idea
what it would lead to.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:23.722
<i>That spurred a fashion industry</i>

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:26.925
<i> of spotted cat coats.</i>

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.695
<i>Jaguars were becoming wiped out,</i>

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.763
<i> as well as other spotted cats.</i>

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:35.601
<i> That's a real leopard skin
 around that dog by the way.</i>

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:40.306
What happened with this terrible
trade in spotted cat coats

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:43.342
is that all the governments

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.945
started to set up
new protected areas,

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.713
started passing new laws,

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:51.918
started banning jaguar hunting,
trade in jaguar skins.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.585
So this was good

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:57.389
but now the jaguar
had to come back.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:59.057
<i> Okay,</i>

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:01.861
<i> then a little boy named Alan
 steps into the scene</i>

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.729
( audience laughter )

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.599
<i> who knew nothing about what
 was happening with the jaguars</i>

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.001
<i> and other spotted cats.</i>

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.836
<i> I was a young man</i>

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:15.541
<i> but I had been born
 with a debilitating stutter.</i>

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:19.278
A really horrible stutter
to where I couldn't speak.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.546
It was called,
by the people at the time

00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:23.616
it was called "frozen mouth".

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.317
They didn't know
what to do with me

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:27.420
in the New York City
school systems,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.022
they put me into
"special classes".

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.356
They didn't know about

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:34.893
dyslexia or ADHD or many things.

00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:36.495
I just shut down.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.865
So I didn't talk to any adults,

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:43.202
which made them think
I was even more disturbed.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.204
But what I could do

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.673
is I could talk to animals.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.974
I still stuttered,

00:06:48.974 --> 00:06:51.277
now we know stuttering
is not purely psychological,

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.913
it's genetic.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.048
But I still stuttered
but I could,

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.550
I could express myself,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.251
there was no expectation,

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:02.154
no judging,
no speed-up, slow-down,

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:04.423
no calm down or
finishing words for me,

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.125
or anything like that.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.093
So, I could--
they became my life,

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.263
they became my friends.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.031
And when I had bad weeks
at school,

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.366
and there were many,

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.168
because back then there weren't
these things against bullying

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:17.970
and I was in a lot of fights.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.339
And I was always
in the principal's office.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.576
When there was a really bad
day at school

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.977
or a bad week,

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.647
my father would take me
to the Bronx Zoo.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:31.750
<i> And my favorite place
 at the Bronx Zoo</i>

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.252
<i> was what I called the
 "Big Cat House".</i>

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:36.188
<i> Cage after cage after cage,</i>

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:39.024
<i>concrete cage of lions, tigers,</i>

00:07:39.024 --> 00:07:40.592
<i> one lone jaguar.</i>

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:43.895
And I knew as a kid, it was
really obvious to me as a kid,

00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:46.732
here these really big, strong,

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.801
healthy, normal animals

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.305
and they're locked inside
these jails,

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.607
inside these cages,

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:59.945
by human beings
who they could kill instantly.

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:02.481
And the reason was

00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:04.549
because they didn't
have a voice.

00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:07.152
They didn't have a human voice.

00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:11.357
Imagine even today
if animals had a human voice

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.125
how we would treat them.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.693
How many animals would we keep

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:17.396
even in our nice zoos,
nice enclosures,

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.966
if they actually said,
"Please, I don't
want to be here."

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:23.535
Or, "Look, please,
stop feeding me that same food

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:25.671
you're feeding me,
it's really terrible."

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.839
How would we treat animals

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.741
if-- and that's the
only difference.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.944
They can speak,
they communicate,
we all know that.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:33.846
But they don't have a
human voice.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.881
They were me, I was them.

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.018
They became my haven.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.953
There was one lone jaguar.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.589
<i> This is a picture from
 my children's book.</i>

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.925
<i> And I would always spend time
 with that lone jaguar</i>

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:48.194
<i> because that jaguar,
 while all the other cats</i>

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.629
<i> charged and growled and
 made vocalizations,</i>

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:52.464
<i> that jaguar sat back,</i>

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:55.467
<i> and just watched people
as if the people were in a cage</i>

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:56.936
<i> and it was in charge.</i>

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:59.070
<i> And I would stand there
 and talk to it.</i>

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.973
And I would promise that jaguar

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.509
and I had no idea
what I was promising.

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:05.378
I was a very young child

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.746
I had no idea what there
was in the greater world.

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:11.050
All I knew was
my world was horrible.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.718
And I would promise him

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.821
"if I ever got a voice

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.791
I would be the voice
for the animals."

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.493
Now I had no idea
what that meant.

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.462
And it wasn't even about
the jaguars

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.397
as much as it was about me.

00:09:25.397 --> 00:09:27.099
But I did make that promise

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.036
every single time I stood by
the jaguar's cage

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.403
or the tiger's cage.

00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:34.406
And I never forgot that promise.

00:09:34.406 --> 00:09:36.709
Fast forward

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:39.478
20-- how many years,
I was about seven.

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:42.348
Fast forward about 15 years

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.815
or so in the future,

00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.051
went to graduate school,
studied eco--

00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.354
new courses called ecology

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:51.523
and animal ecology,

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:54.259
wildlife biology,

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:56.662
and I meet my mentor
George Schaller.

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:59.632
<i> I end up being sent by
 George Schaller</i>

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.701
<i> to this newly independent
 country called Belize</i>

00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.636
<i> in 1981.</i>

00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:07.606
<i> In order to try to see</i>

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:10.442
<i> why there are jaguars
 being actually hit</i>

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:14.146
<i> on the one dirt road
 through the entire country.</i>

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.981
Then when that worked out

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:18.350
he said, "Would you like to
go back for a few years

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.352
and actually try to
capture them,

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:21.954
study them, radio-collar them?

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.589
Do what nobody has ever done

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:26.058
in the rainforest habitat."

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:27.292
And I said, "Absolutely."

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:29.728
I had no idea
how I'd catch jaguars.

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:31.763
( audience laughter )
I had no idea

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:35.167
at first where even Belize was
when he first told me.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:37.836
<i> So I went down.
 Now catching jaguars
 wasn't easy.</i>

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:39.071
<i> I didn't know how at first.</i>

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.706
<i> The first time I built
 wooden traps two-by-fours,</i>

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:43.308
<i> I actually caught a
 black jaguar.</i>

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:46.311
<i> It chewed and busted out of my
 two-by-four traps.</i>

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.879
<i> Later I learnt from
 the Mennonites</i>

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.715
<i> how to build
 an iron rebar trap.</i>

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:52.618
<i> I captured jaguars,
 radio-collared them,</i>

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:53.619
<i> learned how to drug,</i>

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.421
<i> back then we didn't have vets
 showing us any of this,</i>

00:10:56.421 --> 00:10:59.325
<i> which wasn't good.
 It was very hit or miss.</i>

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.326
I mean, I used safe drugs

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.595
but jaguars weren't
always fully asleep.

00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:04.630
( audience laughter )

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.465
This was difficult,

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:09.502
it was dangerous and
it was great.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.902
It was my life.

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.105
This was what I was meant for.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.641
<i> One of the things
 which I noticed right away,</i>

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.476
<i> in the early days is</i>

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.478
<i> how jaguars have a voice.</i>

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.313
<i> How they do talk,</i>

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:22.448
<i> they communicate</i>

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:25.818
<i> with incredible amounts of
 different signals,</i>

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:28.453
<i> scratches,
 scrapes, fecal deposits,</i>

00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:31.189
<i> urine, feces in the scrape,
 urine in the scrape,</i>

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.825
<i> feces next to the scrape,</i>

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:36.128
<i> they have a whole language
 of how they communicate.</i>

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:38.431
<i> And I could see
 jaguars probably have</i>

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.266
<i> the most powerful jaws
 of any cat in the world.</i>

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:43.636
Now that's been proven
that jaguars

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:46.271
per pound of animal

00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:49.608
have the strongest jaws
of any cat in the world,

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:52.078
along with Clouded Leopards.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:56.114
<i> These are massively
 muscled, powerful jaws.</i>

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:59.417
<i> But the most incredible thing
 is what they do with that.</i>

00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:02.955
<i> Jaguars kill unlike
 any other cat.</i>

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:05.190
<i> All the other big cats</i>

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.293
<i> go for the soft, soft tissue,</i>

00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:11.764
<i> go for the throat,
 go for the underbelly.</i>

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.832
<i> Jaguars never do,</i>

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:15.400
<i> unless they miss.</i>

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.502
<i> Jaguars go for the skull.</i>

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:19.004
<i> Jaguars go for bone.</i>

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:22.107
<i> If it's small enough
 they will get its skull</i>

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.776
<i> and puncture the canines
 into the skull.</i>

00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:27.947
If it's too big,
like a 2,000-pound bull,

00:12:27.947 --> 00:12:30.549
it goes for the
spinal vertebrae.

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:33.519
And punctures those canines
into the vertebrae

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.521
and snaps its neck.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.423
Takes animals down quick.

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:43.061
It's a vicious, quick killer.

00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:46.031
<i> Eventually what I was
 to realize,</i>

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.634
<i> the European jaguar
 that had gone extinct</i>

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:50.502
<i> had never gone extinct.</i>

00:12:50.502 --> 00:12:51.737
<i> It had morphed.</i>

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:54.507
<i> It had travelled
 over into the New World.</i>

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.443
And the jaguar of
the Pleistocene,

00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:00.613
bigger, stronger had
morphed into

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.381
to a smaller, more
efficient predator.

00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:05.217
Short limbs, low to the ground,

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:07.252
low center of gravity,

00:13:07.252 --> 00:13:10.956
this animal capable of eating
anything and everything,

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:14.393
capable of taking down prey
with a single bite

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:16.662
or chewing gently
on a small bird

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.298
or an armadillo.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.266
<i> Its size was perfect.</i>

00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:23.302
<i> Its structure was perfect,</i>

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.803
I asked George Schaller

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:28.240
and the New York
Zoological Society if I
could stay longer and

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.610
<i> I set up the world's first
 Jaguar Preserve,</i>

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.412
<i> which ended being through
 no design of mine</i>

00:13:34.412 --> 00:13:38.350
<i>the first of all of the reserves
 in Belize,</i>

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.353
<i> which is now their number one
 economic import.</i>

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.855
<i>But the most important thing was
 this could give jobs</i>

00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:46.157
<i> to the Mayans who had been
 killing jaguars,</i>

00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:49.360
<i> now they were employed
 to protect jaguar.</i>

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.596
<i> By the end of the 20th century</i>

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.732
<i> the Jaguar Preserve
 had taken off.</i>

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.868
<i> Eco-tourism was booming</i>

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:59.137
<i> but it didn't seem to relate
 to the jaguar.</i>

00:13:59.137 --> 00:14:03.175
<i> The way people treated jaguars
 and other animals,</i>

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.377
<i> the way people viewed them</i>

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:09.614
<i> was still as
 a recreational outlet.</i>

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:11.483
<i> Maybe they didn't kill them,</i>

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:14.953
<i>so we played with them instead.</i>

00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:17.255
In 1999, I called together

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:18.957
all the world's jaguar experts

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.292
at a meeting in Mexico.

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:22.961
The point was, it wasn't many,

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:25.497
it was less than 25 people.

00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:28.333
The point was to try to get
all the knowledge

00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:30.702
of what we knew about jaguars.

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:34.005
Where did jaguars live
to our knowledge at that time?

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:37.776
<i> In 1999 we were able to
 determine about 51</i>

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:41.046
<i> what's called JCUs,
 Jaguar Conservation Units.</i>

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:44.650
<i> Places where we knew
 jaguars lived and bred.</i>

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.153
<i> By later in 2000 it went up to
 almost a 100.</i>

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:51.189
The point was to do triage.

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:53.625
That was the word of the time.

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:55.460
Let's take limited funding

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.762
and figure out what we can save

00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:00.365
in different kinds of
habitat types.

00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:04.803
So save just the highest
priority jaguar populations

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:08.540
in different kinds of systems.
That seemed great.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.676
<i> At this meeting there
 were a group of geneticists.</i>

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.444
<i> We were gonna use DNA</i>

00:15:13.444 --> 00:15:15.513
<i> and figure out how many races</i>

00:15:15.513 --> 00:15:18.183
<i> of jaguar there really were.</i>

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:19.784
Last line of their abstract,

00:15:19.784 --> 00:15:22.988
which set me back on my heels

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.957
was that they said,

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:29.160
"There is genetic flow between
jaguar populations."

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.828
That blew me away.
I'm not even sure

00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:32.797
they knew what they were saying.

00:15:32.797 --> 00:15:34.633
What that meant...

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:38.169
they were not able to find
any races of jaguars.

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:40.505
None. None.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:43.909
<i> The jaguar that roamed
 in Northern Mexico</i>

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.111
<i> up to the Southwest US,</i>

00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:49.414
<i> was the same jaguar
 as that in the neotropics</i>

00:15:49.414 --> 00:15:51.317
<i> of Central America,</i>

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:55.420
<i> was the same jaguar
 as the 300-pound animal</i>

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.789
<i> of the Pantanal in Brazil.</i>

00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:00.926
There was no other large
carnivore in the world,

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:02.695
still is not...

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:06.798
where there is no individual
races of that animal

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:10.936
which has been
defined through genetics.

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:14.006
<i> What it meant is that these
 places where we thought were</i>

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:16.875
<i> outside of jaguar range
 it was all important.</i>

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.277
<i> Forget triage</i>

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:20.311
<i> this was the animal
 of the Pleistocene,</i>

00:16:20.311 --> 00:16:24.382
<i> when faced with any kind
 of adversity, it moves.</i>

00:16:24.382 --> 00:16:28.687
<i> It moves until it finds what
 it has to find to survive.</i>

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.889
<i> This was the beginning of</i>

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:34.226
<i> what we call the
 "Jaguar Corridor Initiative".</i>

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.061
We were working
on the premise that

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:39.731
50 percent of
historic jaguar range was gone.

00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:41.700
<i> But the permeability model</i>

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.836
<i> showed that over 80 percent
 of jaguar range,</i>

00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:48.406
<i>while jaguars might not be able
 to live through all of it,</i>

00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:50.876
<i> can actually move through
 80 percent</i>

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.377
<i> of their historic range.</i>

00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:54.579
Still in this day

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:58.617
we're working on
4.5 million square kilometers.

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:01.452
That's what has to be saved
to save the jaguar.

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:04.722
<i> So we trained local people
on how to do interview surveys.</i>

00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:08.060
<i> We trained local teams
 on how to set up camera traps.</i>

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.796
<i> We trained ranchers
 and farmers on how to,</i>

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:13.399
<i> how to identify
 and pick up and collect</i>

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:15.634
<i> jaguar feces.</i>

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.970
<i> And we trained dogs,
 usually drug sniffing dogs</i>

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.274
<i> on how to only sniff out
 jaguar feces.</i>

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.708
Sometimes they mess up

00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:25.009
and it will be some other feces,

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:28.346
but usually only jaguar feces.

00:17:28.346 --> 00:17:29.914
<i> Then came all the hard part.</i>

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:31.749
<i> Fifteen years in the making.</i>

00:17:31.749 --> 00:17:34.218
<i>Country by country, we would go</i>

00:17:34.218 --> 00:17:35.888
<i> and do the genetic research,</i>

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.390
<i> it would show us that
 the corridor did exist.</i>

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.358
<i> Now this is an
 interesting thing.</i>

00:17:40.358 --> 00:17:43.928
<i> Our model ended up showing us
 breaks in the corridor,</i>

00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:45.697
<i> based on what we knew
 about jaguars.</i>

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:48.767
<i> Yet the genetics would say
 that there's no breaks.</i>

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:51.169
<i> Somehow jaguars are
 getting across.</i>

00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:53.438
<i> One of the most
 interesting areas</i>

00:17:53.438 --> 00:17:58.143
<i> was that right north of
 San Pedro de Sula in Honduras.</i>

00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:00.512
<i> And if most of you read
 the newspapers,</i>

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:03.248
<i> you'll know that that's the
 murder capital of the world</i>

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.016
<i> because of drugs.</i>

00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:08.586
<i> Now that showed up as a break
 in the jaguar corridor.</i>

00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:10.822
<i> But yet the genetics said
 it wasn't.</i>

00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:14.593
<i> So I hopped on a plane and
 went to San Pedro de Sula.</i>

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.729
<i> And it turns out that
 right outside of the town</i>

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.799
<i> of this city,
 there is a low mountain range.</i>

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:24.269
<i> And that mountain range is
 where the drug labs are.</i>

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.405
<i> It's where murders happen.</i>

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:28.907
Local people don't
go up in there.

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:31.075
They're afraid they'd
get killed.

00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:33.411
We spoke to some local people,

00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:35.647
we got the permission,
they accompanied us

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.382
and we went up in there.

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:40.418
And there are jaguars roaming
through there.

00:18:40.418 --> 00:18:43.955
The jaguars can take advantage
of that kind of thing.

00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:47.459
<i> So these small patches,
 which we would have ignored</i>

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.794
<i> and would've gotten
 completely cut down</i>

00:18:49.794 --> 00:18:52.230
<i> are now part of the
 jaguar corridor</i>

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.233
<i> and they're part of
 what we're trying to protect.</i>

00:18:55.233 --> 00:18:57.669
<i> Once we have the corridor</i>

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:01.039
<i> definitely mapped out of
where jaguars truly are walking</i>

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.908
<i> and we can prove it,
 we then go to the government.</i>

00:19:03.908 --> 00:19:06.578
<i> Once it gets signed into law</i>

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.747
<i> that means it's in the
 country's computer system.</i>

00:19:09.747 --> 00:19:12.818
<i> Anybody wanting to do the
 development in the country,</i>

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.453
<i> having to do an
environmental impact statement,</i>

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:16.555
<i> it then pops up</i>

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.257
<i> if it's coming through
 the jaguar corridor.</i>

00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:21.059
I assumed like many do

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:25.630
that the jaguar cultural
corridor was dead and
gone long ago.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.967
<i> In 2011, UNESCO declared
 jaguar shamanism</i>

00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:32.303
<i>to be one of the most endangered</i>

00:19:32.303 --> 00:19:35.340
<i> cultural traditions
 soon to be gone.</i>

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.641
<i> Now that's true,</i>

00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:39.210
<i> looking at what used to be</i>

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.580
<i> but as I also learned,</i>

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.083
<i> about the jaguar,
what the animal was capable of,</i>

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:49.187
<i> so I also learned that
 the jaguar cultural corridor</i>

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:52.123
<i> had not disappeared,
 it wasn't dead.</i>

00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:54.292
<i> Jaguars are still parts of
 ceremony,</i>

00:19:54.292 --> 00:19:57.796
<i> jaguar culture is still taught
 now to school children,</i>

00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:59.131
<i> they've never gone away.</i>

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.899
<i> But what has been
 so interesting,</i>

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:04.169
<i> there are many places where
the jaguars don't exist anymore,</i>

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:05.436
<i> where they are gone.</i>

00:20:05.436 --> 00:20:06.905
<i> The Mayans had a saying that</i>

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.773
<i> "when a jaguar dies,</i>

00:20:08.773 --> 00:20:12.143
<i> a star is lost from the sky."</i>

00:20:12.143 --> 00:20:14.713
In these places where the jaguar
was gone,

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.282
their sky was dark...

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.350
very dark.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.152
<i> They want jaguars back.</i>

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:23.055
<i> But they're gone,
 usually forever.</i>

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.723
We all have a voice

00:20:25.723 --> 00:20:28.827
but that voice has to be heard.

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:33.164
All of us have to
let our voice be heard,

00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:35.166
all living things.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:37.101
But for those who don't have

00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:39.871
the exact same voice as we do,

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:42.940
we have to better
learn to listen

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.944
and to understand that voice.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:50.648
And only through that
will we realize...

00:20:50.648 --> 00:20:52.250
how valuable

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.253
other living things are.

00:20:55.253 --> 00:20:58.957
<i> Not only to our own health
 and survival,</i>

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:01.959
<i> but to the health and survival
 of the planet.</i>

00:21:01.959 --> 00:21:04.829
<i> You have to hear that voice.</i>

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:06.765
Thank you.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.800
( applause )
Thank you.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.771
