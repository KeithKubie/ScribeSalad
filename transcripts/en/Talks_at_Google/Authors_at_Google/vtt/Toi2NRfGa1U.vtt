[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:08.490
SPEAKER: So it's my pleasure
to introduce Aaron Draplin.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.790
He's got a new book out called
"Pretty Much Everything"

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.360
about the mid-career tenure
of his design career,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.000
and that's available
in the back, as well.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.780
Aaron's awesome.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.670
He's got a fantastic
Marc Maron podcast out

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.920
if you haven't listened to it.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.794
That will pretty much
show you that he's just

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:27.141
so inspired by everything
that has to do with design

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.640
and is so passionate about it
that it rubs off on everybody.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.792
So without any further ado,
let's welcome Aaron, please.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:38.749
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:41.290
AARON DRAPLIN: This side of the
room, settle down over there.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.581
That side and all those people.

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:43.760
Hi, everybody.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.260
Hello.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.890
Hi.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.052
This is so-- no.

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:49.260
I gotta use this thing today.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.880
OK, everybody, thank
you for coming.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.879
I mean, of all
the surreal things

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.170
you get to do in your life to--

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.330
I use the product.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.280
I use the product.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.780
Thank you.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.890
Good job.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.940
We're here.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.960
We're broadcasting all over the
world, and this is a book talk.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880
I got to make a
book, and let me test

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.800
my multimedia real quick here.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.240
How's that?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.810
How's that?

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.800
RGB is looking
pretty good, and let

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.055
me get to that mosaic filter.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:14.430
How we looking in
the back there?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.680
Everyone look OK?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.320
All right?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.500
Good.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.335
Because I don't know
if you know what I do.

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:21.960
I mean, there are
definitely faces here

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.220
just doing that
kind of thing where

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.840
you're wondering
where you're at,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.756
and you're wondering why
you're looking at me.

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:29.590
It's OK.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.230
I'm a person.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.290
I come from a family.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.581
My name is Aaron James Draplin.

00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:34.062
I'm 43 years old.

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:35.020
I'm a graphic designer.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.240
I live in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.370
And I come from a mom, and a
dad, and sisters, and shit,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.560
an almost brother-in-law,
and I have a girlfriend.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.670
Oh, is she lovely.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.350
Look at her just
little bright spot

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.130
in the back there just radiating
beauty, and intelligence,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.690
and grace.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.760
Her name is Leigh.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.010
When you see this
in the book, this

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.523
is a spread that I didn't
get paid any money.

00:01:57.523 --> 00:02:02.420
And why I loved that is because
I made a life in graphic design

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.880
where it wasn't always about
just cash, or big jobs,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.732
or whatever.

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:07.940
It was about the power
sometimes of your mouse finger

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.735
and how it could
affect your buddy.

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:15.110
And then maybe there's a couple
of things I got paid for,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.470
but they're all there, and you
wouldn't know about that stuff

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.960
because maybe you would
know about me making logos.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.770
I would hope so.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
I love to make logos, and
I've kept myself super busy.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.020
9 out of 10 of these
were just for fun.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.330
In a lot of ways, I
tricked graphic design

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.300
into hiring me by keeping
myself busy because then people

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.760
couldn't tell what was the
big job or the little job,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.060
and then when someone big calls
reacting to something that I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.850
did for my buddy, I
manifested a life--

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.072
I tricked them in so many ways.

00:02:47.072 --> 00:02:48.530
Now, if you know
about Field Notes,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.988
well, these are
all over Manhattan.

00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:52.730
These are all over Brooklyn,
all over the whatever, New York

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.250
City, and we're
up to 2000 stores,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.040
but this was just because
I couldn't find ones

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.790
that I liked.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.846
So I made my own.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.220
Now, there's no
license for that.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.580
I just made my own, and
we're 13 employees now,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.900
which is really crazy.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.190
It could've just been me,
but we're a thing now.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.110
All these years later,
I've been making

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.193
posters for all these
places I've been able to go.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.770
I'm up to about 46
of the 50 states.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.180
Me and the Virginias, we're
not talking right now,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.080
but instead of putting my face
on one of these posters for one

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.852
of the shows I've
been able to go do,

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.310
we would make something for
Iowa that was a little bit more

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.170
like maybe your mom
and dad would like it--

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.290
dead logos, dead things,
colloquialisms, little sayings,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.080
and weird things that I
would dig up from my travels,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.280
or photos, or stuff.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.249
So maybe you know about
those or all the merch

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.290
I've made over the years.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.930
And there was no
bottom line to this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.131
that it was supposed to
be this thing where I

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:45.380
was supposed to make a profit.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.970
No, this was all just for fun.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.950
And I use all this stuff.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.030
That's rule number one.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.840
It has to be real, but there's a
charm to getting a ice scraper,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.215
or there's a charm to
getting a patch or a sticker.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:57.590
Well, I couldn't
call it the chip

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.680
clip due to proprietary reasons,
but it's called a snack clamp

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.140
at the DDC.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.620
You all eat chips,
so just settle down.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.060
That side of the
room, you really

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.670
got to just back off
just a little bit.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.080
Thanks.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.490
It's called crowd control.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.250
Now, if you know about me
messing with dead logos,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610
I love dead logos, and
you'll find a logo today

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.560
when we were at the Con Edison--

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.680
that's a classic New York logo,
and on the side of every cab

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.090
that's a classic New York logo.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.800
And if you know
how to look, it's

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.930
out there, but these are these
little diamonds of complete--

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.410
there's not one
pretentious element to it,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.790
and you guys know.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.230
You guys are inventing the web.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.120
I'm trying to make
a living, whatever,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.710
and it's like sometimes there's
just so much icing on the cake.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.990
And when you're out there,
I love taking photos

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.444
of dead stuff and in a
delusional sense using

00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:52.110
this in my work.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.460
So maybe you've seen this on
my Instagram or over the years

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.572
me championing these things,
because when it goes away,

00:04:59.572 --> 00:05:01.280
we're going to be at
the mercy of clicks,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.010
and likes, and
aggregated things,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.750
and then everything is a fucking
"Star Wars" remix poster.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.350
So that's kind of
where we're at.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.940
If you've seen one of these
shows, today is number 300.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.030
I think it's 300 in
the last six years.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.310
I have gone everywhere.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.590
We will be putting a dot
in Jackson Hole on the way

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.150
back out west this year.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.550
All of this stuff-- if
you know about me or not,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.870
it's all packed into a book.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.960
I got to make a book on a big
city New York City publisher.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.830
This is a new talk.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.080
It's called "We Got a Book
Deal!" or, well, our chance

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.820
to tell you about the
harrowing account,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.400
but I didn't get into graphic
design to make a book.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.230
I got into graphic
design to make a living,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.855
and that's just the
best way to put it.

00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:44.140
I know the people
who got into it to--

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.620
I get to be
backstage with them--

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.740
who talk a certain different--
just a different way

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.430
have such a certitude
how good they are

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.880
and how deserved they are
of making books and shit.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.280
If it didn't happen, I was cool.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.200
I had a great life in
graphic design already.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.222
I made that happen for myself
and my buddies around me,

00:06:03.222 --> 00:06:04.430
but I got to make this thing.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.200
So I got this call to the big
leagues, and that's Abrams.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.360
They're just up on--

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.970
I think it's 20th and something.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.680
Not that far from here.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.060
Big city.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.804
But this is a big league deal.

00:06:16.804 --> 00:06:17.720
Yesterday I was there.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.600
I was looking through a
Damien Hirst selection.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.030
Damien Hirst is on
some imprint of Abrams,

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:31.470
but people closer to me would be
like Sagmeisters is on Abrams.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.210
Victori was on Abrams.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.210
Those are big names in graphic
design, and art, and thinking,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.590
and sort of these
big provocative guys.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.550
And when I got that call,
I was kind of scared

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.220
because I don't weigh
in like they do,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.030
but that's me meeting
John, John Gall, my editor,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.430
and this is me
sealing the deal where

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.970
it was like I was afraid to
go do it because in my life

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.070
it's OK to say no and be small,
but this was scary territory.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.120
So that's how I threatened
him all summer long--

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.280
2015, too.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.250
Well, you get a contract.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.500
You sign that contract.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.054
It goes from zero to
shit's due quick, right?

00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:13.720
So everything was
cool up to that point.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.920
Oh, Aaron, we love what
you do and all that shit.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.010
And then it's going.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.420
So I'm cool with that.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.980
I know how to deal
with a client.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.640
I know now how to deal with
a bunch of smart people

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.400
in the city who are ready
to get this thing done.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.410
Now, compensation is
weird because all I

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.270
was ever concerned about was,
how many books could I get?

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.515
Because, yes, you get paid
to just be a part of it,

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:36.640
and that's usually how a
book works is you give all

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.540
this stuff in a shoebox like
you die is usually how it works.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.280
And then somewhere
an estate takes

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.320
all the big designer, and
name, or artist's work into--

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.130
out of her studio or wherever.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.110
They build a book
for the person,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.640
and then the book comes
out on the imprint,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.450
and that's how it goes, but I
was just like, I'm still alive.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.372
And I said, well,
who designs it?

00:07:57.372 --> 00:07:59.330
Well, we have two people
here in New York City.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.830
No, no, no.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.960
I dabble in graphic design.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.690
I do.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.610
Who writes it?

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.170
Oh, we got this smart
graduate [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.430
I'm writing the fucking book.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.280
So I got paid to
be a part of it,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.970
build it, and then write
it, which meant this.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.700
1,500 books?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.670
All right.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.000
So that's Barnes &amp; Noble price.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.510
That's what I got
paid, and I was cool,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.700
because in the game of
perception, if Abrams sold one,

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.427
I knew I had 1,500 to
go push on the road,

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:31.510
or give to all my buddies.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.659
Book number one went to my
mom, so that was worth it,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.690
but then that shit shows up,
and it would fill this stage.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.330
1,500 books-- I don't know
how to use a pallet jack.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.420
We screwed up the
elevator rugs and shit

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.730
because I had like 3,000
pounds of books in there,

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.090
and whatever, but
it's real easy for me

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.700
to get up here in front
of all this lavish crowd.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.160
See, what you guys
can't see on YouTube--

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.850
there are 10,000
people sitting here.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.140
Listen to them.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.290
[CHEERING]

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.310
There's 11 people.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.370
There's more people
in this fucking photo

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.930
than there are in
this whole room.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.630
Just kidding.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.500
I'm just kidding.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500
So thank you.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.690
It's really easy for me
to be like, I did this.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.360
I did that.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.860
I did.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.320
I'm great.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.600
I made a book and all that shit.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.641
There's a bunch of people
that make these things.

00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:29.560
I got to go do
this talk yesterday

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.370
to all the people at Abrams
who helped me make my book,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.300
and a year ago I went there.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.390
We're getting ready to
start seeing them show up,

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.300
and it was March of last year,
and I thanked every single one

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.370
of them hand over a cubicle.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.809
Thank you for believing
me and doing this thing.

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:45.850
It's going to be awesome.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.470
I can't remember their names.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.559
Ronny, Bobby, Ricky,
and Mike, Jackie--

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.850
I can't remember all the names.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.891
There are so many people.

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:53.950
They're all good looking,
and healthy, and nice.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.140
There's me and, of course,
John, but I thanked them all,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.860
and I did yesterday, too,
because this wasn't supposed

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.280
to happen, and yet they kind
of say authors didn't even

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.150
come into the office sometimes
because that's just business.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.439
Fine, but I'm going to haunt
all these people the rest

00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:14.980
of their lives with
this thing, and I

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.240
have to thank them for
letting me do this.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.500
Now, the schedule was weird.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.916
I thought it would
take two years.

00:10:19.916 --> 00:10:20.962
No, no, no.

00:10:20.962 --> 00:10:23.140
We did it in about
three and a half months.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.630
I got the call in
November of 2014.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.870
I bought DDCbook.com
that afternoon.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.250
Freaked out.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.190
Signed the contract five
months later in March of 2015.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.770
We started the book
in June of 2015.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.450
Had it done by September.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.070
Handed off by November.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.650
Printing January of last
year, and it came out May 17.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.530
So this idea of I got to
build, and write, and design,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.440
and compile for about three
and a half months, and then

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.730
just the process of whittling
down all the typos and things,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.837
and the first printing had 26,
but it took three months just

00:10:59.837 --> 00:11:01.670
to get it ready to hand
off, and that's just

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.550
called being published.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.169
The basic elements are
really, really simple.

00:11:07.169 --> 00:11:08.960
See, there's a bit of
a chip on my shoulder

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.094
because it's a great privilege
to be here with you guys.

00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:14.760
It's a great privilege
to have the book.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.520
It's a great privilege
in a weird way

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.200
to have people come after
you because they know

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.283
your name because you have
this book or something,

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.510
or because they know your
name from some poster

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.564
site or something.

00:11:24.564 --> 00:11:25.730
And I read all the comments.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.330
I'm a human being, and the idea
that I'm going to call this

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.710
a mid-career survey--

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.250
that just sounds so official.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.520
I wanted to show this.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.425
Pack in as much as possible
all the shit I pulled off,

00:11:37.425 --> 00:11:39.800
but it's kind of a chip on
the shoulder, because, listen,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.870
for every little turd
who's come after me--

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.810
grad students--
and come after me

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.820
because I've tried to
live a life creatively

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.160
and tried to live a
life ethically working

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.660
for clients I like and make
things I like even to a loss,

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.860
I'm a target.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.900
And I read that shit
as a human being.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.290
So making this book in a
lot of ways was a lot of--

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.850
one kid said that
Draplin's a one trick pony.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.996
I'll never forget that,
because I was like, well,

00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:06.380
there's about 16 in
that stage coach.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.690
I'm a little biased, but
it's like, man, you can't--

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.870
he doesn't know about this.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.090
That kid didn't--

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.160
I made snowboard
magazines for seven years,

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.510
but what's important is I
know my way around a grid,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.390
and snowboarding
doesn't look like that.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.030
Snowboarding,
skateboarding, and shit--

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.100
I mean, it's wild and
stuff, but we made our mag

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.920
so you could actually read
it, and read the articles,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.770
and look at the photos, and not
have it just bombarded with all

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.580
the latest tricks and shit.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.440
Now, that could
have been maybe--

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.410
if I dare-- a
dwell or something,

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.080
the things that I aspire to,
but they don't know that I

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.370
know my way around a grid.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.245
They don't know that.

00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:42.704
So how do you go back?

00:12:42.704 --> 00:12:43.370
They don't know.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:48.200
If you look at the top
row on the top right,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.690
that's not chicks in bikinis.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.950
That's a women's issue we
made, and the women had their--

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.784
we let them go for it.

00:12:55.784 --> 00:12:57.200
We're not there
to mess with them.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.880
We're there to say you're just
as valid on the hill as we are.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.500
Go.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.875
And they had their
women's issue,

00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.275
and it was super cool because--

00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:04.620
see, they don't know
about that shit.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.370
I'm proud of that.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.690
That's in the book.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.530
They don't know about 12 years
with Coal Headwear, where

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.570
it started with two
of us in a basement,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.380
and there's 20 or
30 kids there now.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.754
They don't know
about that stuff.

00:13:14.754 --> 00:13:18.300
I did every hang tag
for a decade on a hat,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.700
or every year for Union Binding
Company we'd make 50 logos.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.270
They don't know
about this stuff.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.040
So to be-- they're
like cheap shots.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.691
I've just learned the internet
is forever, at least right now,

00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:33.440
and when you leave
that stuff, that's what

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.796
you're going to be known for.

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:37.170
And it takes all my strength
not to go back to that kids.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.970
So making the book was kind of
a big old hairy, well, whatever.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.540
I know my way around the grid.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.760
Here's all the stuff I got to
make, and it's a simple system.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.440
It's some typefaces.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.560
It's a simple grid,
something there,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.905
write an essay, big old hit of
orange, some tricky content.

00:13:54.905 --> 00:13:57.670
That's my nephew,
Oliver, six years old.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.540
First tooth just came out.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.620
So cute.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.290
That's the light of our
lives, my nephew, Oliver.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.530
Last summer's lowest points--

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.560
well, it should say--
yeah, this was summer 2015,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.030
but I worked every day
that day, because it

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.300
was my shot to do it.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.750
And this shit that--

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.800
I was forced to do this.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.444
First of all, they came to me.

00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:21.110
They came to me.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.340
I didn't go to them.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.590
I'm not going to go knocking--
a lot of kids ask me,

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.910
how did you submit your
work to get into a book?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.580
I was like, what are
you talking about?

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.720
This was a record deal.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.740
They gave me the record deal.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.360
So when it was my shot to go do
it, I'm not screwing that up.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.990
I was scared.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.530
I was on a contract, but
I would leave the house,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.700
rip down to the shop in
Portland, work all day,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.391
and go home at 4:00
in the morning.

00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:47.390
And when I would go home
at 4:00 in the morning,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.160
I wouldn't even put my pants on.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.680
I would just drive
home with no pants on,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.650
and then it got so
weird that summer--

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.980
hello, to this side of the
room, all of you other 3,000.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.100
Hi.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.570
Hey.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.990
I wasn't wearing pants on
the way to the job at 7:45

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.990
in the morning, which is
a little tricky getting

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.020
onto the elevator out of
the basement at the shop.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.550
So no complaints, though.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.240
No complaints.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.960
I mean, I just worked
all day, 17, 18 hours.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.590
Now listen.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.670
Behind every 586
pound graphic designer

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.500
who is probably getting
a ticket, triple parked

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.430
in Brooklyn right now,
probably, well, not debatable,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:34.310
chafed, here in the city
sweating-- behind every one

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.500
of those graphic designers,
at least right now,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.140
is a patient,
patient girlfriend,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.640
and her name is Leigh McKolay.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.720
And she's right there.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.160
Just a little bright spot.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.380
Just a little butter cream icing
rose on a big orange turd cake.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.920
Look at her.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.419
Look at her.

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:50.540
Isn't she just lovely?

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.990
And please get a nasty
Prince song in your head

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.460
right now, something real wet.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.177
You got it?

00:15:58.177 --> 00:15:59.010
Because look at her.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.180
Isn't she lovely?

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.230
Isn't she?

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.740
God, what did you guys expect
for what you're paying?

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.320
Look at her.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.310
Look how sweet.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.325
She's three there.

00:16:06.325 --> 00:16:07.200
Look at the symmetry.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.660
Look at the symmetry.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.270
What is she doing
with me, right?

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.120
Graphic design
took me to Berlin.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.790
Leigh got hammered on that first
class trip over there back.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.849
It was great.

00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:21.390
She likes to sing, and I don't
even know what a salt cave is,

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.910
but that's the one person that
summer that really made sure

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.970
that I didn't eat out
of a bag every night,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.850
and would bring me stuff
to work, or get me home,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.970
and I would have a somewhat
regular meal for dinner,

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.350
and then work late.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.530
So I have to thank her,
because we're on this tour,

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.070
and this shit's not easy.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.610
I'm 43 years old.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.010
Leigh is-- I'm not
going to get into it,

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.470
but I want you to see
this because this is cool.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.310
She has shacked up.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:58.440
Gone right to the muck, and is
in it with me in this thing.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.421
And poor girl, but
she's around resources

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:04.170
because I'm doing this
stuff all the time.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:11.069
And that turd, Don Trump, no
one voted for him here, right?

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.099
For the crowd who's not here,
not one even motion of--

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:20.690
because if you did, you're
complicit, but she's pissed.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.890
Don Trump rattled
the wrong cage,

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.720
and she made these
little postcards.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.470
And we're selling them
at our merch table.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.290
Not today, but on the
road on this tour,

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.760
but that's my favorite one.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.890
Wait until our periods sync up.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.680
So you can send this to
your senator or congressman,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.420
and tell them that
they're stupid,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.130
and Leigh will
facilitate that for you

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.130
on her little post card.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.970
She's already raised two grand
for the ACLU with this thing.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.710
So if you go to
notes_to_self, you

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.660
can see her project starting.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.222
This is a person,
and she's pissed,

00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:51.680
and she's fighting
back creatively.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.580
And that's a lesson for all
of us and definitely me.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.580
I don't know what to do.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.150
I'm afraid of that turd.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.710
So I don't know what to do, but
thank you, Leigh, for coming

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.210
today.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.550
Thank you for
coming on this tour.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.880
Here's a shop tour.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.501
Now, that's the shop.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.000
That's it.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.110
That's where I get to be.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.400
There's no reception.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.400
There's no "Star Trek" doors
you walk through like we just

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.680
did 40 seconds ago.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.160
I saw them.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.175
It was cool.

00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:17.500
There was credentials and shit.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.000
I get it.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.730
We're at Google.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.704
Now, those are my two partners.

00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:21.620
That's John Phemister.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.540
That's Dave Nakamoto.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.510
There's no pants if you
don't want pants at my shop.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.930
I got to be with my buddies
for 10 years in this shop,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.190
and I love them for it because
this wasn't about some--

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.640
who hates you boss here?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.220
And no one's raising their hand.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.510
It's all being recorded.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.770
Who hates their boss here?

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.910
Couple half hands.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.900
Well, there's no boss here.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.610
We take care of each
other, and I'm just

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.260
so proud to even show
that I got to do it

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.980
in this with my buddies,
and get away with it,

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.450
and make a killer living.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.840
Take care of myself, and my
mom, and my dad, and Leigh,

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.532
and my sisters, and shit here,
amongst all my little trinkets,

00:19:00.532 --> 00:19:01.490
and goodies, and stuff.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.730
This exists.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.330
I've gone to all
these cool places

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.850
and saw cool cubicles and stuff.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.720
I know.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.850
But I can tell you this.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.129
I raced to get to
my shop every day,

00:19:13.129 --> 00:19:14.420
and I'm proud to even say that.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.800
That exists.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.510
Who's got a book?

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.480
He's flipping right now.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.360
It's a random page
flip, and he landed on--

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.410
good job.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.670
My summer has a carny.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.760
Do we have any
carnies in the crowd?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.650
What is this thing?

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.450
Do we have any
carnies in the crowd?

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.790
Well, I was a carny one summer.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.600
That would be 1994.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.540
I went out west as
a youngster in '93

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.550
to be a snowboarder with
all my asshole buddies,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:46.920
and how we got out there
was we had summer jobs

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.400
and all summer of '93.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.834
Went out the winter of '93, 19
years old, me and my buddies.

00:19:54.834 --> 00:19:56.250
If you haven't
done that yet where

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.750
you move somewhere crazy--

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.512
now, usually I'm telling this
to 22 year olds in a college--

00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:02.220
but if you haven't
done it yet, go do it,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.678
because it'll be
better when you're

00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:06.510
24 than when you're 43
like me, but we got it out

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.555
of our system at 19.

00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:08.430
We went and did this.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.170
Went all the way out
west, and then had

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.120
to come back with our
tails between our legs

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.720
broke and had to
work another summer,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.060
and I got this
job in a carnival.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.740
And it was a traveling deal
all summer long in Michigan,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.390
but there's a hierarchy
to this stuff.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.306
Someone owns all the
rides, and all the stuff,

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:25.620
and books, all the shit,
hires all the carnies,

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.210
but they run the thing.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.590
They rent to a food court.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.516
The food court hires us
as sort of college kids.

00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:32.640
We work for the food court.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.550
We're in a pizza wagon,
me my buddy, Chad.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.580
We started just a gentleman's
handshake all summer

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.840
with our guy.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.670
We're going to work 12
weeks, but underneath that,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.559
are the carnies all
the way at the bottom,

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:47.850
and we're not really supposed
to hang with the carnies.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:48.610
I mean, they're rough.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.070
They're kind of dirty, whatever.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.290
They're just kind of
hardscrabble people.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.580
But two weeks in, Chad and I,
we're doing our pizza wagon.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.070
We're noticing every night
there's a little table,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.550
and they're giving draws
based on daily earnings.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.370
So if someone worked and
they tore the stuff down,

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.230
or they put it all up,
and they ran the ride

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.720
with the carnies all day,
at the end of the day,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.220
they've got this little table.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.400
Get $5, $10, $15, and you do
that every night plus pay.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:21.870
They were charged to sleep in
these little air conditioned

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.790
sleeper units or something.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.720
Well, here's the deal.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.270
Three weeks in, every
night Chad and I-- we

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.800
would cavort with the carnies.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.960
We'd take them in
our truck into town

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.770
to go hit a supermarket, because
if you're not doing that,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.850
you're eating elephant ears
and pizza all summer long.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.780
And that kind of
worked for some people,

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.567
but we were going in
to kind of stock up.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.400
So we'd put people in
the back of our truck,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.290
and we became buddies,
and we were hanging out

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:46.998
with the carnies.

00:21:46.998 --> 00:21:50.100
I remember one
kid, 31 years old.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.380
He had his 15 or 16
year old kid with them.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.810
Just do the math on that shit.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.040
That's what's going on.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.620
So Chad and I, as
compassionate people,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.620
we're like, oh, all right,
these guys are cool,

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.470
but three or four
weeks in getting those

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.920
draws we say, hey, how
come you're not coming in

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.480
with us tonight to some kid.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.000
And he'd be like,
well, I'm broke.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.200
At the end of those two weeks or
whatever, they're taken a draw.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.240
They're getting the charge for--

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.240
some guys would be in
tents outside of their vans

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.020
driving along to save money.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.180
All that shit's taxed,
and sometimes people

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.599
would owe money to the carnival.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.390
They'd be like, what
are you talking about?

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.310
They'd work it off I guess
the next couple of days,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.240
but you know what?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.680
I had a mom and dad.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.570
I had a little bit of college.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.800
I had direction.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.900
I had this wanderlust
to go west.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.160
These kids don't have that.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.240
I had a support system.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.280
My mom and dad didn't cut
me a check to go west.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.790
We worked all summer,
but I had them help me

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.390
when I came back just to give
me my old room back or whatever.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.470
And it's like I had their
creative support and teeth

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.850
care, and these kids didn't.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.760
And Chad and I watched
this shit go down,

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.206
and we're watching people make
some bad decisions, maybe,

00:23:05.206 --> 00:23:06.330
because it's kind of like--

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.029
I don't know-- a gentle
indentured servitude

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.570
or something.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.090
Those carnies still have to
put those rides back together.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.410
These people were
legacied into this shit.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.570
So Chad and I, like a couple
of dumbasses from Midwest

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.280
with a heart--

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.400
we started watching,
and we started stealing.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.100
And how we did it is, when a
guy would come $4.75 Mountain

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.480
Dew this big.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.530
Give me a $5 bill.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.600
I'm supposed to give
him a quarterback.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.210
I'd give him change for a
$20, and we Robin Hooded

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.560
that shit the rest of the summer
and took care of these guys.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.400
And here's the deal.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.270
Do we have any
paralegals in the crowd

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.942
that know amusement law
in Northern Michigan?

00:23:44.942 --> 00:23:45.900
Do we have any of that?

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.970
Because I don't know
what the word is.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.570
Fuck it.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.487
I published the thing.

00:23:48.487 --> 00:23:50.319
I'm like, I'm gonna get
my teeth knocked out

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:51.530
or something when I go--

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.810
from some guy who's
pissed that I stole money

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.880
from them all summer long in
'94 to take care of the carnies.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.580
Got a tough crowd.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.360
I know lunch hour
is in 19 minutes.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.600
What do you see?

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.530
Is this even fun?

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.510
I just don't know.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:13.640
People are checking-- landing
planes off of laptops and shit.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.270
I don't know.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.860
We're human beings.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.520
I talk.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.210
I say things.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.750
You listen.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.060
You react.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.740
Now look it, when
I made Field Notes,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.090
I made them with my hands.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.580
Based on this stuff, these
are ghosts of the Midwest.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.570
Your grandpa, who had
them in his pocket--

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.870
that worked 100 years ago,
and it still works now.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:38.450
My phone, when it gets like
12%, I'm really uneasy,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.950
and that's a new thing.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.150
Little kids are born now.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.937
Their hands like
this in the womb,

00:24:43.937 --> 00:24:45.728
and they wake-- you're
gonna plug that shit

00:24:45.728 --> 00:24:48.400
in their hand [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:48.950
It's true.

00:24:51.654 --> 00:24:54.320
We're putting dots on a map with
our little Field Notes project.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.010
This is ours.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.800
It's ours.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.080
Any profit is ours.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.120
Any losses, it's ours.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.070
There's no board or
nothing like that.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.140
It's ours, and
it's a great lesson

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.600
that we can invent these
things for ourselves,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.530
because when I got free from
clients, and things, and stuff,

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.680
that's where I got to use
my earnings to go and invent

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.527
my life.

00:25:13.527 --> 00:25:15.860
That whole story about how
we made those is in the book,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.710
but I love to show a
spread in the book which

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.700
is totally vulnerable.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:25.610
This is every Field Note I had
in my pocket for the last 10

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.440
or 11 years or
whatever, and it's

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.800
like to show that in the book
was really important to me

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.420
because I want to
demystify how you make

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.130
these things,
because, listen, I get

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.060
to go be around the
people who totally

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.850
know how to talk this shit up.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:43.020
But really, it was there--

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.180
me making notes on paper.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.740
And that's where I was free,
and I could be organized,

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.870
make a list.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.060
Who here still makes a grocery
list on a scrap of paper?

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.620
People do because it works.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.180
You go into Whole Foods--

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.700
whole paycheck--
you go in there,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.200
and you can't concentrate.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.730
There's just a million things.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.050
That worked for your
grandma and your grandpa,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.470
and that works for us.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.020
And we forget that,
because our phones.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.990
I get it, but I love
to show that when

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.500
I had a sticker from a banana
I stuck it in my Field Notes.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.810
That's design, too, on a banana.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.570
And you can learn what it's
like to be packed on a plane.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.890
There it is.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.330
So that's where it was--

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.690
me drawing in my Field
Notes for all these years,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.887
and making a list, and
scratching everything off,

00:26:28.887 --> 00:26:30.470
and feeling free at
the end of the day

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.850
because it's not the
same with a swipe.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.880
It's not the same.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.420
When my phone dies, I can't
handle it, but on paper--

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.730
when they make you put your
laptop away on the plane,

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.930
out come my field notes, and
I'd make way better ideas there.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:50.720
There's me and Jim Coudal,
my captain, the den mother,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.320
my brother, who's really steered
this thing into something good.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.490
They're all over Manhattan.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.770
They're all over the nation,
and I have to thank him,

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.890
because my stupid little
non-idea became a real thing,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.380
and the whole story is in there.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.210
Today this came out.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.030
When I saw this in
Hollandale, Mississippi,

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.810
it just was so beautiful to
me-- this corrugated sign,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.491
the delinting factory
sign thing, the typeface.

00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:21.990
I was like, man,
what is that thing?

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.760
It's so simple.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.440
It's based on how many--

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.140
the grid of the corrugated
lines of this thing.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.930
So here's the first F word.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.390
It's so functional and perfect.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.460
And I just took a
photo, and that night

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.430
in my hotel room on
Highway 61 in Mississippi

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.290
I went looking for it,
and couldn't find it,

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.340
couldn't find it,
couldn't find it.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.840
So fuck it.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.062
I built it, and I built
that thing 2004, 2005.

00:27:47.062 --> 00:27:49.020
10 years I used it out
of Illustrator and would

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:49.620
hunt and peck.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.820
If I needed Google--

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.420
G-O-O-G-L-E-- and build it,
and use it in something,

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.260
until Riley Cran got his
hands on it from Lost Type.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:01.230
Built it into a beautiful,
beautiful three weight

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.310
character set.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.170
It works for 100 languages.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.550
It came out today.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.480
When you open my phone on
the way over, I put it up.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.160
Last night they put
it up, and then I

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.967
put my links up this
afternoon on my "instagrizz"

00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:14.550
and all that--

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.620
this morning on my
"instagrizz," and you

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.930
could just see the
things just flying in.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.340
We built a typeface, and I
mean, we got a site lit for it,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.802
but talk about revival.

00:28:25.802 --> 00:28:28.260
Now, see this is going to be
posted somewhere, but with all

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.450
those kids who are
buying DDC hardware

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.024
with my little typeface today--

00:28:32.024 --> 00:28:34.190
what they don't know, they're
getting a free poster.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.610
That comes right
out of my pocket,

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.560
and that free poster
has decimal equivalents

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.800
because that's where this
stuff was meant to work.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.800
This isn't cool, but we don't
have this kind of typeface

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.910
that's just meant to
be un-fuck-with-able.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:48.910
We don't have that.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.784
Now, I know you've got
a nice bunch of Google

00:28:50.784 --> 00:28:52.060
typefaces and all that.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.800
Good.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.550
That shit's great.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.440
It looks good this big
on a phone and shit.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.250
Great.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.490
But I want these things to
be looked to look shitty

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.340
when it says park
here, because when

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.620
someone grabs one of your
beautiful articulate web

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.630
faces and tries to
do it with that,

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.280
it doesn't work sometimes.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.040
So we built this thing
to work vertically,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.120
you or we have the
ogonek and [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.990
for thank you in Polish.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.440
I'm sure I'm butchering
that, but there's the ogonek,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.610
that little E thing.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.356
We have diacritics to
work for 100 languages.

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:24.230
So I'm proud of that.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.130
This thing can go
all over the world,

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.190
and whether or not it
sells, it's revival.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.690
I saw something
that didn't exist.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.130
I acted on it.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.450
It's not to be ironic.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.520
It's meant to just
be functional.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.597
So that came out today.

00:29:37.597 --> 00:29:38.430
So go check it out--

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.710
DDC Hardware.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.250
It'll be all over
my feed and stuff.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.580
That's going today.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.610
My favorite story from the book.

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.830
My dad, 1983-- I'm
nine years old.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.100
Takes me to a tigers
game with my uncles.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.620
I'm there.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.120
I'm nine.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.450
I'm a third baseman.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.561
You got your jersey,
your hat, your glove,

00:29:54.561 --> 00:29:55.560
and I remember going in.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.630
It's Polish-American
night, so my dad,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.270
who wasn't much of a drinker--

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.190
he liked to play up he was.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.240
Wasn't much of a drinker.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.140
My dad had a couple beers that
night, was feeling no pain,

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.390
and I remember we get there,
and he's a little wobbly.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.264
And I remember him
saying, don't worry, punk.

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:12.431
I'm going to get you a ball.

00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:14.555
My cousins who are with
me, they don't want nothing

00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:15.720
to do with a 9 year old.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.920
They take me down
to the railing.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.080
Get a-- I don't know--

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.550
batting practice ball, nothing.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.634
We go out to center field.

00:30:21.634 --> 00:30:23.216
Couple balls are
bouncing around where

00:30:23.216 --> 00:30:25.309
they're hitting homers and
shit, batting practice.

00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:26.350
Kids are diving for them.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.850
I'm nine.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.300
I don't know what to do.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:32.280
Now, 1983-- I don't have a
photo of my dad, but I do

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.850
have one from 2003,
and there's my dad,

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.650
and I like to call
this shot mid-sip.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.939
So my dad says, I'm going
to catch you a ball.

00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:45.480
And it's first
inning, second inning,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.330
you sing in the seventh,
and then eighth inning,

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.410
ninth inning.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.900
Ron Hassey's up to
bat, knocks one back.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.800
Foul ball.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.500
Top of the dugout, third base
dugout-- we're behind that.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.810
Bounces in front of us
two rows or something.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:02.550
My dad dives with his
beer, catches the ball.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.050
My uncles lift him up.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.011
Doesn't spill the beer, and
my dad caught me a ball,

00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:10.010
and he put it in my lap.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.551
And he goes, I told you I was
going to get you a ball, Aaron.

00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:15.210
He Babe Ruth-ed that shit,
and that's in the book.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.560
That's in the book.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.600
Now, we have a
little extra time.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.260
Turns out my dad did that
with a puck at a Red Wing

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.100
game for my Uncle Kevin 10 years
before me, so that is amazing.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.530
Another favorite section--
they're drawing me now.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.950
What am I supposed to do when
they hand you this shit at one

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:33.810
of these shows?

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.530
I don't know.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.690
Look, they hand
you that portrait.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.920
It's like this big.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.860
I'm not putting that up in my
office, but it was emotional.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.000
Look at the likeness.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.040
It's so crazy, and
that's my buddy John

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.860
Hammer in Tulsa, an incredible
painter, illustrator.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.240
Just an incredible person.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.610
I don't know him that well,
but I'll love him forever

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.850
for him doing that of me,
and now when I'm gone,

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.530
I guess Nakamoto, Leigh--

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.134
Dave put this up on my desk.

00:31:57.134 --> 00:31:59.550
Because I'm gone for 10 weeks,
so when the people come in,

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.860
they're like, why does he
have a painting of himself

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.500
on his desk?

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.720
That's there.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.240
They're embroidering me now.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.220
Yeah.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.920
When they hand you that one--

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.159
this is a buddy in Portland.

00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:13.200
I love them, but the eyes
are all wonky and shit.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.366
I know he did it on purpose,
but you just love them,

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:16.540
and you say it's perfect.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.956
You put them on your Instagram,
and then, of course, this.

00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:21.410
Bleh.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.250
This is in the book.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.670
Two spreads dedicated to all
the guys and girls who drew me,

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.389
and I thank them,
and it's so cool.

00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:30.180
We fought for this.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.620
The book is $40.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.690
It had to be affordable.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.690
MoMA today-- we're
going to go see it. $40.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.750
You bought it Amazon
preorder-- it was $24.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:43.500
I was so thankful.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.651
Will this thing support me?

00:32:46.651 --> 00:32:47.150
Sorry.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.270
S

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.210
$0.16 a page, not bad.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.420
It's amazing.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.334
I fought for that.

00:32:53.334 --> 00:32:54.750
We made little
sticker sheets that

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.770
went with it when we were done.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.580
This isn't Abrams.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.080
This is me.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.830
I just ponied up and
did these things.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.935
I made a little slip
case that was beautiful,

00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:03.390
and we saw these at
the shows, because I

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.230
wanted an American made slipcase
to hold this little gem.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.030
And those were
made in Wisconsin,

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.490
and they were perfect,
and I made those.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.230
We sold a mountain of them
the day the book came out.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.540
And we're on a book tour.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.190
Now look at her on
that orange van.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.130
Look at her.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.470
Buttercream icing rose.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:23.400
Look at her.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.200
Now we're going everywhere.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.150
Today's 300.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.950
I have to update this shit, but
we have gone so many places.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.830
Last fall alone we did 34 shows,
seven weeks, 12,000 miles.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.100
It was awesome, because, listen,
I went yesterday to Abrams,

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.450
people don't go on book tours.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.660
I'm going on a book tour.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.680
I wasn't supposed to
get to make a book.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.580
I'm supposed to go do a tour.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.330
We already did it.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.871
In the next two months, shit,
we're going to all these places

00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:48.390
right here.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.370
I mean, we're halfway through.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.949
I don't even know where
the hell Hampton Roads is.

00:33:52.949 --> 00:33:54.240
Does anyone know where that is?

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.690
I don't even know.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.470
They signed the contract.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.970
I'm going.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:56.640
I can't wait.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.230
And we're going to
Newfoundland, and we

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.250
got to come here
and tell our story.

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.150
We're in a tour van.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:08.739
It is quadruple
parked in Brooklyn.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:09.570
It's orange.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.514
It's orange, and listen,
it's a book tour.

00:34:12.514 --> 00:34:13.139
What do you do?

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.060
Do you put a graphic on
the side of that thing?

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.780
My buddies all came out.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.130
Hey, hey, we could wrap it.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.060
We could do this.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:18.630
I don't know.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.920
Should I be conversational?

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.719
Should I just kind of hard sell?

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.449
Kind of Massimo
Vignelli influence.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.949
Sort of just van.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:30.520
Graphic design.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.570
Thick lines, posters, and shit.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.427
Or tonight in that
halfway house these two

00:34:37.427 --> 00:34:39.760
are at right here-- these two
are at that halfway house,

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.600
and it's court ordered.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.654
And they get out of Google.

00:34:43.654 --> 00:34:45.070
They go back to
the halfway house.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.590
They get in the
meds and all that,

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.980
and then they get in there, and
the doors lock, and it's OK.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.770
They're healing, and they're
in there in their rooms.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.000
They look out their window,
look through the chains and all

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.500
this.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:02.350
They look out the window, and
idling in the drive is that.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.090
No, that's the van.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.810
MAACO orange.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.870
It's got a MAACO
factory paint job.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.780
So much money, but it's
orange all the way through.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.020
You open the doors up,
it's all the way orange.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:14.740
So awesome.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.830
When I roll it tonight in
the Holland Tunnel going

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.215
fast with 3,000 pounds of
books in that fucker, well,

00:35:20.215 --> 00:35:21.090
it'll look like that.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:22.744
So some numbers.

00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:24.910
First printing was sold out
before the book came out

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.514
May 17, 2016.

00:35:26.514 --> 00:35:28.180
Right away they go
into second printing.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.129
The third printing went
at the end of last summer.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.920
The fourth printing
went about a month ago.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.690
We're at eight months
into this thing,

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:38.420
and it's in its fourth printing,
and I can't talk about it,

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.400
but if you've ever been
to Cadillac, Michigan

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.440
at peak season in the summer,
there's about 31,000 people,

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.190
but I can't really
talk about the numbers.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:53.440
So in Grapevine,
Texas, we saw my book

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.432
on the bottom of the shelf right
next to "Design Basics Index,"

00:35:58.432 --> 00:36:00.140
and I just stood there
and kind of like--

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.210
Leigh was at the
Starbucks, and I just

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.070
stood there kind of
crying, like, holy shit.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.650
My book is at Barnes &amp; Nobles.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.670
It's at MoMA.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.120
That's the coolest, but you
can get it at a Barnes &amp; Nobles

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.590
in Grapevine, Texas.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.780
And I stood there.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.740
I flipped out seeing
that, and then of course I

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.800
cleaned off all that shit at
the top row, put mine up there,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.670
and ran out.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.150
So I got to go quick.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.100
I got to make a
logo for Mr. Obama.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.830
I vote for human
rights and shit,

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.510
so I was excited to help him.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.810
We saw a shit change
that day in 2009.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.470
Who went?

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.250
Who went?

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.042
Who went?

00:36:33.042 --> 00:36:34.750
Well, Leigh and I were
there representing

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.820
the good people of Google.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.710
I was a fan of this.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:39.910
I loved this.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.380
I loved what he represented.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.890
I loved intelligence,
grace, cool.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.180
That meant that to me.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.440
This was a new kind of campaign,
a new kind of president,

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.300
and he got it.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.230
And I was so proud
to support him.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.060
Now I get this call
from these guys saying,

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.527
hey, on a Wednesday, want to
make a logo for the president?

00:36:58.527 --> 00:36:59.860
Now, what are you talking about?

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.693
This is a Wednesday.

00:37:00.693 --> 00:37:03.010
These guys are
calling from Chicago.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.605
Now, I'm not supposed to
make stuff for him like this.

00:37:06.605 --> 00:37:08.980
Me and my buddy Chris Glass
made these logos for America.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.540
We did it over [INAUDIBLE]
days, busted them out

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.789
in my home town where the
good old boys-- and there's

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:15.580
good old boys in New
York, and there's good

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.650
old boys in stupid
Michigan, whatever--

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.930
they say horrific
things about Mr. Obama.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:21.725
I get it, but I
was at that thing.

00:37:21.725 --> 00:37:24.100
I said, well, you're back to
work on the road commission.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.670
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.503
Well, I did the logo
for the road commission

00:37:26.503 --> 00:37:28.690
you're back on for what
you just called him.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.520
So that's a weird
little thing, but I

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.280
got to work not just for
liberals, and blue, and shit.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.110
I got to work for America.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.494
When Fox News got us,
we had death threats

00:37:38.494 --> 00:37:40.410
because I worked for an
anti-Christ president.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:40.910
That's real.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:42.790
I have the emails.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.280
Four days later, Mr. Obama--

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.300
President Obama shows
our logos to America.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.913
We did it four days over a
weekend, my buddy, Chris Glass,

00:37:50.913 --> 00:37:54.520
and I. We got to
work for our country.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.080
Now this is my greatest--

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.350
it's all downhill from there,
but I wanted to meet him,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.950
and I'm on the road entertaining
precisely this section

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:04.780
of the crowd, people
like you guys.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.430
People like you
guys-- work release.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:07.240
Work release.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.340
I get it.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.190
I'm out there entertaining those
guys, and Leigh's back home,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.340
and we get the nod, and she
gets to go meet the pres

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.840
at the airport in Portland.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.316
And she goes, and she
does her best Jackie O,

00:38:19.316 --> 00:38:21.190
and gets all dressed
up, and rips down there.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.200
And I'm on the road
entertaining them,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.840
and she gets to meet the pres,
and I didn't, and I'm still

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.710
pissed.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.062
And after this shot,
he's right here,

00:38:30.062 --> 00:38:31.770
and you can't put your
phone in his face.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.940
All the Secret Service
tell you not to.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.890
And he goes to the next
one, and there he was.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.840
And she gets to her
car 20 minutes later,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.760
and she's near tears.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.600
We believed.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.010
We believed.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.000
Now what?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.930
Now what?

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.520
And we're terrified, but
for those eight years

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.690
I was so proud of him.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.770
And then ho ho--

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.439
and then last summer.

00:38:52.439 --> 00:38:54.730
I got you all right where I
want-- right in the pocket.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.989
I got you right where I
want you in that little--

00:38:56.989 --> 00:38:58.780
by the way, I've got
to tell you something.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.657
I've got a whole new
life going right now.

00:39:00.657 --> 00:39:01.990
I've got a whole new life going.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.050
You know what I discovered?

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:08.790
A whole expanse of freedom,
comfort, and movement.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:09.960
Stretch denim.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.880
I did.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.430
And I've got you in that
little pocket right there.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.388
Right where I want you.

00:39:13.388 --> 00:39:15.930
So then we got to
Sea-Tac last year.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.465
You know what lands?

00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:24.510
I'm there in my best Cabela's
bargain cave sweatshirt

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.980
or whatever.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.397
He gets off the plane.

00:39:28.397 --> 00:39:28.980
He comes down.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.560
He shakes the hands of all
the dignitaries in town--

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.700
Seattle.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.021
Comes running up to us.

00:39:34.021 --> 00:39:36.270
Gets about me to the corner
of the stage, and I just--

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.770
oh shit, I started
crying, because it was--

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.760
it's Barack, and
I believed in him.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.400
When he got to us, he
gets to Leigh right here.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.330
They know each other.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.320
Hey, Leigh.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.100
Hey, Barack.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.010
Fucking fist bumping and shit.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.641
When he got to me, all I could
say was, I'm going to miss you,

00:39:51.641 --> 00:39:52.140
man.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.160
That's what I told him.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.260
Now, I'm crying my
eyes out right there.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.230
And I guess because
he kind of took

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.930
pity on me I got the handshake.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.140
I got the hand clap.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.010
Leigh says he even hit me in
the shoulder, kind of buck

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:09.310
up kind of moment,
but if we go back one,

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.360
look at the face of that
Secret Service agent.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.140
That is not the
face of security.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.874
That is pity because
I'm crying my eyes

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:19.540
out meeting the leader
of the free world

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.040
just to say thanks for
having fucking dignity.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.710
He did.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.390
You can't take that
shit away from him.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.040
And this new turd we have--

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.670
now what?

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.910
Well, I got to work
for Bernie, too.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.919
I got to make three posters
for Bernie, which was so cool.

00:40:33.919 --> 00:40:35.710
And then a year ago,
we came to the Bowery,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.960
and we went and saw an art
show with all of our names.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.870
And we got to see, and then
he shows up in his arms,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.060
and elbows, and assholes, or
whatever, and I can't see.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.210
And there's a little bit
of Bernie right there.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.314
And it happened so fast.

00:40:52.314 --> 00:40:53.730
And there's my
buddy Luis Calderin

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.690
helping him up to his little--

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.260
my buddy Louis worked
for him out of Burlington

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.090
where Louis is from--

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.984
and worked for Bernie,
and got to help him

00:41:01.984 --> 00:41:02.900
on his whole campaign.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:08.510
And then Bernie does his
top 1% whatever, and then

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.280
there's Luis looking at me
going, why are you crying,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.730
Draplin?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.064
I'm in the back watching this
shit, and I can't see nothing.

00:41:16.064 --> 00:41:18.355
And then he's gone, and
there's lights, and motorcades,

00:41:18.355 --> 00:41:19.500
and shit.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.720
And I was digging
around the web,

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.060
and I found a photo for proof.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.270
I don't have proof,
but I found proof.

00:41:29.974 --> 00:41:32.099
There it is.

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:33.140
I'll do it one more time.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:33.940
We got-- no, no, no.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.648
We to keep going.

00:41:34.648 --> 00:41:35.942
We got to.

00:41:35.942 --> 00:41:37.900
Don't forget, you guys,
right this very second,

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.030
however you vote, love,
freak out, whatever--

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.570
right this very second New
York-- god damn New York City--

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:49.000
we are in a vast, mysterious,
infinite, big old question

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.690
mark.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.690
You can go this way
to 141st and Amsterdam

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.965
I think it is to where my
cousin Tommy lived up to 19

00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:59.620
or whatever when I was 25 years
old the first time I came here.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.244
You can go that way nine miles,
or 86 miles, or whatever it is.

00:42:02.244 --> 00:42:04.780
Now you can go this
way to Paramus.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.910
We go to Home Depot in
Paramus six more miles.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.960
Great, great, great.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.830
You can go 666 scrillion
miles this way right

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.470
this very second,
and that's real.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.430
This way 666 scrillion
miles, and that's real right

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:22.000
this second right now,
and theoretically we

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.940
could you go in this
direction indefinitely,

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.410
and that's real right now.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.970
Does anyone think of this shit?

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:28.960
That's real right now.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.170
I know your lives go by
faster here in this big city,

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:35.080
but I think about that shit,
and it brings me to tears,

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.910
and it's so beautiful
to me that I

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:43.600
get to be one little mole on the
ass [INAUDIBLE] grand mystery.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.430
That's real, because B--

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.810
A says you can go forever.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.780
B says, if you go quick
enough, you get to the edge

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:54.010
as existence is
creating herself,

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.350
as it's making
herself out there.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.320
What the hell is it
expanding into right now?

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.780
Or if you can go in
one direction forever--

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.490
I don't know-- just get cosmic.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.924
And don't forget that shit.

00:43:04.924 --> 00:43:07.090
If that turd in the White
House would think this way

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:12.060
just a smidge more, I think
we all could chill out

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.040
a little bit but, that's real.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.090
I'm blown away by it.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:15.930
I don't want you
to forget about.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:16.980
We got to go quick.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.040
Recent Nasties-- I missed a
space shuttle on unfunny shows,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.490
me telling all the Nike
execs at TEDx Portland

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.530
I don't need your money.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.446
Guess who doesn't get
calls from Nike anymore?

00:43:26.446 --> 00:43:27.160
It's OK.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.170
New Field Notes and logos.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:31.470
These are posters that
go to art education Inch

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:36.890
by Inch project out of Indiana--
my buddies Drew and Bob.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.530
My buddy made a
skillet company, Finex,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.580
and I got to do
typing logos for it,

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.090
and he's up to 28 employees.

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.520
That's so cool.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.390
My dad died.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.130
I got him tattooed on my arm.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.460
It was kind of looking a wonky,
and I got a bloody toothpick

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.164
somehow.

00:43:51.164 --> 00:43:52.330
I started art directing him.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.160
He got all pissed off.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.010
It's my arm.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.600
Dinosaur JR Poster,
which Hodgman

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.890
saw, and I made one for him
for his big comedy tour.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.650
This is right.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:04.238
My friend Maya and her
incredible little company

00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:05.737
she's making up in
Burlington-- it's

00:44:05.737 --> 00:44:08.040
going to be called
The Hungry Pea.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.030
This is stuff for Target
for a big art show in Aspen,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.190
but not as cool.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.360
Yeah, it's cool, but it's
kind of like rich people

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.210
go to that shit.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:19.650
I got to do one of the
first GBTA cards for Target

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.750
when you check out
because shit's changing,

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.570
and I'm so proud to
have helped in that.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:28.430
This is for Justin Vernon, big
Bon Iver, his big festival.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.180
I got to do the logo
and stuff, but I also

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.888
did the backstage
passes that first year.

00:44:31.888 --> 00:44:34.190
I know how to make the
crusty stuff as much as I

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.150
know how to make the fun stuff.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.352
My last Nike logo I'll
for a Janoski shoe,

00:44:39.352 --> 00:44:40.560
which is skateboarding stuff.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.247
I grew up in skateboarding,
and that's a big shoe for them,

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.330
and I got to work on that.

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:45.360
That was cool.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.682
Our third skill share is out.

00:44:46.682 --> 00:44:47.390
It's going crazy.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.265
My buddy [INAUDIBLE]
just somewhere down here

00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:51.181
in lower west side.

00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:53.430
And we're going to go see
those guys while we're here.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.804
They put me on a
magazine cover--

00:44:54.804 --> 00:44:56.740
how to kill a magazine 101.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:57.740
Some multimedia.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.650
Some multimedia.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.310
See?

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.300
It wasn't a problem.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.160
It wasn't a problem.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.192
Your Google shit was
detecting that there

00:45:04.192 --> 00:45:05.400
was something wrong, corrupt.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.990
No, no, no.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.290
It was a multimedia.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.260
Two million on that Vimeo link.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.829
Now little kids come up to me
in the airport with their moms,

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:15.162
and the mom lets her go, and
he little girl comes to me,

00:45:15.162 --> 00:45:18.122
and she says, are
you Adam Draklin?

00:45:18.122 --> 00:45:19.080
And I said, yeah, yeah.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.665
Hi.

00:45:19.665 --> 00:45:19.920
Hi.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.570
She goes, I want to make
logos when I grow up.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.190
That happened to
me a summer ago.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.140
She saw this video.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.764
Maron let me do his poster
for his show in Portland,

00:45:28.764 --> 00:45:30.180
and then he put
me on the podcast.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.055
That's my greatest hit,
so go check that out.

00:45:32.055 --> 00:45:33.960
It's real weird.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.802
Polish mugs.

00:45:34.802 --> 00:45:35.760
And I've been painting.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.610
I've been painting, and it's
just dumb shit around me.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.180
And my sister Leah's all pissed
because she said I gave her

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.360
a neck beard, and whatever.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.740
And look at my nephew, Oliver.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.409
So proud.

00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:49.200
He's on the ground.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.690
I'm up on a ladder, and
these are all the signs

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:54.690
we made for my dad's garage sale
last summer, because now I'm

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.190
patriarch in training.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.190
And mom says we need
signs, so me and Oliver

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.450
get to work that morning.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.890
We make signs.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.950
And do people know when they
were turning into that garage

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.541
sale they were being guided
by signs from the hand of one

00:46:08.541 --> 00:46:11.040
of the greatest living graphic
designers of this generation.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.123
They don't know that shit.

00:46:12.123 --> 00:46:15.070
They don't know that.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.760
Look at the concentration
on his face.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.260
He's at a third
grade reading level.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:19.870
He's in first grade.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:20.400
He's OK.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.030
He's healthy.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.810
Don't worry.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.010
He's in good hands.

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:27.390
A woman in Iowa, when
I did this, she goes--

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.100
it's a joke.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.300
I went to Guatemala.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.470
That was cool.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.069
So listen, we've got time.

00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:34.610
People I've met in
airports and shit.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.090
Look it, I met
Maron in an airport.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:36.870
He didn't remember,
but I remembered.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:37.911
Look at the face he made.

00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:39.570
Because who am I
walking up to him?

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:40.955
Well, I met him.

00:46:40.955 --> 00:46:41.580
Shook his hand.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.480
The catfish dudes.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.674
Chip Kidd.

00:46:46.674 --> 00:46:49.090
Before the book, he was like,
you're going to make a book,

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.064
and I was like, no way.

00:46:50.064 --> 00:46:51.480
And I got to make
a book, and Chip

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.950
said it was going to happen.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.010
Neil Hamburger.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:54.657
I met him.

00:46:54.657 --> 00:46:55.240
That was cool.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.440
It was awesome.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.120
John Hodgman.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.900
I was just on John's show last--

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.360
couple nights ago in Brooklyn,
which was really fun,

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.250
and usually it's
like real people

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.520
like Wyatt Cenac and Jason
Sudeikis, and Jon Hamm,

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.750
and then something happened.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.208
There was probably a hiccup,
and I got on the show somehow.

00:47:11.208 --> 00:47:12.110
That was cool.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.220
He's a buddy.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.480
I just did his new book cover.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.970
If you go look that up,
that came out yesterday.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.400
J Mascis came to my pop up.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:26.330
I grew up on Dinosaur Jr. I
love Dinosaur Jr. LaFawnduh--

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.620
yeah, came to the show.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.265
And then this turd I
met getting on my flight

00:47:33.265 --> 00:47:37.320
in Minneapolis down to Des
Moines, and so is Gene Simmons,

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.250
but I didn't go shake his hand.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.160
Fuck Gene Simmons.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.740
Well, right before
this, a guy walks up

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.240
with a Sharpie and his ticket.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.690
He's like, Mr. Simmons,
I saw you in 19--

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:52.370
I'm right there.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:55.550
Gene Simmons is right here,
and I'm standing there,

00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:00.676
and I can see the dyed
hair, the rock jeans.

00:48:00.676 --> 00:48:02.300
I'm looking at him,
and a guy walks up.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.270
He's right there.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.579
And I go-- he says, can
I get you autograph?

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:07.620
And Gene's got his phone.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.150
He goes back to his phone.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:15.640
I watched that, and I was like,
man, that guy slinking away,

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.800
that's who gave you the
$300 million you're worth.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.490
And you can sign his fucking
ticket, but he didn't do it.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.156
But so you know who
you're fucking with,

00:48:23.156 --> 00:48:26.390
I'm a Delta diamond
flyer, and I got upgraded,

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:35.010
and I made sure that I just did
one of these onto the big seat.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.664
And I get in the big seat,
and he doesn't, and then

00:48:37.664 --> 00:48:39.580
I'm in the big seat when
he comes up the lane,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.230
and then I go, well, hello.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.310
He's [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:45.610
We get off in Des Moines,
and the whole place

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.550
is looking at him, and we
get up to the baggage claim,

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:51.640
and it's all quiet and weird,
and people are looking at him,

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.260
and it's fucking Gene Simmons.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:59.800
And he-- I see him 50 yards away
stop for these three lady cop

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.944
things that are on
segues or something,

00:49:02.944 --> 00:49:05.110
and he puts his hands against
the wall, and he goes,

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.430
frisk me, officer.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.340
I saw that.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.895
And they're like, oh,
Gene, you lady killer.

00:49:10.895 --> 00:49:15.010
And he comes walking
up to us, and--

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.200
if I fall off this, I just die.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.840
Now, if he comes
walking up to us,

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.880
and he gets to
about right there,

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.845
and there's this
circle of 100 people--

00:49:24.845 --> 00:49:25.720
and he's right there.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.072
And his glasses come off,
and he's kind looking,

00:49:28.072 --> 00:49:30.280
and I have all my bags and
shit from the merch table,

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.482
and I just walk up, and I
go holy shit, Ted Nugent!

00:49:34.482 --> 00:49:35.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.190
And just walk out.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.830
So fuck that.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.050
I met Richard Simmons
in an airport.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:41.630
Look at that.

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.485
So, yeah.

00:49:42.485 --> 00:49:44.500
Boy, tough crowd, huh?

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:50.485
From Gene Simmons, who sucks,
to Richard Simmons, who rules.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:54.700
Wake up, New York.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.190
All right, thanks.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.430
When you guys are slumming
later on, go follow me.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.600
I don't care.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.610
I've already been paid.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.240
Thank you.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:04.782
Buy the book.

00:50:04.782 --> 00:50:05.948
We've got a stack out there.

00:50:05.948 --> 00:50:07.720
People figured out
how to get this thing.

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.530
Go get a book.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.160
They're fun.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.776
I'm a little biased.

00:50:10.776 --> 00:50:13.150
Go to the site and get some
merch, but thanks for coming,

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:14.785
you guys, and
listening to this shit.

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:18.760
And this is for my dad
always, so that's it.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.610
There's so many people it's
hard to wave to them all.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:31.460
[APPLAUSE]
