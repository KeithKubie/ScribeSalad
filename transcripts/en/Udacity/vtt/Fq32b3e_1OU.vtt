00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.900
By now you've been using Git to keep
track of the changes in your code.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.870
You've been pushing it to GitHub and

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.675
have a nice timeline of
your coding journey.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.223
[SOUND] Woah, Walter!

00:00:09.223 --> 00:00:12.210
Looks like your head's floating
in space in a Git timeline.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.210
Don't worry.
You're going to be moving forward,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.180
making commits and sometimes backwards,
if you make mistakes.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.380
You'll also be branching out, and
merging when the code is ready.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.570
We'll make sure you
don't lose your head.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.580
The content in this lesson will also
help you with your Git workflow by

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.500
covering some of Git's best practices
in the next project and beyond.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.920
If you're ready to Git
started let's Git to it.
