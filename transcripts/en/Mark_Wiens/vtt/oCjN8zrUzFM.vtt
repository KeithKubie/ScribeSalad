00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.516
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:04.110
I am in Angat, in Bulacan,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.314
which is about an hour and a
half away drive from Manilla.

00:00:08.314 --> 00:00:10.894
And today I have a very
special video for you today.

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:13.578
Myself along with Ying and Mikah,

00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:16.056
and also my good friend Anton,

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:17.674
and a couple of his boys.

00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:20.036
We took a day trip from Manilla,

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:20.954
to this city,

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.361
and this is a village,
a Gawad Kaling Village.

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.486
And Gawad Kaling is a
social entrepreneurship

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:28.906
within the Philippines that is helping

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.654
the poorest of the poor in the Philippines

00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:33.340
and not only, providing for them,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.940
but also finding a sustainable
way for many people

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.440
to live and to be,

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:40.955
to grow and to create businesses.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:43.505
We're gonna have lunch here.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:45.064
We're gonna meet some people

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:45.897
and just walk around,

00:00:45.897 --> 00:00:47.199
and so I'm happy to visit

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.838
and also to share this video with you.

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:52.421
(upbeat music)

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:58.788
- We have 50 families that
reside in this community.

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:00.822
- [Mark] Alright.

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:02.212
- The community actually started

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:04.270
the fourth year before the corn.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.650
The community was built in 2008.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.572
Is there are over 3000
communities all over

00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:11.276
the Philippines.

00:01:11.276 --> 00:01:12.834
- [Mark] Okay.

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.531
- Within that, this is the first farm.

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.472
Malaya.

00:01:15.472 --> 00:01:16.633
She's one in biggest
- Hi.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:17.664
- Hi.

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:19.589
Welcome to the community.

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:20.422
Community.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.381
I'm Malaya.

00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.964
I'm Malaya.
- Baby.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:26.181
- I'm baby Malaya.

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:27.704
- Baby Malaya, nice to meet you,

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:28.620
baby Malaya.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.506
- Welcome.

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.369
- Thank you.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.434
- Baby Mikah is asleep.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:34.490
So part of the aspect of the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.475
whole enchanted farm

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:36.914
is the local,

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:38.977
the locals who live within the farm.

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:40.099
- Absolutely.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.633
- So it's all self sustainable.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.168
People live here,

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:44.589
people work here,

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:47.095
and develop creative ideas.

00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:48.860
- So the biggest goal
is to eradicate poverty

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.258
for five billion families by 2024.

00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:52.502
And the first step,

00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:53.786
In doing that

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:55.456
is to provide them with housing right.

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:57.281
But then these communities
just give them a sense

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:58.762
of safety and security, right.

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:02.179
And now that do have solid
rooftops over their head,

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.472
they can actually switch
from survival mode

00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:05.517
to thriving mode.

00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:06.795
And the idea now,

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.035
is, yeah exactly,

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:09.341
to try to provide them with
opportunities on the farm.

00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:10.902
And now they can think about, you know,

00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:12.434
earning a sustainable income,

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:14.013
saving money on the side,

00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:15.744
and actually having plans for the future,

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:16.609
for their kids, right.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.459
Just be more hopeful and optimistic about

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.180
what's coming next.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.513
(upbeat tranquil music)

00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.834
We have two of our Tita's
here in the community.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:32.469
This is Tita's friend now.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.691
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:34.926
- And Tita Sellion.

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:37.915
- [Mark] Nice to meet you.

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:39.540
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.444
- Good morning!

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:41.438
Not good morning, good afternoon.

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:42.318
- Hi good morning,

00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:43.204
well it's still morning,

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:44.073
we're good yeah.

00:02:44.073 --> 00:02:45.178
It's a long morning, but yeah.

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:47.273
- [Mark] Oh I can immediately
smell some delicious food.

00:02:47.273 --> 00:02:48.106
Whoa!

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.463
- I have to put leek, you know?

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:52.614
- [Mark] Beautiful.

00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:53.580
- This green onion.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.612
Spring onion.

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:55.445
I will put that,

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:58.363
just like for the toppings.

00:02:58.363 --> 00:02:59.499
- This is chicken curry.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:00.704
- [Mark] Chicken curry, okay.

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:03.621
(foreign language)

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.229
- [Mark] This is carrot rice.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.637
- [Woman] Yeah.
- Okay.

00:03:14.637 --> 00:03:15.966
- [Woman] I hope you like it.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.897
- [Mark] It looks beautiful.

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.397
I already like it.

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:22.333
- Because the chefs are beautiful,

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.216
that's right.

00:03:23.216 --> 00:03:25.362
- [Mark] Yeah the chefs
are beautiful, yes!

00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:27.696
(laughing)

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:29.221
Is curried rice a common Filipino food,

00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:30.430
or you?
- I just experiment.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.571
I just started experimenting.

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.904
This is healthy,

00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.084
and it is a balanced diet,

00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.078
because it is a,

00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:38.551
very they say, go, grow and glow.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.165
So it comes only in my mind.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:41.711
So the goal for this,

00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.640
is sticky rice,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.275
and then the grow for this is the eggs

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:45.397
and the coconut milk,

00:03:45.397 --> 00:03:47.083
and then the glow for this, is the carrot.

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.288
That makes our
- It'll make your

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:51.744
skin glows.
- That makes our skin glow.

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:53.099
(laughing)

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.030
- Oh yes.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.397
The aroma's coming out of this kitchen

00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:56.400
are amazing.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.538
I'm like,

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.943
I'm in a,

00:03:58.943 --> 00:04:01.877
I'm in like a cloud of
carrot rice right now,

00:04:01.877 --> 00:04:04.209
and I'm loving it.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.292
Thank you so much for
allowing us in the kitchen.

00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:12.210
Oh.

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.372
What are you making here?

00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:15.280
- It's a coconut,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.532
veggies.

00:04:16.532 --> 00:04:18.308
- [Mark] Okay, vegetables with coconut.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:19.141
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.808
(meat sizzling)

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:24.385
- [Mark] Okay, are cooking one vegetable

00:04:24.385 --> 00:04:26.218
and mixed vegetable dish with some squash,

00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:28.411
some wong beans and eggplant in there

00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:30.201
and then she mixed it with,

00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.477
coconut milk as well.

00:04:31.477 --> 00:04:33.086
And then also frying over here in this pan

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:34.924

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:40.946
Oh it smells so good.

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.683
My mouth is watering,

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.869
for lunch.

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:45.140
Can you say that one more time?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.389
- OHGK.

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.231
- [Mark] It's called,
the drink is called OHGK.

00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:49.453
And it's a combination of

00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:52.115
- Oregano, honey, ginger, and kalamansi.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:53.624
- [Mark] Wow.

00:04:53.624 --> 00:04:57.499
Okay, and you are the one

Oh wow.

Oh that's wonderful.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.692
What really comes in nicely is the ginger,

00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:32.298
that you can,

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:35.249
and then it's just perfectly soured.

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.871
That's extremely refreshing.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.621
Oh the ginger taste is wonderful.

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:42.840
And the sweetness is coming from honey.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.673
Okay.

00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:47.680
Honey which is also from, the farm also?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.086
- Here and the surrounding
communities as well.

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:51.068
The next town, you'll see.

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:54.180
- Okay so they produce honey around here.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.513
(baby talk)

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:01.057
(upbeat music)

00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:06.884
- [Man] Would you like some more of the

00:06:06.884 --> 00:06:08.467

But you can smell it all Mikah.

00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:24.636
That food looks amazing.

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:25.834
Home cooked food.

00:06:25.834 --> 00:06:27.776
Got the rice, got the vegetables.

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:28.743
How is it Anton?

00:06:28.743 --> 00:06:30.169
- This is the best,

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.569
when it's a home cooked meal.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:32.457
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:33.331
It looks so good.

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:35.075
I'm gonna start with those vegetables

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:37.173

The rice is nice and gooey.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.386
Like glutinous.

00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:49.350
And then the vegetables are,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.279
kinda creamy with that coconut milk,

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.327
but nice and soft.

00:06:52.327 --> 00:06:54.471
I got a piece oqeur in that bite.

00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:55.757
It's awesomely good.

00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:57.293
- The vegetables are really good,

00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:58.268
by itself.

00:06:58.268 --> 00:07:01.761
- [Mark] All the vegetables
are from this farm yeah.

00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:03.344
I really wanna taste this Mongoose,

00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:04.635
which has been marinated,

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:06.622
she said is some calamansi,

00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:09.990
and also some soy and I
think ginger and garlic.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.823
Oh yes.

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.040
Mongoose is,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.535
one of the best things to
eat in the Phillippines,

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:17.315
and with some chili and this.

00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:18.732
Break this chili.

00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:21.560
Oh yeah.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.393
With some of the rice.

00:07:26.716 --> 00:07:27.549
Oh yeah.

00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:30.423
Oh I love it.

00:07:30.423 --> 00:07:31.958
Oh mongoose is,

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.375
such a good fish.

00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:35.680
It's so pure.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.513
It is,

00:07:37.596 --> 00:07:39.997
kind of has that dryish texture

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:41.512
similar to tuna.

00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:43.467
And also the chicken curry looks amazing

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:45.634
with carrots and potatoes.

00:07:47.272 --> 00:07:48.150
Wow.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.983
Mm.

00:07:50.362 --> 00:07:52.461
Yeah, the curry is really good as well.

00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:53.999
- [Man] But not as spicy
as what we're used to.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:55.855
- But it's very fragrant though.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:57.559
- But you have to eat the labuyo.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:58.418
The labuyo,

00:07:58.418 --> 00:07:59.872
you have to eat the labuyo.

00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:00.750
- What's the labuyo?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.615
- That one.

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:02.487
- This one?

00:08:02.487 --> 00:08:04.138
- It's a Filipino chili.

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:05.396
- I will chase it with

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:06.896
with labuyo, okay.

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:09.017
- Yeah.

00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:10.311
- [Man] He ate the whole thing?

00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:11.213
- Delicious.

00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:12.770
(laughing)

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:13.937
- Her doctors.

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:22.548
- And all of a sudden as we're enjoying

00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:24.102
this beautiful lunch,

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:27.387
it just started down pouring outside.

00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:28.801
It was kind of humid this morning,

00:08:28.801 --> 00:08:31.293
so I think the rain was coming.

00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:33.061
Oh but that's so refreshing.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:34.107
I love eating outdoors,

00:08:34.107 --> 00:08:35.652
especially when it's raining.

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:36.902
It's wonderful.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.789
(rain drowning out Anton)

00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:46.392
- The vegetables.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.308
Everything's good,

00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:49.637
but the vegetables' amazing.

00:08:49.637 --> 00:08:52.220
(upbeat music)

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.233
That was an amazing lunch.

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:02.582
Great delicious food,

00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:04.183
and especially the

00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:06.988
the generosity of the family was,

00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:07.821
amazing.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.106
It's still drizzling a little bit,

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:12.279
but we are walking around the farm

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:15.772
and seeing some of the social
entrepreneurship projects.

00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:19.105
(tranquil upbeat music)

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.724
One of the things that
they really emphasize

00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:31.744
at the GK villages
throughout the Philippines

00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:34.782
is that the Philippines
is such a rich country

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:36.289
with full of natural resources.

00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:38.627
And, they also really,

00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:41.772
make efficient use of the land,

00:09:41.772 --> 00:09:43.746
and so, at the GK village right now,

00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:45.966
we're walking around some
of the permaculture areas,

00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:48.679
and I just wanna read you this sign here

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.920
where it says permaculture.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.531
Means permanent agriculture
on an agricultural system

00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.754
or method that seeks to
integrate human activity

00:09:54.754 --> 00:09:57.111
with natural surroundings, so as to

00:09:57.111 --> 00:09:59.810
create highly efficient
self sustaining ecosystems.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.917
And so,

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:03.383
you can see on this map which is actually,

00:10:03.383 --> 00:10:07.130
this land right here, behind this sign,

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.027
they're gonna be producing,

00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:11.508
there's gonna be a pond with tilapia,

00:10:11.508 --> 00:10:12.925
bananas, gabi and

00:10:14.656 --> 00:10:17.156
then around they're gonna
have herbs like oregano,

00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:19.106
kang kong, which is water spinach.

00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:23.190
So it's a whole, it's an entire ecosystem

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.756
that really makes
efficient use of the land.

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:28.021
And then along with people that are living

00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:29.940
in this community and working on the farm

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.282
and growing the,

00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:32.516
and taking care of the agriculture

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:33.611
and the permaculture,

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:35.590
there's also students that
attend the school here

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.151
to learn about social entrepreneurship.

00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:39.815
So it's a whole,

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:40.732
not only a.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.227
Hello.
- Hello.

00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:44.060
- Hi.

00:10:45.374 --> 00:10:48.715
An entire ecosystem
that is self sustaining

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:51.296
and that is also profitable
through the projects

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:52.963
that they are doing.

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.741
(cat meowing)

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.069
(tranquil upbeat music)

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:02.894
(rooster cawing)

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:03.876
Whoa.

00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:04.709
Hey guy.

00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:09.521
You can probably guess pretty easily,

00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:12.092
but this is part of the
chicken raising facility.

00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:13.817
(rooster cawing)

00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:15.149
Oh hello.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:16.911
Whoa that's a huge chicken.

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:17.917
Oh the chicken farm,

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:19.042
the chicken range.

00:11:19.042 --> 00:11:21.940
Here we go, here's the sign.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.334
Check out the size of
that rooster in there.

00:11:26.334 --> 00:11:28.167
You're a huge guy man.

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.828
(rooster cawing)

00:11:31.828 --> 00:11:33.995
Look at that rooster comb.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:37.593
- I think we have about
a thousand chickens.

00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:39.135
We started one and a half years ago,

00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:42.364
where we only had around three hens

00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:44.641
that were able to you know do.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.886
- [Mark] Now how many
chickens do you have?

00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:48.133
- About a thousand chickens.

00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.103
- [Mark] About a thousand.

00:11:49.103 --> 00:11:50.301
- The thing here is that,

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.026
I also came from bombi,

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.630
and three years ago I didn't know

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.891
how to speak any English.

00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:56.083
- Thank you so much for showing us around.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:58.159
- There's not a lot of
social enterprises were open.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.742
- No, it was really

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.587
for me

00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:05.309
and I think for anyone visiting,

00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:07.408
I think the whole project,

00:12:07.408 --> 00:12:09.185
but also hearing the individual stories,

00:12:09.185 --> 00:12:11.463
that really is touching,

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:15.296
and is what really
empowering people that have

00:12:16.982 --> 00:12:19.632
come from some of the
most impoverished families

00:12:19.632 --> 00:12:21.291
in the Philippines and then giving them

00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:23.906
a chance here to do something,

00:12:23.906 --> 00:12:25.323
and to, really be

00:12:26.468 --> 00:12:28.339
to really use their skills.

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:29.515
- Yeah of course.

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:30.966
I mean our goal,

00:12:30.966 --> 00:12:32.683
obviously it's one of these big hairy

00:12:32.683 --> 00:12:34.711
outrageous goals to eradicate poverty

00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:36.054
for five million families.

00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:37.976
But again, obviously we
will never do it on our own,

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:39.324
and we're quite aware of that.

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:40.436
But the whole idea is to try to,

00:12:40.436 --> 00:12:41.895
inspire everyone right.

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.755
Be part of the spacial building movement.

00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.160
And that's exactly what it is.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.247
- It was really an amazing
opportunity to visit.

00:12:47.247 --> 00:12:50.580
Probably lunch was my absolute favorite.

00:12:52.445 --> 00:12:55.145
And, all of that home cooking,

00:12:55.145 --> 00:12:56.688
a big thank you to all of the Tita's.

00:12:56.688 --> 00:12:59.372
But then also learning
about the different stories

00:12:59.372 --> 00:13:01.628
of the individuals that go to school

00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:03.033
at the GK village,

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.461
and then also seeing the permaculture

00:13:04.461 --> 00:13:05.977
and the farm,

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:06.989
was,

00:13:06.989 --> 00:13:08.389
it's really fascinating.

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:09.800
I wanna say a big thank you to Anton.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.629
- Alright, hello.

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.512
- Great trip.

00:13:12.512 --> 00:13:14.319
And also thank you to the whole team

00:13:14.319 --> 00:13:15.152
at GK and

00:13:16.002 --> 00:13:17.773
all of the Tita's and Tito's that we met.

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:19.853
Thank you very much for

Bye bye, thank you for watching.
