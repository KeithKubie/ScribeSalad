00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.370
Vsauce!

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.000
Kevin here, and these three grains of rice
help explain why you are you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.720
Also, the knife and jar represent a hypothesis
for human sacrifice.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.959
We’ll get to that later…

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.480
Let’s start with you.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.850
You’ll be the green rice.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.150
You desire things.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.040
Love, respect, money, friends, wisdom, a cool
haircut, fame, YouTube views, shoes, a robust

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.570
stamp collection.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.940
Those ever-changing objects of desire are
the red rice.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.750
And you just want those things because you
want them, right?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.109
You know what you like!

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.670
It’s your free will to decide what it is
you desire.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.739
Maybe not.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.239
Anthropological philosopher René Girard didn’t
think so.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.660
While survival depends on satisfying biological
needs like hunger, desires are not innate.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.210
We’re not born wanting a fancy car or the
prettiest gown at the ball; desires manifest

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.170
from imitating other people.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.750
The subject we imitate for any given desire
is called a model.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.690
That’s the blue rice.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.800
Your mom is blue rice.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Your Dad.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Grandma Maggie.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
Albert Einstein.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.670
Harry Potter is blue rice.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.130
A model can be a person close to you or just
a person you’ve read about.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.900
And a Triangular Desire Relationship flows
from you imitating the model to receive the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.570
desired object.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.980
I want to be as wealthy as Bill Gates.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.020
I want to be as funny as my Aunt Maureen.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.530
I want to be as sexy as some sexy muscle-y
hunk.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.360
Why do I speak English?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.980
Why do you speak your native language?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.650
Because you imitated people who imitated people
because, aside from crying, imitating people

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.680
was the first thing you ever did in your life.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.229
Infants are able to imitate facial acts like
sticking out their tongues immediately after

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.289
being born.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.189
The youngest infant tested successfully imitated
42 minutes after leaving the womb.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.439
According to psychologist and infant development
researcher Andrew Meltzoff, that suggests

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:28.590
infants have “an inborn mapping between
the perception and production of human acts.”

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.599
Becoming you starts by… becoming someone
else.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.370
But it’s not just, “monkey see, monkey
do.”

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.739
Or conditioning a dog to dance for oranges.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.209
We project our own internal experiences onto
others to come to an understanding that, “Those

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.459
moving meat bags with eyeballs are ‘like
me.’”

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.319
Gaze following is a non-verbal triangular
communication between subject, model and object.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.560
Infants are more likely to gaze follow mothers
whose eyes are open rather than closed, leading

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.239
Meltzoff to hypothesize that an infant knows
when it closes its eyes the world goes dark,

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.299
so it must go dark for mommy, too.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.579
“No need to follow her closed eyes when
I know she’s not actually looking at anything.”

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.499
Humans are born imitating and human culture
evolved by imitating.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:33.200
Neuroanthropologist Merlin Donald says our
mimetic culture of imitation is the first

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.510
definitively human stage of development.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.010
Non-human primates do learn in social settings,
but it’s an “episodic culture,” meaning

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.090
they pay attention to the result of an action
and then figure out the method for achieving

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.670
that through trial-and-error rather than duplicating
the successful mannerisms they observed.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.059
Imitation is humanity’s cultural zero point.

00:03:56.059 --> 00:04:04.639
Long before we developed fancy words like,
“cultural,” “zero,” or “point.”

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.599
According to Girard, human society developed
as people copied one another’s desires to

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.569
the point of becoming rivals.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.220
If the object of desire is in limited quantity,
whether it’s territory or a girlfriend,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.109
the rivalry to obtain it eventually leads
to violence.

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.801
When the violence spread to a point where
society was at risk of collapse, everyone

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:30.040
got together and sacrificed a goat.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.650
More or less.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.590
The Scapegoat Mechanism is the process by
which group hostility is transferred onto

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.190
a single victim and banishing this victim
restores unity to the group.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.110
Illusionist James Warren visualizes this phenomenon
using a jar, rice, and a knife.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.629
Imagine that each grain of rice is an individual
person.

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.310
As their matching desires, jobs, love, and
wealth spread like a virus, they get closer

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.030
and closer until they’re packed so tightly
that rivalries emerge and friends, families

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.009
and neighbors turn into enemies.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.720
Violence is inevitable.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.860
With society at risk of collapse, someone
in the group is perceived as an outsider and

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.070
is chosen as the party responsible for the
chaos.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.780
All hostility is turned on the scapegoat and
social order is restored by uniting around

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.600
the common cause of banishing it from the
group or delivering the ultimate banishment

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.880
-- killing it.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.080
Girard believes scapegoating explains how
early human societies developed.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.849
In “René Girard And Myth,” Richard Golsan
details a myth from the Venda people of South

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:46.849
Africa.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.039
The snake god Python had two wives.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.500
During a drought, the second wife was seen
as a major disruption and was blamed for the

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.870
drought and the suffering of the people, so
she was killed.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.629
Her death triggered a flood and the community
was saved.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.639
After successfully uniting the group, the
scapegoat is sanctified.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.930
From there, sacrifices honoring the event
became a religious consecration.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.229
Sacrificing humans and later animals, like
goats - paid tribute to the Gods and the great

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.120
uniting scapegoat.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.010
The word scapegoat means, “a symbolic bearer
of the sins of the people.”

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.020
During the Salem Witch Trials, occult magic
was used as an imagined differentiator to

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.669
single out women as witches who were then
executed to restore peace to the village.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.099
Foreign-born Queen of France Marie Antoinette
was scapegoated as the cause of unrest during

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.880
the French Revolution and… off went her
head.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.789
Here’s the problem.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.290
Scapegoating can only provide a temporary
sense of contentment.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.470
Soon enough, rivalries flare up, a new scapegoat
is chosen and exiled, and the cycle begins

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.080
again.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.610
People actually become dependent on this cycle
as reflected in C.P. Cavafy’s “Waiting

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.870
For The Barbarians.”

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.139
In the poem, an entire city-state joins together
in solidarity and bases their behaviors around

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:21.979
the impending danger posed by the barbarians,
except… the barbarians never arrive.

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.580
It ends with confusion:

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.740
And now, what’s going to happen to us without
barbarians?

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.590
They were, those people, a kind of solution.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.080
Scapegoating happens at home, in school, in
online communities, and on social media.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.659
It’s an emergent property resulting from
mimetic desire, leading to mimetic rivalry

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:53.449
and ending in mimetic violence -- and a scapegoat
is chosen to quell the crowd.

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.490
You can see its underpinnings everywhere.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.030
Even disco.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:05.069
In 1977, Saturday Night Fever catapulted disco
music into the mainstream and its soundtrack

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:08.340
became one of the top-selling albums of all
time.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.539
Within two years, cultural dynamics ranging
from sexual and racial demographics to internal

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:19.740
strife among commercial artists led to disco
becoming a scapegoat for eroding musical values

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.340
-- and baseball’s Chicago White Sox capitalized
on the hysteria.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.699
They promoted a Disco Demolition Night that
featured crowd-supplied disco albums being

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.510
blown up during the middle of a doubleheader.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:38.169
More people united to participate in the figurative
death of disco than to watch the actual baseball

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.260
games.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.800
Disco was symbolically banished to appease
the crowd.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.880
The effectiveness of the Scapegoat Mechanism
is contingent upon the group being unaware

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.420
of its presence and being convinced the scapegoat
is actually guilty.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.090
By recognizing a group’s scapegoating, the
power of the mechanism is diminished and the

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.670
violence is revealed.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:08.100
However, because we’re mimetic creatures
-- because we imitate each other to the point

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.620
of contagion -- it takes active defiance in
the face of our very nature to step away from

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.200
the crowd and acknowledge the hidden force
in play.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.620
Which is really hard to do.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:30.209
It’s hard to stand out because… it’s
lonely.

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:35.800
As Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, who
himself was exiled from his society, wrote

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.990
in Notes From Underground, “I am alone and
they are everyone.”

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:53.060
Dostoevsky’s books have been translated
into 170 languages.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:59.889
People all over the world can learn from his
writings -- they can learn from him.

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:05.480
His mimetic influence spreads and survives
in a way more powerful than a genetic influence

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.990
ever could.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:18.130
He had four kids, but he has millions of grains
of green rice.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.610
By watching this video, part of you is now…
me.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:29.110
And if you consider that all of the information
and imitation passed down from generations

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.780
has been absorbed and been ingrained in you
throughout your life to develop you into you,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:42.120
you realize that, in a general sense, Dostoevsky
was wrong.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.899
They aren’t everyone.

00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:51.889
You are everyone.

00:10:51.889 --> 00:11:10.890
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.290
The person who inspired me to make a YouTube
channel was probably Tim Heidecker from Tim

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.260
&amp; Eric Awesome Show Great Job.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:24.470
His style was so accessible and it was just
a guy being hilarious and being weird and

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.330
having his own unique sense of style and comedy.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.530
And it spoke to me on such a personal level
that it was the first time that I'd considered

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.530
to myself, "Hey!

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.260
I'd like to do this too."

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.139
Hey I'm Destin from Smarter Every Day.

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:40.700
Believe it or not, I'm inspired to make videos
because of my children.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.550
They're curious little people that like to
learn and I want to be the exact same type

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:46.550
of person.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.970
And I want to learn stuff so they can watch
videos, in the future, of their dad learning

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.649
stuff.

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:57.639
I have looked up to Bret Michaels since I
was 13 years old.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:12:02.769
Just being a fellow type-1 diabetic and he
influenced me just by inspiring me and I wanted

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:07.660
to take that and inspire others in the best
that I knew how which was through my artwork

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.660
and through charity.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.480
I even keep his guitar in the background of
my videos.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.660
For me, guys like Jon4Lakers and SoldierKnowsBest
really showed that there was actually a future

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.740
in doing tech videos on YouTube.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.329
The person who inspired me to start making
YouTube videos is my friend and was my roommate

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:26.329
at the time.

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:30.960
NicePeter my his channel and it looked like
a lot of fun so he helped me make my channel.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.889
He gave me a leg up.

00:12:32.889 --> 00:12:36.110
As well as that time I got locked out of the
apartment - he gave me a leg up to get through

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.110
the window.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.110
'Cause we can't do it alone.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.000
My high school teacher definitely introduced
me to science communication but I think it

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.310
was Derek Muller and Henry Reich and ViHart
and Charlie McDonnell that were the ones that

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.510
inspired me to start my own YouTube channel.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.269
Because I saw what they were doing with this
new platform and I was like, "That's so cool!"

00:12:55.269 --> 00:13:02.320
Like, they highjacked this platform for cat
videos but are using it for science.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.650
The person who inspired me to start a YouTube
channel was Natalie Tran who makes Community

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.650
Channel.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.209
She is hilarious, she's a YouTube O.G. and
best of all, she is an awesome person.

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:15.170
And I'm please now to be able to call her
a friend.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:20.180
My inspiration, not just for making YouTube
videos but for making videos in general comes

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.810
from being a kid.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.850
As far back as I remember I've always wanted
to make movies.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.130
And the thing that inspired me the most was
horror films, strangely enough.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.589
When I was a kid, a young lad, my brother
who is older would always show me slasher

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:38.000
films and horror movies like Friday The 13th,
Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Child's

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.440
Play, Sleepaway Camp, stuff like that.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.660
And I loved them because they took you on
an emotional journey.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.319
It was spooky, it was scary but it was funny
and there was all these different emotions

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:54.529
that you felt while watching and I loved the
fact that something that I couldn't interact

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:57.290
with, something that was a passive experience,
something that I was just watching could influence

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.290
my emotions that much.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.730
And I wanted to be part of that.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.420
I wanted to be able to do that to others.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.630
And that's what inspired me to make movies.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.800
To be able to take people on some sort of
experience, some sort of emotional journey.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.540
And it just landed on making them in a scientific,
I guess, way.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.089
And that becomes the motivation for why we're
telling the story.

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.590
We're going on an informational journey.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.550
And it just fit.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.120
I was inspired to make my first YouTube channel
by Eric Fensler.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.260
I never met Eric Fensler but he is the guy
who made the famous G.I.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.459
Joe PSA parodies.

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:34.610
He took actual G.I.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:40.190
Joe cartoon Public Service Announcements and
overdubbed their voices with his own so that

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.170
they would say bizarre, surreal things.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.170
And the strangeness of these clips made them
viral.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.660
I think they were actually, if not the first
viral videos on the internet, they were certainly

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.449
in that first batch, that first generation
that showed the power of the internet.

00:14:54.449 --> 00:14:56.709
And I had to get involved.

00:14:56.709 --> 00:15:04.220
It's seemed so subversive and punk to be able
to take a thing and subvert what it meant

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.269
and not need to have the blessing of any gatekeepers.

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:09.680
It was just you.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.480
And over time what I was putting out on the
internet evolved into what it is today, science

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.480
communication.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:26.670
It enabled me to marry my interest in performing
and art with facts and knowledge and questions

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.350
and curiosity.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.079
I think that line is always blurry.

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:36.740
But man, I really am thankful to Eric Fensler
for making things that made me laugh and made

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.800
me want to aspire to make something similar.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.889
My main influence has always been my dad.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:46.950
He's a brilliant creator.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:52.240
He builds guitars for a living and now I build
videos.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.269
So because of him I knew I always wanted to
have a life driven by creativity.

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:02.269
And one of the creative projects I'm really
proud of t is The Curiosity Box.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:07.940
This is a subscription box filled with wondrous
items hand-picked by Michael, Jake and I.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.480
And it's like getting Vsauce delivered right
to your door.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.389
A portion of the proceeds goes to Alzheimer's
Research so it's not only good for your brain,

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:21.120
