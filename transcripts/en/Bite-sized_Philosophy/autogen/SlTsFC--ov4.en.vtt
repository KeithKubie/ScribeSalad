can you hazard a guess why Europe is

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
can you hazard a guess why Europe is
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.070
can you hazard a guess why Europe is
clamping down on speech critical of

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
clamping down on speech critical of
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.559
clamping down on speech critical of
Islam when Islam is causing lots of

Islam when Islam is causing lots of
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.480
Islam when Islam is causing lots of
problems with rape gangs terrorism and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490
problems with rape gangs terrorism and
 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.830
problems with rape gangs terrorism and

suppose the first let's say if I was

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980
suppose the first let's say if I was
 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620
suppose the first let's say if I was
going to oppose that statement I would

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
going to oppose that statement I would
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.890
going to oppose that statement I would
say well perhaps it's a propagandistic

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900
 
 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.650
 
what would you call it conspiracy to

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660
what would you call it conspiracy to
 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.280
what would you call it conspiracy to
blame what's happening in Europe on

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290
blame what's happening in Europe on
 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.660
blame what's happening in Europe on
Islamic immigrants I guess part of the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
Islamic immigrants I guess part of the
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700
Islamic immigrants I guess part of the
problem is is that at least as far as I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
problem is is that at least as far as I
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.959
problem is is that at least as far as I
can tell the news has become

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969
can tell the news has become
 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.299
can tell the news has become
sufficiently unreliable because it's so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
sufficiently unreliable because it's so
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.860
sufficiently unreliable because it's so
polarized that we can't really tell

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
polarized that we can't really tell
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440
polarized that we can't really tell
what's going on I mean I think the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
what's going on I mean I think the
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.979
what's going on I mean I think the
reason that Europe is clamping down on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
reason that Europe is clamping down on
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770
reason that Europe is clamping down on
speech critical of Islam is partly the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
speech critical of Islam is partly the
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.779
speech critical of Islam is partly the
same reason that the entire Western

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
same reason that the entire Western
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610
same reason that the entire Western
world is clamping down on speech that's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
world is clamping down on speech that's
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400
world is clamping down on speech that's
critical of anything that is associated

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
critical of anything that is associated
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.170
critical of anything that is associated
with group identity which is pretty much

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
with group identity which is pretty much
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540
with group identity which is pretty much
any set of ideas that unites people and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
any set of ideas that unites people and
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.800
any set of ideas that unites people and
it's it's a consequence of the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810
it's it's a consequence of the
 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.710
it's it's a consequence of the
collective decision that we've made that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720
collective decision that we've made that
 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.890
collective decision that we've made that
egalitarianism and conflict avoidance

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
egalitarianism and conflict avoidance
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050
egalitarianism and conflict avoidance
constitute the two highest virtues and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
constitute the two highest virtues and
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.640
constitute the two highest virtues and
they Trump everything else including

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
they Trump everything else including
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.539
they Trump everything else including
free speech now why that's happened this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
free speech now why that's happened this
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910
free speech now why that's happened this
very very difficult thing to say I mean

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
very very difficult thing to say I mean
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179
very very difficult thing to say I mean
I suspect to some degree that it's a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
I suspect to some degree that it's a
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.039
I suspect to some degree that it's a
consequence of women becoming involved

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
consequence of women becoming involved
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109
consequence of women becoming involved
in the political system which is

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
in the political system which is
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030
in the political system which is
something that we've never experienced

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
something that we've never experienced
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.050
something that we've never experienced
before and women are more agreeable by

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
before and women are more agreeable by
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780
before and women are more agreeable by
nature than men and agreeable people are

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
nature than men and agreeable people are
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.749

are compassionate towards those they see

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
are compassionate towards those they see
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700
are compassionate towards those they see
as suffering and that seems to include

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
as suffering and that seems to include
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609
as suffering and that seems to include
any minority especially when you combine

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
any minority especially when you combine
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.080
any minority especially when you combine
that with the kind of neo Marxist

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
that with the kind of neo Marxist
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.180
that with the kind of neo Marxist
doctrine that claims that anyone who has

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190
doctrine that claims that anyone who has
 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.210
doctrine that claims that anyone who has
that is swiped it and I think in the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
that is swiped it and I think in the
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830
that is swiped it and I think in the
Islamic situation you get it real

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
Islamic situation you get it real
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.040
Islamic situation you get it real
conflict there because it's obviously

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050
conflict there because it's obviously
 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.530
conflict there because it's obviously
the case that many Islamic practices are

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
the case that many Islamic practices are
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.900
the case that many Islamic practices are
not commensurate with postmodern

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910
not commensurate with postmodern
 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.450
not commensurate with postmodern
neo-marxist feminism let's say but they

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
neo-marxist feminism let's say but they
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160
neo-marxist feminism let's say but they
seem to get a free pass and I guess

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
seem to get a free pass and I guess
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.230
seem to get a free pass and I guess
that's because the idea that all

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240
that's because the idea that all
 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.670
that's because the idea that all
cultures are equal Trump's the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680
cultures are equal Trump's the
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.350
cultures are equal Trump's the
requirement for human rights for women

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
requirement for human rights for women
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320
requirement for human rights for women
and and maybe the other thing that's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
and and maybe the other thing that's
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.380
and and maybe the other thing that's
even dark there is that there's a fair

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
even dark there is that there's a fair
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.780
even dark there is that there's a fair
bit of revolutionary fervor in the more

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
bit of revolutionary fervor in the more
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.270
bit of revolutionary fervor in the more
radical end of the left political

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
radical end of the left political
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.430
radical end of the left political
spectrum and that radical further is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
spectrum and that radical further is
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560
spectrum and that radical further is
devoted towards tearing down the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570
devoted towards tearing down the
 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.120
devoted towards tearing down the
patriarchy and of course that's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
patriarchy and of course that's
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.140
patriarchy and of course that's
basically Western civilization and so if

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
basically Western civilization and so if
 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.610
basically Western civilization and so if
because Islam isn't part of Western

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
because Islam isn't part of Western
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.640
because Islam isn't part of Western
civilization then it can be seen as an

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
civilization then it can be seen as an
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.670
civilization then it can be seen as an
ally in that in that attempt that's what

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
ally in that in that attempt that's what
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.910
ally in that in that attempt that's what
it looks like to me I also think you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
it looks like to me I also think you
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800
it looks like to me I also think you
know that ignorance and and all of that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
know that ignorance and and all of that
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.220
know that ignorance and and all of that
contribute it isn't obvious that people

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
contribute it isn't obvious that people
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.520
contribute it isn't obvious that people
who are afraid of such things as

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530
who are afraid of such things as
 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.979
who are afraid of such things as
Islamophobia really understand anything

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
Islamophobia really understand anything
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.170
Islamophobia really understand anything
about Islam I wouldn't say I understand

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
about Islam I wouldn't say I understand
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.610
about Islam I wouldn't say I understand
anything about Islam even though I've

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
anything about Islam even though I've
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.530
anything about Islam even though I've
read if they're a bit about it it's very

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
read if they're a bit about it it's very
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.840
read if they're a bit about it it's very
difficult to put yourself inside a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850
difficult to put yourself inside a
 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.250
difficult to put yourself inside a
different belief system I'm somewhat

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
different belief system I'm somewhat
 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.860
different belief system I'm somewhat
apprehensive about Islam because it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
apprehensive about Islam because it
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.330
apprehensive about Islam because it
looks to me like it's a totalizing

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
looks to me like it's a totalizing
 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.750
looks to me like it's a totalizing
system as well as a religion and it's a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
system as well as a religion and it's a
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.699
system as well as a religion and it's a
totalizing system because everything has

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
totalizing system because everything has
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.770
totalizing system because everything has
to come under its purview including law

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
to come under its purview including law
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.250
to come under its purview including law
and and everything that goes along with

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
and and everything that goes along with
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.720
and and everything that goes along with
that there's no separation between

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730
that there's no separation between
 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.540
that there's no separation between
church and state and so I don't see how

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550
church and state and so I don't see how
 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.160
church and state and so I don't see how
that's commensurate with the Western

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
that's commensurate with the Western
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.080
that's commensurate with the Western
mode of existence and I don't think

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090
mode of existence and I don't think
 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.010
mode of existence and I don't think
people want to have

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020
people want to have
 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.200
people want to have
conversation because they want to say

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210
conversation because they want to say
 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.010
conversation because they want to say
well no everyone diverse as they are and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020
well no everyone diverse as they are and
 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.870
well no everyone diverse as they are and
important as that diversity is

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
important as that diversity is
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.180
important as that diversity is
apparently such that everyone has to be

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190
apparently such that everyone has to be
 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.490
apparently such that everyone has to be
represented equally the diversity isn't

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
represented equally the diversity isn't
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.920
represented equally the diversity isn't
really of anything about anything

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
really of anything about anything
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.960
really of anything about anything
fundamental and we can all get along

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
fundamental and we can all get along
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.250
fundamental and we can all get along
without a problem and I'm afraid that

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260
without a problem and I'm afraid that
 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.560
without a problem and I'm afraid that
that's extraordinarily naive and then I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570
that's extraordinarily naive and then I
 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.960
that's extraordinarily naive and then I
suppose there's also an element of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
suppose there's also an element of
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.820
suppose there's also an element of
something like Western guilt

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830
something like Western guilt
 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.010
something like Western guilt
I guess perhaps for what has been

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020
I guess perhaps for what has been
 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.380
I guess perhaps for what has been
described as our imperialist past the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
described as our imperialist past the
 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.300
described as our imperialist past the
there's been a very long term assault on

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
there's been a very long term assault on
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.789
there's been a very long term assault on
on the what would you call moral on the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799
on the what would you call moral on the
 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.020
on the what would you call moral on the
morality of the West

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030
morality of the West
 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.080
morality of the West
we're often viewed as the rapers and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090
we're often viewed as the rapers and
 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.790
we're often viewed as the rapers and
pillagers of the world and that sort of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
pillagers of the world and that sort of
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.260
pillagers of the world and that sort of
goes along with the environmentalist

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
goes along with the environmentalist
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.040
goes along with the environmentalist
ethos and so I think we do have a fair

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
ethos and so I think we do have a fair
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.750
ethos and so I think we do have a fair
bit of guilt about that whether it's

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760
bit of guilt about that whether it's
 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.170
bit of guilt about that whether it's
warranted or not I mean history is a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180
warranted or not I mean history is a
 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.580
warranted or not I mean history is a
bloody nightmare and it doesn't matter

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
bloody nightmare and it doesn't matter
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.230
bloody nightmare and it doesn't matter
where you look and I would say at least

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
where you look and I would say at least
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.140
where you look and I would say at least
the West has brought advantages along

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150
the West has brought advantages along
 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.200
the West has brought advantages along
with its disadvantages and I think that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210
with its disadvantages and I think that
 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.120
with its disadvantages and I think that
our attitude towards individuality is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
our attitude towards individuality is
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.090
our attitude towards individuality is
fundamentally correct and absolutely

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100
fundamentally correct and absolutely
 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.980
fundamentally correct and absolutely
vital and I would also say that the only

vital and I would also say that the only
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.050
vital and I would also say that the only

countries in the world that are
 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.180
countries in the world that are
essentially worth living in in any real

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190
essentially worth living in in any real

people who well who are what
 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.409
people who well who are what
contemptuous of being as we discussed in

contemptuous of being as we discussed in
 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.689
contemptuous of being as we discussed in
the last question and also angry with

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699
the last question and also angry with
 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.070
the last question and also angry with
the political system because they're

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080
the political system because they're
 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.899
the political system because they're
powerless or maybe they've been hurt by

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909
powerless or maybe they've been hurt by
 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.290

male authority figures that happens very

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300
male authority figures that happens very
 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.450
male authority figures that happens very
frequently and so they have absolutely

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
frequently and so they have absolutely
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.529
frequently and so they have absolutely
no trust in higher in hierarchical

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539
no trust in higher in hierarchical
 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.689
no trust in higher in hierarchical
structures and there you might add to

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699
structures and there you might add to
 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.640
structures and there you might add to
that to certain amount of laziness

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650
that to certain amount of laziness
 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.890
that to certain amount of laziness
because the thing about hierarchical

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900
because the thing about hierarchical
 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.899
because the thing about hierarchical
structures is that they impose values on

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909
structures is that they impose values on
 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.760
structures is that they impose values on
people and then in order to progress in

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770
people and then in order to progress in
 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.080
people and then in order to progress in
that value structure you have to

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090
that value structure you have to
 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.300
that value structure you have to
discipline yourself and work hard and

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310
discipline yourself and work hard and
 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.850
discipline yourself and work hard and
many of the radical leftists happen to

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860
many of the radical leftists happen to
 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.159
many of the radical leftists happen to
be very low in conscientiousness and so

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169
be very low in conscientiousness and so
 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.950
be very low in conscientiousness and so
they don't believe in hard work and they

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960
they don't believe in hard work and they
 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.420
they don't believe in hard work and they
don't believe that people get to where

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430
don't believe that people get to where
 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.959
don't believe that people get to where
they're going by hard work and then well

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969
they're going by hard work and then well
 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.490
they're going by hard work and then well
one other thing there's a group of

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500
one other thing there's a group of
 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.659
one other thing there's a group of
people I think who are basically

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669
people I think who are basically
 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.510
people I think who are basically
personality disordered and those are the

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520
personality disordered and those are the
 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.129
personality disordered and those are the
ones that have never had a positive

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139
ones that have never had a positive
 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.659
ones that have never had a positive
relationship with anything that was

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669
relationship with anything that was
 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.330
relationship with anything that was
masculine so whenever they see anything

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340
masculine so whenever they see anything
 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.760
masculine so whenever they see anything
masculine that has motive power and that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770
masculine that has motive power and that
 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.379
masculine that has motive power and that
would include authority and confidence

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389
would include authority and confidence
 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.100
would include authority and confidence
not just power they assume that that's

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110
not just power they assume that that's
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.110
not just power they assume that that's
tyrannical and it's part of the

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120
tyrannical and it's part of the
 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.969
tyrannical and it's part of the
postmodern assumption that all power

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979
postmodern assumption that all power
 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.070
postmodern assumption that all power
higher all hierarchies are hierarchies

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080
higher all hierarchies are hierarchies
 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.379
higher all hierarchies are hierarchies
of power when the truth of the matter is

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389
of power when the truth of the matter is
 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.719
of power when the truth of the matter is
is that hierarchies in the West are

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729
is that hierarchies in the West are
 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.399
is that hierarchies in the West are
usually hierarchies of authority and

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409
usually hierarchies of authority and
 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.230
usually hierarchies of authority and
competence and they're like they're

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240
competence and they're like they're
 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.969
competence and they're like they're
oriented towards getting a certain task

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979
oriented towards getting a certain task
 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.830
oriented towards getting a certain task
done and they actually do get the task

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840
done and they actually do get the task
 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.909
done and they actually do get the task
done so but we're dubious about our own

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919
done so but we're dubious about our own
 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:47.010
done so but we're dubious about our own
ethical what would you say integrity and

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020
ethical what would you say integrity and
 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.779
ethical what would you say integrity and
I guess that's also why it's a

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789
I guess that's also why it's a
 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.969
I guess that's also why it's a
particular importance for people to try

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979
particular importance for people to try
 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.309
particular importance for people to try
to act honestly because if you know what

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319
to act honestly because if you know what
 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.769
to act honestly because if you know what
act honestly and then you start to doubt

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:55.779
act honestly and then you start to doubt
 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:56.730
act honestly and then you start to doubt
your own take

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740
your own take
 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.140
your own take
and then when people come after you

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:58.150
and then when people come after you
 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.029
and then when people come after you
you're going to be weekd and that's a

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039
you're going to be weekd and that's a
 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.169
you're going to be weekd and that's a
really bad idea so
