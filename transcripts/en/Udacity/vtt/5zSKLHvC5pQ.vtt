00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There are three ways to watch these lectures.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A good way is to kind of watch them and use the Udacity discussion forums

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to interact with other people watching these lectures.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Something as better is these lectures are free and the don't really require any books or texts,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but there are books or texts and I would feel really guilty not telling you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that Alexander Osterwalder's "Business Model Generation" book is coming to store book

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for understanding the Business Model Canvas and the Startup Owner's Manuel written by yours truly

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and my co-author Bob Dorf is kind of a standard for customer development,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but let me emphasized again, these are not required and you can understand the lectures are just fine

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
without them but they'll surely help explain a lot of the detail in the 617 pages

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because it's almost an encyclopedia for startups.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Enough of the ad, that's the last time I'll mention buying the texts or books.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So the best way to watch these lectures is instead of just watching them to do everything above

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and also form a startup team and get outside of the building in between watching the lectures

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and so you're actually watching the lectures as a guide

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for lectures supposed to be doing week to week.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And one of the reasons we've kind of suggest that you instead of just watching the lectures

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to actually get out of the building and do it either by yourself or with your team.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The startups are not about lectures, an entrepreneurship is not about your grades

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and this class, it's about the work you do outside the building after you watch the lectures--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
not how much the lectures you watch.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Entrepreneurship is experience it, it's hands on, and it's immediate and intense feedback.
