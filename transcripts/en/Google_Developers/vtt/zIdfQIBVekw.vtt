[MUSIC PLAYING]

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:11.000
BRYNN EVANS: I'm Brynn
Evans, and I'm really

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.430
excited to be hosting
this conversation today

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.700
about what I consider
to be one of the hardest

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.030
things in design-- hiring and
building out a great design

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.360
team.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.200
I think this is challenging
for a number of reasons.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.910
For one, designers
are hard to come by.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.360
There's a lot of us in
the audience here today,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.510
but a lot of designers
are happy in their jobs,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.760
and it's hard to convince them
to consider a new opportunity.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.520
I think recruiters
face this a lot.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.320
I think as design managers,
we face this a lot.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.600
Once you've got designers
recruited onto your teams,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.330
growing their skills,
and their talents,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.170
and keeping them motivated and
engaged is really challenging.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
Smart people are
hard to keep engaged.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.820
And thirdly, I feel
that as you grow

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.940
your team or the needs of your
organization change over time,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.900
you need to constantly be
reevaluating your hiring

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.480
practices, where your needs are.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.020
And so you're just constantly
revisiting this timely question

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.170
of hiring and building
out great teams.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.400
So for me, this is particularly
timely, because I've recently

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.720
switched teams at Google,
as John mentioned.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.220
I was on a pretty large team
on Google+ for a long time,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.390
and I was helping with
hiring, and sourcing,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.340
and recruiting there.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.930
But what I found is
because I could staff

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.050
for a really large team, I
could find the best talent

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.104
and find a good role for
them on the broader team.

00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:33.520
And suddenly, I've
switched roles,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.706
and I'm on a much
smaller team in Android.

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.580
It really operates a
lot more like a startup,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.530
and I manage two designers
and one researcher.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.080
And suddenly, I want
to hire a new designer,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.820
and I have to be really picky
about filling that role,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.700
because I only have one slot.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.720
And yet, I need this person
to have really specific skills

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.240
to help me in really
specific ways, suddenly.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.270
So I've noticed, again,
needs shifting over

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.580
the course of changing jobs,
and roles, and things like that.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.220
So to get started, I'd like
to have the panelists quickly

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.127
introduce themselves,
say something

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:06.710
about their role and
their background,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.750
especially as it
pertains to hiring

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.802
and your experiences in the
past, and a point of view

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:13.635
that you have on hiring
or some perspective.

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:16.610
MIA BLUME: Cool.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.030
So hey, everyone.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.750
I'm Mia.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470
I manage product
designers at Pinterest.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.100
Before Pinterest,
I was at Square,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.690
so similar growth trajectory
but very different

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.219
product and relatively
different culture.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.010
And before that, I was
at IDEO for a while,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
which is a completely
different hiring spectrum.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.350
So from a design manager
leadership perspective,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.420
one of the things that
I try and think about

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.140
is designing the team.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.280
If you look at a description
for any design leadership role,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.260
you'll see things like scale
the team, deliver great work,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.380
engage your designers,
all business talk.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.880
But at the end of the
day, we're designers.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.330
We know how to create complex
systems, interactions,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.270
communication flows,
and environments

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.140
that are really
successful and creative.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.230
So that's definitely
a motto that I

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.150
bring to the table in terms
of how do we cultivate

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.100
a great culture, how do we
think about the composition

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.057
of our team, and how do
we all work together?

00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:21.140
One of the things that
I've learned along the way,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.980
just like being a designer,
being a design manager

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950
or leader, you have
to take some risks.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.930
And you're going to fail, and
that's OK, just like the things

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.700
that you're building
every single day.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.250
But you've got to
try something new.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.400
And what works for me may not
work for these guys, and so on.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.629
So taking risk and
trying new things.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.420
And the last thing.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.070
This is particularly
true for us at Pinterest,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.569
but I think it's true for all
of us because we're creatives.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.380
The most important
thing, I think,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.800
in terms of keeping
your designers engaged

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.060
is making sure that you
have an inspired team.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.050
If your designers are
inspired, whether it's

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.270
by each other, the projects
that they're working on,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.728
the environment
they're in, they're

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:02.632
more likely to create an
inspiring and creative product.

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:03.840
SOLEIO CUERVO: Hey, everyone.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.990
My name is Soleio.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.690
I was at Facebook
from 2005 to 2011.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.569
I was Facebook's second
product designer.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.860
While there, I got to work
on a bunch of core products,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.800
building out a lot of our
early features for our users,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.730
and overseeing our
visual design standards,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.390
and overseeing a
lot of our growth.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.905
The reason why I'm here is
along with building products

00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:25.700
with my colleagues there, I
was responsible for helping

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.400
to bring and attract
a lot of our talent

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.170
to the design organization as
we went through hyper-growth.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.460
After Facebook,
I joined Dropbox,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.600
where I led design
from 2012 to 2014,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.390
where we oversaw the growth
of the design team from about

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.410
three people all the
way through to-- I

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.990
think today we have
about 40-some designers

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.242
in the organization.

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:47.950
I wanted to come here
to talk to you guys

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.220
about understanding
core motivation.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.730
I think that at the end of
the day, any organization,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.850
its real competitive
edge is aligning people

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.860
to what the business
is setting out to do.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.460
And within the
design discipline,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.140
it's understanding a
person's core motivation

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.040
for being a designer.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.220
What gets them up
in the morning?

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.310
What is their dream work?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.090
What is their dream gig?

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.480
Who are the people that they
want to be affiliated with?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.410
What's the kind
of work that they

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.610
want to be affiliated with?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.380
Whether it be craftsmanship,
whether it be illustration,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.520
whether it be
visual storytelling,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.360
it's really important for you to
be able to concretely identify

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.950
what a person wants to do as
a designer, what brought them

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.040
into the field.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.990
And the thing that
actually worked for us

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.060
a great deal at Dropbox
was asking that question,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.840
having that conversation,
understanding

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.670
what led you to
become a designer.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.790
What is it that you take
pride in in your work?

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.640
What's the sort of
thing that you'll

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.290
do that you don't
have to be paid for?

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.090
And what are clever ways, from
an interviewer's standpoint,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.780
to solicit that?

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.437
We found that just by asking
the question, like, show

00:05:42.437 --> 00:05:44.270
us some side projects
that you've worked on,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.230
what are the things that you've
done that you haven't been paid

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.522
for, what's your proudest
design collaboration,

00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:49.980
you can learn a
lot of things about

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.070
whether or not a
person is not just

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.790
a great technical fit
for your organization,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.860
but also a great culture fit.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.590
One of the things
that we did at Dropbox

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.780
was articulate a set
of values around how

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.150
we want to conduct ourselves
as people, as a business,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.460
and make sure that those
values are described as hiring

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.275
attributes that we embed in our
hiring standards-- making sure

00:06:10.275 --> 00:06:12.700
that every single person that
we're hiring into Dropbox

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.540
exhibits the qualities
of being humble,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.540
being audacious,
people who are really

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.167
passionate about
[? the ?] details,

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:20.250
and people who are going
to be really trustworthy.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.690
Because it follows
that you're not

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.070
going to build software
that's going to help people

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.028
collaborate, you're not
going to build software

00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:29.800
that people are going to really
trust unless you hire folks who

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.041
themselves are worthy of trust.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:32.790
DANIEL BURKA: Hey.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.050
My name's Daniel, and
I'm a design partner

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.870
at Google Ventures.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.640
So Google Ventures is
Google's venture capital arm.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.100
We invest in about
250 companies.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.310
And that means that
I, as a designer,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.870
get to work with
those 250 companies

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.090
to help them to be
more successful.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.090
Previously, I've helped
run a couple of startups

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.060
and founded one-- two.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.156
Two startups.

00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:57.280
So I have a lot of experience
in the startup world.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.210
Now it's really
interesting to be

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.180
on the other side of
the fence and to get

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.590
to work with a wide variety
of startups-- everything

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.070
from life sciences
to consumer internet.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.580
And one of the things that
they often come to us with

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.310
is, like, oh, hey, we heard
design is like this pixie dust,

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.700
or we know that
we suck at design,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.100
and we want to hire a designer.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.060
And design's a really big term.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.770
And so we often help them to
either look at their design

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.951
needs either as
filling the gaps,

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.450
filling the holes
in their business,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.510
or looking at where the
biggest opportunities are

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.540
in their business.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.730
And even a small
startup that doesn't

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.250
have a designer,
somebody who wears

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.564
fancy clothes and a
cardigan, somebody's

00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:38.980
doing the design
at that business.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.240
And so what we'll frequently
do is talk to them

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.800
about the different
design skills.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.220
And we'll talk about visual
design, front-end development,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.560
copyrighting, product
interaction, and research.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.790
If you really roughly
cut up design,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.291
you might be able
to do it that way.

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.748
And then you look
at their business

00:07:54.748 --> 00:07:56.800
and say, well, where are
you guys the strongest?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.337
And maybe they have somebody
who's doing some copywriting

00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:01.295
or doing some research.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.450
But if you look at it-- and
the engineering-heavy team

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.440
might have great UI
development already,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.740
but they're weak on the visual
interaction standpoints.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.150
And that helps them
focus in on-- instead

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.800
of trying to post a job listing
for a unicorn-type designer

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.480
and go really broad
across everywhere,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.820
it helps them really focus
in and hone their pitch,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.130
hone who they're looking for,
and find the person who's

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.755
really going to help
them out the most.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.630
SHALIN AMIN: So
my name's Shalin.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.530
I'm the Creative
Director at Uber.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.079
And I kind of want
to start off with I

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:38.120
guess an intro to myself.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.100
So I started off at an
agency called Hot Studio back

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.950
in-- I don't really
remember the year.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.900
Probably like six years ago.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.180
And I worked out of their
San Francisco office,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.700
went to New York to
help them establish

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.240
a presence in New York.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.890
And then shortly after, I left
to work on my own startup.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.095
In consulting, you
tend to go pretty wide.

00:08:57.095 --> 00:08:59.320
You go understand
different verticals,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.020
such as automotive, and
health care, and science.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.700
But you never really see a
product from beginning to end.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.460
And so I was at a
point where I decided

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.085
I wanted to see what it takes to
build a product from beginning

00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:11.920
to end, and decided to
build my own startup.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.250
And so that process
and journey led me

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.690
to doing a round of
funding, essentially.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.110
And I was approached by Designer
Fund [? Rights, ?] pitched,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.140
and met a couple
of mentors, and got

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.760
in touch with Travis at Uber.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.270
And so that was the start
of my journey at Uber

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.100
and how I kind of got there.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.070
So I wanted to touch
on growth at Uber.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.240
We're about four, four
and a half years old.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.870
And growth has been
pretty incredible for us.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.290
And so I wanted to
throw out some numbers

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.380
around how fast we've grown over
the last two and a half years.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.630
Since March 2012-- so
today is September 2014--

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.060
it's quite staggering
growing a team from one

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.351
to x in just a short
period of time.

00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.850
And I'm hoping to
kind of cover some

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.975
of the hiring practices,
challenges, and failures

00:10:01.975 --> 00:10:04.940
that we've gone through.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.850
So the three things that we
typically look for at Uber

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.530
when we're hiring, and then
how we measure success,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.680
basically, around the
work, we define it

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.152
with speed, vision, and quality.

00:10:17.152 --> 00:10:18.610
All three are
essentially required.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.985
It's not like you have to be
amazing at quality and speed

00:10:20.985 --> 00:10:22.210
but not have vision.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.590
And during our
evaluation process,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.590
we also fine-tune and calibrate
for speed, vision, and quality.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.090
This is essentially what
we look for in candidates

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.020
when we're looking
at portfolios.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.596
And then the first
part is about the work

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:43.220
itself, and then how
they did the work.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.590
So that involves, what
does the process look like?

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.630
Do they work well with
ambiguity, constraints?

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.550
Do they have an ego?

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.024
Do they work hard?

00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:55.690
And then overall
communication, personal

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.600
and interpersonal communication.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.580
Yeah.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.620
BRYNN EVANS: Thanks.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.120
As you guys are talking, you've
all sort of touched on this,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.480
but I'm curious if there is
one greatest challenge for you

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.902
in the hiring process.

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:08.860
DANIEL BURKA: Sourcing.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.776
BRYNN EVANS: Sourcing?

00:11:09.776 --> 00:11:11.840
SOLEIO CUERVO: It's
basically identifying talent.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.370
Sort of if you take
this statement,

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.970
break it into two chunks, how
do you identify people out

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.980
there in the universe
that are great designers

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.424
or can be great designers.

00:11:19.424 --> 00:11:21.590
And two, how do you bring
them to your organization?

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.881
BRYNN EVANS: So what do you do?

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:25.555
DANIEL BURKA: Hey, if any of
you guys are looking for a job,

00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:26.860
come talk to us.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.592
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:29.050
BRYNN EVANS: So
that's what you do?

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.258
DANIEL BURKA: That's one way.

00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:32.640
BRYNN EVANS: You get up on
stage and you make a pitch?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.050
No, where do you
find talent, though?

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.860
SHALIN AMIN: I think
there's a variety of places.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.610
So at Uber, specifically,
we didn't really

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.404
have recruiters at
the very beginning.

00:11:41.404 --> 00:11:42.820
So we were leaning
on the networks

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.600
that we had amongst
friends and other people

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.100
that we had worked
with in the past.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.516
And now, luckily,
we have a couple

00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:50.690
of recruiters that
will go out and scan

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.940
the world for Dribbble, and
LinkedIn, and so on and so

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.740
forth, all the natural sources.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.620
But most of the
success that we've had

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.850
has come through our networks
of designers that we've hired.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.465
And really, when somebody's
able to step up to the plate

00:12:02.465 --> 00:12:04.862
and be like, I have a friend
who's really great at x, y,

00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:07.490
and z, we typically
don't hesitate

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.920
to reach out and contact them.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.956
But most of our talent
comes from in house.

00:12:11.956 --> 00:12:14.330
MIA BLUME: Actually, I think
one of the larger challenges

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.660
is getting the timing right.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.300
So not just having
this source list

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.140
of designers or a
pool of designers

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.580
that you want to talk
to, but the timing.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.410
So engaging with them
at the right time,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.010
because most designers
out there have great jobs.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.176
And so knowing how to build
a relationship with them

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:32.550
over a period of
time and knowing

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.500
when the timing is right.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.342
BRYNN EVANS: How do you
do that at Pinterest?

00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:38.800
MIA BLUME: A lot
of it is the team.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.240
So networks, I think,
are the strongest way

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.100
to bridge the gap between these
two different problem sets.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.230
So finding people that
you want to work with,

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.910
but also getting them in
and working with them.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.090
So having the designers actually
engage in the community,

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.070
be out there, build
relationships with designers,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.540
bring them over, have lunch
with them, whatever it is,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.980
depending on that designer.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.720
But knowing that
it may be a longer

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.930
game than a couple
of weeks or a month.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:03.680
BRYNN EVANS: Yeah.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.510
I've noticed that, too.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.480
I feel like it's easier said
than done in a lot of ways.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.110
I've been on both sides of
it, where there's candidates

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.920
I'm interested in,
and then I need

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.290
to remember to stay
in touch with them

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.514
and keep them on
the long-term radar

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:17.180
even if they're not
available right now.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.790
And in turn, I've
also experienced that.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.410
People keep up those sorts
of relationships with me.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.080
I think, as a design
manager, we have

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.040
a lot of other responsibilities,
and so I think it's interesting

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.370
how you could balance that.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.930
Do you work with recruiters
at your companies?

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.110
Do you manage your
relationships all yourselves?

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.700
Do you try to put some
of this onto your team

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.085
and get them engaged and active?

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:41.030
What do you do?

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.530
SOLEIO CUERVO: I
think the key piece

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.680
is to build a culture
around recruiting.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.050
What's enjoyable about this
line of work in particular

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.500
is how collaborative it is.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.829
And in order for you to build
a healthy design culture

00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:53.287
and design organization
is that you

00:13:53.287 --> 00:13:55.328
need to be really proactive
about the people that

00:13:55.328 --> 00:13:56.330
populate it.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.705
And so, at least at Dropbox
and certainly at Facebook,

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.080
a tremendous amount
of our hiring

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.160
came just from referrals
and from people

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.390
not just referring
their buddies or people

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.870
they've worked with in the
past, but naming their heroes,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.370
naming the people
out there that are

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.910
producing really
great work, and not

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.286
being shy about cold-calling
these folks and saying, hey,

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:13.951
we want to have a
conversation with you.

00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:16.290
We want to invite you to
work with us on this project.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.430
At Dropbox, we found a
tremendous amount of success

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.750
through on-site contracting--
bringing people in for two-

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.170
to three-month stints,
giving them a desk,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.550
giving them a laptop,
basically fully integrating

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.546
them into the team, and
then later, using that

00:14:29.546 --> 00:14:31.170
as a means of starting
the conversation

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.670
around full-time employment.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.280
And again, if you make that
list of people who you're really

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.130
passionate about, but more
importantly, you feel deep down

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.860
are correctly aligned
with what you're

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.480
trying to accomplish
as a business,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.090
that can get you
much further along

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.694
than just wishing
them to join you.

00:14:46.694 --> 00:14:48.860
BRYNN EVANS: I think that's
an interesting strategy,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.050
actually-- not something
that we do a lot at Google.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.550
But I've wondered
about in the past,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.000
bringing people on
for a shorter period

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.300
and getting them active
on the team early.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.450
Have any of you guys tried
that at your companies?

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.000
SHALIN AMIN: The
try-it-before-you-buy-it kind

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.540
of concept?

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.290
BRYNN EVANS: Yeah.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.000
And also, how do candidates
feel in that position?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.790
SHALIN AMIN: Yeah.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.623
We've done that with a
couple of candidates.

00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:10.170
And we've found
typically that helps

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.620
for them to understand the
culture, the pace of work

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.200
at which we produce stuff.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.251
And it's very different at a
Dropbox or a Pinterest versus

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:18.750
Uber.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.011
So just as much as
they're evaluating us,

00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:23.260
we're evaluating them as well.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.350
And so I think it's a
fair ask to do that.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.154
And it's nice.

00:15:28.154 --> 00:15:29.695
It's easy to have
those conversations

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.029
at the end of the three months,
or doing those check-ins

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.236
every month and being like,
hey, how are you feeling?

00:15:34.236 --> 00:15:35.400
Are you feeling supported?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.530
Are things working for you?

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.196
Are you finding success
in your project?

00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:40.055
Do you like working
with engineers or PMs?

00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:43.430
So you get to answer all
that and just not having

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.100
as much risk, which
is kind of nice.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.650
But generally, we
find people that

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.560
jump on right after
the three-month period.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.950
DANIEL BURKA: A few years ago,
I was considering my options,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.420
and I went and talked to one of
the big kids in the Bay Area.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.956
And the CEO said to my
face, he said, listen,

00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:02.330
you're not getting
married to us.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.704
Come and try it
for three months.

00:16:03.704 --> 00:16:07.276
And I was like, that was
a baller thing to say.

00:16:07.276 --> 00:16:08.400
It was not what I expected.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.460
I thought he was
like, join our team.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.470
You're going to be happy here
for the rest of your life.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.850
And I was very tempted
to actually try it.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.840
So it's a unique pitch.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.590
BRYNN EVANS: Yeah.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.070
For sure.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.480
SOLEIO CUERVO: And
it's a good way

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.560
to scale needs for
the organization,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.090
especially if you're going
through a growth stage

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.381
and you know that there's
just a laundry list of things

00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:28.926
you wish you were working on.

00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:31.300
That can align really well
with some terrific freelancers

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.950
that are out there.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.824
It gives you an opportunity
to just introduce

00:16:33.824 --> 00:16:36.290
some diversity of thought
and process into your team,

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.372
even if it doesn't net
out to a full-time hire.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:40.330
We've just found a
tremendous amount of success

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.270
both in terms of
staffing projects,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.549
getting awesome
experiences out the door,

00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:46.840
and then ultimately converting
them to full-time hires.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.720
When we had our first developer
conference in this building,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.750
we basically contacted this
tremendous illustrator,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.560
Ryan Putnam, who ultimately
joined the team by virtue

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.250
of his exposure to
Dropbox through the lens

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.130
of that project.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.090
We were able to get
the project done.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.210
And more importantly,
we were able to achieve

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.125
a great full-time hire.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.500
BRYNN EVANS: So
I wonder how this

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.210
plays into the
next topic I wanted

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.180
to talk about a little
bit, senior designers

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.329
versus junior designers.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.390
It feels like maybe with
the exception of you,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.670
Daniel, being offered
a three-month gig,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.950
you're not getting
married to this company.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.740
It seems great for
junior designers

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.315
or new designers
getting started.

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:22.940
They want to just
try out a few options

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.690
or not commit to anything.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.349
But also, how do you source
for really senior talent?

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.950
I found this to be particularly
challenging myself.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.040
I have a lot of senior
designer friends,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.630
but they're very
happy in their jobs.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.170
What do you do?

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.470
SOLEIO CUERVO: You never say no.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.137
BRYNN EVANS: OK.

00:17:40.137 --> 00:17:42.094
SOLEIO CUERVO: I think
there's a certain amount

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.130
of relentlessness
that comes with it.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.130
I think, going back to
what I was saying earlier

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.930
about understanding
core motivation,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.550
you need to-- everybody
here in this room

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.707
has a career trajectory.

00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.540
Everybody sort of has
a thesis in their head

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.840
of what they can accomplish
in their professional careers,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.840
like why they entered
design in the first place,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.790
and how that's going
to play out over time.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.760
I think a key part of
it is understanding

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.770
what the trajectory
looks like, figuring out,

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.190
does it align with my
business, with my team?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.370
Is there a great fit here?

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.690
And then painting that picture.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.337
There's this concept,
inception, that

00:18:11.337 --> 00:18:12.670
was popularized with this movie.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.280
But I actually think that it
directly applies to recruiting.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.750
You have to create a scenario
where a person clearly

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.350
understands their
role on the team,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.292
how it aligns with
their individual story,

00:18:21.292 --> 00:18:23.500
and how they can achieve
growth in your organization.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.958
But most important
of all, you have

00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.890
to be able to actually
realize that growth.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.348
You need to be able to make
that promise and deliver on it.

00:18:29.348 --> 00:18:32.357
Because I think designers,
creatives can smell bullshit.

00:18:32.357 --> 00:18:34.190
And so I think it's
really important for you

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.630
to be able to actually
demonstrate how a person can

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.270
grow and achieve that thesis,
achieve that storyline

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.641
in your organization.

00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:43.140
MIA BLUME: I think part of it
is, again, it's the long game.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.240
You have to be willing to
wait for the right timing.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.627
So if you know that that
junior designer wants

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.210
to be a part of the
team, you probably

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.793
have a lot more
opportunities for them

00:18:51.793 --> 00:18:53.520
to engage on a project.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.530
But senior designers,
they do have a story.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.489
They've been somewhere.

00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:57.946
There's certain
things that they're

00:18:57.946 --> 00:18:58.990
looking to work on next.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.239
And so sometimes, it's just
about having that business

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:03.220
opportunity in your
project and getting

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.780
them aligned on that, which
means that more often than not,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.999
you have to have a very specific
pitch for that senior designer,

00:19:08.999 --> 00:19:11.040
which is, hey, you're
going to be working on this

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.581
with these people, and this is
the impact that we foresee you

00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:17.940
having on the company
and the product.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.990
DANIEL BURKA: And frankly,
to source senior talent,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.190
there's nothing wrong
with going and approaching

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.260
the people you love, whether
or not they have a current job.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.750
And you don't have to poach
them by carrying around

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.009
two big bags of cash, like
putting it on their table.

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.800
But talk to them about
the role that you're

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.870
looking to fill,
and then ask them

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.340
who they'd hire
for the position.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.550
Because either they're going to
step up and say, you know what?

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.258
To tell you the truth,
I'm not very happy

00:19:41.258 --> 00:19:43.460
where I am right now, and
that sounds [BLEEP] cool.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.680
Yeah, I'm interested.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.700
Or even if they're
not interested,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.457
ask them who the three people
they'd hire for that position.

00:19:49.457 --> 00:19:51.290
Go start the conversation
with those people.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.527
It's a great way to kind
of work your way out.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.110
But hiring senior
talent is just hard.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.005
It's really hard.

00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.530
And if you're not
putting in the leg work,

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.810
you're not going
to get good people.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.110
SOLEIO CUERVO: I would
piggyback on that.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.651
Designers collect
designers, and they

00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:04.750
would, more often than
not, just tell you

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.110
who are the great folks
they should be talking to.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.904
Curiously enough, we hired
Evan Sharp to Facebook

00:20:11.904 --> 00:20:13.320
by virtue of a
referral like that.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.440
We had actually reached out
to somebody in New York,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.280
and they were like, I'm not
interested in a role there,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.113
but you should talk to
this guy, Evan Sharp.

00:20:19.113 --> 00:20:20.680
And lo and behold,
he ended up making

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.513
a great hire and
ultimately a great founder.

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:24.852
But that one degree away
is just free information.

00:20:24.852 --> 00:20:26.810
And if you're not getting
that free information

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.518
with every single
recruiting conversation

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:33.149
that you're having, you're just
throwing away valuable intel.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.940
SHALIN AMIN: So just
to jump in real quick.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.090
So part of the thing that Mia
talked about around building

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.690
a story and listening,
I think it's

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.110
really important for
senior level talent

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.910
to really listen
and figure out, what

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.927
was their story before they
joined the last company?

00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:47.260
What are they getting out of it?

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.930
What's missing?

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.660
And then to try to format a
sales pitch or the story that

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.646
aligns around your
culture, your goals,

00:20:53.646 --> 00:20:55.520
and seeing how they
could potentially fit in.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.110
Like painting a better
picture for them, essentially.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.505
I think what
designers really want

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:03.705
is to solve really
hard problems.

00:21:03.705 --> 00:21:06.330
And I think as long as you make
it about problems and not about

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.860
money, I think you're going
to have a lot of success.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.174
But it's really actively
listening to where they are,

00:21:11.174 --> 00:21:12.090
where they want to go.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.030
How will Uber or
some other company

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.590
format that story for them, and
really pitching it that way.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.904
We've found success.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.320
BRYNN EVANS: You guys touched
on this for a brief moment--

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.085
poaching and hiring ethics.

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.210
And I think this is tricky.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.490
Designers do collect designers.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.280
And when you leave,
you want to bring

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.330
the best people
you know with you.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.400
But I think there
is a fine line.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.710
How do you know when
to lay off, when

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.114
to be more gentle
about who you go after?

00:21:42.114 --> 00:21:43.780
But you also want to
build a great team.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.609
Do you have examples of
either you've tried this

00:21:46.609 --> 00:21:47.650
and it's been successful?

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.191
Or you've tried this
and you actually

00:21:49.191 --> 00:21:52.360
got slapped on the hand,
or there was an incident?

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.750
MIA BLUME: You call it
poaching, I call it recruiting.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.900
Great designers have great jobs.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.670
It's a really great
time for all of us

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.950
right now to work on a
lot of awesome stuff.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.600
And so yes, there
are legal things

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.720
that you should
definitely avoid in terms

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.480
of recruiting designers.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.110
But hey, if they're
excited about your product

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.410
and your team, and you're
excited about them,

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.164
there's no harm in
having a conversation.

00:22:16.164 --> 00:22:16.830
BRYNN EVANS: OK.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.320
DANIEL BURKA: I'm not going
to do anything underhanded

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.310
if I'm trying to hire somebody.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.400
I'm expecting that
if I went and chatted

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.840
with them about the
job, they're going

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.730
to go tell their boss,
potentially, hey,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.860
Burka's trying to get
me to come do something.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.220
So if I'm poaching
people from Twitter,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.090
I don't want Mike Davidson--
he knows where I live.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.190
He can mess with me.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.732
But there's nothing
wrong with having

00:22:38.732 --> 00:22:40.273
a conversation with
somebody and just

00:22:40.273 --> 00:22:42.150
talking about how
interesting something is.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.840
I talk to Googlers and chat to
them about their current job.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.130
I'm not going to go
poaching people from Google.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.710
But if they're looking
for their next thing,

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.380
it's a great opportunity.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.800
BRYNN EVANS: Yup.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.220
So moving on.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.680
Sourcing is clearly a challenge.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.930
And I think we all
agree that there's not

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.701
one clear solution that's
going to make this really easy

00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:09.200
for us.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.160
But we still do a
pretty good job.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.590
Your teams are pretty
well developed.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.190
What do you look
for when designers

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.550
come on to your teams?

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.450
So in the first week
or the first month,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.740
do you have a process for
welcoming them, onboarding

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.525
them, getting them involved
with the rest of the team

00:23:24.525 --> 00:23:26.150
that's been successful
or unsuccessful?

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.709
MIA BLUME: For us
at Pinterest, we

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:33.000
do a couple of different
things, and we've tried things

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.410
over the past months, years.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.250
Sometimes they are successful,
sometimes they're not.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.410
We try and have a culture buddy.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.030
And we don't call it a culture
buddy, but basically someone,

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.530
another designer
on the team, that's

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.930
there to look out
for them-- take them

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:51.030
to really important sessions,
meetings, cultural moments they

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.980
may not know about yet.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.632
But also, be there
to answer questions.

00:23:54.632 --> 00:23:56.090
Because sometimes
going to a leader

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.840
on their team, their
manager, it might

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.090
be a little bit intimidating
at the beginning.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.080
Things that we start
to look for early on

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.610
is if they're not asking
really tough questions

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.270
in the first couple
weeks, I'm not

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.520
sure they're paying attention.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.300
So I'm actually really
excited that designers

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.630
are asking tough questions.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.520
How does this work?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.390
That seems weird.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.500
What's going on here?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.749
It means they're observing.

00:24:15.749 --> 00:24:16.540
They're digging in.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.130
They're meeting
the right people.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.140
And part of that is
setting them up for success

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.806
and giving guidance on, hey, you
should go talk to these people.

00:24:22.806 --> 00:24:25.990
You should get engaged in these
certain programs or projects,

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.260
and just kind of absorb.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.010
And so the questions
that come out of that

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.064
are really important.

00:24:31.064 --> 00:24:32.480
The other thing
that we try and do

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.000
is get them on project
as fast as possible

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.517
so that they're
engaged in the work.

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:39.100
That doesn't mean we expect them
to ship something on day two,

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.730
although that's great.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.605
We want them to be
involved in the project

00:24:42.605 --> 00:24:43.980
and know who their
teammates are.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.772
That's really important
for them to absorb.

00:24:45.772 --> 00:24:48.188
SOLEIO CUERVO: I think the
highest [? ordered ?] [? bit ?]

00:24:48.188 --> 00:24:50.420
is to always actively
invest in it.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.580
Even if you're really
starved for resources

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.290
and it'd be really hard
to carve out 10% to 20%

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.150
of a person's time to
onboard a new designer,

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.680
it's such a crucial investment.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.790
One, you need to be able
to just assimilate them

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.677
into the culture, expose
them to the problems

00:25:04.677 --> 00:25:06.760
that are being worked on,
introduce them to teams,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.440
real hard work.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.190
Get a sense of whether
or not the person's

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.940
going to be the sort of fit
that you had anticipated.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.212
Because you had probably
spent n hours evaluating them

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:15.920
over the course of
interviews, but that's

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.340
going to pale in comparison
to the first week of work

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.170
that they conduct.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.670
And so I think it's
really important

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.080
to align them with a buddy.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.750
At Dropbox, we
called it your DFF,

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.240
your Design Friend Forever.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.192
And you have a DFF
assigned ahead of time.

00:25:29.192 --> 00:25:30.900
That person would be
responsible not just

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.030
for conducting all
of the social 101s

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.890
and taking you
around the building,

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.480
but they're also going to
be responsible for vetting

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.500
projects, introducing
you to the stakeholders

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.583
for those projects, and
making sure you're getting

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:44.100
your work done within
your first couple weeks.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.530
I think that the onboarding
process varies according

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.360
to the life stage of
a particular company.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.144
When Dropbox was a lot smaller,
we sort of did the round robin.

00:25:52.144 --> 00:25:53.810
Give me the projects
that are unstaffed,

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.309
and we'll find the ones that
are scoped well enough for you.

00:25:56.309 --> 00:25:59.550
And we'll try to parcel it
up into a six-week program

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.575
or residency for
that new designer.

00:26:01.575 --> 00:26:02.950
As Dropbox has
scaled, we've been

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.094
much more proactive
about aligning designers

00:26:05.094 --> 00:26:07.260
to particular design clusters
so that they basically

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.759
get integrated into the team
that we anticipate them landing

00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:12.130
in, and more importantly,
getting a sense of how

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.590
their technical
fits is incorporated

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.535
into that particular
design cluster.

00:26:16.535 --> 00:26:18.660
BRYNN EVANS: I'm similarly
interested in the senior

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.450
versus junior position here.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.510
Because on the team
that I just left,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.300
a pretty senior designer joined.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.045
And he really didn't get
assigned a mentor or a buddy,

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.170
because he was very senior.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.250
And he specifically came
in to help run the team.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.110
And he came to me and asked for
advice, and I gave him advice.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.132
It was no problem.

00:26:36.132 --> 00:26:37.590
And then he
continually came to me,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.880
and I started becoming
his de facto mentor, which

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.070
I was perfectly happy to do.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.090
But he was much senior to me.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:46.380
And I realized that either
he was lost in the cracks,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.870
or we just weren't
paying as much attention

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.590
to him, because
he was so senior.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.950
But I think the kind
of guidance he needed

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.280
was maybe more organizational,
less around craft, and UX,

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.490
and feedback on specific work.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.670
But even still, we
needed to pay attention

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.040
to getting senior designers
up to speed, and active,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.850
and engaged, too.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.720
And I'm curious what
you guys have tried.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.870
Shalin, have you tried
stuff with senior designers

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.801
that are different from junior?

00:27:11.801 --> 00:27:12.550
SHALIN AMIN: Yeah.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.390
I mean, for us, it's
a little different.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:19.350
So by that chart, we
have a lot of priorities

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.630
in building design discipline.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.400
When I started at
Uber, it was literally

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.480
like there was no onboarding.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.340
It was just like, hey,
I need a computer.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.631
They're like, there's an
Apple store across the street.

00:27:31.631 --> 00:27:33.517
Go get it and expense it.

00:27:33.517 --> 00:27:34.600
I need some Post-it notes.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.849
Well, there's an Office Depot.

00:27:35.849 --> 00:27:37.200
Go get it.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.890
And at a very early
stage, I think it's OK.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.270
But as we start to develop
into a more mature company,

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.740
I think these onboarding
processes or boot

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.550
camps are super useful.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.470
We're getting better about
our onboarding process,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.680
but I don't think
we're there yet.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.430
I think we have a pool
of talented designers

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.070
that new hires can rely on.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.784
We now have these
programs in which

00:28:04.784 --> 00:28:06.700
there are multiple
designers on a single team.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.210
So when we put a
designer on that team,

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.160
the program is
essentially expected

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.254
to onboard and ramp them up.

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:15.170
And we're not necessarily
looking for somebody

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.830
to produce anything
in a couple of days.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.540
But more often than
not, we've found people

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.110
just being like, put
me in the game, coach.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.920
I want to build something.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.878
I want to do something.

00:28:21.878 --> 00:28:25.139
So as long as they
have that passion,

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:26.930
we're not going to let
that get in the way.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.410
But in all honesty, I think we
can be better about onboarding.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.244
But we're not there yet.

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:34.660
BRYNN EVANS: So
I'm wondering also

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:40.510
about happiness, and spirit, and
culture of the team in general.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.410
Have you guys tried anything
experimental or crazy

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.190
to keep your teams happy, like
outside of work, off-sites,

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.840
things like that?

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.450
Interesting activities?

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.720
MIA BLUME: For us at Pinterest,
we do a lot cultural events,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.130
whether it's really small
stuff or design team off-sites.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.690
In general, we're a
very makerly culture.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.060
And the team is very passionate
about their different interest

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.972
areas beyond design.

00:29:06.972 --> 00:29:08.680
For instance, we
started this small thing

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.980
that is not just for designers
but the larger company called

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.760
Studio Nights.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.544
We have a design studio that's
dedicated to the creative team,

00:29:15.544 --> 00:29:17.710
but we wanted to open that
up to the larger company.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.680
And so we basically had one
individual teach a small class

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.550
one of their skills
or interest areas

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.240
to other people at the company.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.360
It was a great way for a
rapidly scaling startup

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.770
to get to know each
other, to make things,

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.160
to have fun, have a beer.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.230
So we did everything from
beekeeping to GitHub 101

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.260
to bookbinding,
all kinds of stuff.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.800
And so that was a really great
way to get people engaged.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.770
As a design team, we
also get out a lot,

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.020
because we're rapidly growing.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.380
And it's really important
for us to not only have

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.780
social connections but be on the
same path as the design team.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.926
Understand where we're
headed, what we believe in,

00:29:52.926 --> 00:29:55.300
because there's going to be
a lot of new people coming in

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.091
and different perspectives,
which is great.

00:29:57.091 --> 00:29:59.277
It will stretch and
grow our perspectives.

00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:00.735
But we also want
to be in alignment

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:03.440
in terms of where we're headed
and what we're building.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.230
DANIEL BURKA: To
be honest, I think

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.830
that some of these off-site
things are kind of BS.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.810
It feels good.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.660
And I know a team that
took the whole team,

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.270
and they got on a plane,
and went to Los Angeles,

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.600
and went to the Eames House.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.040
And that sounds fun.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.250
I like going places,
and that's cool.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.820
But I think lots of
teams do this stuff where

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:31.090
they do team-building exercises,
and they do, like, fun.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.450
And again, I like fun.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.145
Fun's fun.

00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:37.270
MIA BLUME: Nobody likes
mandatory fun time, though.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.100
DANIEL BURKA:
Mandatory fun time.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.185
Yeah.

00:30:38.185 --> 00:30:39.476
It takes all the fun out of it.

00:30:39.476 --> 00:30:40.450
It's true.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.084
But I think that if you're
going to do this stuff,

00:30:43.084 --> 00:30:44.500
I think there is
some value to it.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.090
I think it's
overrated a bit, but I

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.200
think there's some value to it.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.658
If you're going to
do it, do things

00:30:48.658 --> 00:30:52.990
where it helps you get in
the mind space of your users.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.350
Pinterest has obvious
places to do that.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.260
I'm trying to think
of some good examples.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.870
But there's lots
of exercises you

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.030
can do that help you
understand users.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.870
But the best team-building
stuff is doing great projects

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.160
together, like work
projects-- things

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.616
you ship, and you succeeded.

00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:13.240
And then go out and
celebrate together.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.680
That's another great
way to build team unity.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.370
But these BS off-site
barbecue, let's all

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.200
do three-legged races,
and build our teams.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.757
Like, [BLEEP] off.

00:31:24.757 --> 00:31:27.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.705
[SOME APPLAUSE]

00:31:28.705 --> 00:31:29.615
SHALIN AMIN: Claps.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.617
You have five
people on your team.

00:31:33.617 --> 00:31:34.325
DANIEL BURKA: No.

00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:36.810
I've worked on teams that
are bigger than five people.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.429
I love my team, if you're here.

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:39.720
Let's go do three-legged races.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.810
SHALIN AMIN: I
think my perspective

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.050
on that is slightly skewed
and a little different.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.960
So for me, team outside
bonding exercises

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.904
are-- you can work on
projects, and that's great,

00:31:48.904 --> 00:31:50.570
but you're working
with a core of, like,

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.810
five people at a time.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.040
You're not getting to interact
with the other 40 designers

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.270
that you have around you.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.940
And I think part of it is
building a shared experience

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.530
together.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.490
So we have a designer at
Uber who did-- last holiday,

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.650
she did a gingerbread
house-making contest.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.142
And everybody was
super down on it.

00:32:11.142 --> 00:32:12.600
It was like one of
those forced fun

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.141
kind of things at
the very beginning.

00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:18.600
But by the time we finished it,
I think the entire experience,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.330
it was not only working with
four new people on your team,

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.750
but building in a common goal.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.730
At the end of it,
we were laughing.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.830
We were talking about
some of the mistakes

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.246
that we made, some of the cool
things that we had come out

00:32:31.246 --> 00:32:33.800
of the gingerbread houses.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.870
And I don't know.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.970
It was just really
things that were not

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.040
related to work or to users.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.370
And I think designers
at Uber, especially,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.480
they think about
work all the time.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.960
So what is that natural thing
that we can do beyond drinking,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.402
I think, is also important.

00:32:48.402 --> 00:32:49.860
MIA BLUME: One of
the things that I

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.985
would encourage as you
think about your off-site is

00:32:51.985 --> 00:32:52.940
time to make together.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:57.030
That doesn't have to be just
barbecues, or rollerskating,

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.180
or whatever you do for
the mandatory fun stuff.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.390
So two off-sites, for
example, that we did.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.570
The first one, when the
team was really young--

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.270
it was just a handful of
us-- part of our off-site

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.270
was to think about what are the
characteristics that we want

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.870
our design team to be, and
what do we want to grow into.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.050
So we talked a lot
about what environments

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.110
made us successful,
what made us happy.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:21.570
And we basically did our own
design exercise around the team

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.440
that we want to build, which
influenced who we hired,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.560
the environment that
we created as we grew.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.110
Another example is, we had
an afternoon where we all

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.580
wanted to work on
this one project.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.395
It wasn't a priority
for the company.

00:33:33.395 --> 00:33:34.520
And we said, you know what?

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.880
We're going to go away, and
we're going to work on it.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.220
So we were working, but we
were bonding over a project

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.400
that we wanted to work on.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.422
And some really cool
stuff came out of that.

00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:45.130
So I think there's a
way to balance that.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.860
And maybe this comes from
my consulting background.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.090
There's a lot of effort that
goes into running a workshop,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.610
and this is basically a
workshop with your team.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.490
So the effort that
you put into it

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.130
is the return that you'll get.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.470
DANIEL BURKA: Yeah.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.303
I like that, though.

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:02.546
You set a base of,
this is serious fun.

00:34:02.546 --> 00:34:05.730
You're actually getting
something productive out

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.470
at the end of it.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.830
That's great.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.973
MIA BLUME: Serious fun.

00:34:06.973 --> 00:34:07.700
SOLEIO CUERVO: But
to echo your point,

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.350
I think the best
way to retain talent

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.260
at the end of the day is to
challenge them on things that

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.880
are going to matter
to the business.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.750
Give them the opportunity
to take that winning shot,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.679
and make sure that they
celebrate when they hit it.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.010
I think at the end
of the day, doing

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.290
great work is what keeps
people happy, is what keeps

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.400
people engaged.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.639
Everything else is not going
to substitute for that.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:29.339
All the office perks, off-sites,
the fun little brunches,

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.880
that doesn't matter as much as
shipping software that changes

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.820
people's lives and holding
people accountable for that,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.800
and making sure that they
celebrate it when they do it.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.633
When they finally get
across that milestone,

00:34:37.633 --> 00:34:40.020
make sure you're throwing
the biggest party in town,

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.520
because they need
to recognize that,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.186
at the end of the
day, that's why you're

00:34:43.186 --> 00:34:45.969
at that organization, is
to achieve those goals.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.395
BRYNN EVANS: Yup.

00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:48.770
As you're talking,
it's making me

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.219
think that a lot
of our effort is

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.540
spent on keeping our
teams happy and engaged

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.710
and putting the right
sort of cultural values

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.790
into our teams, which will
then lead towards finding

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.330
the right talents, building
the teams in the ways

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:00.930
that you want.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:01.520
I'm curious.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.600
Soleio, you at Dropbox
were trying specifically

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.510
to put the culture
directly in the team

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.610
before looking for talent.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.470
And when you choose
where to spend your time,

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:14.030
sourcing or
team-building, how do you

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.720
decide where to spend
most of your time?

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.270
Where is it going
to be most valuable?

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.410
SOLEIO CUERVO: I think
at the end of the day,

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.810
it's trying to set up culture
around the things that

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:23.060
are going to matter, not
just for a particular quarter

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.560
or a particular
year, but over time.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.559
What is it that's going
to be the differentiator

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:28.960
for your business, not just
from a recruiting standpoint,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.847
but also just from a
competitive standpoint?

00:35:30.847 --> 00:35:32.930
And make sure that the
culture feeds through that.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.190
And going back to
the hiring attributes

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.950
that we were talking about,
at the end of the day,

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.075
Dropbox is in the business
of storing people's most

00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:40.540
important information
and bringing it to life.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.640
And so that requires people to
be able to sweat the details

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.720
and really just cultivate a
culture around that, but also

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.380
just to be able
to be trustworthy,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.900
be people who are going to
be open, honest, and earnest.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.470
And making sure that you're
rewarding that day to day, not

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.345
just in terms of individual
actions, but also

00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:58.590
trying to cultivate programs
and acknowledging that,

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.720
OK, for us to be able
to sweat the details

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.250
and build the best
quality products,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.310
we care about diversity.

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.170
So we're going to set these
specific goals around it.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.650
And every time we have that
recruiting pipeline meeting,

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.730
we're going to be
measuring how we're

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.010
tracking towards those goals.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.510
And making sure
that you're not just

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.400
saying that you're paying
attention to something

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.110
or caring about it,
but you're actually

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.724
showing results against it.

00:36:17.724 --> 00:36:18.390
BRYNN EVANS: OK.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.780
I'm curious if there's any
questions from the audience.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.511
Anything that we
haven't covered?

00:36:24.511 --> 00:36:26.007
MIA BLUME: Yay. [LAUGHS]

00:36:26.007 --> 00:36:28.090
SOLEIO CUERVO: Are we the
first to have questions?

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.572
SHALIN AMIN: I hope so.

00:36:29.572 --> 00:36:30.560
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.351
BRYNN EVANS: Hello.

00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:31.956
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:35.570
I'm curious how you recommend
prioritizing diversity when

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.847
you're looking for designers.

00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:39.680
DANIEL BURKA: That is
an excellent question,

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.221
first of all.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.480
BRYNN EVANS: Were you
going to take it away?

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.980
SHALIN AMIN: In all
honesty, we were

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.174
talking about this
backstage, and we

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:51.090
were debating whether
we should bring this up.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.820
But thank you for bringing
that up, actually.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.970
I guess we could tee it off.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.380
Burka had brought up the
conversation around diversity,

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.340
and he was kind of nervous
about just even bringing

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.450
the conversation up, which led
us to some great discussions

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:10.130
around-- diversity, I
think, is an important part

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.970
in the hiring process.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.810
And it takes rigor,
and it takes intention.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.070
It doesn't come easy.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.410
And so I think in hiring within
the entire design discipline

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.930
or within the organization,
you have to make time for it.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.560
It means you have to increase
your pool of candidates

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.634
and work harder at finding
a more diverse set of people

00:37:33.634 --> 00:37:35.800
versus the ones that you're
just automatically going

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.360
to get through your
hiring pipeline.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.986
Do you want to share any?

00:37:40.986 --> 00:37:42.860
DANIEL BURKA: Boy, you
really set me up here.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.040
SHALIN AMIN: Yeah, I know.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.720
DANIEL BURKA: I
commiserate with anybody

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.080
who finds this uncomfortable.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.900
I mean, it's really difficult
to talk about this stuff

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.410
without feeling like you're
marginalizing people,

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.860
and without talking
about it, like you're

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.160
talking about a specific group.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.960
And I think one of
the good suggestions

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.340
is to not think of it
like, we need more women!

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.819
And then, oh, I've got
folders full of women!

00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:05.360
Who was that?

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.570
Mitt Romney, I think, said that?

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:06.870
SOLEIO CUERVO: Binders.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:07.690
DANIEL BURKA: Binders
full of women.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.832
BRYNN EVANS: Binders, yeah.

00:38:08.832 --> 00:38:10.290
DANIEL BURKA: Is
to think about it,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:14.390
I think, a bit more broadly,
and to think about diversity

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.380
generally, like where
are your people from?

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.170
Do they have a diverse set
of background experiences?

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.540
They could be different
language experiences,

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.880
different-- there's all
kinds of areas of diversity.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.770
And then you don't
fall into that trap

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.320
where you feel like you're
kind of categorizing

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.424
everybody and getting
yourself in trouble, I guess.

00:38:38.424 --> 00:38:40.090
MIA BLUME: One of the
things I mentioned

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.240
earlier is thinking about
the composition of your team.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.114
And to the idea of having
different profiles,

00:38:44.114 --> 00:38:46.290
I think you constantly
need to be assessing,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.190
hey, what are different
qualities, and aspects,

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:52.730
and backgrounds that are going
to make our design team better?

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.060
Without singling out a
specific gender or race,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.120
it's about what is going
to help us grow as a team?

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.330
And that may include gender and
race, depending on your team.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:04.750
But go beyond that,
and constantly

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.080
be looking beyond
your assumptions

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.770
of what's right for the team.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.210
And that means that you may
have to take some risks.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.420
That means that you
may have to hire people

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.170
that you wouldn't normally hire.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.670
And that leads me
to the next point,

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.160
which is it's not enough just
to hit your numbers and say,

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.870
great.

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.760
We set a goal, we
are now more diverse.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.620
But actually to follow
through and make sure

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.580
that those people are engaged,
and getting into the work,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.230
and getting into the team.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.920
Because that's where
it really matters.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.590
Are you hiring them, and
are they staying engaged?

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.750
And do they actually
make the team better?

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.140
SOLEIO CUERVO: And a good
way to start the conversation

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.942
within a design organization
is just to wind the clock back.

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:43.650
One thing that's
amazing about this space

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:47.030
is that people's backgrounds
in design today are so diverse.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.760
I mean, it's not like we
all went to design school.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.620
Folks are coming from
different backgrounds,

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.130
different motivation centers.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:57.632
And you ask yourself, how would
I have identified myself out

00:39:57.632 --> 00:40:00.090
of the sea of people out there
in the world five years ago?

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.173
Because there are more
people like that out there.

00:40:02.173 --> 00:40:04.850
And in order for us
to grow this industry

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.590
and grow the design
discipline, we

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.350
need to look outside of the
known quantities of people that

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.630
are already in tech
organizations for talent.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:14.950
We're going to have to start to
look much further beyond just

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.740
Silicon Valley and
thinking about who

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.770
are the international candidates
that we should be hiring.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.720
What are the emergent schools
that we should be hiring from?

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.277
Are they architecture schools?

00:40:22.277 --> 00:40:24.360
Are they schools that
aren't even teaching design?

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.570
Maybe it's computer science.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.360
And I think that's going to have
to be the competitive advantage

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.860
that any hiring
manager cultivates

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.520
within their team, is, again,
having an open conversation

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.100
around, OK, how many of you
guys went to design school?

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.550
Raise your hands.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.961
A lot, but not everyone.

00:40:39.961 --> 00:40:41.460
And I think that's
worth noting when

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:44.360
it comes to sourcing and
to cultivating talent,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.110
and shining a
really bright beacon

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.380
towards this line of work.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.800
I think at the end of the
day, the chief responsibility

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.330
that every person
in this room has

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.835
is indicating that there is
tremendous careers in design

00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:55.950
and tech.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:41:00.219
Two, that it's just very
fulfilling work, but then

00:41:00.219 --> 00:41:02.760
more importantly, that this is
something you can actually get

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.950
paid to do.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:05.654
And I don't think
that as a community,

00:41:05.654 --> 00:41:07.570
we're doing enough to
communicate that message

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.520
to people early enough
in their careers.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.910
Every 18-year-old should
know that they can actually

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.080
be a software designer.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.850
They can actually pursue
this as a career path.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.070
BRYNN EVANS: We probably have
time for one more question.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.790
I see a few.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.130
SOLEIO CUERVO: That guy.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.046
BRYNN EVANS: This guy.

00:41:29.037 --> 00:41:29.620
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.230
That's loud.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.910
Hi.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:31.577
BRYNN EVANS: Hi.

00:41:31.577 --> 00:41:33.284
AUDIENCE: So you guys
talked a little bit

00:41:33.284 --> 00:41:35.620
about hiring junior people
versus senior people.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.340
And I know that one thing I
hear all the time from people

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.020
who are hiring is, it's
so hard to hire people,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.140
it's so hard to find
people and source people.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.942
But I also know that
there's a lot of people

00:41:45.942 --> 00:41:47.900
who are fresh out of
school who are, like, it's

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.400
impossible to find
a job, I can't

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.920
find anyone who will hire me.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.300
So there seems to
be a disconnect

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.160
between organizations'
ability to hire junior people.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.290
So I wondered if each
of you could talk about,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.914
in organizations
you've been a part of,

00:42:01.914 --> 00:42:06.065
what's the number one roadblock
to hiring junior people to more

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:07.344
roles?

00:42:07.344 --> 00:42:09.260
MIA BLUME: We were talking
about this earlier.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.634
I think one of
the things that we

00:42:10.634 --> 00:42:13.610
found-- because this is a
discipline that is evolving,

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.620
there's a lot of terms
being thrown around--

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.390
are you a UX designer,
product designer, whatever?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.020
I know that must be really
confusing for people right out

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.620
of school to figure out
how to position themselves.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.790
So there are definitely a
bunch of awesome startups

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.560
and resources for
those designers

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.887
to get involved in,
like Designer Fund.

00:42:30.887 --> 00:42:32.720
But one of the things
that we do on our team

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.230
is make sure that
we give feedback

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:35.840
to every single candidate.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.510
Hey, this is what we
saw in your portfolio.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.264
We actually think
your strength is this,

00:42:41.264 --> 00:42:42.680
and there's an
opportunity for you

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.890
to grow in these other areas.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.390
And help them shape
their narrative.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.310
And even though that might not
be a right match for us right

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.320
now, hopefully, we're
giving them something

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.180
to propel them forward to the
next opportunity, whether it's

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.440
at Pinterest or somewhere else.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.270
So I think there's work
to be done on both sides.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.870
SOLEIO CUERVO: I think
the leading obstacle is

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.530
the perception that it's--
I think a lot of folks take

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.320
so much pride in doing the work
that they don't recognize how

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.850
leveraged it is to set aside 20%
of your time to helping nurture

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.070
and grow others.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.250
And every design
manager should be

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.480
thinking about instilling
a culture of growth,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.410
not just in terms
of sheer headcount,

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.610
but in terms of
growing your people,

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.600
accelerating their career
paths within your building,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.149
within your team,
and making sure

00:43:26.149 --> 00:43:27.940
that you're thinking
about that as the most

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.150
leveraged opportunity.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.816
Because what you'll
find that comes from

00:43:30.816 --> 00:43:33.650
it is that mentorship is
a natural part of growth.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.462
And if you can create a culture
of mentorship within your team,

00:43:36.462 --> 00:43:38.920
you're going to be able to have
the infrastructure in place

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.379
to absorb a lot more talents
and to take calculated gambles

00:43:41.379 --> 00:43:43.253
on people who are just
going to be coming out

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:45.730
of school, saying, I don't
really have much experience.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.100
My portfolio is this.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.070
I'm eager to learn.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.370
I'm going to work my ass off,
but will you please hire me?

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.550
And I think that's the
leading obstacle that I've

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:57.690
seen across not just the
branding and tech companies

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.730
but across all of
tech, is that we

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.654
can't make enough
calculated gambles,

00:44:01.654 --> 00:44:03.570
because there isn't the
culture of mentorship,

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:06.250
and that it really starts with
design managers emphasizing

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.667
growth within their
organizations.

00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:09.875
DANIEL BURKA: That's exactly
what I was going to say.

00:44:09.875 --> 00:44:12.020
It's a ratio between
mentors and mentees.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.150
And junior designers, by
definition, need mentorship.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.750
And the advice I always
give junior designers

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.990
when I have coffee
with them is, find

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.350
one person who you
can see as a mentor,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.420
and try to work with them.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.610
You don't have to
work with a big team.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.312
It doesn't really matter.

00:44:29.312 --> 00:44:31.520
Being able to sit next to
somebody who can mentor you

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.020
is easily the best way to learn.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.210
And one way I think that
especially smaller teams can

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.120
potentially take a risk
on junior designers--

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.150
because that's really
what it is, is you're

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.520
an unproven quantity--
is potentially

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.500
look outside of your business
for potential mentors.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.750
Bring in somebody as an
advisor to your business who's

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.800
a senior designer who's willing
to put aside two hours a week

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.180
to come and work with
your junior designer.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.270
That way, you can take
the risk but still

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.570
have somebody who's able to
cultivate that young designer

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.140
and bring them along.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.340
That's something we try to do
as the GV team a little bit.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.260
If our startups hire
a junior designer,

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.760
then we'll spend a bit of time
working with them all the time

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.585
and giving them that critical
critique and feedback.

00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:17.160
But I don't think that's just
limited to that situation.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.120
I think you can--
especially in San Francisco,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.440
there's such a wealth
of senior designers

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.090
to leverage that
type of mentorship.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.740
And if you're a
senior designer, I'm

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.700
sure you learned by
learning from mentors.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.310
Critique them.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.540
Be honest with them, and
help bring them along.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.447
Because that, I think,
is our responsibility

00:45:35.447 --> 00:45:36.280
as senior designers.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.300
SOLEIO CUERVO: It's
so much more effective

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.440
than writing blog posts.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.060
I think a lot of it just
involves identifying folks

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.210
out there who really
want to do great work

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.000
and spending the time with them.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.375
I think every
person in this room

00:45:46.375 --> 00:45:47.800
can think back on
great teachers,

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.790
and I often believe
that designers and tech

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:53.079
underestimate their potential
as teachers for others.

00:45:53.079 --> 00:45:54.120
BRYNN EVANS: I love that.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.680
We are out of time, but I
think that's a great way

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.555
to wrap up the panel.

00:45:56.555 --> 00:45:58.060
Thank you guys so much.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.518
SOLEIO CUERVO:
Thank you, everyone.

00:45:59.518 --> 00:46:00.930
