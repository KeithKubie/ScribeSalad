So, tell me about Cuddle 
Sanctuary.

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:08.341 align:start position:0%
Cuddle Sanctuary is a social 
experience that welcomes healthy

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start position:0%
human touch.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.710
I associate cuddling with sex.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.979 align:start position:0%
Like, I don't know how you 
separate it.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.815 align:start position:0%
If you feel some arousal coming 
on, just shift your position.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start position:0%
What if when I shift, I go 
like...

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.786 align:start position:0%
[ Laughs ]
[ Grunts ]

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:20.953 align:start position:0%
This is how I shift.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:24.157 align:start position:0%
[ Grunts ]
So, I'm gonna try a class.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.925 align:start position:0%
Okay. Let's do it.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.693 size:81% position:41%
Let's do it. Let's cuddle.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.595
Franzblau: So, let's talk about 
the many different options of 

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.697 align:start position:0%
things you can try.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.299
The first one would be spooning.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.635 align:start position:0%
Does anybody feel like demoing 
the spoon?

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.402 align:start position:0%
You're in?

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.637 align:start position:0%
You're in.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.705 size:75% position:38%
Coming in for a landing.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.607
Is this missionary of cuddling?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.410
The only problem I'm really 
having is that I'm concerned 

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.112 align:start position:0%
where my phone is.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.114 align:start position:0%
Do you mind if I check my 
e-mail, bro?

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.148 align:start position:0%
Um, yes.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.051 align:start position:0%
But now that I can't check my 
e-mail, I just...

00:00:52.084 --> 00:00:53.953
I want to let you know that the 
rest of the time I'm gonna be 

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.388 align:start position:0%
thinking about checking my 
e-mail.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:59.025 align:start position:0%
[ Laughter ]
The next option that you have 

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.993 align:start position:0%
for paired practice is called 
companioning.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.328 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just gonna go ahead 
and sit next to you.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.529 align:start position:0%
Cool.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:04.530 size:75% position:38%
[ Chuckling ] That's it.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:05.331 align:start position:0%
Um, this is it?

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.532 align:start position:0%
[ Laughs ] Yeah.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:12.371 align:start position:0%
In seventh grade, this would've 
blown my mind.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:13.406 size:78% position:39%
We could do back to back.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start position:0%
I could just spin around and 
then sort of...

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.943 align:start position:0%
Let's do it.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.778 align:start position:0%
And this is kind of it.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.113 align:start position:0%
All right.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:23.082 align:start position:0%
It's just sort of like a way for
people to chill out and talk.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:27.220 align:start position:0%
It's very, uh, "Fault in Our 
Stars."

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.055
So, I'm going away this summer.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.124 align:start position:0%
Do you think we'll keep in 
touch?

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.294 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:38.164 align:start position:0%
What if you meet some other 
girl?

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
Then it's over.

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:44.837 align:start position:0%
[ Laughter ]
You're crazy.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start position:0%
Is that good?

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.573 size:84% position:42%
Is that what we would talk 
about, things like that?

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:48.774 align:start position:0%
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:49.342 align:start position:0%
Cool.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.978 align:start position:0%
Cool.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'm still thinking about my 
phone.

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.450 align:start position:0%
You're like the teddy bear I 
always wanted.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
You wanted a biracial, 
polyamorous teddy bear?

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.288 align:start position:0%
That's weird.

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.056 align:start position:0%
Is that your belt?

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.058 align:start position:0%
I'm not wearing a belt.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.194 size:75% position:38%
Is that, like, a button?

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:12.098 align:start position:0%
No, they're --
they're just pajamas.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:12.899 align:start position:0%
Okay.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:20.072 align:start position:0%
[ Laughter ]
Oh, my God, I love this.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.073
But I do want to [bleep] you.

[ Laughter ]
How often do you...

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.444 align:start position:0%
fall in love?

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:28.214 align:start position:0%
This isn't really the place for 
that.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.116
Your pajamas tell me otherwise.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start position:0%

Libya.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
Would you like to hold hands 
with me and eye-gaze?

What are your intentions with 
me?

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:57.577 align:start position:0%
Uh, I don't know.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.645 align:start position:0%
I'm just, like, lost in your 
eyes.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
They're just like --
I-I feel like I'm, like, staring

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.982 align:start position:0%
at the universe.

Yeah.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
That's a little much.

Yeah.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.592 align:start position:0%
You should follow me on 
Instagram.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.293 align:start position:0%
Okay. Sounds good.

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:15.995 align:start position:0%
That means a lot that you said 
that.

I seriously get what you're 
saying now.

This isn't about sex at all.

I don't want to have sex with 
any of you.
