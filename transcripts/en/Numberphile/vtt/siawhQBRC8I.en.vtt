00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is actually a little paper calculator that I made.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.660
You follow the tube, these split off. These tubes are drectional.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Your first choice is wether you want to choose zero or one.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.900
Which would you like to choose?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.500
Let's choose zero.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.080
So you choose zero, that leads to this instruction to flip.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.080
We flip the page, ...

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.860
...continue down.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.580
Plus - you don't choose the operator.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.540
But you do choose the next number...

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000
...that you want to add to zero.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.360
One, let's do Zero plus one.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.380
Zero plus one.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.480
Go here.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.740
Then you just follow the tubes - this is all done automatically.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.520
You follow...

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.180
Zero plus one is one.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.420
That's your answer, zero-one is the answer.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.280
Let's do Zero plus Zero.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.380
Zero plus zero, okay.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.780
So you start here, you choose zero.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.100
This tells you to flip.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.380
So theres your zero.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760
Let's choose to add another zero.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.720
So we'll flip again

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.140
So you'll notice, when you flip these flaps,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.480
they can either connect or block off certain pathways later on.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.420
So that's basically how it all works.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.440
You follow...

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.540
...these paths...

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320
When you get here, it says to flip.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.160
Then you get to the end.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.820
So...

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.240
Your answer is...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.080
zero-zero

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.920
Alright, let's do one plus one, Jason.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.760
OK

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.360
I've always wanted to know what that is.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.320
What a good thing I've got this calculator here.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.340
I'll go ahead and choose this one.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.580
Leads me to one.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.780
And another one.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.240
That goes to the "equal"-sign.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.560
Tells me to flip.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.040
Tells me to flip again.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960
And there is our answer.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.180
One-zero.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.180
Or two in binary.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.600
This is basically how calculators and Computers work,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.520
you know, electronic versions of these mazes.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.100
If you'd like to know why on earth Jason was making a calculator out of paper,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.200
you really Need to see what came before

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.560
and what's coming next.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.660
Have a look to These extra Videos we're putting on numberphile

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
either right now or very soon.
