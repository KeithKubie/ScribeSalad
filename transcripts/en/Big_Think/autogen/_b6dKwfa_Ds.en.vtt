00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.339
If you look at a country like the United States,
the share of the total income going to the

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.010
top ten percent of the population used to
be about one third of the total income back

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.999
in the early 1980s and now in 2015 It is over
one half.

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:25.060
So it has gone from 30/35 percent to over
50 percent of total income.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.569
Marx in the 19th century says that inequality
would have to rise forever.

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:35.750
Kuznets in the 20th century on the contrary
assumes that there were natural forces that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.079
would make inequality go down in the long
run.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.120
My main conclusion is that there are powerful
forces going in both directions and that ultimately

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.940
which one dominates really depends on the
institutions policy that we choose in the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.890
area of education, labor market, taxation,
corporate governance, minimum wages.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.479
And all of these matter and there are several
possible futures.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.549
If your parents are rich like 100 percent
of the generation almost goes to college.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.610
If your parents are poor it's like 20/30 percent
going to college and these are not the same

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.030
colleges if you're rich.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.450
And so there's very unequal access to education
prevents inequality from going down.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.550
Now, even if you get education policy right
there are other forces which can lead to rising

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.990
inequality in the long run.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.630
In particular there is a tenancy of the rate
of return to capital to exceed the economies

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.909
growth rate in the very long run can act as
a powerful force to very high concentration

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.420
of wealth and property as opposed to income
inequality, in particular labor income inequality,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.220
which is primarily damning by education and
labor market institution.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.049
So again, it really depends on the institution
and policies like progressive taxation of

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.700
income, wealth that we put in place in order
to regulate these dynamics.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.780
Sometimes people want just to blame globalization
and say because of globalization, because

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.010
of the competition with emerging countries
inequality has to increase and in any case

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.230
there's not much we can do about it; that's
just globalization.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.230
And I think this is wrong.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.510
I believe in globalization but I believe we
also need strong democratic institution and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.430
fiscal and educational policies so as to ensure
that more people actually benefit from globalization

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.940
so you don't have the same rise in inequality
everywhere.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.510
For instance, in Europe and Japan where you
also have globalization and competition with

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.690
the emerging countries, inequality of income
or wealth did not increase quite as much as

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.849
in the United States.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:11.190
So this shows a different course of action
can make a difference.
