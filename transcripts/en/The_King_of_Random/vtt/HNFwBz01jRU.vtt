00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Today, we're taking a look
at a less common type of glue,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.500
one that cures
with exposure to light.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.980
[Music]

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.800
There are a lot of types
of glue in the world,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.309
and I think that over the years,
I've used quite a few of them.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.639
But today, we're going to be
trying out some experiments

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:23.800
with a type of glue
I've actually never used before.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.200
And that is glue
that cures with UV light.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.650
At its core, this UV glue
is a type of super glue.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.280
It's a cyanoacrylate,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.499
which means it's going
to be a clear liquid

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.900
that bonds very strong.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
It's going to be really good
for some applications,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.817
and not so good
for some other ones,

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:40.600
and we want to learn
what a few of those are.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.755
And maybe talk about some

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:44.400
of the interesting things you
can do with this type of glue

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.300
that you can't do
so well with others.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.826
UV curing adhesives
were introduced in the 1960s,

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:51.300
and have since then become
a lot more affordable

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.800
and easy to get your hands on.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.958
And so, it's something

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.640
that you can definitely use
in hobby pursuits today.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.590
You don't have to be
some big fancy shop

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.477
with crazy equipment.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:00.774
In fact, you can actually pick

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:02.676
up some versions of it
at the hardware store.

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:03.800
I got these at Home Depot.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.633
This is sort of an all-in-one
kit that has glue

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.205
and a light built into it.

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:11.392
And then, I've also got
these separate larger bottles,

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:12.507
and this separate,

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:14.800
perhaps overpowered
ultraviolet light.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.220
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.239
We've got some UV curing glue,

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:21.200
some standard superglue,
a five minute epoxy,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
and a glue gun.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.400
We're going to compare
them together, and see

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.413
what's best at what.

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:26.363
For our first test,

00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:28.100
I have just a sheet
of scrap cardboard,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.600
and we're going to start putting
the glue down on the cardboard,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.425
and see what it does.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.250
How long does it take
to cure with the light?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.200
How long does it take to cure
without the light?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.055
And how does it change
with more or less light?

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:40.496
I'm gonna do a test
that's not necessarily

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:42.700
recommended by the
glue manufacturers.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.837
Well, it has a warning on it

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.300
that says it bonds
to skin instantly.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.200
So I'm actually just gonna take
a little bit of this,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.500
put it in my thumb and finger,
and then stick them together.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.400
With normal cyanoacrylate glue,
normal super glue,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
that's going to make them stick
pretty much immediately.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
So, let's try this.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.940
Oh, yeah, look at that.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.800
I've just glued
my fingers together.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.700
However, that little glue...

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.400
Ooh, that is
a pretty good stick.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.800
There we go.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.150
If that does happen to you,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.279
a little bit of acetone
is the best way to break

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.179
through that bond.

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.189
It goes pretty quick.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.550
Okay, I'm going to do a test.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.533
It's been sitting there

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.277
for about 2 minutes
without curing, now,

00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:21.600
we're going to hit it
with UV light,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.100
and see what happens to it.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.780
[Music]

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.200
That was about five seconds.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.900
Ooh, now, it's sort of a tacky
gummy sort of consistency.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900
So it has started to cure.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.140
[Music]

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, that seems
completely cured.

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:44.600
It seems very rigid.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.078
Yeah, it has no give to it.

00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:46.890
It's very hard.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.062
All told though,
that's what 15 seconds.

00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:50.900
That's not a very
quick cure time.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.600
Let's compare that
to our UV beast flashlight.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.200
I'm gonna start
with two seconds.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.180
One, two.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.100
See how we're doing.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.500
That's cured.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.940
That is a hard plastic,
and it's very warm too.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.758
When super glue cures,
it does put off heat,

00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:11.858
and when we force it to activate
by shining the UV light on it,

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.800
it puts off more
heat all at once.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.900
Enough that this feels
warm to the touch.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.400
Just it's cooling down by now,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.500
but right when I did it,
it was pretty warm to the touch.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.000
Let's try a bigger blob of it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
I'm kind of curious
if we can actually get

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.700
like a visible reaction
from all of the heat.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.100
That's a good-sized blob
of super glue.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.900
That could glue your fingers
together just about forever.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100
Try our big flashlight.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.200
Here it goes.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.740
[Music]

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.780
There's smoke coming
off of that.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.180
[Music]

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.500
I assume that means it is
in fact getting quite hot.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.680
[Music]

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.320
Ow.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.580
Yeah.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.700
That is getting very hot.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.000
Hot enough that just
by touching it,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.600
I burned my finger a little bit.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.160
Now, it's still
a little bit gummy.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.300
This first one that I did really
cured into a hard plastic,

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.200
whereas this thicker puddle
has some give to it,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.400
and that makes me think
that maybe the UV light

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.600
doesn't penetrate
through the glue very well.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.196
So the top might be cured,

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:12.800
but underneath the top
maybe isn't quite yet.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.820
So the UV light cures the glue,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.720
and it puts off quite a bit
of heat when you do.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.200
We do have one more black light
that I want to test,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.600
and that's the black light

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.439
that comes with
this FiberFix kit.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.102
This whole system,
it's got a glue bottle built-in.

00:04:26.102 --> 00:04:27.700
It's got a backlight built-in,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.464
and I want to see
how well it works.

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:30.823
I also actually went ahead,

00:04:30.823 --> 00:04:33.600
and tore one of these open
to see how much glue is inside,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.700
and here's the bottle.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.100
It does say on it
that it's five grams,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.400
or 0.176 ounces.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.100
This bottle is seven ounces.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.692
So several times the amount

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.240
of glue that comes
in the FiberFix kit.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.700
This little bottle is worth
about four of these.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.400
So let's test out
the light on this one.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.500
This is the glue
that comes with the kit.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.400
We're going to see

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.200
how long it takes to cure with
the light that it comes with.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.700
This is about
the same consistency.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.900
Maybe just very
slightly thicker.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.220
[Music]

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.900
All the way there.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.200
Okay, now, it's
beginning to set up.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.200
All right, that
definitely took longer.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.100
It was more like
the first light we tested,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.500
even visually, I don't know.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.621
This is obviously
much smaller output,

00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:20.800
but it seems like
about the same color.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.100
Whereas this UV beast light,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.000
it really does look
like a different shade.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.682
They pretty much all just
look blue on camera.

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:29.800
The UV Beast light,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.600
the one I'm swirling
around right now,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.300
in real life, it's a bit
more of a pale purple.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.975
Whereas the other two
looked like sort

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.360
of an intense bluish purple.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.000
There are a few things
that make UV cured glue

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.100
very useful compared
to regular super glue.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.600
Now, I love regular super glue,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.200
and I use it
for plenty of stuff.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.800
But the best thing about it is
that you can choose

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.340
when it gets cured,
when it gets activated.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.700
So you can put
some glue on something,

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.212
hold it in place,
and hit it with the light,

00:05:55.212 --> 00:05:56.549
and it's just going
to freeze in place,

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:57.500
and that's pretty valuable.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.600
One of the other things
I want to try with it

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.100
though is I want to see
if I can sort of build up,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.805
or even sculpt with this stuff.

00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:05.364
Not going for anything fancy.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.000
But because I can make it cure
when I want it too,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.733
I'm going to try and just build
like a tiny little box

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.860
out of it, attached
to this cardboard here.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:23.820
[Music]

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.400
Just testing the
one layer I did.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.979
That's nice and cured.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.200
As a little test,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.200
we've got these UV
protective glasses,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.121
and we have a second pair,

00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:33.000
and we're actually going
to try and put those in front

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.320
of the camera lens,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.100
and see if that lets

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.100
us see the backlight
a little bit better.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.312
It does have a tendency
to overwhelm the camera

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:40.749
when it's shining
really brightly,

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:42.000
but hopefully, like this,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.800
we'll be able to see
what's happening more.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.200
With and without,
quite a big difference actually.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:07:05.540
[Music]

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.100
So that is really cool
how much I can build up,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.700
just putting glue
on top of glue,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.900
and hitting it with the light
in between each layer.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.200
I want to do a strength test.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.107
Got some bamboo skewers,
and four types of glue.

00:07:16.107 --> 00:07:17.457
I've got UV cure glue.

00:07:17.457 --> 00:07:19.175
I've got regular super glue,

00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:20.900
and baking soda I
can add into it.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.900
I've got some five minute epoxy,
and I've got a hot glue gun.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.822
I'm just going to glue

00:07:24.822 --> 00:07:26.500
some skewers together
with each of those,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.100
and we can see which one
is going to hold up the best.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.320
Okay, three of these probably
have already completely set.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.980
The hot glue is
probably cooled down.

00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:38.099
The two super glues that we
cured with the baking soda

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:40.700
and the UV light
are almost certainly cured.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.400
But the epoxy is not.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.140
It's five minute epoxy.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.800
We're going to leave
that probably at least

00:07:45.803 --> 00:07:48.600
10 minutes to really make sure
it's set pretty well.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.800
It won't be at 100% full cure,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.193
which doesn't take
place for an hour.

00:07:52.193 --> 00:07:54.400
But I think we're going to get
a pretty good approximation

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.394
of how it works.

00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:56.700
I'm now going to take

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.500
a whole bottle of this glue
poured into this cup,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.800
and hit it with the light.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.500
I'm curious how much heat,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.100
what catalytic reaction
we're going to get out of that.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.079
It may only be 0.7 ounces,
but for super glue,

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.541
that's quite a lot.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.100
Just very slight
yellow tint to it

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.745
when we have that much of it.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:21.640
[Music]

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.020
3, 2, 1.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:34.380
[Music]

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.315
Plenty of fumes
coming off of that.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.100
It's actually kind
of interesting.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.900
The top layer is cured,
but it's like gummy flexible.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.200
It's also very
much changed color.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.000
Before it was
slightly yellow tinted,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.566
and now it's gone a little bit
more green or blue.

00:08:49.566 --> 00:08:52.320
I'm gonna try and give it
some more light from the sides.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.700
[Music]

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.760
Not sure how UV transparent
these cups are or are not.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.100
Seems that the UV
glue is actually

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.913
not completely UV transparent.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:07.805
Once it cures,

00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:10.800
it doesn't really let light
through all the way.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.200
I mean, it's not just

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
on the very top layer
that it's cured,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but it hasn't cleared all
the way through either.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.800
Also, this cup
looks sweet like this.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.400
Let's test our bamboo skewers.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.100
How hard is it
to pull these apart?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.100
First off, we've got the skewers
held together with hot glue.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.300
[Music]

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.500
That's a surprisingly good hold.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.640
I rarely think
of hot glue as something

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.052
that's going to really
hold on in a pinch,

00:09:37.052 --> 00:09:40.000
but pulling laterally against
the direction of the glue,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.160
that's holding on pretty nicely.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.900
I'm going to see what happens
if I try and twist.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.300
[Music]

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.800
Well, yeah, that's more
like what I was expecting.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.121
It just sort of tore
right through the glue.

00:09:50.121 --> 00:09:51.848
There's still glue
on both sticks,

00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:53.142
but it just tore apart

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:54.900
when I twist it
just a little bit.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.980
Okay, here is our super glue
with baking soda.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.740
[Music]

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.300
Yep, that's holding
pretty well that way too.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.200
That is hard
as I can hold on to it.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.840
Try the twisting.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.400
[Music]

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.200
Maybe a little bit stronger
than the hot glue.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.000
Still shattered when I got
a little bit of twist on it.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.300
And again, they're still
glue on both sticks.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.900
It didn't release from one side.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.800
It just the glue
itself gave out.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.320
Okay, here's our epoxy,
or two part epoxy.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.940
I'm gonna try and pull us apart.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.000
Oh, well that just pulled apart.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.900
Now, it is possible

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.100
I didn't give this quite
enough time to cure.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.900
It is still just
a little bit gummy.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.550
I don't know.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.200
That didn't feel
very stable though.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.900
Here is our UV cured super glue.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.940
I was able to pull
that one apart too.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.120
That does not look
like it was bonded very well.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.530
Is it the strongest glue?

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.320
It's not looking like it.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.200
But for convenience

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.800
and some applications,
it might be just what you need.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.600
I want to find

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.200
some other cool things we
can try out with this stuff.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.700
I really like how it works.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.700
If you've got any suggestions
of things you want to see is do

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.600
with the UV curing glue,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.000
let us know because I want
to try those things too.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.200
Guys, that's not all.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.721
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.083
The box up at the top takes
you directly to our last video.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.200
You should go check that out.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.089
The other box shows you

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:18.794
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:20.100
You hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.434
you'll be subscribed
to the channel,

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:23.000
and that way, you're never going
to miss a cool video,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.057
especially if you don't forget
to ring that bell,

00:11:25.057 --> 00:11:26.600
so you get the
notification about it.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.557
We'll see you in the next one.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.440
Talk to you then.
