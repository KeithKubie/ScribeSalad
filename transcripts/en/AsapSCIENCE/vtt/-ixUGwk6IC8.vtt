00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.320
Politicians often blame video games for some of the violence in our world and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.609
while it is true that the top five most popular

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.520
video games right now are all shooter games,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.900
do the guns on screen really translate into

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.769
aggression in real life?

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.119
Can video games make you violent?

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.179
One of the main arguments people make against video games is that they prime kids to be violent.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.718
Priming is a non-conscious form of memory where one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.989
For example, if I said the word yellow then asked you to name a fruit

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.480
you would most likely say banana.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.580
This led to a study in which

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.760
researchers had participants play one of two games.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.840
One game where they were in a car avoiding collisions.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.820
Another where they were just a mouse avoiding a cat.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.900
Following the game, the researchers, based on priming, hypothesized

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.480
the players would be faster at categorizing objects associated with the game they played,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.669
more quickly in the real world.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.640
So the players looked at pictures of things like a bus or a dog and were asked to quickly label them either as a vehicle

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
or an animal. Those who played the car game were no faster at categorizing vehicles.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.799
And those who played the cat game were no faster at categorizing animals.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.520
In fact, those who played each game had a slower reaction time to the related category.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.820
Meaning negative priming might actually be occurring.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
Oh, science, you're always just messing with us, aren't ya? But unlike the 8-bit games of our past,

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.059
today's game designers are capable of producing incredible graphics.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.640
Therefore another criticism is the more realistic a game the more likely it will activate aggressive behavior.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.300
To study this concept, one study had participants play one of two Kombat games.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.040
One where the characters were modeled using rag doll physics:

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.560
movements modeled off of the human skeleton, which means they had very physically realistic death behaviors.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.820
The other game used deaths that were extremely unrealistic.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.879
Afterwards, aggression was assessed via a word association

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.040
test and the game with the more realistic deaths showed no increase in aggression.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.800
Of the available research, most find no link between video games and violence.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.460
A meta-analysis of studies showing a positive link between games and aggression found that they

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.620
often used ineffective  lab tests of aggression.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.440
For example, measuring brain waves and heartbeats, which doesn't necessarily

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.100
translate to actual criminal behavior.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.320
And in the past when a correlation has been found, it's been weak.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.860
Criminologists who study mass homicides refer to the link between

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.200
violent games and crime as a myth.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.840
In fact in 2011 the US Supreme Court ruled that research did not find clear connection between

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.200
violent videogames and aggressive behavior.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.060
Unfortunately, we all know how often after a crime,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.120
video games and violent media get brought into the conversation.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.300
But the truth is this might actually be distracting from the more significant causes of violence.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.200
