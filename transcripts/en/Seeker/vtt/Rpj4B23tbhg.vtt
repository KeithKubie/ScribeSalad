00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.180
When you think of leaving the Earth, you probably
think of something like this:

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.160
This is the Saturn V launching Apollo 11 to
the Moon.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.799
It was a chemical rocket, burning a mixture
of kerosene and liquid oxygen to get its payload

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.499
— the Apollo astronauts — off the Earth.

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.410
Chemical rockets are basically an exercise
in brute force, but they’re not the best

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.410
way to go.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.080
They use a ton of resources, are bad for the
environment, and can kill people.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.680
What if there was a better, easier, cheaper,
less environmentally disastrous way of leaving

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
the planet?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.199
One company, Zero2Infinity, is working on
a different method today using rockoons.

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.470
Rockoons are a hybrid of a rocket and a balloon
that split the process of reaching orbit into

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.050
two parts: First, the balloon rises into the
upper atmosphere, then the rocket adds the

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.879
needed momentum to launch something into orbit
or to another planet.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.710
In March of 2017, Zero2Infinity, launched
a balloon to about 82,000 feet.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.410
At that point, they were above 99 percent
of the atmosphere, so they ignited a small

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.839
solid rocket motor.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.330
Another company, ACRA, is using a rockoon-type
launch system for its entry into the Google

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.220
Lunar X Prize competition.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.420
But if using a balloon to lift a rocket seems
like old technology, it’s because it is…

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.180
The concept originated in March of 1949 for
better, high-altitude atmospheric science.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.750
Rockoons are actually a simple and ingenious
approach to spaceflight.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.200
Instead of fighting against gravity, they
turn gravity into an advantage.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.390
A small sounding rocket is suspended beneath
a large balloon made of super thin plastic

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.490
— usually polyethylene — that is filled
with a small amount of helium.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.480
As the balloon rises, the atmospheric pressure
gets lower and the helium heats, allowing

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.070
it to expand and fill the volume of the balloon.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.930
The balloon can then ascend to a point where
it’s above most of the atmosphere, meaning

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.470
the rocket suspended beneath it is in a near
vacuum.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.500
It’s at this point the rocket fires, and
because there’s almost no atmosphere, the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.670
rocket is much more efficient.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.240
Another benefit of rockoons is that they can
accommodate all kinds of payloads.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.070
Satellites on rockets need to be folded and
housed in fairings, basically an aerodynamic

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.140
case, to keep them safe from launch vibrations
and fit them on top of the rocket.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.890
With a rockoon, because the rise to launch
altitude is slow and smooth, the air doesn’t

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.170
tear apart the thing you’re launching.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.870
This means the payload can be less aerodynamically
sound and still fly safely.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.860
It’s just protected by a lightweight fairing.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.200
Perhaps the most famous use of rockoons was
a series of launches done by James Van Allen

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.980
in August and September of 1952.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.090
He was able to send instruments 50 miles up
to test radiation near the Earth’s poles.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.370
It was through these launches that van Allen
discovered there was significant radiation

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.390
at high altitude.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.430
Follow up observations with the Explorer 1
satellite in 1958 allowed van Allen to discover

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.680
the radiation belts that bear his name.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.530
Of course, mentioning the Van Allen belts
usually gets people pointing to them and crying

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.470
foul saying, “we can't go through them to
get to the Moon, so we never went to the Moon.”

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.640
Well, astronauts did.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.650
I’ve got a video going into those details
on my own channel Vintage Space.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.120
And speaking of the Moon and other planets,
should Pluto be a planet again?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.180
We talk about how it could be in this video.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.750
What’s your favourite, non-traditional way
to get into space?
