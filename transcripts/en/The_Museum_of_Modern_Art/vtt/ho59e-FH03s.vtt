00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160
People come to me to design because they know
I'm going to create something that

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.700
looks unique.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.640
It's going to be sexy

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.390
and then it's going to exude this powerful element.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.780
Which is why I've designed a lot for musicians
and people who want that rock star look.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.060
And a biker jacket is imbued with all of those
sexy, masculine features, right.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.720
Whenever I design a new biker jacket,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.260
I draw a classic biker jacket.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.530
And then I begin to take those biker jacket
details and manipulate them.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.020
With the MoMA biker jacket, I wanted to go
really beyond that.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.220
Are you, are you gonna put it on right here?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.219
Mhmm.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.649
Oh, not on the mannequin, ok.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.360
Yea yea we’re gonna feed it in, so...

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.690
Cool, yea careful, cause this...

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.690
Oh yea, yea.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.240
It’s not, it doesn’t have that long of
a run right now...

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.160
Wow, this is really exciting, that this is
the moment we’re….

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.160
Yea, captured on camera.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Yea.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.260
Stick a bitch on.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.220
The idea for this prototype actually came
about two and a half years ago when we were

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.840
talking to him about designing a motorcycle
jacket

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.480
where you could signal

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.860
based on the motorcycle jacket itself

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740
using animations to do that.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.040
Someone will be able to plug the system into
their bike, a little wireless dongle essentially,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.580
that would plug into the motorcycle’s computer
system, much like any car’s kinda operated

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.719
by a computer now.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.460
And via bluetooth, it would be able to send
to the jacket when it’s turning, left or

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.300
right, whether it’s braking, if there’s
a car or an object in your blind spot

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.780
and all sorts, all sorts of different animations.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.299
This is going to be for the base of the entire
jacket, and Asher has designed multiple pieces,

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.680
actually, to sit on top of it that will diffuse
in a very nice looking way.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:38.750
And it won't look like the Terminator,] like
the Terminator's cousin at that point.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.850
Wow.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.019
Really, really good.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:57.530
So that’s going to be more like the, what…Ok
I mean there’s still a lot of work to do.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.760
But you know what Tyson, see look, it’s
not really coming through, so we may have

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.949
to make a panel of LEDS that go right here,
for the lapel

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:08.041
Yea, for the lapel.

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:11.600
You know, cause it should integrate with that,
right.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.280
When it comes to a biker jacket, there’s
the look, but then there’s the utility,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280
right?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.700
You need flexibility to move, but you also
need protection, so the base, the skin base,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.880
which is based off of the fractals of butterfly
eggs, is made up of two different types of

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.700
polymers, one that’s stretchier and one
that’s harder, so typically you’re used

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.470
to seeing biker jackets with big pieces of
armor on it, however, what if we brought the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.620
size of the armor down and attached it to
a flexible base.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.130
You can flex, but then you also have these
little microscopic armor plates.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.980
Then when you combine that with the lighting
technology, then that’s another layer of

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.980
utility.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.470
You are communicating with other drivers on
the road of your presence, and where you’re

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.720
going, if you’re stopping.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.280
All of those things that we’re used to communicating

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.290
while we’re driving.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.960
You see someone putting their blinker on.
You can see them blinking.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.180
Oh, they’re putting

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.320
their brakes on 200 feet in front of me because
their car is going red.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.720
But now when we brake, the jacket will go
red, so it’s kind of using these you know,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.800
communicating archetypes of driving and merging
it with a design aesthetic.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.530
It looks so good, the diffuse is pretty good.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.170
Yeah, it’s all hanging on the LEDS here,
because...

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.170
And we’re not even gonna see that...

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.170
Oh right, cause of the shoulders...

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.960
Yea yea, the shoulders, and then we’re gonna
have shoulder elements that have the animations

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.290
in it

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.310
Right.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.120
The material fabrication is completely futuristic.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.350
The silhouette, though, plays with, you know,
the asymmetric lapel, but we rounded it out.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.150
The whole jacket is kind of round.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.350
And I love to accentuate the shoulder blades,
and I use that as an opportunity to, you know,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.650
house our diffusion lights, but also, I think
it's so sexy to accentuate the arm and the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.230
elbow, so we added these like extended harness,
like, you know, patterns that diffuse the

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.570
light as well.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.860
So bending the silhouette, what is sexy, those
are all questions that we think about when

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.420
we’re designing.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.100
See this front?

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.600
Woosh, this is gonna be translucent, so, so...

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.880
When something falls outside of the boundary
of what people perceive what something can

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.700
be, that's when you push the understanding
of anything.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.890
So for fashion, right, when people go, "What
is that made out of?" or, "What is that silhouette?"

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.880
it's expanding their idea of what it can be.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.030
And that's why I like this whole prototype,
is because we're given this opportunity

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:11.160
to expand people's understanding of what can
a biker jacket be and what can a biker jacket

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.630
do and how can that change?
