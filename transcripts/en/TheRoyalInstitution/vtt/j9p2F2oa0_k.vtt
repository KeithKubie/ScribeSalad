00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.080
The gene is immortal.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.660
In fact a publisher once,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.050
when I showed him the first couple of
chapters of the "Selfish Gene"

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.859
he said: you shouldn't call it that... you should call it the
"Immortal Gene".

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.580
and perhaps I should have done.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.080
ahm

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.699
Genes
are immortal

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.189
in the sense that the coded information
they contain is reproduced,

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.070
is replicated with almost total fidelity...

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.579
significantly, not absolutely total
fidelity.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.940
Generation, after generation, after
generation... such that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.750
there are genes which are identical to
what they were

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.750
tens of millions of years ago... Houndreds of millions of years ago in a few cases.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.199
ahm... so genes are immortal... not... not the DNA,
of course that's not...

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.520
that turns over in a very short space of time
but the coded information is potentially

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.289
immortal

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.809
and that means that the difference
between a successful gene

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.820
and unsuccessful gene, really matters

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.700
it's going to matter for millions of years. So...

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.630
the genes that make it through those
millions of years are the ones that are

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.490
good at it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.200
and good at it means good at building
bodies good at controlling the processes

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.229
and Embryology

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.060
to make bodies which have what it takes

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.369
to preserve those genes and pass them on.
So I use this phrase: "survival machine"

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.119
a body... an individual

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.689
is a is a survival machine and that's by
far the most powerful way

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.290
of interpreting what an individual
organism is.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.049
An individual organism is a throwaway
survival machine

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.850
for the self-replicating

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.060
coded information which it contains. And
the fate of that coded information

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.540
is crucially bound up with the fate of
the body in which it sits.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.280
If the body in which it sits dies before
reproducing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.420
than that coded information is not going
to go on to the next generation, and the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.509
next and potentially for tens of
millions of years

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.090
so the genes that are in the world
today, distributed as they are

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.220
in bodies of millions of different...

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.090
different species... are here today
because they were good at what they did

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.890
in the past. They've come through, an...

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.520
literally, unbroken line of successful
ancestors

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.580
where unsuccessful non-ancestor have been
littered by the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.360
by the... by the wayside. And so the genes
in a swallow, or in a kangaroo or in a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.830
hedgehog or in a human...

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.540
Are all very, very good at making swallows, or hedgehogs, or kangaroos, or...

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.360
or... or humans. They had to be good at it
or they wouldn't have come through

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.440
the generations... Ahm... Today.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.800
Now that, I think, is an
inspiring vision:

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.700
and that's what fired me up... about... about...

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.860
the very idea of the Selfish
Gene

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.989
it in my... When I first red Hamilton
and then when I...

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.260
when I wrote it down in my... first in my 
lectures and then...

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.019
and then in the in the Selfish Gene.
- So the idea... The genesis of

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.879
the idea comes in the mid-sixty's from,
from bill Hamilton any then it

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.239
sort of lies... not... not ignored, but... not... not really

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.480
researched further and then some people
like Bob Travers picks it up and...

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.560
-Yes, I mean... actually to be fair... I mean,
its... its inherent in the neo-darwinian

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.700
synthesis of the 1930's, actually... Ahm...

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.500
in Fisher and... and...

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.380
and Holding. And Hamilton...

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.720
particularly applied it to the problem
of the relationship between kin

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.540
between... Ahm... but but it wasn't only
kin it inspired me it was the...

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.730
the very idea of the survival machine... of...
of...

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.750
immortal genes. Which goes back to the
nineteen thirties, I think

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.120
...or should I call you: clint?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.319
- Oh come on... ok... - So Richard Dawkins, as
it says on page one

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.540
of your autobiography... - I have to read what the...
nobody will get the joke unless...

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.540
unless I... - Well...

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.740
apparently you are called: Clinton.
