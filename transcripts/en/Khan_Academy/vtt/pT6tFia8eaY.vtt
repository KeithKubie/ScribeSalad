00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.689
Male: In the last video
we left off in 1922

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.803
in October where you have several hundreds

00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:08.941
of thousands of fascists march on Rome,

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:12.025
which causes the King
to put Benito Mussolini

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:14.076
in power and this picture
right over here is

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.536
from Mussolini coming to power from the

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:21.024
march on Rome and not
only does he get appointed

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:24.469
as Prime Minister, but
he has dictatorial powers

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.207
for one year.

00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:28.535
Those dictatorial powers
are also backed up

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:31.689
with the Blackshirts,this
loose band, kind of

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.773
a paramillitary group.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.608
So he uses his powers
and the fact that he has

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:44.475
his own force so to
speak to continue to just

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:47.140
secure more and more power under him

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.656
over the next few years.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:57.806
By 1923 he makes the
Blackshirts actually become

00:00:57.806 --> 00:01:01.536
a formal national militia, essentially

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:04.436
the volunteer militia
for national security.

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:08.279
In Italian the acronym is the MVSN.

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:12.611
So, the Blackshirts become formalized

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.700
as the MVSN.

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:19.136
He also gets Parliament
or gets the legislature

00:01:19.136 --> 00:01:21.693
to pass what's known as the Acerbo Law

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:22.735
or Acerbo Law.

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:24.077
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

00:01:24.276 --> 00:01:26.654
Acerbo Law.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.805
This is an interesting
one because this is a law

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:33.028
that allowed whichever majority party,

00:01:33.028 --> 00:01:40.074
whatever the largest party
in the Deputy of Ministers,

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:42.939
whatever the largest
party in Parliament is

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.251
that party, as long as they
get more than 25% of the vote,

00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:57.087
they will get 2/3s of
the seats in Parliament.

00:01:57.457 --> 00:01:59.650
This is strange because traditionally

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.853
in a Parliamentary system if you got ...

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:03.983
Let's say you were the largest party

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:07.452
and you got 26% of the
vote, you still would not

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.759
have enough seats to govern properly.

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:11.051
You would have to form a coalition with

00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.051
several other parties so that you could

00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:17.049
essentially form a government.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.249
But this is saying whoever
gets the plurality of votes,

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.122
whoever gets the most
votes without necessarily

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.384
being a majority, they will be by default

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.759
become a majority.

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:30.051
And you could imagine why the
fascists wanted this to happen.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.035
They felt that they could
get 25% of the votes,

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.871
one maybe through popular support

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:40.253
but also with the help
of the coercive tactics

00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:42.650
of the Blackshirts and
then that would give

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.285
them stronger control in the legislature.

00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:49.183
Now, the big question is is why would the

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.052
legislature pass this?

00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:53.317
Because at this point
the fascists were not

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:54.720
the dominant party.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.701
They did not have a
majority in the legislature.

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.386
In fact, this was why
they wanted to pass a law

00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.990
because they didn't have a majority.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.118
And once again it's one of those questions

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:03.784
of history.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.321
Some would say that people were enamored

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:07.247
with the fascists.

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:08.451
They were enamored with Mussolini.

00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:10.704
They were eager to have strong leadership.

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.050
They didn't want this
government of coalitions.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.412
They wanted one government to be able

00:03:14.412 --> 00:03:16.156
to take action.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.252
On the other side when
the votes were happening

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:20.253
you actually had Blackshirts in the room.

00:03:20.253 --> 00:03:21.999
One argument is that there was also

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.552
an element of pure intimidation.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:30.084
But needless to say the
Acerbo Law actually passed.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.855
There is irony here
because it was unnecessary.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:37.522
In 1924 when you actually have elections

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:40.554
you have the fascists
getting 2/3s of the vote.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:43.587
Fascists get 2/3 of the vote.

00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:46.794
Now, many today and many
in Italy at the time felt

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:48.671
that this was a fraudulent election.

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.787
They felt the reason why the fascists were

00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:52.522
able to get so many votes is because

00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:54.662
they were able to intimidate folks.

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:57.755
They were able to commit
fraud during the election.

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:01.725
They were able to kind
of throw other votes out,

00:04:01.725 --> 00:04:04.169
and one of the most outspoken individuals

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.451
when it came to criticizing the fascists

00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:09.662
and their tactics of coming to power was

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:12.002
Giacomo Matteotti.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.414
He wrote a book about the fascists.

00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:15.587
He gave two really strong speeches

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:20.459
in the Deputy of Ministers
where he talks about

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.422
or the Chamber of Deputies I should say,

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:27.585
where he talks about the corruption

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:30.499
and the violence of the fascists.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.987
A few days after giving
those speeches he gets

00:04:33.987 --> 00:04:35.852
killed by Blackshirts.

00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:39.919
So, he gets actually
quite violently murdered

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.190
by Blackshirts, and this puts Mussolini

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.335
at least initially in a bit of a bind.

00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:52.127
He doesn't want to look like a thug,

00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:55.005
someone who goes out
and just murders people.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:56.456
It's not clear that he
actually, Mussolini,

00:04:56.456 --> 00:04:58.257
was involved in this in any way,

00:04:58.257 --> 00:05:01.857
but his followers had committed this act.

00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:05.123
To protest against the
murder of Giacomo Matteotti

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:07.922
you actually have the
entire socialist party

00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:09.752
boycotts Parliament.

00:05:09.752 --> 00:05:11.718
This was known as the Aventine Secession

00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:13.999
or at least the 20th
century Aventine Secession.

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.128
Aventine Secession.

00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:19.671
It's called the Aventine
Secession because if you go

00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:22.451
back to Roman times 2500 years ago

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.333
you had the Plebeians
secede out of protest

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:28.584
from harsh rule and they
go to the Aventine Hill.

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:31.020
So, it was named after that same idea.

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.730
The whole reason why the
socialists did this is they

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.996
hoped that by boycotting Parliament

00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:42.597
that that would convince
the King to get rid

00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:44.897
of Benito Mussolini.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.263
Mussolini, as I say, he's also in a bind.

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.763
He doesn't know quite what to do,

00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:50.395
and on top of all of this the Blackshirts

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:52.328
are telling him, "Look, if you don't take

00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:54.464
control of the situation,
if you don't become

00:05:54.464 --> 00:05:56.597
a strong ruler we're going
to do it without you.

00:05:56.597 --> 00:06:00.465
We might even overthrow
you Mr. Mussolini."

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:05.929
In 1925, early 1925,
Mussolini makes his famous

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:07.929
January speech.

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:13.847
1925, his famous January speech.

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:16.674
This is normally viewed
as the formal start

00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:20.147
of his absolute dictatorship.

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:23.530
In this Mussolini, instead
of the Aventine Secession

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.012
somehow undermining Mussolini's power

00:06:26.012 --> 00:06:28.597
because the King did not dismiss Mussolini

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.467
it actually strengthened
Mussolini's power.

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:31.929
He used that as a pretext.

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:34.010
He said, "Look, all of
these deputies they've

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.599
decided not to show up at Parliament.

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.797
They've essentially given up their seats,

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:42.134
and he bans, he bans the
Italian Socialist party.

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:44.999
He embraces the Blackshirts.

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.672
He takes responsibility for them.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.196
He doesn't take responsibility directly

00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:51.006
for Giacomo Matteotti's murder,

00:06:51.006 --> 00:06:53.012
but he takes responsibility
for the Blackshirts,

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:56.730
and he gives in kind of
classic Mussolini style

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.431
a somewhat convoluted
argument about how strength

00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:03.867
and violence is going to give
stability to the Italian people.

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:06.736
Obviously he is an amazing orator.

00:07:06.736 --> 00:07:08.345
He's very charismatic.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.196
This essentially gives
him the control he needs,

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:14.597
and by the end of 1925 you
have the Christmas Eve Law

00:07:14.597 --> 00:07:18.512
that's passed by Parliament
that esentially puts

00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:21.347
no checks on Mussolini's power,

00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:24.398
and as you go then into 1926 they more,

00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:27.333
and more, the fascists
under Mussolini take

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:30.672
absolute control, absolute power of Italy.

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:37.929
So in 1926 they're banning other parties.

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:43.762
So, other parties are banned.

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:46.516
They're starting to force people to become

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:48.263
members of the fascist party if they want

00:07:48.263 --> 00:07:51.136
roles in the government or even
in any type of institution.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:52.996
They're starting to take
control of the press.

00:07:52.996 --> 00:07:55.014
They're starting to have a very strong

00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:57.347
state police architecture.

00:07:57.347 --> 00:07:59.679
If this looks familiar
based on what we studied

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:03.339
about the Nazis it's not a coincidence.

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:07.200
Hitler, he admired Mussolini.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.403
In fact, Mussolini's
march on Rome inspired

00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:15.595
Hitler to attempt his
Beer Hall Putsch in 1923.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.402
A lot of these tactics
that brought Mussolini

00:08:18.402 --> 00:08:21.532
to power you see kind of
a parallel in what brought

00:08:21.532 --> 00:08:25.362
Hitler to power only
about seven years later.
