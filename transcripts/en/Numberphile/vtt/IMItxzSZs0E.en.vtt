BRADY HARAN: And the first thing I'll ask you is what you had for breakfast this morning so I can test the volume.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.520
PERSI DIACONIS: What did I have? I had rice puffs and banana,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.360
and Earl Grey tea,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.060
and fresh orange juice.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.740
HOLLY KRIEGER: I didn't have anything for breakfast.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.620
BRADY: You didn't have breakfast?

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.180
I'm a coffee drinker. Coffee sustains me.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.580
It's keeps you productive.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.460
BRADY: Was the banana on the rice puffs?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.120
Yes it was. I slice it up into tiny little pieces.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.300
Breakfast? What's that? I just got out of bed.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.300
I had cream of wheat with brown sugar.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.340
BRADY: Cream of wheat? I don't even know what that is.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.100
I used the last milk in the house. Almost none left for tea, but it was okay.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.240
For breakfast this morning I had oatmeal. I nearly always have oatmeal for breakfast.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.020
Do you have anything on it? Like sweetener or anything? Or do you have it just...?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.900
No, I have oatmeal and then on the side I have soy yoghurt.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.080
Okay. Testing...
Brady: What did you eat for breakfast?
What did I have? Starbucks.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.100
BRADY: You had Starbucks!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.520
Blueberry scone.
BRADY: Nice.  Yeah, Yeah.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.180
BRADY: You were out and about this morning, were you?

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.040
Oh yeah, every morning. 7. Get up, get out, do stuff.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.180
Egg, bread, and a coffee.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.560
BRADY: Egg and bread, do you toast it? Or plain bread?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.080
Oh no no, I toast it. Toast it. Yeah.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
I had rolled oats and bananas.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.980
and a really good coffee which is how I have to start my day every morning.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.160
BRADY: Good coffee. Colombian?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.820
Colombian, of course.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.140
Cranberries.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140
Porridge and bananas.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.600
Little bits of dates and some wheat bran.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.100
Actually, I missed breakfast this morning.  Which was...  In fact I haven't eaten yet today.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.700
BRADY: At all?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
No. Sometimes this happens.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
Is this thing on?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.100
But I did have a curry at approximately half past 12 last night, so really I'm probably still digesting.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.200
Uhh... and a bacon and
BRADY: Pound of wurst?
...and potatoes and it was all not good.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.880
Since we're discussing my breakfast from this morning,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.080
which was not the breakfast the hotel offered us

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.220
because they wanted to have a natural number

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.820
of our English pounds in exchange for that breakfast. And obviously...

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.460
BRADY: How many pounds did they want for breakfast?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.800
On the order of twenty.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000
I had eggs and cinnamon toast.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.180
BRADY: Twenty pounds!?!
--Twenty pounds for breakfast, but I'm about to say

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.300
they better chop it into bite-sized pieces and put it in my mouth for me for twenty quid.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440
BRADY: Bit of test, what did you have for breakfast this morning?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440
The usual. Muesli.
Brady: Muesli?   Yup.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.600
Okay, so I got up and had oatmeal at about 5 in the morning. Oatmeal and coffee.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.940
BRADY: 5 in the morning!?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.280
Oh I had, um, cereal and coffee.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.220
And then my daughter woke up a little bit after 5 and I made her a coffee.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.300
Ah let's see, I had coffee and a bit of a smoothie.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.780
Ah hello, HELLO! Hey hey hey hey!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.580
BRADY: Let me ask you what you had for breakfast this morning.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840
No memory. Ah, actually, I do I do I do.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.500
BRADY: Of course you do. What did you have?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.520
Let's see. What did I have for breakfast? Cereal with lots of fruit.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.960
I had all the leftovers from the kids.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.860
BRADY: Alright.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.740
I had some toast.
BRADY: Just toast?
Just toast yeah.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.660
BRADY: What did you have on it?
Peanut butter.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.280
What's recipe today, Jim?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
Test 2, test test test. I'm probably not switched on.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
You are switched on.
-I am?
What did you have for breakfast?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.560
I had a bacon panini apparently.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.820
What did I have for breakfast? Some salmon and rice and she brought me some coffee, didn't she?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820
Yeah, she did.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.380
For breakfast today I had two Weetabix.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.440
BRADY: Two? 
- Yes
BRADY: Why not three?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.260
Because then I'd end up with an odd number.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.900
Actually, you know I don't care about the coffee very much. But yeah, I do drink it.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.520
BRADY: Bit of a sound check professor, what did you have for breakfast this morning?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.320
Oh, yoghurt and fruit.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.560
BRADY: What fruit did you have?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.620
More mangos.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.380
BRADY: Really? Did you have rum on them? Haha.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.860
I was yearning for that, but no.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.220
Porridge.
BRADY: Porridge?
With milk, bananas, and blueberries.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.480
Oatmeal.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.780
BRADY: Oatmeal. Did you put anything on 'em?

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.760
Some raspberries and milk.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.640
Well I don't generally eat anything in the morning.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.060
BRADY: What? You're sort of healthy?...

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.580
I know, but I... yeah, but I exercise a lot. I exercise for two hours then I eat lunch. Especially when I'm running late.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.700
BRADY: I thought you weren't supposed to exercise on an empty stomach though.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.220
Well I've been exercising for fifty years so I do it the way I want to do it.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.380
BRADY: I'm going to do what you do because it seems to be working.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.240
Hello!
BRADY: What did you have for breakfast?

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.940
Umm... I did some maths for breakfast.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.080
BRADY: You did maths for breakfast?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.340
Yeah.
