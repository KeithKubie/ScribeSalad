00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.920
In this video, we're going to
study the electric field

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.860
created by an infinite uniformly
charged plate.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.400
And why are we going
to do that?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.550
Well, one, because we'll learn
that the electric field is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.650
constant, which is neat by
itself, and then that's kind

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.420
of an important thing to realize
later when we talk

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.640
about parallel charged plates
and capacitors, because our

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
physics book tells them that
the field is constant, but

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.340
they never really prove it.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.340
So we will prove it here, and
the basis of all of that is to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.790
figure out what the electric
charge of an infinitely

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.400
charged plate is.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.975
So let's take a side view of the
infinitely charged plate

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.440
and get some intuition.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.550
Let's say that's the side view
of the plate-- and let's say

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.670
that this plate has a charge
density of sigma.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
And what's charge density?

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.240
It just says, well, that's
coulombs per area.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.750
Charge density is equal
to charge per area.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.930
That's all sigma is.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.980
So we're saying this has a
uniform charge density.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.030
So before we break into what may
be hard-core mathematics,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.870
and if you're watching this in
the calculus playlist, you

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.670
might want to review some of
the electrostatics from the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.400
physics playlist, and
that'll probably be

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.810
relatively easy for you.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.090
If you're watching this from the
physics playlist and you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.020
haven't done the calculus
playlist, you should not watch

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.430
this video because you will
find it overwhelming.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.710
But anyway, let's proceed.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.200
So let's say that once again
this is my infinite so it goes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.300
off in every direction and it
even comes out of the video,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.170
where this is a side view.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.130
Let's say I have a point
charge up here Q.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:41.470
So let's think a little bit
about if I have a point--

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.170
let's say I have an area
here on my plate.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.550
Let's think a little bit about
what the net effect of it is

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.250
going to be on this
point charge.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.430
Well, first of all, let's say
that this point charge is at a

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.225
height h above the field.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.840
Let me draw that.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.260
This is a height h, and let's
say this is the point directly

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.300
below the point charge, and
let's say that this distance

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.110
right here is r.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.400
So first of all, what is the
distance between this part of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.000
our plate and our
point charge?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.780
What is this distance that
I'll draw in magenta?

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.030
What is this distance?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.550
Well, the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.880
This is a right triangle, so
it's the square root of this

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.270
side squared plus this
side squared.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.030
So this is going to be
the square root of h

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.570
squared plus r squared.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.990
So that's the distance between
this area and our test charge.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.550
Now, let's get a little
bit of intuition.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.410
So if this is a positive test
charge and if this plate is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.950
positively charged, the force
from just this area on the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.620
charge is going to be radially
outward from this area, so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.220
it's going to be-- let me do it
in another color because I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.220
don't want to-- it's going to
go in that direction, right?

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.720
But since this is an infinite
plate in every direction,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.530
there's going to be another
point on this plate that's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.610
essentially on the other side of
this point over here where

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.140
its net force, its net
electrostatic force on the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.490
point charge, is going
to be like that.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.680
And as you can see, since we
have a uniform charge density

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.470
and the plate is symmetric in
every direction, the x or the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.700
horizontal components of the
force are going to cancel out.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.080
And so that's true for really
any point along this plate.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.910
Because if you pick any point
along it, and we're looking at

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.720
a side view, but if we took a
top view, if that's the top

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.790
view and, of course, the plate
goes off in every direction

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.390
forever and that's kind of where
our point charge is, if

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.930
we said, oh, well, you know,
there's this point on the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.160
plate and it's going to have
some y-component that's on

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
this top view coming out of the
video, but it'll have some

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.190
x-component, this point's
x-component effect

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.320
will cancel it out.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.000
You can always find another
point on the plate that's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.680
symmetrically opposite whose
x-component of electrostatic

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.600
force will cancel out
with the first one.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.769
So given that, that's just a
long-winded way of saying that

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.900
the net force on this point
charge will only be upwards.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.025
I think it should make sense
to you that all of the

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:30.370
x-components or the horizontal
components of the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.120
electrostatic force all cancel
out, because they're infinite

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.780
points to either side
of this test charge.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.550
So with that out of the way,
what do we need to focus on?

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.890
Well, we just need to focus
on the y-components of the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.470
electrostatic force.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.660
So what's the y-component?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.460
So let's say that this point
right here-- and I'll keep

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.270
switching colors.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.270
Let's say that this point-- and
once again, this is a side

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:09.250
view-- is exerting-- its field
at that point is e1, and it's

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.270
going to be going in
that direction.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.620
What is its y-component?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.200
What is the component
in that direction?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.620
And, of course, it's
pushing outwards if

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.290
they're both positive.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.120
So what is the y-component?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.290
What is that?

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.330
Well, if we knew theta, if
we knew this angle, the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.350
y-component, or the upwards
component is going to be the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.890
electric field times
cosine of theta.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.590
Cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse, so hypotenuse

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.810
times cosine of theta is
equal to the adjacent.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.050
So if we wanted the vertical
or the y-component of the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.800
electric field, we would just
multiply the magnitude of the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.290
electric field times the
cosine of theta.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.980
So how do we figure out theta?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.510
Well, that theta is also the
same as this theta from our

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.430
basic trigonometry.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.080
And so what's cosine of theta?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.940
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.770
from SOHCAHTOA, right?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.160
Cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.120
So when we're looking at this
angle, which is the same as

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.110
that one, what's adjacent
over hypotenuse?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.740
This is adjacent, that
is the hypotenuse.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.600
So what do we get?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.030
We get that the y-component of
the electric field due to just

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.065
this little chunk of our plate,
the electric field in

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:33.935
the y-component, let's just call
that sub 1 because this

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.280
is just a little small
part of the plate.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.400
It is equal to the electric
field generally, the magnitude

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.720
of the electric field from this
point, times cosine of

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.910
theta, which equals the electric
field times the

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:59.500
adjacent-- times height-- over
the hypotenuse-- over the

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.110
square root of h squared
plus r squared.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.610
Fair enough.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.250
So now let's see if we can
figure out what the magnitude

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.270
of the electric field is, and
then we can put it back into

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.920
this and we'll figure out the
y-component from this point.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.770
And actually, we're not just
going to figure out the

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.840
electric field just from that
point, we're going to figure

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.730
out the electric field from a
ring that's surrounding this.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.530
So let me give you a little bit
of perspective or draw it

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.480
with a little bit
of perspective.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.990
So this is my infinite
plate again.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.920
I'll draw it in yellow
again since I

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.390
originally drew it in yellow.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.315
This is my infinite plate.

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:39.675
It goes in every direction.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.930
And then I have my charge
floating above this plate

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.930
someplace at height of h.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.120
And this point here, this could
have been right here

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.770
maybe, but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to draw a ring

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.470
that's of an equal radius around
this point right here.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.430
So this is r.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.850
Let's draw a ring, because all
of these points are going to

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.400
be the same distance from
our test charge, right?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.170
They all are exactly like this
one point that I drew here.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.420
You could almost view this as
a cross-section of this ring

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.290
that I'm drawing.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.890
So let's figure out what the
y-component of the electric

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.310
force from this ring is
on our point charge.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.370
So to do that, we just have to
figure out the area of this

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:34.740
ring, multiply it times our
charge density, and we'll have

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.640
the total charge from that
ring, and then we can use

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.919
Coulomb's Law to figure out its
force or the field at that

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.980
point, and then we could use
this formula, which we just

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.700
figured out, to figure
out the y-component.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.710
I know it's involved, but it'll
all be worth it, because

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.520
you'll know that we have a
constant electric field.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.360
So let's do that.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.385
So first of all, Coulomb's Law
tells us-- well, first of all,

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:57.360
let's figure out the charge
from this ring.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.390
So Q of the ring,
it equals what?

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.460
It equals the circumference
of the ring times the

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.160
width of the ring.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:11.230
So let's say the circumference
is 2 pi r, and let's say it's

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.675
a really skinny ring.

00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:14.750
It's really skinny.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.600
It's dr. Infinitesimally
skinny.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.470
So it's width is dr. So that's
the area of the ring, and so

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.340
what's its charge going to be?

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.940
It's area times the charge
density, so times sigma.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.140
That is the charge
of the ring.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.400
And then what is the electric
field generated by the ring at

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.900
this point here where
our test charge is?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.250
Well, Coulomb's Law tells us
that the force generated by

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:48.700
the ring is going to be equal
to Coulomb's constant times

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.460
the charge of the ring times our
test charge divided by the

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.100
distance squared, right?

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.350
Well, what's the distance
between really any point on

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.400
the ring and our test charge?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.380
Well, this could be one of the
points on the ring and this

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.130
could be another one, right?

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.640
And this is like a
cross-section.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.470
So the distance at any point,
this distance right here, is

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.410
once again by the Pythagorean
theorem because

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.880
this is also r.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.060
This distance is the
square root of h

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.140
squared plus r squared.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.710
It's the same thing as that.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:28.290
So it's the distance squared
and that's equal to k times

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:35.170
the charge in the ring times
our test charge divided by

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.970
distance squared.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.560
Well, distance is the square
root of h squared plus r

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.820
squared, so if we square
that, it just becomes h

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.300
squared plus r squared.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.280
And if we want to know the
electric field created by that

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.060
ring, the electric field is
just the force per test

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.360
charge, so if we divide both
sides by Q, we learned that

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:02.510
the electric field of the ring
is equal to Coulomb's constant

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:09.540
times the charge in the
ring divided by h

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.830
squared plus r squared.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.180
And now what is the
y-component of the

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.460
charge in the ring?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.960
Well, it's going to
be this, right?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.890
What we just figured out is the
magnitude of essentially

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.250
this vector, right?

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.350
But we want its y-component,
because all of the

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.950
x-components just cancel out,
so it's going to be times

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.790
cosine of theta, and we figured
out that cosine of

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.380
theta is essentially this, so
we multiply it times that.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:42.370
So the field from the ring in
the y-direction is going to be

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.850
equal to its magnitude times
cosine of theta, which we

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.020
figured out was h over
the square root of h

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.780
squared plus r squared.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.740
We could simplify this
a little bit.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.670
The denominator becomes what?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:03.630
h squared plus r squared
to the 3/2 power.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.210
And what's the numerator?

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:13.340
Let's see, we have kh and then
the charge in the ring, which

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.310
we solved up here.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:28.180
So that's 2 pi sigma r-- make
sure I didn't lose anything--

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:35.480
dr. So we have just calculated
the y-component, the vertical

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.860
component, of the electric
field at h

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.270
units above the plate.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.600
And not from the entire plate,
just the electric field

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.530
generated by a ring of radius r
from the base of where we're

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.780
taking this height.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.160
And so I've already gone 12
minutes into this video, and

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.130
just to give you a break and
myself a break, I will

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.230
continue in the next.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.110
But you can imagine what
we're going to do now.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:03.680
We just figured out the electric
field created by just

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.320
this ring, right?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.425
So now we can integrate across
the entire plane.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.040
We can solve all the rings of
radius infinity all the way

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.170
down to zero, and that'll give
us the sum of all of the

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.880
electric fields and essentially
the net electric

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.460
field h units above the
surface of the plate.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.340
See you in the next video.
