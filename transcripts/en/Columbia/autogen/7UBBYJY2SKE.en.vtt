and the and because you know the of the

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:20.130

and that's that's essentially the basis
 

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.950
and that's that's essentially the basis
of it so the idea is that these flights

of it so the idea is that these flights
 

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.200
of it so the idea is that these flights
would go around the Arctic a little bit

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:36.210
would go around the Arctic a little bit
 

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.330
would go around the Arctic a little bit

mean they're you know they're they vary

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640
mean they're you know they're they vary
 

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.540
mean they're you know they're they vary
a lot from place to place but in that

00:57:59.540 --> 00:57:59.550
a lot from place to place but in that
 

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.430
a lot from place to place but in that
case you would you find a dramatic

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440
case you would you find a dramatic
 

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.900
case you would you find a dramatic
reduction and in the in the case of the

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:04.910
reduction and in the in the case of the
 

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:09.050
reduction and in the in the case of the
of the diesel trucks and are the the

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:09.060
of the diesel trucks and are the the
 

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.890
of the diesel trucks and are the the
trucks and the other off-road vehicles

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:11.900
trucks and the other off-road vehicles
 

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.660
trucks and the other off-road vehicles
we know there are there are traps that

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:14.670
we know there are there are traps that
 

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:16.940
we know there are there are traps that
can reduce by ninety percent or more the

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:16.950
can reduce by ninety percent or more the
 

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.320
can reduce by ninety percent or more the
generation that can happen from these

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:18.330
generation that can happen from these
 

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:19.940
generation that can happen from these
vehicles so it's a combination of these

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:19.950
vehicles so it's a combination of these
 

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:21.650
vehicles so it's a combination of these
things won't quite be zero carbon but

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660
things won't quite be zero carbon but
 

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.810
things won't quite be zero carbon but
but it might be ninety-seven percent

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:23.820
but it might be ninety-seven percent
 

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.970
but it might be ninety-seven percent
reductions in some cases and that can

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980
reductions in some cases and that can
 

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.140
reductions in some cases and that can
make a huge difference when these

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.150
make a huge difference when these
 

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:39.079
make a huge difference when these
effects or as large as they are

00:58:39.079 --> 00:58:39.089
 
 

00:58:39.089 --> 00:58:44.069
 
I'm wondering whether fracking causes

00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079
I'm wondering whether fracking causes
 

00:58:44.079 --> 00:58:50.039
I'm wondering whether fracking causes
climate change in any way well it really

00:58:50.039 --> 00:58:50.049
climate change in any way well it really
 

00:58:50.049 --> 00:58:53.969
climate change in any way well it really
depends on on whether there's a lot of

00:58:53.969 --> 00:58:53.979
depends on on whether there's a lot of
 

00:58:53.979 --> 00:58:57.329
depends on on whether there's a lot of
methane release and I mean the I mean

00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:57.339
methane release and I mean the I mean
 

00:58:57.339 --> 00:58:59.160
methane release and I mean the I mean
it's a it's a very much a double-edged

00:58:59.160 --> 00:58:59.170
it's a it's a very much a double-edged
 

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:01.019
it's a it's a very much a double-edged
sword into I mean fracking you know

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:01.029
sword into I mean fracking you know
 

00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:02.039
sword into I mean fracking you know
they're obviously concerns about

00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:02.049
they're obviously concerns about
 

00:59:02.049 --> 00:59:03.959
they're obviously concerns about
fracking in terms of water supplies and

00:59:03.959 --> 00:59:03.969
fracking in terms of water supplies and
 

00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:08.339
fracking in terms of water supplies and
other things in any case but the there's

00:59:08.339 --> 00:59:08.349
other things in any case but the there's
 

00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:10.950
other things in any case but the there's
a lot of work that's being done and some

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960
a lot of work that's being done and some
 

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.839

been looking a lot at some of these
 

00:59:18.819 --> 00:59:23.549
been looking a lot at some of these

natural gas for coal and but on the
 

00:59:39.489 --> 00:59:41.009

00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:43.589

things we know is that the Arctic is an
 

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.450
things we know is that the Arctic is an
iconic location and it's like the

that have to be tested and lab they have

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:30.030
that have to be tested and lab they have

something of the sort
 

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.980
something of the sort
to be safely tested and you have to know

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:38.990
to be safely tested and you have to know
 

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.000
to be safely tested and you have to know
that they're not going to be a lot of

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.010
that they're not going to be a lot of
 

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:42.100
that they're not going to be a lot of

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.950

among those and Jim you are probably the

world expert on exactly this you know
 

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:50.260
world expert on exactly this you know
how sensitive you know this is so I

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:50.270
how sensitive you know this is so I
 

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.600
how sensitive you know this is so I
think it's important that you know some

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:52.610
think it's important that you know some
 

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.030

research go on in this but as a

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:55.040
research go on in this but as a
 

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:00.040
research go on in this but as a
practical matter the even with you know

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:00.050
practical matter the even with you know
 

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:03.070

changes in in the cloud effects well it

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:03.080
changes in in the cloud effects well it
 

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.220

that's still a problem even if you could

that's still a problem even if you could
 

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.700
that's still a problem even if you could
could see major gains so I think that

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:17.710
could see major gains so I think that
 

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:21.430

01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299
kind of causes for optimism I'm
 

01:06:03.299 --> 01:06:04.700
kind of causes for optimism I'm
wondering how you see 350 in that

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:04.710
wondering how you see 350 in that
 

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:06.469
wondering how you see 350 in that
context you know it seems like they've

01:06:06.469 --> 01:06:06.479
context you know it seems like they've
 

01:06:06.479 --> 01:06:07.880
context you know it seems like they've
had a lot of success compared to other

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:07.890
had a lot of success compared to other
 

01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:09.739
had a lot of success compared to other
environmental groups by taking an

01:06:09.739 --> 01:06:09.749
environmental groups by taking an
 

01:06:09.749 --> 01:06:11.420
environmental groups by taking an
extremely intransigence stance toward

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:11.430
extremely intransigence stance toward
 

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:14.180
extremely intransigence stance toward
new fossil fuel developments as winning

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.190
new fossil fuel developments as winning
 

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:15.620

if you think that this is also part of

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:15.630
if you think that this is also part of
 

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:17.359
if you think that this is also part of
the solution and that their things we

01:06:17.359 --> 01:06:17.369
the solution and that their things we
 

01:06:17.369 --> 01:06:18.920
the solution and that their things we
could learn from them or if you think

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:18.930
could learn from them or if you think
 

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:21.829
could learn from them or if you think
that this kind of intransigence is to to

01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839
that this kind of intransigence is to to
 

01:06:21.839 --> 01:06:23.180
that this kind of intransigence is to to
black and white and distracting us from

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.190
black and white and distracting us from
 

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:25.130
black and white and distracting us from
other kinds of solutions you know I

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140
other kinds of solutions you know I
 

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.309
other kinds of solutions you know I
think that you know they they played a

01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319
think that you know they they played a
 

01:06:27.319 --> 01:06:30.109
think that you know they they played a
significant role in the issue one of the

01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119
significant role in the issue one of the
 

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.430

fix would be nice if and looking at some

01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:42.029
fix would be nice if and looking at some
 

01:06:42.029 --> 01:06:43.729
fix would be nice if and looking at some
of these effects in northern areas it

01:06:43.729 --> 01:06:43.739
of these effects in northern areas it
 

01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:45.349
of these effects in northern areas it
would start looking not not just at the

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359
would start looking not not just at the
 

01:06:45.359 --> 01:06:46.940
would start looking not not just at the
additional co2 at the other if they do

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:46.950
additional co2 at the other if they do
 

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.339

this because if the Arctic really goes
to hell in the basket it's it's going to

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:48.670
to hell in the basket it's it's going to

the the Arctic climate action registry
 

01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:55.620
the the Arctic climate action registry
is one means of doing this and I think

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:55.630
is one means of doing this and I think
 

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.900
is one means of doing this and I think
some of the activist groups or another

these climate engineering projects they
 

01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:09.839
these climate engineering projects they
even end up playing a role but i think
