00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this problem, you'll be given Bob's public key

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
along with two messages and their corresponding signatures,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and your task will be to calculate a signature for the third message.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In the code, here is Bob's public key.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the first message--387.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the signature for the first message.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The second message--only two.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And here's the signature for the second message.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And your task is to create a signature for the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
message 774 and assign it to the variable s3.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We've provided a test function for you to use

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to see if your value for s3 is correct.
