oh my name is Mariana Blair I come from

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790
oh my name is Mariana Blair I come from
 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.769
oh my name is Mariana Blair I come from
friends and I would like to know how do

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779
friends and I would like to know how do
 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.430
friends and I would like to know how do
you succeed to discover the big man

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
you succeed to discover the big man
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.140
you succeed to discover the big man
Terry how did you succeed to to discover

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
Terry how did you succeed to to discover
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750
Terry how did you succeed to to discover
these things and because I'm really

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
these things and because I'm really
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.230
these things and because I'm really
impressed so that's it thank you well hi

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
impressed so that's it thank you well hi
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.359
impressed so that's it thank you well hi
Marianne to tell you the truth I didn't

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
Marianne to tell you the truth I didn't
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.880
Marianne to tell you the truth I didn't
discover the big bang theory that honor

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
discover the big bang theory that honor
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.900
discover the big bang theory that honor
goes back to the 1920s when Edwin Hubble

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
goes back to the 1920s when Edwin Hubble
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940
goes back to the 1920s when Edwin Hubble
discovered the galaxies are going away

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
discovered the galaxies are going away
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520
discovered the galaxies are going away
from us at great speeds and a few years

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
from us at great speeds and a few years
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340
from us at great speeds and a few years
before that when theorists predicted

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
before that when theorists predicted
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.290
before that when theorists predicted
this result based on Einstein's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
this result based on Einstein's
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779
this result based on Einstein's
equations so I didn't discover the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
equations so I didn't discover the
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270
equations so I didn't discover the
theory but it's been under test for a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
theory but it's been under test for a
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880
theory but it's been under test for a
long time the work that I did was to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
long time the work that I did was to
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350
long time the work that I did was to
test the theory by measuring the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
test the theory by measuring the
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840
test the theory by measuring the
primordial heat radiation this is heat

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
primordial heat radiation this is heat
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670
primordial heat radiation this is heat
radiation that should still fill the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
radiation that should still fill the
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700
radiation that should still fill the
universe and is really quite bright but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
universe and is really quite bright but
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.010
universe and is really quite bright but
was very difficult to measure so our job

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
was very difficult to measure so our job
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.380
was very difficult to measure so our job
with our cosmic background Explorer

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
with our cosmic background Explorer
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910
with our cosmic background Explorer
satellite was to measure the heat of the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
satellite was to measure the heat of the
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740
satellite was to measure the heat of the
radiation see if it matches the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
radiation see if it matches the
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390
radiation see if it matches the
prediction of the theory very precisely

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
prediction of the theory very precisely
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640
prediction of the theory very precisely
and in addition to see whether it's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
and in addition to see whether it's
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890
and in addition to see whether it's
equally bright in all directions so the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
equally bright in all directions so the
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780
equally bright in all directions so the
result was it matches up exactly with

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
result was it matches up exactly with
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609
result was it matches up exactly with
what the predictions of the Big Bang

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
what the predictions of the Big Bang
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.670
what the predictions of the Big Bang
Theory say it should be
