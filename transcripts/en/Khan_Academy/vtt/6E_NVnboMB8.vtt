00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.210
Welcome back.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.410
Whenever I start running out
of time I rush things and I

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.670
most probably confuse you.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.000
So let me go over that last
example one more time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I said I have a completely
fair coin and I'm going to

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
flip it twice, and I want to
know the probability that

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.865
I get heads in both times.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.150
Well, we already know the
probability that I get heads

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.250
the first time is 1/2.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
There's 1/2 chance I get heads
the first time and there's

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.740
1/2 chance that I get
tails the first time.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.450
And then I'm going to flip
again, and let's say, in this

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.560
world, there's a 1/2 chance
that we enter into this reality

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.980
where the first flip is heads,
and then in that world I'm

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.190
going to flip a coin again.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.590
And I know that there's a half
a chance of heads-- this is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.250
the second flip-- and
1/2 chance of tails.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.250
And I know in this other
world-- I'll just draw it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.920
so we can figure out maybe
other probabilities.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.960
I know that there's 1/2
chance of heads, so this

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.360
is for the second flip.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.355
And I know that there's
1/2 chance of tails

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:08.130
on the second flip.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.260
And just so you know, this is
called a probability tree.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.430
And in general, it works
excellent if you're not

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.550
dealing with huge numbers.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.480
If you're not dealing with--
I'm doing 100 trials or the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.390
probabilities get really messy
or in each trial there's 50

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.050
different circumstances
that can occur.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.890
In this situation there's two
branches per-- you could say

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.270
per node, so there's not that
many circumstances that

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.880
can occur on each trial.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.350
And we're not doing that
many trials, so it's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.120
pretty manageable.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.110
And in these situations,
the probability tree

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.240
works really well.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.450
You can never get overwhelmed
with the information then.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.330
And I'll show you, we'll do
some pretty complicated

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.950
examples using
probability tree.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.930
There's no reason why I
actually circled that with

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.620
yellow; I just happened
to switch to yellow.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.420
But anyway, just so you know,
this was the first trial.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.300
This is the second trial.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.370
We want to know the probability
of getting here because we got

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.120
heads on the first trial,
heads in the second.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.330
Well, we know that there was a
1/2 chance of getting there and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.660
then we know of that 1/2 or you
know, 1/2 the times we got

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.100
here, 1/2 of those times
you would get there.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.910
So the probability of getting
there is 1/2 times 1/2,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.880
which is equal to 1/4.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.930
Another way of thinking about
it is each of these scenarios--

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.980
this is a scenario heads, heads
because you got a heads

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.240
and then a heads.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.920
This is the scenario
heads, tails.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.940
This is the scenario
tails, heads.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.690
You got a tail, then
you got a heads.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.230
And this is the
scenario tails, tails.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.780
And all of these are equally
probable scenarios.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.170
There's no reason why one is
more likely than the other.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.990
And so we have 4 equally
probable scenarios, so

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.275
the total of equally
probable scenarios is 4.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.510
How many of these equal
probable scenarios is our

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.610
probability or our event true?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.300
Well, it's one of
them-- heads heads.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.160
So it's 1/4.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.050
So that's another
way of viewing it.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.710
Another way you could view it
is if we did this trial a

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.910
hundred times, if we did is a
hundred times, 50 of the times

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.150
my first flip will be heads.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.000
And then of those 50 times 25
of those times-- half of those

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.680
trials where I got 50 the first
time will be heads again.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.330
And so 25 out of the total 100
trials will end up with heads

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.650
heads, or this is 25% chance.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.230
I wanted to show you that all
of these are pretty much the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.870
equivalent, but I want your
brain to kind of connect

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.460
and make sure that it
understands everything.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.343
So now that we've drawn this
probability tree I don't want

00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:55.685
it to go to waste, so let me
give you another circumstance.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.020
What's the probability I get
one heads and one tail?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.430
And notice, I'm not saying that
it has to be in that order.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.950
You know, it could be tails,
heads or heads, tail.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.840
Let me write that down.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.930
This is equal to the
probability of tails, heads

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.990
plus the probability
of heads, tails.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.300
Or we could write that as-- and
this is kind of with set theory

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.570
notation, but it's good to be
familiar with all of these.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.980
It's a probability of getting
tail, heads or this U looking

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.050
thing means or in set theory.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.860
Or the probability of getting
heads, tails, right?

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.830
We can get tails, heads
or heads, tails.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.380
In either of these we're
getting one heads

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.280
and one tails.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.920
So what's that probability?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.370
Well, we can just look at all
of the outcomes and we know

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.020
that there are 4 equally
probable outcomes.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.240
And then, how many of these is
the event that we want true?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.880
Well, it's 1, 2.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.280
So there's a 2/4 or equal 1/4
chance where when we do both of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.810
these flips we get at least one
heads and at least one tails.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.260
And I think that's a good time
now that we've drawn this tree

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.070
and we've talked about two
flips in a row, to realize that

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.880
these are mutually
exclusive events.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.030
The reason why we can multiply
the probability of the first

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.280
event times the probability of
the second event is because the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.480
probability of getting heads
the second time is completely

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.160
independent of whether I
got heads the first time.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.340
And that might be obvious to
you, but sometimes it isn't.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.390
You know, some people feel that
if they got 5 heads in a row

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.360
that they're more likely to get
a tails on the sixth time.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.450
But what we know from
experience really, is that no,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.170
it's not like the coin knows
that you got 5 heads in a row

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.820
and then it says, oh boy, I
better give Sal a tails now

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.160
just to kind of make up for
all the 5 heads he got.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.370
It's equally problems
to get a heads again.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.600
So that's just something
to keep in mind.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.370
And it's amazing how just human
beings psychologically-- you

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.250
feel that if you have a
big streak of heads that

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.350
you're due for a tails.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.660
But your probability of getting
that tails does not increase.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.830
Although, if you keep doing
it you're probability of

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.301
eventually-- the more times you
do it, the probability of

00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:30.810
getting a tails does increase
and I'll show you that soon.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.930
That last statement probably
confused you and I probably

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.130
shouldn't have said it.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.840
Let's do an example.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.830
Now that we know that in
mutually exclusive events

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.700
you can just multiply
the probabilities.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.530
So let's say I have a fair coin
and what's the probability

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.540
of getting 5 heads in a row?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.090
Well, I have a 1/2 chance of
getting heads the first time.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.230
Then of those, 1/2.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.990
Then another 1/2.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:10.430
So it's 1/2 times 1/2 times
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.470
And that equals 1/2
to the fifth power.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.790
That's equal to 1 over
2 to the fifth power.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.260
And that's 1/32.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.280
That's the probability of
getting 5 heads in a row.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.460
What's the probability of
getting-- let's say I were

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.120
to flip a coin seven times.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.420
So let's say I flip a coin, out
of seven times, what's the

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.035
probability of not
getting any heads?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.270
I'm going to switch colors
just for the hell of it.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.300
Well that might seem a little
bit more convoluted to you,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.100
but just think about it.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.050
The probability of out of the
seven flips of not getting

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.760
any heads, that is equal--
what has to be true then?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.900
We got all tails then.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.090
That's equal to the probability
of getting 7 tails in a row.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.510
And what does that equal?

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.900
Well, the tails are equally
likely to the heads.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.250
So that would be 1/2
to the seventh power.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.570
That equals-- what is that?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:44.060
So it'll be 4 times 132,
so that's equal to 1/128.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.600
And a fun experiment to do is
maybe in your classroom or if

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.460
you have a large group of
people together, maybe 128 or

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.610
some large number of people
and you make everyone flip

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.470
a coin multiple times.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.710
By the end of 5 or 6 or 7
flips, there will probably be--

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.660
and later on we'll actually
figure out the probability

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.750
that there is someone
who has a streak.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.860
But there will probably be
someone who has a very long

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.410
streak of heads or tails.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.510
And that person will probably
think that there's something

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.140
magical about what is going on
in their life at that moment.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.610
And it's important to realize
if you have a large room, if

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.730
you have a room of 500 people,
someone's going to be getting--

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.670
there's a likelihood and we
haven't figured that out yet,

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.520
but just given that you have a
1 in 128 chance of getting 7

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.670
heads or 7 tails in a row.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.100
Someone's going to get if you
have 500 people flipping coins.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.030
But that person, they just view
their own reality, they think

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.080
that today is their lucky day.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.820
And they think that they're on
some type of streak and that

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.440
they should go to Vegas.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.920
But that's just something that
you should think about because

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.280
probability can often
play with our brains.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.240
But anyway, I have 10
seconds left, so I will

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.240
see you in the next video.
