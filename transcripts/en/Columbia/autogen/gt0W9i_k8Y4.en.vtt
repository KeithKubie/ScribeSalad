be creative and think of ways to help
 

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.060
be creative and think of ways to help
each other and we have to ask the

and they feel connected okay now getting
to of course the components now we saw

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159
to of course the components now we saw
 

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:36.950
to of course the components now we saw
professor Miller today and we know that

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960
professor Miller today and we know that
 

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.200
professor Miller today and we know that
there are components to health and

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.210
there are components to health and
 

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:39.690

then we use four stages of change

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.130
then we use four stages of change
 

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.009
then we use four stages of change
because right away people don't even

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:44.019
because right away people don't even
 

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:45.720
because right away people don't even
know there is a problem they don't think

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:45.730

that the elderly are needed they don't
know the numbers so what happens on the

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:49.750
know the numbers so what happens on the
 

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.720
know the numbers so what happens on the
principles I've designed to put this

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:51.730
principles I've designed to put this
 

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.430
principles I've designed to put this
model together the same ones I use for

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440
model together the same ones I use for
 

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.259
model together the same ones I use for
my after-school program so I said it

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:55.269
my after-school program so I said it
 

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.820
my after-school program so I said it
works for you it can work for the

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:56.830
works for you it can work for the
 

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.889
works for you it can work for the
elderly by getting people involved in

00:18:58.889 --> 00:18:58.899
elderly by getting people involved in
 

00:18:58.899 --> 00:19:01.799
elderly by getting people involved in
the process by understanding what their

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:01.809
the process by understanding what their

needs are by asking them and by then
having meetings and gather and so we can

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760
having meetings and gather and so we can
 

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.430
having meetings and gather and so we can
all come together and understand what we

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440
all come together and understand what we
 

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.379
all come together and understand what we
need to do and that's what we're doing

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:10.389
need to do and that's what we're doing
 

00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:13.200
need to do and that's what we're doing
out the reason why we're in production

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:13.210
out the reason why we're in production
 

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.940
out the reason why we're in production
of this program is because it's new it

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:14.950
of this program is because it's new it
 

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.860

was just funded from September of last

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:16.870
was just funded from September of last
 

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.570
was just funded from September of last
year so we haven't even been going a

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:18.580
year so we haven't even been going a
 

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.460

year yet but right now we're doing the
 

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.710
year yet but right now we're doing the
asset mapping and one of the things we

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720
asset mapping and one of the things we
 

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.200
asset mapping and one of the things we
want to do is make sure that we increase

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.210
want to do is make sure that we increase
 

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.990

groups together these are some of the
the connection based opponents we're

00:19:41.129 --> 00:19:41.139
the connection based opponents we're
 

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.899
the connection based opponents we're
going to do planning which is what we're

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:42.909

that first so they trust us and then we
 

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.009
that first so they trust us and then we
can move on to other interventions then

00:19:59.009 --> 00:19:59.019

need a place for their children to go

they be used during the day for the

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:25.770
they be used during the day for the
 

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.230
they be used during the day for the
elderly because they got poles and they

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240
elderly because they got poles and they
 

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.450
elderly because they got poles and they
have places to ride and they have so you

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460
have places to ride and they have so you
 

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.550
have places to ride and they have so you
need to rethink that because we close

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:31.560
need to rethink that because we close
 

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.860

those 20 down until that group is

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:33.870
those 20 down until that group is
 

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.990
those 20 down until that group is
available and that doesn't make any

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000
available and that doesn't make any
 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.730
available and that doesn't make any
sense so the first thing that we're

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740
sense so the first thing that we're
 

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.310
sense so the first thing that we're
working on is opening them up so they're

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320
working on is opening them up so they're
 

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.380
working on is opening them up so they're
open all day long so that both groups

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:42.390
open all day long so that both groups
 

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:47.710
open all day long so that both groups
can utilize them together and separately

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720
can utilize them together and separately
 

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.420
can utilize them together and separately
question how are we supposed to interact

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:50.430
question how are we supposed to interact
 

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:52.550

get to connect with them alive good
question and that is definitely a

00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880
question and that is definitely a
 

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.930
question and that is definitely a
problem we're not connecting because we

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940
problem we're not connecting because we
 

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.990
problem we're not connecting because we
