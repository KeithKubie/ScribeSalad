00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:08.170
RICHARD FULCHER:
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.870
In the dev keynote,
we just announced

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.526
a comprehensive update
to material design.

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:15.400
I feel like I actually
recognize a few people

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.309
from the dev keynote.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.610
So hopefully you enjoyed that.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.010
We are going to talk about
material theming, which

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.170
is material designs new approach
to customizing apps powered

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.330
by open source components, new
tools, and new design guidance.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.040
We've created all of this work
focused around two major goals.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.490
First, we wanted to do more
to improve the designer

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.460
to developer workflow.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.790
And it was a big focus
for us in this work.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.860
We want to make it
faster and easier

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.910
to build custom and
improved experiences.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.110
And, second, we wanted to make
material much more adaptable

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.460
and much more flexible so that
more varieties of products

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.790
and different styles of
brand can come to material

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.890
and take the benefits of it.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.810
This talk today is
going to be focused

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.670
on that aspect of customization,
how you move from customizing

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.310
and design to realizing
that customization in code.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.180
So we'll cover both
halves of that.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.820
We launched Material
Design in 2014

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.750
as a way of creating a
unified cross-platform set

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.040
of experiences.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.830
It was a design system
not just for Google,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.160
not just for Android,
but for everyone.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.370
And we wanted it to be able
to span mobile, desktop,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.300
and other devices along the way.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.810
And since then, we've
seen an incredible amount

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.720
of beautiful and usable
products produced

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
by you, built on the
foundations of Material Design.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
As an example, we have these
winners of previous years

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.830
Material Design Awards.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.440
So many of these great
experiences from the New York

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.710
Times, to Airbnb,
to Blinkist succeed

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.616
because they're able to
bring their brand to bear.

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.240
They bring the strength
of the identity

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.639
they've already established
into the forefront

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.520
of the experience.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.730
Without compromising [INAUDIBLE]
sense of predictability,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.270
we're introducing
confusion for the user.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.140
With material theming, you
can create a custom theme

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.890
of material which is
personalized for your product,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.610
expressing its brand through
color, type, and shape.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.410
For today's talk,
we're going to walk

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.680
through three steps involved
in using material theming.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.140
First, Rachel is going to tell
us about the design system

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.931
itself and how it's expanded
to include material theming.

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.555
We'll go into a lot
more detail than we

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.150
were able to cover
in the keynote there.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.860
Then Rachel I are
going to walk you

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.090
through a set of different
examples of how you can create

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.250
material themes for
different types of apps

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.900
and different types of brands.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.172
And Josh is going to show us how
to realize all of this in code.

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:01.380
So that's the plan for today.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.470
RACHEL BEEN: OK, let's talk
about the design system.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.340
So our updated
material guidelines

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.670
help you understand the
foundations of good design

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.460
and how to build an
app with material.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.440
So materiality, if
you guys remember,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.030
is still the
fundamental metaphor

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.530
driving the design system.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.810
These tactile
surfaces still create

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.660
a really predictable usable
environment for the user.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.620
Combined with things like a
clear elevation model, defining

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.020
surface relationships,
the user intuitively

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.080
understands how to
use your products.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.610
Fundamental guidelines, which
is layout, interaction, motion,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.950
and so much more still
provide the scaffolding

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.070
to create these beautiful
and functional products.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.840
And components are still
the building blocks

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.440
of great product experiences.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.870
We've expanded componentry
over the years as many of you

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.670
might have noticed,
introducing things

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.275
like the bottom
nav and this year

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:59.400
the bottom app bar, which
you probably saw on stage

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.280
and will see in
our presentation.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.110
We've also strengthened
the usability

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.780
of many of our componentry
based on user research

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.370
and the material community.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.460
For example, last year, we
released a new text field

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.760
component to increase
usability and discoverability

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.220
within this component.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.709
Starting today,
component articles

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.890
in the material guidelines
will feature a theming section.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.900
These section showcase
how components

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.010
can be easily customized from
the baseline material theme.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.320
After understanding the
customization possibilities

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.780
within the guidelines, you
can use a very powerful tool,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.020
the Material Theme
Editor to execute.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.900
What this tool does is
it cascades customization

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.420
decisions throughout
your design components

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.960
creating a branded symbol
library within Sketch.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.420
Let's talk about a few of these
customizations that really

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.190
make your product come alive.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.580
In 2014, we launched a beautiful
color palette and a system

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.230
to think about how to
apply color to your UI.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.650
But what if your brand color
wasn't in this palette?

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.780
How could you use the system?

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.770
Today, we're introducing
guidelines and tools

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.180
bringing any color into
the Material Design system.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.920
A new tool in the
guidelines creates

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.190
beautiful material palettes
generated from any color

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.710
and gives you additional
options for harmonious colors

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.600
to add to your palettes.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.570
You can also generate pellets
in the Material Theme Editor.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.210
The theme editor, though,
takes this a step further,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.580
applying colors to the
appropriate componentry

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.470
across your symbol library.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.750
It also helps check
for accessibility,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.660
using the full palette to
provide alternative colors that

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.210
meet accessibility standards.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.640
So let's talk about type.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.240
We introduce the same
customization possibilities

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.390
with typography.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.140
In 2014, we released a
comprehensive Roboto type scale

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.360
that mapped to componentry.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.280
Today, with the
Material Theme Editor,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.460
we can create beautiful type
scales for any typeface, not

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.750
just Roboto.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.210
These scales are optically
corrected to work

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.300
in material components, mapping
again across your entire symbol

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.380
library.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.940
And for shape, today, with the
launch of the theme editor,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.940
we are introducing the ability
to systematically customize

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.230
shape so that rounder corners
or a custom cut detail on some

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.420
of your surfaces
immediately apply

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.560
across all of the surfaces
within your design.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.690
And, lastly,
iconography-- we've been

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.550
building our
comprehensive set of icons

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.410
since 2014, resulting in a
collection of over 1,000 icons.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.050
Today, we're announcing four
additional sets of icons,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.800
expanding the visual
range of the original set.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.690
Available on material.io
and in the theme editor,

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.750
these sets allow for even
more visual expression

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.230
and even the smallest details
of your product experience.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.760
And as you all know
design can only

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.246
go so far if you can't
realize it in code.

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:49.620
So, today, we're launching
Gallery, a collaborative tool,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.600
as Rich mentioned
in the talk, that

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.480
helps bridge this
designer-developer workflow.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.910
Components exported using
the theme editor can

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.890
use the inspect
feature in Gallery,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.980
allowing for this easy
transfer of design decisions

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.100
into our open source components
for iOS, Android, web,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.140
and Flutter.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.730
So let's go deeper with theming.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.070
We want to show you how
efficient customization can

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.700
actually be.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.680
So just so you know,
we test material design

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.740
by creating products studies
that showcase our thinking,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.550
making sure our system works for
a wide variety of experiences

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.074
and products and brands.

00:07:23.074 --> 00:07:25.240
You'll see these studies
used throughout our updated

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.251
guidelines.

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:28.250
Today, we're going to
talk about three of them--

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.290
Crane, a travel app, here
shown on desktop, Reply,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:39.299
an email app, and Shrine, a
retail app, shown on tablet.

00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:41.090
This visual shows how
they would originally

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.710
appear pre-material theming.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.180
When we pull away
the content, you

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.540
can see how similar the
structure and the visual design

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.250
of these screens are--

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.100
navigation on the top,
relying on color blocks

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.900
to really create
a differentiation

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.950
from each other.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.500
But these experiences
and brands are different.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.810
And that's not coming out
in the user experience.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.320
Let's use material theming to
better express these brands.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.540
I'm going to start with
an app called Crane.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.300
Crane is a travel app
that helps users book

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.310
and find travel, lodging,
restaurant options.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.050
It's both functional, using
components such as text fields,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.260
lists, selection controls
to book a trip, and really

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.460
editorial, using beautiful image
lists to showcase and browse

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.660
content.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.180
Cranes brand is refined
but not unfriendly.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.250
The brand needs to give
the user confidence

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.400
that they can trust crane to
book travel and accept payment,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.830
but also lively
enough for vacation

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.909
planning to still feel excited.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.510
A lot of that personality
starts with the color decisions.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.275
Crane's primary color is purple.

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:46.990
It uses variants of this color
to distinguish different UI

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.000
elements and create contrast.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.790
And Crane's secondary
color is bright red.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.440
This red is used for important
information and selection

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.420
within this experience.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.670
The primary purple is the
main color of the buttons.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.294
And the secondary
color is really used,

00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:03.960
as I said before, for
selection controls and really

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.360
important typographic
elements and prices.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.780
But if we use red for type
and selection controls,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.850
what about error states?

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.280
It's very observant
if you notice that.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.539
Material defines a
default color red,

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:17.705
but you can define your own.

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:21.540
So instead of red, Crane uses
orange as its error color.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.180
So this way the error
color calls attention,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.210
but isn't associated
with the brand identity.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.120
Speaking of text fields,
Crane uses two styles

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.380
that you'll see here.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.430
This one is the lighter
weight outline text

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.980
field that's used for
longer scrolling forms.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.960
This other text field is used
for inputting search and user

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.530
preferences.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.540
You can combine the two styles.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.360
They have a custom shape
with rounded corners

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.510
and use the brand colors, the
iconography, and the typography

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.130
as defined by Crane.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.290
And, lastly, we mentioned
Crane's emphasis

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.020
on editorial content.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.060
Crane uses a masonry style
grid list where photos

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.690
maintain their aspect ratio.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.290
So they show as much
content as possible.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.910
The image list has
been customized

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.310
to display text
labels with each item.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.070
Custom padding has been added
above and below the item.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.570
OK, Josh, your designer is
given you a beautiful design.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.380
Can you make it?

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.890
[LAUGHING]

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.210
JOSH ESTELLE: Well,
I'll see what I can do.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.230
So as a developer, I
love a good challenge.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.480
And I love making beautiful
designs come to life

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.220
and really putting them
in the hands of our users.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.710
Our engineering team
has been hard at work

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.260
creating building
blocks for great design,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.880
complete with the
kind of flexibility

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.270
necessary to construct
any app or any style.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.640
We've primarily done this
through material components,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.420
or MDC, or open source
libraries for UI development

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.680
available for Android,
iOS, the web, and Flutter.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.540
For this particular
example, I'm going

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.706
to walk you through how we
get started building this

00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:56.090
with MDC web.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.980
Using material
components, I can quickly

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.000
drop in the basic structure of
an app, a top app bar, tabs,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.592
a few text fields,
and an image list.

00:11:04.592 --> 00:11:06.050
This is what it
looks like before I

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.360
begin customizing anything.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.520
These baseline styles
will give your users

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.230
a great user experience
right out of the box.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.620
But, today, we're talking
about customizing materials

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.490
for your brand specific needs.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.620
I'm going to show
you how easy that is.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.940
First, color.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.890
Rachel told you about
our new color system

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.620
with tools and guidelines to
help create a dynamic color

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.350
palette using your brand colors.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.330
From those tools,
you can easily pull

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.080
in the colors
necessary into MDC web

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.670
by defining these SAS variables.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.270
These variables are used
throughout the MDC components

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.610
and can be used
anywhere within your app

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.860
to make it easy to
have a semantic meaning

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.100
and understanding to
how color is applied.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.170
While all MDC components
will automatically

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.900
pick up and adapt those
colors we just defined,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.580
you can also customize
things whenever necessary.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.380
Tabs default to colors
that expect they're

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.004
on your default
background color.

00:12:03.004 --> 00:12:04.420
However, in this
app, the tabs are

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.930
part of that top app bar,
which uses the primary color

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.610
as your background.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.220
The default black the
tabs use is too dark

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.710
to put on top of
that primary color.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.600
So here we show how we
override the ink color on tabs

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.550
with our on primary color.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.710
That's a color chosen
to specifically

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.770
be high enough contrast
to put directly

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.000
on top of a primary color.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.440
And this is what
that looks like.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.580
So our colors are clearly
applied across the top app bar,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.990
the tabs, and the text fields.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.880
Now let's look at
the image list.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.330
MDC gives us a simple
standard grid very easily.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:51.220
But for this product, we wanted
that less regular masonry grid.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.440
This is how the standard
grid was defined--

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.160
very easy, very simple.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.440
And here's the only changes
necessary to turn it

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.390
into a masonry column layout.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.330
So just a little bit, and you
get that different layout looks

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.440
like this.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.220
And that's it.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.650
That's about 10 to
15 lines of code

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.610
that went from our
baseline look to this.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.990
And then a few more tweaks, and
we'll have the final design.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.790
All right, what
else can we build?

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.174
RICHARD FULCHER: Thank you Josh.

00:13:21.174 --> 00:13:22.340
All right, let's do another.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.640
Let's go forward to
our email app, Reply.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.760
Reply's promise to users
isn't especially complex.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.860
It's an email app.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.600
It wants to be
clearly organized.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.200
It wants to have
legible typography.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.770
It wants to have
straightforward navigation.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.350
But we still have customization
opportunities within that.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.660
Reply's brand is focused on
friendliness, its competence,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.610
and maybe even a
hint of quirkiness.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.540
On mobile, Reply uses
the bottom app bar.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.700
The most obvious feature
that you see here

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.980
is that floating action button,
that golden FAB in the center.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.070
It's even been kind of nested
into the app bar itself

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.350
with that nice little cut.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.030
Doing that increases
its prominence,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.060
is the key action as
our FABs often are.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.640
And this makes it a
very obvious target.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.220
Navigation is also
supported in the app bar.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.380
But it's a little less
obvious, less prominent.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:24.994
It uses the Reply logo to access
a traditional navigation panel.

00:14:24.994 --> 00:14:27.410
You might also have noticed
something interesting going on

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.600
with the icons themselves.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.550
They're using one
of those new sets

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.920
that Rachel described
earlier, in this case,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.750
the two-tone version.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.780
Now these icons are still
immediately recognizable.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.510
We haven't changed kind of the
way that we draw the symbol.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.880
The user will still recognize
it from other experiences

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.020
across the system.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.130
But we have stylised it.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.430
The entry chips for the
addressees in the middle

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.780
of the screen here.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.590
Those also use custom
color and typography.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.840
And we've also adjusted
some of the layout elements.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.930
So instead of the avatar
being inset within the chip

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.810
as it would be for the
baseline presentation,

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.470
we've customized it to be a bit
larger, completing the rounded

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.890
shape and giving you a slightly
better chance of actually

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.330
being able to tell who that is.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.660
A key component of
Reply's style is the way

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.120
it employs typographic scale.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.930
It needs to cover a lot
of different use cases

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.650
or tasks related to this
very text heavy application.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.960
So we've done
customization here as well.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.300
We've taken the default Roboto
and replaced it with Work Sans.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.350
We've updated the weights, using
the guidance that comes out

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.470
of the Material Theme Editor
to optimize how we want to size

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.030
them as well.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.260
With the bold headlines and less
emphasized captions and body

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.970
text, we increase the
scanability of the content.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.650
And you can see
that really clearly

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.050
in a view like the
messaging list here.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.720
There's a clean
visual hierarchy.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.820
The user's eye knows how to
jump kind of very rhythmically

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.040
down the page to catch
the different titles that

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.750
are there.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.480
On the cards themselves,
we've customized

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.730
them to use sharp corners.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.950
And we've decreased the
padding between the cards

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.370
so that there's just more
space to get content in.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.070
Now even though there's
no indication of elevation

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.430
on the cards, you can still
see a clear separation

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.580
between them.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.090
You're getting a little bit of
that background color peeking

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.670
through between the
cards, cuing that these

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.460
are different surfaces and
that the user can reasonably

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.360
expect they could perform swipe
gestures on it, in this case,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.690
to either star or delete
one of those messages.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.090
OK, that's a lot
of customization.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.960
Can Josh build it?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.210
[LAUGHING]

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.860
JOSH ESTELLE: All right, so
I already showed you MDC web.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.920
So for reply, I'm going to
bring you through MDC Android.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.670
One of the beauties
of material components

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.040
is that no matter what platform
you're building for, you have

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.840
a consistent set of
components available,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.290
the same patterns, features,
theme ability, but still

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.140
very much in line with
the platform specific

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.641
paradigms that your users
are going to expect.

00:17:09.641 --> 00:17:11.349
So here on Android,
we have the same kind

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.270
of material theming for color.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.390
We define our theme, inheriting
from the material components

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.822
them, and define
our brand colors.

00:17:18.822 --> 00:17:20.280
This defines all
the colors that'll

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.410
flow through the app,
styling both the MDC Android

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.440
components, but also lower
level UI elements provided

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.640
by the Android framework.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.340
Now for Reply, we really
need to exercise our ability

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.422
to customize typography and
use the material type scales.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.130
To do that on Android,
I want to tell you

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.160
about Android downloadable
fonts and how with Google Fonts

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.520
you have a great set of fonts
readily available to use.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.490
Work Sans is the
typeface for Reply.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.550
And this is all you need to
have that font downloaded

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.740
on the fly whenever
necessary for your app.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.890
Once we have the font, we have
to apply our material type

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.620
scales that our tooling
will help you determine.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.820
Here we redefine the
headline one text appearance

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.160
to use Work Sans with
a light text style.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.650
We can redefine the
entire type scale

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.390
and link it up
through our theme so

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.910
that all of the text appearances
update across your app.

00:18:18.812 --> 00:18:20.270
So with those
changes to our theme,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.910
we see Reply's colors
and typography permeate

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.100
through the components and
the various views of the app.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.500
But now let's look at a
couple of specific components.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.750
First, chips.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.420
Chips can be tremendously
versatile and useful,

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.220
but also quite
complicated to implement

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.530
well and in a consistent way.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.390
So we've done that for you.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.560
Pull in the MDC Android
chips like this--

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.250
very simple.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.190
Drop it in your layout,
getting all the nuance behavior

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.830
of a chip just right,
and completely pulling

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:54.230
in your theme colors and type
definitions, and, of course,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.810
the new bottom app bar with
that special little place

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.485
for the floating action button.

00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:00.110
This is one of the
really nice patterns

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.940
that might seem like
it'd take forever

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.710
to figure out how to build.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.120
It did take a while.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.100
But we got that for you too.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.530
Here's the bottom app bar
and floating action button,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.600
where they would go in
a coordinator layout,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.365
automatically pulling in
your theme colors and type.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.740
It's also worth
pointing out here

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.050
we're using our new
material two-tone icons.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.230
These icons are
available on material.io

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.520
and are ready to drop
into any Android project.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.641
So that's Reply.

00:19:27.641 --> 00:19:28.140
What else?

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.579
RICHARD FULCHER: OK,
we'll do just one more.

00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:35.120
You're getting the
hang of it by now.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.310
But I want to show off a couple
of other aspects of the system.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.610
The final app that we're going
to look at is called Shrine.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.640
So Shrine-- it's a retail app.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.530
It's an online marketplace
that doesn't just

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.300
sell goods from one label.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.420
It shows them from a
variety of fashion providers

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.880
and promoted labels.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.150
So because of this, a lot of
the emphasis in the design

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.260
of Shrine is on imagery.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.880
The tonal color
palette that we use

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.110
has fairly minimal
contrast in this case.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.370
OK, those are really key
choices because think

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.049
about what a user coming to
this experience was looking for.

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:11.590
They want to engage
with the content.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.350
They want to be excited
by the different wares

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.270
that you have up
for sale and keep

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.250
their attention focused there.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.280
But you also need to be
able to convert them.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.820
They need to be able to
find that add to cart button

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.710
and hit it when it's time for
them to make the purchase.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.910
So you're balancing content
browsing and also this more

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.450
specific task execution.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.420
So with that in
mind, Shrine's brand

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.010
actually recedes a little bit.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.290
Content and key
actions go forward.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.110
Where shrine does assert its
brand identity very strongly

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.740
is in the way that
it uses shape.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.980
We use sharp cuts on
surfaces like the buttons

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.460
and on larger
sheets of material.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.210
And those are all tied back to
that diamond logo, the product

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.810
logo of Shrine itself.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.750
Those aren't just
aesthetic choices.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.450
When we do those surface
cuts on the corner,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.960
we're also communicating how the
different material surfaces are

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.050
arranged in the space
and how the user might

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.010
be able to interact with
them in different ways.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.090
So from front to back, you
have the backdrop back layer,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.080
which is where we have a custom
navigation menu for Shrine.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.982
In the middle, we have
the backdrop front layer,

00:21:28.982 --> 00:21:31.440
which is where the bulk of the
content the user is actually

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.910
going to engage with
is going to reside.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.530
And then the
shopping cart sheet,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.830
which is actually tucked
almost entirely off screen,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.970
is foremost.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.080
And it just gets out of the
view when it's not needed.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.800
On tablet and desktop,
Shrine's primary navigation

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.090
is through tabs.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.580
And in keeping with the emphasis
on storytelling through shape,

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.630
we're using a
highlight indicator

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.730
that takes a custom
shape and draws it

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.650
behind the active label.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.890
OK, last time, Josh, once more.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.990
JOSH ESTELLE: OK, so this
time let's talk about iOS.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.719
Again, I'm going to show you how
colors are defined very simply

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:13.260
and easily get
applied throughout all

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.850
of our components.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.950
For each platform, you
define these colors

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.570
and then trust that
we've applied them

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.280
in the appropriate places
across all the UI elements.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.060
But for Shrine, I
really want to focus

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.590
on the shape customizations.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.150
That's one of the areas
I'm really excited about.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.160
It's pretty tricky to
implement these things.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.299
But we aim at making
adjusting shape

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:34.840
and applying it to
your components as

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.410
simple as theming any other
aspect of your design.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.800
Here for Shrine we use this cut
on the corners of the buttons

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.870
and on the top left corner
of that larger surface.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.050
On iOS, you can use our shape
generators and corner APIs

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.610
to style the buttons.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.650
Here you see an
8-pixel cut applied

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.620
to every corner of the button.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.430
And here you see a
bigger 32-pixel cut

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.000
but only applied to that
top left corner of the card.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.010
This takes care of
a ton of complexity

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.080
and making touch targets
behave correctly,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.890
ripples and shadows
appear in the right place.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.560
And with all of this, you get
a very easy interesting way

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.500
to apply custom shapes
across everything you do.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.630
Now shape is still
a work in progress.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.450
I showed it to you here
applied to buttons and cards.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.931
But it'll be coming to many
more of our components soon.

00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:26.430
With that, hopefully
I've gotten you

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.890
excited about material
components, the benefits they

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.320
provide, and the ease in
which they enable these very

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.252
sophisticated customizations.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.540
RICHARD FULCHER: OK, so if we
revisit these three apps again

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.740
with all the customizations
we just employed,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.430
they feel much more distinct.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.540
They feel much more like
themselves, which is the goal.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.180
We haven't changed any of
the essential structuring

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.270
of the information.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.710
It's all the same content,
all the same navigation.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.200
But we've added a lot more
of the brand's character

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.060
in through this work.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.790
And everything that
you see is still

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.250
entirely consistent with
the fundamental principles

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.399
of material design.

00:24:07.399 --> 00:24:08.940
We're not introducing
anything that's

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.500
going to be unfamiliar
to the user.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.050
There's still going to be able
to work through these systems.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.790
Crane is still making
use of bold color.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.750
But it's flexible enough to be
able to tell a selection state

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.940
from an error state as we saw.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.550
Reply is using a
different style of icons,

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.550
but they're still recognizable
and familiar to the user.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.606
And Shrine is still giving the
user cleanly separated surfaces

00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:34.980
so they know where
they can touch

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.460
and how the surfaces
might respond.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.196
That's the power of
material theming.

00:24:40.196 --> 00:24:42.570
That's the goal we've been
chasing over these last couple

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.270
of years.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.110
And starting from the
foundation of material itself,

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.810
that solid material
foundation of good design

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.690
and customizing the experience
through key attributes, which

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.900
have a wide ranging impact
throughout the experience--

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.670
today, we've just
kind of concentrated

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.670
on three of our example apps.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.190
There are actually four
more at material.io

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.530
so you can see another
range of different product

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.480
styles and different
customization options

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.970
to get the sense of the full
capabilities of material

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.740
theming.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.630
And while you're
there, you can also

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.670
see how other real brands
are using material theming.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.080
So you can read about how
we've applied the material

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.720
theme, the Google material
theme specifically,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.840
to products like Gmail,
News, Pay, and Home.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.690
And over the last
year, we've partnered

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.470
with the stellar design
teams from Genius, Lyft, NPR,

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.550
Pocket Casts, and Zappos to
help them bring material design

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.290
into their products.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.570
You can see the studies
of how these partners are

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:48.400
thinking about material
on material.io as well.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.890
This is just the start.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.950
We will be adding more new
components and new material

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.210
theming options, new
guidance, and new examples

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.770
on a regular basis.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.739
We're very excited to see what
you do with Material Design.

00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:03.030
Thank you for joining us today.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.362
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.910
And if you'd like to
learn a little bit more,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.840
we have sessions coming
up, about four or five

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.340
different sessions, that cover
different aspects of material

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.180
throughout the
remaining couple of days

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.430
of I/O. There is a session
later today on stage 4 that

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.730
goes deep on how you use
material to design and build

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.592
across platforms.

00:26:32.592 --> 00:26:33.550
I've seen that session.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.591
It's a very good session.

00:26:34.591 --> 00:26:37.040
You will probably
enjoy it as well.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.220
And we also have just
outside this stage

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.680
is the Design and
Accessibility Dome.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.025
And we will be there
throughout all of I/O. Come.

00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:49.400
I'm sure you will
have questions.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.060
We are happy to answer
them there at the Dome.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.640
Meet designers from
the materials team.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.210
You can see demos of Material
Gallery, Materials Theme

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.260
Editor.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.100
You can also get a designer
review for your app.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.400
So you can get a 15 minute slot
to talk through what questions

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.430
you might have about material
or design in general.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.290
And we also are
going to be doing

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:15.220
a series of short 10-ish minute
talks, kind of small form,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.070
on different topics throughout
the next couple of days

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.370
of I/O. So once
again, thank you.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.574
And have a good rest of I/O.

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:27.072
