1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:05,790
This is Radiolab and we're
talking about bliss. So far.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,550
I'm going to say we're not doing so
great. I mean we had a fleeting moment,

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,100
a dream that crumbled snowflakes
that evaporated in your hand,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,640
but in the next story we're going
to shoot for bliss that lasts.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,400
Hello, this is Mike Young. Mike, speak
up. Andy comes to us from our producer,

7
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,100
Andy Mills. Can you hear me? I can
hear Ya. All right, so set this up.

8
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,960
Who is this guy? His name is Mike Young.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,040
I called them up because of something
that happened to him a little over 50

10
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:30,910
years ago. Let's see.

11
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:35,911
This was 1962 is something that he still
thinks about all these years later.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,060
I was in my early twenties
22 something like that.

13
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:45,061
21 he was an undergraduate
at a theological school
in Boston and one day he

14
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,950
received a very different
kind of religious education,

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,950
a very different kind, good ds though.

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,050
He event occurred on Good Friday

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,580
[inaudible]

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,690
and it happened at the Boston
University Marsh Chapel.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,930
He was sitting, not up in the main chapel,

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,060
but down in the little basement chapel.

21
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,050
And he was sitting with about
19 of his fellow classmates.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,090
The Meditation Service was being piped
down to us from the chapel above.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,140
They have speakers in the front of
this little chapel in the basement,

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,320
had organ music and an excellent choir.

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,080
And the voice of the preacher

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,130
sentenced those is this kind of
famous guy named Howard Thurman.

27
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,510
And we relaxed. We're all good

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,530
and interesting ideas
began going off in my head,

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,350
well beside us in the way that we take.

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,000
Sometimes it was hard to pay attention
to what was going on in the room,

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,070
the things that resist and defy.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,600
And we slid jet a right into the, uh,

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,050
silicide been experienced.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,660
What we did, he said silicide
yes. Was in magic. Mushrooms.

35
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,480
Shrooms. What? You're gonna
have to explain that one.

36
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,320
This was actually something called
the Marsh Chapel experiment,

37
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,640
the Marsh Chapel experiment.
And it was run by this guy.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,110
His name was Walter Pinky.
Very briefly summarize that.

39
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,880
And he was a graduate student at
Harvard at this time and he was studying

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,040
religious experience. Me.

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,950
Oh. This has also been
called the cosmic experience.

42
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,020
The transcendental experience
or the mystical experience.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,190
What exactly was he looking at? You know,
like, um, Christians, Muslims, Jews,

44
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,250
mystics. Like what kind of things
do they all have in common?

45
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,550
So he did a bunch of research
and interviews and he came
up with a basic catalog

46
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,260
of the ingredients in
a religious experience.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,640
And one day he's at Harvard
and he bumps into turn on

48
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,220
Carolinian and drop out
that guy, Timothy Leary,

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,590
he was actually a teacher at Harvard
at the time and he was famously giving

50
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,080
psychedelic drugs to Undergrad

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,970
by teaching people out of his very head.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,460
The a point is that in order to use
your head have to go out of your mind.

53
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,470
And when Panky got a chance to talk
to these students who had tripped,

54
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,620
he noticed pretty quick that they used
really similar language to the people

55
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,210
that he'd been studying.
And he started to wonder,

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,710
if you put people into the right
situation and you give them this drug,

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,480
could you induce, actually
induce a religious experience.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,560
So on that day in 1962,

59
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,360
Pankey put 20 theological school students
into this church basement, you know,

60
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,860
during this Good Friday service,

61
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,190
10 of them got a placebo and then 10
of them got a hefty dose of Psilocybin,

62
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,150
things in the room morphing. Um,

63
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,500
which brings us back to
Mike Young. You would move

64
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,600
of your head and there'd be an after
image from the lights at one point.

65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,570
The visual effect was especially powerful.

66
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,440
And he had this one moment that
has just stuck with him ever since.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,520
I was in the middle of a technicolor's
C and there were bars of color and I was

68
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,070
floating through them and they
were floating through me, uh,

69
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,160
and it was just glorious. And
the bars of color then resolved,

70
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,980
uh, into, uh, a feel.

71
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,590
I was at the center and there was a
different color going out from me in every

72
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,210
possible direction.

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,383
[inaudible]

74
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,070
at first, this was quite nice. Uh,

75
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,460
and then I realized that I had just
swim out one of those color bars

76
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,793
I had to.

77
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,480
And each of those different color
bars would be a whole different life

78
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:02,340
experience. And I could
choose any one of those, uh,

79
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,370
life experience color bars that I wanted,

80
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,790
but I had to choose one
and I couldn't choose one.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,760
It was very painful. It felt like my
insides were being ripped out of me

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,610
and I died.

83
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,870
And at that moment that I died, uh,

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,840
I heard Howard Thurman say,

85
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,540
I shall die,

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,660
but that is all that I shall do for death.

87
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,500
And I stopped dying.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,340
Wow. That's, wow.

89
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,740
What are we supposed to make of that?
Right. It is. It is strange. Yes. In fact,

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,050
this is actually right around the time
that this huge cultural backlash against

91
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,840
this drug, by the end of 1962,

92
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,890
you've got Harvard making the decision
that these experiments are not going to

93
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:11,270
be done at their university
anymore. 63, that evil man,

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
they fire Timothy leary. Timothy
Leary, he's out of there.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,650
1970 congress outlaws, psychedelics, 1971

96
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,500
nearly every country in the world,
including the United States,

97
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,650
bans them from research is their signatory
to an international law banning the

98
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,860
use sale,

99
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,870
cultivation and possession of dangerous
drugs that have no useful place in

100
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:34,704
medicine.

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,900
I mean on some level,

102
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,901
like I get that because like what
could you learn from a bunch of people

103
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,100
tripping like scientific.

104
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,280
I mean I think that there actually is
something that we can learn from this.

105
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,870
What? Well,

106
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,680
if you look at Mike Young on the
day that he walked into that chapel,

107
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,330
I was still a theological school
student. He was, you know,

108
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,230
he's experiencing doubts
without any real confidence.

109
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,290
That ministry was something
I was going to stay in.

110
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,560
But after this experiment at the chapel,

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,280
he went home to his wife
and when I walked in,

112
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:14,281
my wife was very much aware that something
rather unusual had occurred to this

113
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:19,250
guy she was married to. Did she
just, you carry yourself differently?

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,140
You should never been that explicit
about it. She just said she knew that,

115
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,580
that I had had some kind of
a major experience at first.

116
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,210
He just kind of wrote the whole
thing off. But as time passed,

117
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:35,020
he couldn't stop thinking about the
death and the rebirth experience.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,140
And to make a long story
short, if you fast forward,

119
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,490
I'm a unitarian universalist minister, um,

120
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,980
as a result of partly a result
of that drug experience.

121
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,560
I want to share with you this
morning, a little extra. Jesus.

122
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,990
The New Testament. That's him. Yeah.
Story of the Good Samaritan. And he has,

123
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,190
I've been preaching for 45 years here.

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,710
Here's the thing that I
think is really strange.

125
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,900
All of the people who
took the drug that day,

126
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:09,300
those 10 who got the
psilocybin and not the placebo,

127
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,200
all but one that came.

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,300
Ministers really? So nine out
of 10 went into the mystery.

129
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:22,250
Nine out of 10. What about the
others? The Placebo Group? Yeah. None.

130
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,350
None. Gordon to Mike. Absolutely
none. Wow. That is interesting.

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,960
That was the first thing. I was
like, wow, that's, that's crazy.

132
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:33,050
But at the same time, you know,
it's really small sample set.

133
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,730
Who knows why anyone becomes a minister?
I'm sure it wasn't just the drugs.

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,370
You know, maybe they didn't even play
that big of a role for everyone else,

135
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,410
but this did make me, you know,

136
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,620
like more curious like what exactly is
happening to people when they take this

137
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,380
drug? Yeah,

138
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,610
and I was surprised to find out that
like right now there are actually a few

139
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:57,120
laboratories who are starting
to experiment with these
drugs. Again, we thought,

140
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,850
well why not? This is Roland,

141
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,010
Roland Griffis psychopharmacologist. I
studied the effects of drugs on behavior.

142
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,220
He's at Johns Hopkins and
Hopkins for 40 years now.

143
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,060
He's really well known for
studying nicotine and Ritalin,

144
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,220
but he tells me that back in 2000 he
was reading about the old psilocybin

145
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:22,221
studies from the 60s and this is right
around the time when the Drug Enforcement

146
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,150
Administration and the FDA were starting
to loosen their rules on experimenting

147
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:30,780
with psychedelics. So he
applies and he gets approval.

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,010
Study about short had not been approved
for 30 years and I can tell you that

149
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:39,440
I've never had a protocol that was
as rigorously and carefully reviewed

150
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,940
and scrutinized from every angle since
no one had studied this drug for like

151
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,600
three decades. He started with
some really basic questions.

152
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,570
How does this affect behavior
after people have taken this drug?

153
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,650
Like did they feel confused or
afraid? Is it habit forming?

154
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,580
And how he did his test was he has this
lab room at Johns Hopkins that he's,

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,950
he's made like really nice and cozy.
It's a, it's a aesthetic living room,

156
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:04,790
like environments.

157
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,260
There's a couch in the stereo system
and then one at a time the volunteers

158
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:13,670
brought in and given a hefty dose of
psilocybin blindfolded and then they're

159
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,970
asked to lay down and direct
their attention inward

160
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,390
[inaudible]

161
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,280
we were bringing people in two months
after sessions and asking them so well,

162
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,810
you know, what was the session like?

163
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:30,340
And they filled out some questionnaires
and the thing that I really wasn't

164
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:35,341
prepared for was how salient and important
these experiences we're said to be on

165
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:43,270
follow up. You know, they were saying,
well, it was really important, you know,

166
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,580
and I would say, well, how important?
And they would say, oh, well,

167
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:49,780
it was a most important experience
in my life. And I'd go, what?

168
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,690
[inaudible]?

169
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,700
And they would say, yeah, you
know, it's like, um, you know,

170
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,670
like when my daughter was born,
that changed my world forever.

171
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,550
I recently lost my father and,
um, and I'll never forget that.

172
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,620
And they'll say, you know,
it's kind of like that.

173
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,550
And that's a totally
improbable. So we didn't,

174
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,660
we didn't have any metric
that could even assess that.

175
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,080
And what made things even weirder
for Rollin is that when he gave these

176
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,310
volunteers a questionnaire,

177
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,340
about 75% of people are saying it's in
the top five most personally meaningful

178
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,460
and spiritually significant
experiences, but their life,

179
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,730
a vast majority. We're talking about it
like it's a spiritual experience. Huh?

180
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,360
So rollin,

181
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,360
he went back to look at Pankey's
studies from the 1960s about the basic

182
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,760
ingredients that make
up a religious aspect.

183
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,370
Let me look. The characteristics
of very summary list first,

184
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,410
the characteristics of awe and wonder.

185
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,570
Everyone would report that they felt like
they were in the presence of something

186
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,770
great and enormous

187
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,980
characteristic is the of time

188
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,460
and space. People describe time
slowing down or space getting

189
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,480
the third characteristic have to do with
mood. Very deeply felt positive. Mood

190
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,150
fourth, and I'm skipping over a few

191
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,190
you want to do this is a
sense of cosmic oneness,

192
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,320
this feeling of intense connection
to everything around you.

193
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,640
The part of everything that is the whole
universe and even every blade of grass

194
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,810
and grain of sand and so forth.

195
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,040
These are words that people
use in describing anyway,

196
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,110
so based on this one guys,
research and keep in mind,

197
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,180
you know a lot of people have
different opinions about this.

198
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,210
Roland believes that you can actually
take this little drug and from majority of

199
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:35,210
people you can induce
a religious experience,

200
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,030
but it's I you don't you, I don't know.

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,850
Soon as you call it bat then I'm
starting to think, hm, don't know.

202
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,490
This is a real, a real, I
mean I don't know you guys,

203
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,370
but for someone who has to
take this very seriously,

204
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,550
because to say that you can pop a
pill and then in some shortcut fashion

205
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,160
suddenly get this experience that hit
her too had been very rare and had been

206
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:04,380
assigned the values of grace

207
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,160
to say that is to say any enormous
thing. Well it sounds like,

208
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,950
it sounds like you're not, I'm
guessing how you're taking it, Robert,

209
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,630
as to say that a d values, the thing I do,

210
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,550
values kind of does the
opposite for me. Well really,

211
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I mean when I hear the stories from,

212
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,440
from like all the people in these
studies, it reminds me like I've,

213
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:29,441
I've had these like very meaningful
experiences that I didn't think would last

214
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,850
on the pill. Did you have them
or no, not, not a pill. No drugs.

215
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,330
So what happened? What, what
are you talking about? Well,

216
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,940
it goes back to like
when I was a Christian,

217
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I used to be an evangelical Christian
and when I was about 15 I was at a church

218
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:52,911
camp and me and some of my best friends
were all gathered around a campfire.

219
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,640
It was hot in the stars
for all bright and shiny.

220
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,490
I remember they were playing
this song that I really liked.

221
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,580
And you know that feeling that you get
when when you in a crowd of people are

222
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:10,820
all singing like really loud some
song that you all really love.

223
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,670
Sure. And as we're all singing this song,

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,440
I remember my friend who wasn't raised
in the faith like me leaning over to me

225
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,600
and saying that like he wanted to
accept Jesus and be a Christian.

226
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,060
And he asked, well, what am I supposed
to do? And I remember that being like,

227
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,590
great, great. It's not
even the word for it.

228
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:36,591
Like in this one moment I got caught up
in something that just felt so enormous.

229
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,750
It's hard for me to
explain how it felt like.

230
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,410
It's hard to describe how I
felt like we were all one.

231
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,970
Like there was something
powerful that was,

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,750
that was like both over
us but also inside of us.

233
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,020
And so much has changed since then
that sometimes I look back and I think,

234
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,640
did that happen?

235
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Like did I hallucinate like some dude
on drugs because that friend who,

236
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,900
uh, reached over to me, he's dead now.

237
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,840
That faith that I was
a part of, I left it.

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,420
Okay.

239
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,060
Like all I have is this weird feeling

240
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,360
okay.

241
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,970
That I can remember. That's good.

242
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,880
And even though you're not
a Christian anymore, you,

243
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,860
you still have that feeling. Oh yeah.

244
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,060
But what is it about the
idea that, that feeling,

245
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:37,990
that campfire feeling can be triggered
by a pill and that maybe that's what was

246
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:40,240
happening to those folks in Rollins study?

247
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,660
What is it about that idea
that helps you? For me,

248
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:47,920
like I see something concrete,
you know, like I see,

249
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,210
I see. I see something that's
harder to write off. How so? Well,

250
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,450
if I can go back into reporter mode,

251
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,510
I will introduce you to one more guy who
I think is going to help you understand

252
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:04,570
what I'm talking about. Hello.
This is Charlie. Charlie Busan.

253
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,520
He's a longtime smoker. No, let's
start it at 17. Smoked for 40 years.

254
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,000
Pack a day. Breakfast, coffee,
talking on the phone. Wait,

255
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,630
why are we talking about smoking? Well,
Roland's new studies doing right now,

256
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:19,150
his pilot program that he's
just started a few years ago.

257
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,220
[inaudible] is trying to see if there's
something in the transformation that you

258
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,450
have in, in the psilocybin experience
that can help smokers quit smoking.

259
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,010
What really stick with me. They
gave me a pill, a a blue capsule,

260
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,430
and he closed his eyes. And like Mike,

261
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:39,910
he says he had a hallucination
that changed him.

262
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,090
The thing that I found so amazing,

263
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:48,091
the one thing that was more amazing than
anything else was when I was on this

264
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,470
mountain. This is the
mountain in his head. Yes.

265
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,570
When I had traveled to
the very top, uh, I was,

266
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,120
uh, looking out over this greatness,

267
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,100
this vista of everything he says
he was just this microscopic thing.

268
00:17:09,101 --> 00:17:11,680
He was, he was so small and it was so big.

269
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,710
But my experience at this one place was
so exalted because he was struck by this

270
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:23,794
feeling,

271
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,810
this deep feeling that
we were the same thing.

272
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:30,870
[inaudible]

273
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,480
we were the same.

274
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,740
This right here is another
hallmark of these experiences.

275
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,190
You're somehow confronted with this
radical shift in scale and things that

276
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:47,400
formerly felt like too big for
you to deal with. They suddenly,

277
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,040
they suddenly look different. We had

278
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
one person involved in her cigarette
smoking study who had had a dose of

279
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:59,580
Psilocybin, and in the
course of that session,

280
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,260
the idea of smoking came up
to him and he said, you know,

281
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:09,261
it was like a fly had landed on his
arm and he just took his finger and he

282
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,730
flicked it off and he said he
was done with it. Done, done.

283
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,610
[inaudible] and that's exactly
how it was for Charlie.

284
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,860
The morning afterwards he says he just
didn't want cigarettes anymore and they

285
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:28,890
just weren't an issue anymore. Huh.
And how long has he been off of it?

286
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,350
Three years. Wow. Now this
is just a tiny pilot program.

287
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,720
I don't think that we should
make too much out of it yet,

288
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,960
but the insight I feel
like is like, because,

289
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,130
because like Charlie has this
real experience, like it's not,

290
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,860
it's not a question of like
something invisible like faith,

291
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,710
but it's like a tangible reality for me.

292
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,880
It's like the closest thing I can come
to having some kind of real evidence that

293
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:57,360
what happened to me was real
with a campfire. Right. To me,

294
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:02,361
the mystery is you've done this occasional
thing with an artificial stimulus,

295
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,890
had a extraordinary but temporary
feeling and then mysteriously it isn't

296
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,980
temporary. It just goes on and on. Yeah.

297
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:15,570
Do we have any idea why it persists?
Well, Roland has a very educated hunch.

298
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,190
I asked him about this and he's looking
right now at getting in there and doing

299
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,990
research with some new SMRI machines,

300
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,950
but his hunch is that the
silicide man drug experience,

301
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,490
it somehow rewires the,

302
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,920
we're talking about rewiring a personality
at a fundamental machine programming

303
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:35,510
level.

304
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:40,430
Like he calls this experience a
rearranging experience. Huh? You know,

305
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,370
maybe, maybe one day science.

306
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:46,670
We'll figure out what's happening
in the brain of a person.

307
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:48,590
That's experiencing something like this.

308
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:53,591
But one of the things about this that
troubles me like as a reporter and then

309
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,880
even like personally is that
going back to Walter Panky,

310
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,880
like remember his list of ingredients
from earlier, his final characteristic.

311
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,020
Yeah.

312
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,810
The final characteristic that
I'd like to mention here,

313
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,070
the final ingredient was

314
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,010
the characteristic of
alleged enough ability,

315
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,520
which means that the people who have
such an experience claim that it can't be

316
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,790
described in words that is
nonverbal, basically indescribable.

317
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,560
And that's one of the main things that
I'm going to take away from all this.

318
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,920
I mean, talking to Roland
and Mike and Charlie is,

319
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,780
is just how hard it is to talk about the
thing that I've just spent the last 20

320
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,614
minutes

321
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
trying to talk about. I

322
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,290
understood something some

323
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,440
life, uh,

324
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,650
suddenly eternal truth.

325
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,840
These words really don't
match the thing. I was at the,

326
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,190
I was feeling divine source of,

327
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,470
um, of um,

328
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,570
self awareness that I'd,

329
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:06,670
sorry, aide said trick
of words. I guess it's a

330
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,203
got

331
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,970
larger thanks to producer Andy
Mills. Thanks to you guys for.
