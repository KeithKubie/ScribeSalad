00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.890
Encased in a hard shell, brainless and possessing
only a single limb (a retractable foot that

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.550
looks like a tongue), clams seem like a species
for which reproduction would be difficult.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.970
And yet, each year, millions of clams are
born – thanks in large part to chance.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.640
During their life cycles, clams go through
several stages before they look and act like

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.710
a clam as we think of it.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.260
When they reach this juvenile stage, all clams
are male – this works out because clam sperm

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.360
is much smaller and takes less resources to
produce than clam eggs.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.140
The juvenile males simply couldn’t accommodate
eggs, nor have the metabolic resources required

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.820
to be able to produce them.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.010
When they become adults and can devote more
energy to reproduction, rather than growing,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.620
this ceases to be an issue.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.980
In any event, clams begin making babies when
the water gets sufficiently warm, depending

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.340
on the location and the species, in the spring,
summer or fall.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.990
For the Northern Quahog Clam (sometime called
the hard clam or Mercenaria mercenaria), this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.460
happens in late spring/early summer when the
water reaches about 68F.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.549
Called spawning, at the appointed time, the
smaller males release sperm into the ocean

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.850
to (hopefully) meet up with the eggs produced
by the larger (and older) clams that have

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.229
become females.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.090
These millions of gametes join in the water
where fertilization occurs.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.759
When a sperm and egg do manage to meet, the
cells of each young egg rapidly divide until

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.539
the embryo grows into a morula, a ball of
cells that resembles a mulberry (hence the

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:41.539
name).

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.840
After a day or two, cilia grow on the creature,
which again develops into a trocophore, a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.090
free-swimming larva.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.619
Continuing to change, the larva adds a shell
and a foot and becomes a veliger that spends

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.360
the next couple of weeks swimming around eating
plankton.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.039
During the veliger stage, the body begins
to take on a clam-like shape, where one side

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.999
is straight (where the hinge will be), while
the other is rounded (where the clam will

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.070
ultimately open).

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.280
After this phase, the creature has the typical
bivalve appearance, with a hard shell and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600
well-developed foot (and is called a pediveliger).

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.069
Stiff and heavy, the juvenile sinks to the
ocean floor (in what is called the settling

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.069
stage).

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.160
The total time to reach this juvenile phase
is between 8 days and two weeks.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.300
As a young clam, he uses his foot to dig in
the sand and move around (a bit), and a siphon

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.830
that extends from the shell to feed.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.820
Many burrow under the sand with only the siphon
extending up into the water to filter-feed

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.820
on plankton.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.660
When above the sand, clams’ photoreceptors
can distinguish when the shadow of a predator

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.120
floats above, an event which often sends them
diving for cover.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.070
There they wait until it’s spawning time
again, and the life cycle repeats.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.580
Only about 10% of fertilized eggs reach the
juvenile stage, but if the clam is savvy (or

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.620
just lucky) enough to avoid being eaten, it
can live for about 30 years, grow up to 4

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:12.510
inches across and become

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.209
a lady clam.
