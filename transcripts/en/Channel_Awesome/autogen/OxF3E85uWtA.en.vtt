off into an eighth but that's only for a
 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.260
off into an eighth but that's only for a
few seconds and the same thing when he

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270

wanted more of his internal struggle to
take up the majority of the film but

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030
take up the majority of the film but
 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.080

have one shot at it it's kind of a
 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.790
