00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.009
In 1860 in Pembrokeshire, Wales someone spouted
the phrase, "Eat an apple on going to bed,

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.410
and youâ€™ll keep the doctor from earning
his bread."

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.320
An apple a day keeps the doctor away!

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.620
But will it, REALLY?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.590
Apples are native to central Eurasia -- what
is now Kazakhstan and have been spread across

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.230
the world by traders and travelers over the
centuries.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.270
1,500 years ago, apples appeared in Ayurvedic
medicine -- an ancient holistics practice

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.750
-- and apples were thought of as healthful
by the ancient Anglo-Saxon and Roman societies.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.390
"An apple a day sends the doctor away" was
first used in 1922, and unsurprisingly, it's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.440
stuck around!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.810
Also unsurprisingly, since people say it all
the time, science studied it, and apples ARE

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.940
healthful!

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.650
Eating an apple every day could prevent 8,500
vascular-related deaths in people over 50,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.940
according to the British Medical Journal.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
A 2011 study from the Journal of the American
Heart Association found people who ate "white"

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.220
fruits and vegetables -- apples and pears,
for example -- had a 52 percent lower incidence

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.840
of stroke and heart attack.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.979
So what is it about apples?

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.690
Are they some kind of miracle fruit?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.760
I mean, not the actual miracle fruit that
makes things taste funny -- but like, a specially

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
healthful one?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.811
Apples contain the following building blocks
as broken down by HowStuffWorks: Pectin: you

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.320
may have seen this on some processed labels,
apples contain them naturally, it's a form

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.860
of fiber related to reducing blood pressure,
LDL and glucose levels.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.670
Boron: which supports healthy bones and brains.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
Quercetin (qwar-sehtin): is a flavonoid which
may reduce damage from free radicals -- atoms

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.060
in the body with unpaired electrons which
can damage cells.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.110
Free radicals can damage DNA, so reducing
them has been linked to lower risks of cancers,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.060
Alzheimer's and age-related problems.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.510
Vitamin C, A, E, and beta carotene which also
fight free radicals, boost immune response,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.729
reduce risk of heart disease, asthma, and
diabetes.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.540
Guys, all that sounds pretty frickin' AWESOME
TO ME.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.710
And that's not ALL.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.479
According to the Institute of Food Research,
apples also contain polyphenols, can block

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.470
a protein receptor called VEGF, which helps
cancer progression in the body!

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.759
Polyphenols are found naturally in fruits,
vegetables, and other things like green tea!

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.420
But the thing is, apples aren't alone in these
properties.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.319
Pears contain a lot of the same nutrients,
in fact -- so do MANY fruits and berries.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.540
Compounds in cranberries and blueberries fight
urinary tract infections, blackberries and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.599
strawberries have fiber, bananas have potassium:
which boosts heart and muscle function.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.040
They ALL have a lot of fructose though, which
in large quantities ISN'T greatâ€¦

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.410
If you ate only apples, you'd become severely
malnourished; no one thing can sustain the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.819
human body -- we need a variety of things.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.293
An apple (or pear or other fruit or vegetable)
may keep the doctor away, but it's not going

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:43.293
to do it alone.

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:44.293
Do you eat apples?

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:45.293
Do you even LIKE apples?

00:02:45.293 --> 00:02:46.293
What's your favorite fruit?

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:47.293
I WANT TO KNOW.

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:48.293
I used to like apples.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:49.293
I think I ate too many.

00:02:49.293 --> 00:02:50.293
TELL ME IN THE COMMENTS.

00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:52.069
And if you're like me, you're worried what
will happen to all our food if nuclear war

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.261
happens, or climate change devastates the
planet -- I worry about stuff, guys -- but

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:59.730
my friend Evan over on Seeker explored the
Svalbard Seed Vault -- Humanity's last best

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:13.439
hope -- for a tasty future.Thanks
