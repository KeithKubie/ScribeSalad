00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.700
You're listening to radiolab radio from Wny, C d.

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.530
N p. R. [inaudible]

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.700
[inaudible]. So we're, um,

4
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.150
we're at church in a church that's different for us.

5
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.640
It's not usually where we start wearing a church cathedral,

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
really a huge cathedral. Uh, upper Manhattan, St John, the divine God,

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.450
an Oregon, the preacher,

8
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.220
preacher, congregation. Of course,

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.270
couple of thousand people in the pews. At least Jesus said,

10
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.300
therefore your basic Sunday service

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.780
and it's except today you've also got,

12
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:59.100
here it comes. Oh, no, bizarre.

13
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.063
It's already there.

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.630
The reason we began here is because today the church is filled with [inaudible]

15
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.230
dogs. I talked to you about your dog. Yeah. What's his or her name?

16
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.610
His name is blizzard. And what is he? He's a Labrador and put on mix. Wow.

17
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390
I have legend who I just adopted in January.

18
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.520
I have Jen down bell by the way, in more than dogs.

19
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.100
You've got Burt's name is Jesse. It's a choir now.

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.640
And now has this guy ever been blessed before? I don't think so.

21
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.230
Me just warn this year in Hamsters, his name is TBI,

22
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.620
teddy toes. And if he'd come out you'd see why?

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.410
Because he's really fat and all kinds of creatures.

24
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.930
Got a little girl with a Falcon and behind her, oh, it's a giant cordis. This is

25
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.300
the Saint Francis Day of the animals.

26
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
So the yearly event and coming toward us when people bring their animals to be

27
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.540
blessed. Is it daunting? The folks that are gathered here,

28
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.310
there was a little girl with a hermit crab.

29
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.090
They don't think there's anything weird or inappropriate about this fact.

30
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:03.480
If you ask them in, here comes a bull, here's what they say.

31
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.000
I don't know if it means anything to her, but it means that to me.

32
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.310
Cause you know you want to baptize your babies and this is more or less the same

33
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.700
kind of thing. And what is it? What does it mean to you? It just means when,

34
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.620
when she finally does go away, she's going to, uh, but I haven't,

35
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
what kind of parent it is? She called core goals. Oh yeah.

36
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.020
Don't put your hand near his face. If he wants his new chuckled struggle.

37
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
Do you feel like he has a soul or an inner life of some sort?

38
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.530
It's a thinking being there. They're as smart as we are. Really? Yeah.

39
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.500
Since you invited me here, I didn't want to be impolite or anything.

40
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.640
Say what you got to say. Wow. Okay. These people, of course,

41
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.010
they love their animal. Sure. Yeah. Did you hear that?

42
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.610
That's when I'm feeling sad.

43
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030
Comes in the bed and he lays down spine to spine with me and he just didn't

44
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:53.570
leave my side. Bye. They piss you off a little bit.

45
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.810
That the animals they love are going to feel just the grace of the prayer or

46
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.190
feel

47
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.130
<v 1>the blessing, which is a, which raises a question,</v>

48
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.350
what do we really know about what goes on inside the animal's mind?

49
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:13.580
Yeah. All those things that you might feel in a church. Grace, gratitude, uh,

50
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.400
guilt. Can the animals feel those things too?

51
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.360
How much can we share and can you measure it? Yeah.

52
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.810
I'm Jad Abumrad I am Robert Krulwich. This is radio

53
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.963
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

54
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.080
<v 1>well, and we'll begin the hour with a story about an animal who would,</v>

55
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.390
I'm sure love to have been at the worship service, but it was,

56
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.970
it was a very inconvenient thing. Didn't quite get there.

57
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.870
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.920
<v 1>okay. Just to get things rolling.</v>

59
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:58.480
This is a story that we heard about [inaudible] enough to talk about first from

60
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:01.570
the falling. Hey, is it makers? Mike [inaudible]. I go by Mick.

61
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.410
There's way too many mikes around. Mick Migos,

62
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.620
his name here and then we met nick recently at the Emeryville Marina,

63
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.880
which is not far from San Francisco where he's got a boat called the super fish

64
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.780
figured out. Make says he rents out for all kinds of things.

65
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:20.470
It's your trips to ash gathering bachelor parties, fireworks watching.

66
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.930
I don't know. I get a little cardboard sign. I stand by the freeway.

67
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.300
Just have boat need work. So yeah,

68
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:28.960
that's Mick and our story begins one morning in December,

69
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.730
probably eight o'clock in the morning or something.

70
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.490
As I recall a few years back [inaudible] just kind of sitting at home.

71
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.950
I was at home. Yeah, it was the middle of December. We didn't have any work,

72
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.170
but then he gets this call. Hello, you got this call there.

73
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.950
Is it call relaying a message from a fisherman way out at sea,

74
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.460
18 miles maybe outside the golden gate bridge.

75
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.240
They told me that there was a whale in trouble,

76
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.060
tangle up in grab gear and it didn't appear to be able to move.

77
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.590
So after he hangs up, make immediately calls a few dive buddies, Jim Young,

78
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.120
Jim Young, air force pararescue. And then let's see, James Mosquito,

79
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.060
James Mosquito national diver. I called them and said, hey, you know,

80
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:13.630
here's the deal. Are you interested? It was a no brainer. I said, yeah, I'm in.

81
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.120
Absolutely. All right, we're going. I packed up my stuff,

82
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.660
I have my gear and I went directly to the boat and we left underneath the Golden

83
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.493
Gate Bridge.

84
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.500
<v 0>Nothing that the horizon in front of us. My name is Holly [inaudible].</v>

85
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:32.270
I am James's significant other. We motored out for about two hours.

86
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.140
I had to do west towards the Carolinians.

87
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.360
What were you feeling when you're on the boat heading out?

88
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.850
I didn't think we'd find her. I really didn't.

89
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.050
<v 1>But about 18 miles off the coast, completely open water.</v>

90
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.150
One of the divers spots and crab buoys in the distance and some seagulls flying

91
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.480
overhead. And as they got closer, why saw the whale?

92
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.100
She just, uh, just the very

93
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.330
<v 3>top of the whale sticking up about maybe six inches out of the water at the</v>

94
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.950
surface, a tiny sliver of black. That was it. I said, okay,

95
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.840
we need it. See what's going on. So, uh,

96
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.160
so Tim and James Jump into an inflatable boat and they paddle about a couple

97
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.800
hundred feet from the whale and it just wasn't happening.

98
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.400
Every time that the swale came on up,

99
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.080
it would just displace the boat back again. So it pushed us back again,

100
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.960
not to mention the visibility in the water was just terrible.

101
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:26.750
He couldn't even see down there to see, you know, what they were dealing with.

102
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:31.280
And, uh, you know what, sometimes plans have to change in, in mid flight.

103
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.730
So Tim and James Look at each other and without saying a word, boom,

104
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.400
we got out of the boat and slash

105
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.143
<v 4>until the water</v>

106
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.190
and I see a shadow

107
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.830
[inaudible] this massive animal, a hazy silhouette.

108
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.310
And we just started swimming

109
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.140
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

110
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.820
<v 3>to the whale about a hundred feet away, uh,</v>

111
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.660
you know, parts of, of blubber and skin floating around 35 feet,

112
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.250
<v 6>20 feet. And then they see it.</v>

113
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.300
<v 3>My goodness, this thing's the size of a school bus.</v>

114
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.910
A female humpback whale is one of the largest creatures on the planet,

115
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.720
50 feet long, 50 tons,

116
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.910
and this particular whale was in a kind of c shape where its head was at the top

117
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.970
of the water, but its tail was almost pointed directly down.

118
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.410
It was almost like somebody was pulling her down by the tail to the bottom of

119
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:40.710
the ocean. Yeah, there was probably 20 crab traps,

120
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.940
2000 pounds at least just tied up to the tail.

121
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.410
She had just become an anchor and to see her not be able to move that tail and a

122
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.244
struggle,

123
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:56.310
<v 7>the will was actually really laboring to breathe a little puff and there was</v>

124
00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.770
just a rope everywhere.

125
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.660
It went around the whales mouse around the whales head across her eye,

126
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:08.620
over her background, the pictorial fins all way down to his tail.

127
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.960
I thought there was no hope, there was no chance.

128
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.230
We're looking at a dead well and the whale just doesn't know it yet.

129
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.800
<v 3>But I knew that I had to try when a swim to the whale.</v>

130
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.620
And as soon as I decided, okay, I'm gonna swim to the whale.

131
00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:24.590
Well the whale decided she wasn't going to have that.

132
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.220
<v 8>What'd she do? She put up her tech Toro Fin,</v>

133
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.840
which is like her arm and this pictorial fins about 15 feet long.

134
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.050
It's about four feet wide. And she just

135
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.870
splashed down the water in front of me. You know,

136
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.490
this is the size of an airplane wing coming down on top of you,

137
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.680
just inches from my head.

138
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.080
<v 3>So at that point I backed off and uh, waited,</v>

139
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.730
waited for the whale to settle down. She was exhausted,

140
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.580
which he did. And then they both swim back.

141
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.680
James goes to the tail and Tim, up to the wheels head, you know,

142
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:09.240
I was there with a a six inch dive knife cutting out line right near her eye,

143
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.010
which was the size of a grapefruit hinge. Her eye was moving,

144
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.643
keeping an eye on [inaudible].

145
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.960
<v 1>Really? Yeah, absolutely. He would go left or I would go left,</v>

146
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.140
he'd go right or I would go right. She was tracking me.

147
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.660
And all the while they're just cutting as much rope as they can.

148
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.890
<v 8>You really had a saw at it. It was very strong, very tight.</v>

149
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.800
Sometimes I'd cut a rope and it would be a loose rope and all of a sudden

150
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:37.850
something else would tighten up,

151
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.490
which was the one rope that would let it all free. This whole process took

152
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.920
<v 1>hours, but finally James gets to the end of it.</v>

153
00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:52.030
He's at the tail sign his way through that big clump of line and he realizes at

154
00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:55.870
a certain point it to cut through all that line when they have to stab

155
00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:01.050
<v 3>the whale to get my knife underneath the rope. Ah, it was that tight though.</v>

156
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.063
I, uh,

157
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.660
Jad my knife into the whale's tail and pulled the rope and then cut it and it

158
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:07.710
wants the rope went.

159
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.140
<v 8>It was a very surreal moment looking down and seeing the 20 crab traps and buoys</v>

160
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.020
just disappear into the abyss.

161
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:29.360
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

162
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.900
<v 1>and just like that the whale was gone.</v>

163
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.190
<v 8>I'm spinning around going, where'd she go? Where'd she go?</v>

164
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.900
<v 1>But as the waters settled, they realized they'd done it. They'd freed her.</v>

165
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.020
<v 8>As soon as I came up, I was like, Woo. Oh. Cooping it up and yelling.</v>

166
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.120
Unbelievable.

167
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.350
<v 3>Well, I was screaming, can you imagine it</v>

168
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.400
<v 1>now? Here's where the story takes a pretty startling turn. In fact,</v>

169
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.330
the whole reason we wanted to tell this story to begin with,

170
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.950
it's for what happens next.

171
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:59.040
So Tim and James and the other divers are in the water. They're celebrating,

172
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:00.600
high fiving, and then all of a sudden

173
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.310
<v 3>James looks down.</v>

174
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.230
Next thing I know how I have this 50 ton whale coming right at me.

175
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.720
<v 8>I'm thinking, oh my God, stop. I just stayed. Wait,</v>

176
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.750
so this whale is coming at you from below like jaws. Yeah,

177
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.870
she's rising up towards me. Oh God. And I was just thinking,

178
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.130
this is going to hurt.

179
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.170
<v 5>Yeah. When she was only inches away from my chest,</v>

180
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.600
[inaudible] stopped and

181
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.730
<v 3>push me on the chest backwards</v>

182
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.370
and then released me and then kind of pushed again

183
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.970
<v 8>and then released and pushed again and again. Wow.</v>

184
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.100
And then she swam up right next to me,

185
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.390
picks her head up above the water so that her eye was above the water.

186
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.500
And then came up and looked directly at me

187
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:03.950
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

188
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.810
<v 9>and for what felt like 30 seconds.</v>

189
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.850
<v 5>He says she just</v>

190
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.130
<v 8>stared at him. The pupil didn't move around.</v>

191
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.370
She wasn't looking for anything else. She was just looking

192
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:20.200
<v 5>at me. [inaudible]</v>

193
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.210
<v 8>you're in the presence of something that great, makes you feel small.</v>

194
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.950
It really wasn't a very emotional feeling. No,

195
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.040
it wasn't quite sure what to make out of it,

196
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.870
<v 9>make of it. But then he says she went off to the next Dyer did the same thing.</v>

197
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.970
I remember distinctly,

198
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.380
I was 18 inches away from her eye and she just looked at me and let me touch

199
00:12:43.381 --> 00:12:44.214
her.

200
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:44.650
<v 10>Okay.</v>

201
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.860
<v 8>And then swam off and then she went off to the next diver and did the same thing</v>

202
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.760
and the next person and did the same thing one by one coming up Brian next to

203
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:55.540
him looking at him really good and you know, inches away. Eyeballing them.

204
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.510
Just swam around to every diver, all the guys.

205
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.150
<v 10>So it was about desk. Um, the water was glass flat.</v>

206
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.750
I was sitting at the helm of the boat just in awe and they had to leave the

207
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.030
whale. She didn't want to leave them.

208
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.000
<v 11>And this is a real question here.</v>

209
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.120
What exactly was that wheel doing or saying? Was she saying anything?

210
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.700
If you ask James or Tim or Mike or any of the other divers that were in the

211
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:26.750
[inaudible]

212
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.583
<v 8>water that day,</v>

213
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.530
Neil tell you I felt this well was really thanking us.

214
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.640
I know it sounds crazy, but I could see the look in her eye,

215
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.590
this mammal, this,

216
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.090
this 50 ton mammal was literally saying thanks,

217
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.270
thanks for helping me out. And you know, I'll,

218
00:13:48.271 --> 00:13:51.340
I'll bring that to my grave knowing the gratification that I felt

219
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.420
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

220
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.880
<v 9>so what do you think? Here's the question really.</v>

221
00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.300
Was that whale saying thank you? Was the whale thing?

222
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:15.380
Well I think the whale was things, something, I mean a whale.

223
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.100
If she was just free of her ups, I would think she would just go off and say,

224
00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:21.940
well I'm free. So the fact that she was,

225
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:26.360
she hung around and make these specific eyeball visits, like,

226
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.240
I don't know. I feel that she, there's something intentional about that.

227
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.930
She didn't leave anyone out, right? No, she went, in fact, according to them,

228
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:33.770
one of the guys on the boat,

229
00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:36.290
she actually went to the boats and did the same thing to the boats.

230
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.890
She said thank you to the boats. Yeah.

231
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.940
Well then so she was looking at the people,

232
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:44.720
but she also thought that the craft was somebody she had to say that or say deal

233
00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:48.050
with. Yeah, so maybe she was just cite. Maybe she was just a,

234
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.470
<v 10>yeah,</v>

235
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.910
<v 9>I really don't know what I mean. I,</v>

236
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.450
I don't feel completely comfortable just saying,

237
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.960
of course I know what I want to feel. Yeah, me too.

238
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.770
But let's just try to straighten up for a second.

239
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.970
We have a guy named Clive when his teaches at the university. Hey. Oh, hi.

240
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:08.720
Is this Mr Clive when, yeah, this is live when Clive is with them.

241
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.250
Psychology Department of the University of Florida. Where am I taught?

242
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.560
Here's this, this is Jad from my radio 11 right. Hijab.

243
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.450
Clive also happens to be an expert on animal psychology and this is Robert also.

244
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.220
You hear US pretty well? I can hear you pretty well. I'm, I'm,

245
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.560
I'm wondering how well I'm going to distinguish your voices. No need to do that.

246
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.410
This as a unitary figure. Okay. Listen, let me,

247
00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:34.400
let me begin on this is Robert Talking will tell you a story and we want to know

248
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.730
what you think of the story. So once upon a time and not too long ago,

249
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.630
we're going to fast forward a bit because we ran Clive through the entire wheel

250
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:46.190
story front to back question to you is if a diver said to you,

251
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.070
this will said thank you to me, what would you say?

252
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.463
<v 12>Well,</v>

253
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.540
I would be put in a difficult situation because I don't doubt that what these

254
00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:59.410
people experienced was a very moving moment with that whale.

255
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.590
But the problem is I just don't speak whale,

256
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.640
so I don't know what thank you looks like in whale.

257
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.510
If I'm going to be a cynic about it, I would say,

258
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:14.410
well the whale has been trapped for I believe,

259
00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:17.170
over a day and may just be disoriented.

260
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.300
<v 9>Well, but this was,</v>

261
00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:22.920
this was parking herself with one individual and then moving to the next.

262
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.170
That's not a distracted. That looks like it's got some money intention.

263
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.860
<v 12>It shows some interest in the individuals. I'll give you that, but how do we,</v>

264
00:16:29.861 --> 00:16:31.390
how do we get from that too?

265
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.910
Did you sing that the whale is trying to express things? What do you live in?

266
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.130
Let's play a different example.

267
00:16:36.131 --> 00:16:39.880
Let's suppose that you found a bear in the woods that was caught up in some

268
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.650
netting that ended up in the woods and you work for hours to free the bear and

269
00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:45.940
then the bear eats you.

270
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:50.500
Does that mean that the the bears are an ungrateful species of animal? Yes.

271
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.510
No, I don't really believe that. Well, so,

272
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.140
so I mean it would make as much sense to ascribe in gratitude to the bear as it

273
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:01.480
does to ascribe gratitude to the whale.

274
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.540
I just don't think that's a useful way of trying to understand animals.

275
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.040
I think it ultimately it demeans them because it means that instead of living in

276
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:12.280
a world that's full of a diversity of wonderful creatures,

277
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.670
each with its own ways of relating to other members of its own species and other

278
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:18.880
members of other species, we say, well, we don't live in a world like that.

279
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.720
We live in a world that's basically a world of human beings. It doesn't matter.

280
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:26.470
Some of these human beings have suits on some of these human beings weigh

281
00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:29.920
hundreds of tons and live under the ocean and can hold their breath for a very

282
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:32.620
long time. None of that really matters. Ultimately,

283
00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:36.070
they're all basically like us and I just don't find that satisfying.

284
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.680
Are you saying that you don't know if there's a possibility of sharing or that

285
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:45.850
you don't think that there's a possibility of sharing at an emotional level

286
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.280
between two species? Um,

287
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.890
I don't doubt that there is the possibility of sharing between two species.

288
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.840
I mean, I see it with dogs all the time, but I think the,

289
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.730
it will be a mistake if we thought that the love we feel for our dogs is the

290
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:02.280
same feeling that the dog has back to us. It,

291
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.030
it has different qualities and it's where you pet your dog wags his tail and it

292
00:18:06.031 --> 00:18:09.240
seems happy to see you. Yeah. Do you just like not trust that well, okay,

293
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:12.420
so let me make clear that I wear two hats when I'm talking about a dog,

294
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:13.920
particularly a pet of my own.

295
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:17.730
I'm where I have two possible hats I can wear and one is that when the dog pants

296
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:21.750
back at me, I just hugged the dog and you know, let him kiss me and that's,

297
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.690
that's life with a dog. But if I'm,

298
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:29.340
if I'm now wearing my scientific hat and getting my blanket as wet as I possibly

299
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:34.020
can, then I ask myself, what did these behaviors mean among those?

300
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.120
That was a beautiful study that came out recently from Alexander Horevitz.

301
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.430
I'm Alexandra Horowitz and I study dog cognition. Where do we find her?

302
00:18:48.431 --> 00:18:50.800
She's well, she's around the corner from you. She's at Barnard College.

303
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.270
So we sent our producers, so we're in wheeler. Yep. That's me to meet her.

304
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.320
And he ended up hanging out with her and her dog Finnegan in the park.

305
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.780
Snuffle that's nice stuff.

306
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.670
She did this beautiful experiment that shows that, um,

307
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.160
when people think their dog is looking guilty,

308
00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.880
eyes lowered tail between the legs.

309
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.150
Actually the dog is just being submissive.

310
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.640
<v 1>So here's what she did. She tracked down a bunch of dog owners,</v>

311
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.670
posted 'em craigslist and put out posters and she found a bunch of owners who

312
00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:29.220
believed that like most dog owners do that their dogs feel guilt. Yes,

313
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:31.170
my dog feels guilty when he's done something wrong.

314
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.560
And then she set up a situation where all of the dog owners had to scold their

315
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:37.770
dogs because you know, they had been told that their dogs did something bad.

316
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.450
But the trick of the experiment is that only half the dogs had done something

317
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:42.661
wrong.

318
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:46.620
Half the dogs had actually been naughty and half the dogs had not been naughty.

319
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.860
But then she misinformed the owners lied to half of the owners to the owners.

320
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.080
So even the owners who has dogs hadn't been bad,

321
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.640
thought their dogs had been bad,

322
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.940
so everybody scolded their dog and almost everyone did this the same way,

323
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:04.170
which was to say no that lead to their dogs and maybe put their hands on their

324
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:08.670
hip and expressed as pivotal. Yes. Then again,

325
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.640
oh, it's okay.

326
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.110
See fitting just made the look even though he hadn't done anything wrong.

327
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.880
And that's essentially what she found.

328
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.180
Even the non guilty dogs need the guilty look.

329
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.030
It didn't matter whether the dog had transgressed or not.

330
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.560
All that mattered was whether it was being chastised by it's owner. So bad dog,

331
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.480
bad dog. Right. That creates the look, not the deed. That's exactly right.

332
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.260
But, but for me, the,

333
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.950
the pivotal question here is not whether or not they all had the look,

334
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:39.210
but what's attached to that?

335
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:42.030
Look what feeling in the dog is attached to that guilty look.

336
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.870
Maybe the dogs who were falsely accused still felt bad.

337
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.890
Well, maybe they did. Maybe they didn't have.

338
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:54.040
Maybe there are angels on top of this control console here.

339
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.650
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

340
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.920
<v 1>I thought it was a perfectly valid question. Yeah, we should think, uh,</v>

341
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.660
Alexandra Horowitz, her latest book is called inside of $8.

342
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.390
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

343
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.190
<v 1>and before we end this section,</v>

344
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:34.720
I have we resolved the question of what was that whale doing with those people?

345
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:39.160
Was she saying thank you or no? No. And do we ever resolve any questions at all?

346
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:42.580
Well we try, we give a little closer to the, we got this, no,

347
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:45.010
we have not resolved but we will try harder but, but, but,

348
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:48.190
but in our next section, a mere 70 seconds away,

349
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:51.430
we will try very hard to actually get scientific about it.

350
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.920
<v 13>Hi, this is Tim young out in California, uh,</v>

351
00:21:54.921 --> 00:21:59.030
on my first take of leading the radio lab credit. So here it goes.

352
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.530
Radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation and the National

353
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.780
Science Foundation. Hi,

354
00:22:05.781 --> 00:22:10.781
this is five when radio lab is produced by WM YC and distributed by NPR.

355
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.361
<v 9>Hi,</v>

356
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:17.980
it's Rachel Martin from NPR news up first is the morning news podcast from NPR.

357
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.540
When news moves fast,

358
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.510
it's the quick morning update on what happened and what you need to start your

359
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.600
day. The most important news in about 10 minutes or so.

360
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.490
Wake up with up first every day.

361
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.140
You can find it by 6:00 AM eastern time on the NPR one app or wherever you

362
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:32.980
listen to your podcast.

363
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.800
<v 1>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.</v>

364
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:44.660
This is radio lab today is our animal minds animal mind, right? Do can,

365
00:22:44.661 --> 00:22:47.960
can one animal really know what's going on in another animal's head? Yeah.

366
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.000
Like really? No really, no thanks for meetings.

367
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.060
So we were thinking about that whale story that we heard before the break,

368
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.750
you know,

369
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.460
where the divers make the whale and they were sure that we always saying thanks,

370
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.620
literally saying thanks. Thanks for helping me out. Okay.

371
00:23:03.621 --> 00:23:05.540
That is their opinion. But we wanted to know like,

372
00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:10.541
what can you actually scientifically say about that kind of exchange and that

373
00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:14.470
question. Let us introduce yourself. Like, so this guy, uh,

374
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.880
my name is Patrick Ho.

375
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:20.570
I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,

376
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.390
although actually the truth is he's really from someplace like Geneva.

377
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:26.540
He's from, he's a Swiss from the French part of Switzerland. Right. Um,

378
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:31.750
we came to him because he may have found a way of separating the animals,

379
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:37.270
of knowing which animals can genuinely have human emotions and which can't.

380
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.610
It's, it starts,

381
00:23:38.611 --> 00:23:43.611
it starts in 1995 we were studying the anatomy of the human cingulate cortex.

382
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.810
It's part of the brains right here, Kenny, between your eyes,

383
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.310
butt down and a student in my lab as an chain scheme.

384
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.480
She was looking at some brains and she saw something, ah,

385
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.240
these very slender of bipolar on the run.

386
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.730
I've never seen a neuron like that. Maybe it's unknown months,

387
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.870
probably pathological, just to be sure.

388
00:24:06.871 --> 00:24:11.770
She got some slides of other human brains looked in the same place. And we,

389
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.670
there was again,

390
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.650
started to see them again and we were very pleased. Say, okay,

391
00:24:17.651 --> 00:24:21.330
we have discovered a new cell type, whew.

392
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.230
Something that is unique to human.

393
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:28.530
But then they went to the library and discovered that some guy whose name is a

394
00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.130
Constanta Fun Economo [inaudible] Romanian guy.

395
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.700
[inaudible] had seen these cells 70 years ago and you named them spindle cells

396
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.140
because of their shape. Oh, that must've been a very sad day for Esto. No, no,

397
00:24:44.141 --> 00:24:44.974
no.

398
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.810
It's now they believe that these little brain cells may be a key to how humans

399
00:24:49.811 --> 00:24:54.370
relate to one another and whether or not other creatures can relate to us in the

400
00:24:54.371 --> 00:24:57.550
same way. Right. Is it possible to,

401
00:24:57.551 --> 00:25:02.530
for us to see a spin the cell? Yeah, we can. We can show you a spin. Also,

402
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.020
Patrick Hoff took us down the hall. Yup.

403
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.240
Jag went first and parked him in front of it.

404
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.390
<v 0>Big Microscope. Yeah, fine sense. Again, look at it. Will it be obvious to me?</v>

405
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.830
Yeah. I'm looking at crossing the middle of the field.

406
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.690
You can see a series of tall, slender and making me dizzy. One, two,

407
00:25:18.691 --> 00:25:23.220
three, four, five. Is that the spindles? Yeah. Oh, they're everywhere. Yeah.

408
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.900
Aw. You want to see them when you can see them? I mean, yeah. You hold in mind.

409
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.990
Oh yeah. There's like a,

410
00:25:30.991 --> 00:25:35.100
there's a whole troop of them and they're long and skinny and purple.

411
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.600
It's funny because the normal brain cells,

412
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.530
which you can also see in there are like that,

413
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.710
but these ones are do like little purple bananas,

414
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.700
like a team of Purple Banana and the thing that makes these cell so interesting,

415
00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:51.540
she means to hit off in this direction. Yeah. According to Patrick Hoff is that,

416
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.420
you know, in the normal brain cells they just talk to their neighbors.

417
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.030
But these ones, because they're so long,

418
00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.030
<v 1>they seem to be yelling across a big a distance. Exactly.</v>

419
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:06.550
We know that this sales send an action at some distance. Okay.

420
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.600
Hello?

421
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.400
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

422
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.170
<v 1>it's across the valley. Yeah, it's across the valley. Exactly. It's projecting</v>

423
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.990
the projecting what and from where to where. Well,

424
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:21.330
Patrick Hoff doesn't entirely know,

425
00:26:21.331 --> 00:26:24.600
but he says he can make it pretty good guess based on, well,

426
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.420
if you look in the microscope, you do notice the things.

427
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.100
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So, so here, here,</v>

428
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.570
top of the spindle points toward the surface of the brain or your job, he says,

429
00:26:33.571 --> 00:26:38.010
seems to shoot up towards those more modern parts of the brain that involve high

430
00:26:38.011 --> 00:26:40.920
Yoda cognition, language, abstract thinking.

431
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.590
Whereas the bottom of the spindle seems to shoe down

432
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.690
<v 14>deep down lower centers in the brain towards those older parts of our brain that</v>

433
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.430
involve

434
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.260
<v 1>feelings, emotions, instinct.</v>

435
00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.530
So perhaps this is what Patrick off things,

436
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.240
the desales are a kind of network,

437
00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:02.580
a really important one did allows the different parts of our inner selves

438
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.493
<v 0>connect.</v>

439
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.490
Like you've got the parts of us down here that feel things can now communicate

440
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:12.350
with the parts of us up here that think things.

441
00:27:12.351 --> 00:27:14.750
This is an oversimplification of course, but the point,

442
00:27:14.751 --> 00:27:18.530
the larger point is that this is exactly what happens when you look into the

443
00:27:18.531 --> 00:27:23.060
eyes of another human being because it begins with a kind of thought,

444
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.910
your eyes seem sad,

445
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.970
but then that thought within you travels a great distance and connects with a

446
00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:33.970
feeling of sadness that you feel sad too.

447
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.260
I mean it's the basis of a kind of a emphasis.

448
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.050
<v 1>Exactly. Exactly. You know, I, I see you are happy, you know, so,</v>

449
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:43.110
so that I feel good about it and you know, and consider those times.

450
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:47.310
I mean not just empty where like your thoughts and feelings are in conflict and

451
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.610
if you've got to really talk to one another. Like for example,

452
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.920
when you kicked in front of me at the microphone yet again and hey it's you,

453
00:27:55.921 --> 00:28:00.270
but I know that I have to work with you. So I, I sit on that feeling,

454
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.690
I just sit on my, it's going down to the bottom of my brain,

455
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:05.310
but I say take a nap.

456
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.270
See that's the best part of your spindle situation is that it's not just a

457
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:12.900
thought to connect to feelings with his thoughts can sometimes suppress

458
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:13.610
feelings. Yeah.

459
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:18.610
I think that's the idea is that humans in social interactions can rely on these

460
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.380
hardwired emotions in the same way. Either animals might be able to,

461
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.210
that's shown hilarious science writer,

462
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.290
a regular radio lab contributor and a guy we often call it to help us make sense

463
00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:29.580
of things. Um, you know,

464
00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.940
we can like a dog just hump every other dog and see what happens.

465
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.250
We've just got a flirt and be funny and you know,

466
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:42.970
buy a couple drinks and that, that, that was, you guys have to cut that cause I,

467
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.020
I am so astonished. We kind gotta use that.

468
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.900
I just, I just turned into a frat boy. So,

469
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.370
but the point being that our social interactions are very complicated and that

470
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.360
we can't rely,

471
00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:00.960
it's much tougher for humans to rely on simply these hardwired primitive

472
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:04.290
instincts against the job of spindle cells is to simply broadcast

473
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.610
<v 14>content to the rest of the brain. Cause without our whole brain involved,</v>

474
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.140
we'd never be able to navigate the social world and make any kind of connection.

475
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:16.740
Right.

476
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.420
So if spindle cells then allow us to talk gently and emotionally to one another.

477
00:29:21.421 --> 00:29:23.970
The question is, this is the question for our hour,

478
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.930
what about introduced species is intra or inter intra intra run net?

479
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.810
Yeah, that's inside I think across species is what you mean.

480
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.320
Does any other animal have spindle cells?

481
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:42.040
<v 1>Yeah, we're taking and as it happens, so we, I'm you to my cold</v>

482
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.100
<v 16>room just down the hall from his office. It's professor Hoff has a freezer,</v>

483
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.420
a way high stalled.

484
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.540
The specimens are very big door to full.

485
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.350
The brain's going to get to the cooler here.

486
00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.430
All different kinds with brains of volume species. The CETACEANS are over there.

487
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.620
We have the Great Davis around whale wall and that's the way the wall, yeah,

488
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.290
he's got dozens and dozens of brains and buckets and new jars and it keeps them

489
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:12.280
all organized. Well in each category of species has its own shelf.

490
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.550
You have more grapes down there with going laws in orangutans.

491
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.220
<v 1>Uh, it was really cold in there too.</v>

492
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:29.510
What they did was they took a bunch of those brains off the shelf and walked him

493
00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:33.800
down the hall to the lab and put little pieces of them under a microscope.

494
00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.820
They didn't expect to find any of those bizarro neurons,

495
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.530
any of these other creatures.

496
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.800
Cause he was pretty sure this is something that is unique to human.

497
00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.330
But one day we will looking at the brain of the Humpback Whale

498
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.880
and we stumble on spindle cells, plenty of spindle cells. Oh,

499
00:30:56.881 --> 00:31:01.350
so what was that? Did you, were you surprised? And I was there say, okay,

500
00:31:01.351 --> 00:31:05.790
this is fascinating. You weren't expecting that. I wasn't expecting that.

501
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.620
But on the other hand, here we have the, the humpback whale,

502
00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:14.740
which is a very social animals. They, they,

503
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.100
they form clans, they,

504
00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.270
they communicates the males. It was so long

505
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:28.750
they hunt together. They develop punting strategies,

506
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.850
which requires perfect coordination of many whales.

507
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.220
So they have to act together to do that.

508
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.790
<v 11>Now if acting together is the key, you know,</v>

509
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.430
and having complex social structures,

510
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.240
well then these things shouldn't just be limited to Wales. And in fact,

511
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:49.990
over the years half and other scientists have found spindle sales in

512
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:54.100
chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins,

513
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.620
gorillas. Which begs the question

514
00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:58.520
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

515
00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.440
<v 11>like if we want to have an experience with another creature and now not just at</v>

516
00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:04.290
the zoo, but are real shared experience,

517
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.070
do those creatures need to have these things?

518
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.480
Do you think the existence of spinned Osos creates more of a possibility of

519
00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:16.200
having that cross species sharing moment? I think so.

520
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.340
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

521
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.840
<v 4>if we assume that the cells have zilch an influence on uh,</v>

522
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.180
the sociability of the species,

523
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.680
it is very likely that you would, uh,

524
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:34.390
experience something of that kind of with the species that has them.

525
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.540
I doubt you would get a very good experience if you were trying to do this with

526
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.433
the Hyena.

527
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.380
<v 14>So maybe what we see when we look into, you know,</v>

528
00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:50.610
these sad eyes of a blue whale or when we look into the eyes of an elephant,

529
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.500
I'm cradling a baby elephant, which are just the cutest things on earth.

530
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.450
Maybe what we recognize is, is, is that same flavor from ocean,

531
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.420
that same inner life, a feeling maybe,

532
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.320
and it's the big maybe maybe that in our life requires spindle cells.

533
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:18.500
<v 12>And how big is that? Maybe it makes, it sounds like a really maybe, maybe.</v>

534
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.810
I mean, you know, it's important that I, this is all just a,

535
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.120
I think this is still very theoretical and in fact if you asked people like

536
00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:30.440
Clive with the fellow who, who, who poo-pooed our whale, thank you from before,

537
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.953
ask Clive. Like,

538
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.740
could you look at an animal and find something in the animal that says, Yep,

539
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.530
if he has that he's got feeling well wrong.

540
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:45.610
I don't for a moment imagine that there's going to be a type of nerve cell or a

541
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:47.570
type of structure in the brain,

542
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:52.640
which is going to be such an acid test of whether an animal has a particular

543
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:56.690
psychological capacity that we could then find that kind of neuron and say,

544
00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.390
well, now we know without having to look at the behavior of the animal.

545
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:03.780
Now we know that this species has this or that psychological ability. Well,

546
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.150
let me ask the question a different way. I mean,

547
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.760
do you think spindle cells are no spindle cells?

548
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.960
Let's just toss them out for a second.

549
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:13.961
Do you think there are a category of creatures that are more likely to have

550
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:19.220
empathic experiences with us? Would you draw lines between beings? Well,

551
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:20.050
the thing I would, the,

552
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.930
the thing I would emphasize if we're looking for empathy between different

553
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:25.970
species is there, um,

554
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.090
developmental experiences to make his point.

555
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.350
Clive told us about this experiment is let's take a chimp with all the spindle

556
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:34.790
cells inside the chimp brain there.

557
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.100
Put the chimp in the room and in front of the chimp,

558
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.840
let's put the two cops face down. No one of the cups has a grip,

559
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.460
something delicious under it,

560
00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:48.650
and the chimp doesn't know where the grape is. It could be under cup a cup B.

561
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:49.071
So what you,

562
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:54.071
the experiment you do is you simply point to the cup that has the grape.

563
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.580
Like that's the one, that one right there.

564
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.580
And all the animal has to do is to go to the cup. That's pointed to it.

565
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:04.250
Seems simple enough. But chimps five says,

566
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.600
chimps find this stunningly difficult to understand. Get this wrong.

567
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.471
What do you mean? I mean,

568
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:12.560
they just look at you pointing and they look at your pointing and they look and

569
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.080
you're pointing and they just go, Whoa,

570
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.300
where is dogs who don't have spindle cells?

571
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:20.030
Most pet dogs get this from the get go.

572
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.390
The dogs can do this and chimps can, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.900
They quite spontaneously recognize that you should go where where they point and

574
00:35:26.901 --> 00:35:31.490
Clive says the explanation here is not the dogs have some special cell in their

575
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:35.060
brain. It's simply because because they grow up in our households,

576
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.480
they grow up with us. Right to test this idea. He did the same study,

577
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.400
the pointing one. Yup.

578
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.730
Except this time with some wolves because wolves are the animals from which dogs

579
00:35:44.731 --> 00:35:49.731
are descended but they haven't lived in human households obviously and normally

580
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.760
like the chimps.

581
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:55.620
Wolves totally screw up the pointing tasks that we've done some tests on some

582
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:59.880
wolves that were hand reared by human beings and are very friendly to human

583
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:04.881
beings and we find that those wolves behave just like the dogs,

584
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.940
that they are just as good at following the human pointing to find the food.

585
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.870
Really. Did you have to train them or no? We did not train them.

586
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.180
They just wound up while they just picked it up.

587
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:20.450
But these are exceptional bowls in so far as they were reared by human beings.

588
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.690
They were bottle fed when they were wee babies because there are things that go

589
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:29.130
on earlier in our development that are crucial and that include learning who are

590
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.910
your, who are your kind, what do I, who am I, what am I?

591
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.320
And you learn that in a critical period in your early life by looking around you

592
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:38.790
and seeing who you're interacting with.

593
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.750
Pretty much every dog you might meet has learned to accept humans as social

594
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:46.350
companions. And that's because it was written in a human home.

595
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:50.520
And because evolution has prepared it with a relatively slow development so that

596
00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:54.360
it's pretty easy to tame a dog. The Wolf on the other hand,

597
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.080
it goes through its childhood and adolescents in the blink of an eye in the

598
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:59.850
course of just a handful of weeks.

599
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.240
And so it's actually extremely difficult to successfully hand rear a wolf

600
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:10.530
because you have so little time available to you and you have to invest 24 hours

601
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:10.801
a day,

602
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:15.801
seven days a week during that brief period that a wolf is open to the

603
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:19.530
possibility of learning who its companions might be. That's really interesting.

604
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.690
You know, one of the pieces of the interpretation that I find intriguing,

605
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.210
I wanna I want to run by you. Is that, Ooh, so interesting.

606
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.830
I'm now sitting here thinking, boy, if I could raise a whale with a baby bottle,

607
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.070
then I would know whether the will was saying thank you to me because I would

608
00:37:35.071 --> 00:37:37.710
have learned it's not like I have to learn a little bit.

609
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:40.710
Whale would have learned human. Wow, that's right. I mean,

610
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:42.180
of course this is completely hypothetical.

611
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:44.310
The whales are really bad example to choose,

612
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.270
but my guess would be if you bottle fed or whale,

613
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.510
you would get a whale that might plausibly do something like a behavior that

614
00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:56.400
expresses things. That is such a hard mental image to conjure. Well,

615
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:57.390
that's right. That's right.

616
00:37:57.391 --> 00:38:01.650
Bottle feeding away because we have to keep rising to the surface for 21 years

617
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:04.890
to breathe before I actually get to the experiment.

618
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.740
There are a number of drawbacks to that experience.

619
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.850
Radio will continue in a moment.

620
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.570

<v 9>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab today. Uh,</v>

626
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.410
kind of a hard topic to describe. We're calling it, um, animal minds animal,

627
00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.950
or maybe the better way to say this is minds other than our own,

628
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.460
which would be the animals. No, we're, we're animals though. Yeah, you're right.

629
00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.760
Yeah. So we live with, yeah. Wherever.

630
00:38:59.761 --> 00:39:01.320
You weren't having enough trouble just talking to each other.

631
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.190
But imagine if I would try, if you were a Labrador, that'd be tough. See,

632
00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:08.370
then we'd have a problem or a way. That's kind of what we're looking at it.

633
00:39:08.371 --> 00:39:12.360
How much can you really share with, you know, a Labrador or a whale. Right.

634
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.670
And we're not solving this problem in this show at all,

635
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.960
but we really could do this.

636
00:39:15.961 --> 00:39:19.080
Maybe instead of talking to scientists about other minds,

637
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:24.150
maybe we should talk to, um, a writer. Yeah. Paul, can you hear me?

638
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.290
Paul, can you hear Paul Paul, Paul Paul,

639
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.610
the writer we chose to look for you may not know was named Paul. Okay, standby.

640
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.320
Paul. He's the author of any number of travel books,

641
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:42.480
novels. Did he win a big prize? I'm sure. Yes. Is that Jed? Yes.

642
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.870
Hi j d, that's me. Like a Pulitzer, one of the,

643
00:39:45.871 --> 00:39:47.760
one of the big ones and I didn't win a Pulitzer,

644
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.090
but he won a prize of my heart when he wrote the Patagonia Express. Oh,

645
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.510
so you're taping. Okay, great. Yes, yes. Anyhow,

646
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.140
Paul Theroux travels all around the world writing about all kinds of things,

647
00:39:58.141 --> 00:40:02.610
but the reason we called him is for something that actually happened in his

648
00:40:02.611 --> 00:40:06.120
backyard, which luckily for him happens to be in the state of Hawaii.

649
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:09.210
I own seven acres on a slope,

650
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.920
a west facing slope on the north shore of Oahu. O and I had very,

651
00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:18.060
very long grass and someone said, oh, I know what you need is some geese.

652
00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:19.290
They'll take care of that grass.

653
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.520
So I called a couple and you decided not to go to the hardware store and buy a

654
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.720
lawnmower. You decided to buy two animate bird? That's right. I would have deed.

655
00:40:27.721 --> 00:40:31.230
So I really, really serious industrial mower.

656
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.720
Instead I get to nonindustrial geese.

657
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:34.703
<v 7>Oh,</v>

658
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.950
I actually got three two Gander's in a goose and the strange thing happened,

659
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.590
one of the candies imprinted on me.

660
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:46.750
So what does that mean?

661
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:51.750
Show me the baby chick boy looked at you as 10 the first moving thing they see

662
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.650
is the mother figure. This goose became very attached,

663
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.460
very protective. It would sit by lap. When another goose came up,

664
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.260
it would peck at them. Anyway,

665
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:06.190
it was both protective and attentive,

666
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.330
but as the gander grew up,

667
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:16.110
<v 9>strange things began to happen. First it became detached from me,</v>

668
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.980
then aggressive toward me and then needed me.

669
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.710
It was very strange and it made me think,

670
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.980
I want to get some more geese and I want to read more about them and then and

671
00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:29.940
then watch them. So he, well, he asked friends and friends said to him, look,

672
00:41:29.941 --> 00:41:32.700
if you want to know everything that's important to know about geese,

673
00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:34.190
you have to read e

674
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.570
<v 18>B white. Most people mentioned ab white when they talk about gays and our costs.</v>

675
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:40.160
I know and love Ab White.

676
00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.580
And if you're not a Martian you probably love Eby too. I mean,

677
00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.160
what do you mean? And being people,

678
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.430
it's possible for people not to love read Stuart little or how many people read

679
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:52.760
Charlotte's web? Just if you don't love the children's fiction.

680
00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.240
And he's certainly one of the great greatest of all American SAS. Yeah,

681
00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.180
see that's the point. He's one of the great American writers. He actually

682
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.690
wrote the Bible for writing elements of style. You know,

683
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.190
let's tell the Bible for writing weirdly. And it was written like 50 years ago.

684
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.960
So when people point to anything by BYG you point seriously.

685
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.670
And in this case, very late in life, after he'd moved up to a cabinet in Maine,

686
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.300
he was in his seventies and this particular essay we're gonna talk about is

687
00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:24.400
called very simply the geese, the geese,

688
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.150
Allan Cove, July 9th, 1971

689
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:29.743
<v 5>okay.</v>

690
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
<v 18>I've had a pair of elderly gray goose goose and the gander living on this place</v>

691
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.830
for a number of years and they have been my friend.

692
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.560
So Paul threw open the essay early in the spring,

693
00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.140
fully expecting to learn all about geese.

694
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:53.830
But then he kept running across these little phrases and adjectives that made

695
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:55.274
him

696
00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:01.010
<v 9>cringe. [inaudible] he talks about a Gosling that grows into,</v>

697
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:05.420
I'm quoting now, a real, real dandy full of pompous thoughts.

698
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:11.060
Surely gesture, pompous thoughts and surly gestures, you know, come on. I mean,

699
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:15.940
doesn't that make the goose a little bit more, um, easy to relate to? All right,

700
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.140
take one word malice.

701
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.690
I could not tell whether the look in his eye was one of malice or affection.

702
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.620
Bellis is a word you use for Mussolini or somebody else from dos.

703
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.920
But what's the sin in that?

704
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.810
If a man who's a professional storyteller and one of the greatest ones, it says,

705
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.610
let me tell you about my keys.

706
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.260
And then talks about them as though they were uncles and aunts and neighbors

707
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:47.130
with moods that are distinctly human. Well,

708
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.130
I suppose you could say so. You could say so what if you put them in,

709
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.780
you know little Halloween costumes too for that matter. So what,

710
00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.740
but I'm in the writing business. Thriving business should be unsparing.

711
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.520
He could be quite unsparing himself in his writing.

712
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.430
You're giving Evie white too much license.

713
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.430
If you're saying it really doesn't matter, it does matter to me

714
00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.520
<v 18>and the reason it matters is Paul through</v>

715
00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.100
is it Eby got so attached to the idea of those geese as aging critters like

716
00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:22.370
himself did.

717
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:25.460
He missed something deep and important about the geese.

718
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:27.050
The elements of that behavior that is,

719
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.180
that is pure groups all pointed to the end of it. Suddenly

720
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.990
<v 5>I heard sounds of a rumble outside in the barnyard where the ganders were</v>

721
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:42.900
formerly great gander gets unseated by a younger male. Goose is a big fight.

722
00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.770
It's a squawking and the old gander loses

723
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.130
[inaudible].

724
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:56.130
I watched as he threaded his way slowly down the narrow path between clumps of

725
00:44:56.651 --> 00:45:01.390
pistols and daisies. His head was barely visible above the grasses,

726
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.590
but his broken spirit was plain to any eye.

727
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.840
I felt very deeply his sorrow and his defeat. Well,

728
00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:14.770
<v 9>the defeated a Ganda goes off. Well, this isn't true at all.</v>

729
00:45:14.771 --> 00:45:17.770
When aganda loses a battle, he goes off,

730
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:21.190
gets his strength back and waits for a chance to attack again.

731
00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.290
That kind of is going to come back and fight again.

732
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.620
So you're saying that he got it wrong? Of course. Of course.

733
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.860
Here's a man who is solitary.

734
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:35.020
He's a New Yorker who goes to Maine and becomes a gentleman farmer of a kind

735
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:39.180
<v 18>and begins to relate to his case and then writes about them as though he's one</v>

736
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:44.160
of them. I know I'm not one of them, but if you can't use words that are,

737
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.190
you know, very human and psychological words,

738
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.520
and if you can't because you're not a goose,

739
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:54.750
have whatever it is that geese have on their insides,

740
00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:00.230
then what if you wanted to share something with a goose,

741
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.920
and I bet you you do.

742
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:07.550
Is there any way in which you could honestly describe yourself as a friend of

743
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.910
any of these gates?

744
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.970
<v 9>I would say, you know, the, the, this is a very good question. I,</v>

745
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.850
I had a very surly tend to use it. Eby were a very, uh, very,

746
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.260
um, rambunctious Ganda and he got very sick. You know,

747
00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:32.650
the thing is sitting on the ground just following its nest.

748
00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.210
I thought he was really gonna die and I nursed him back to health.

749
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.780
I gave him a, a antibiotic with a Turkey based, uh,

750
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.640
and it took about three or four weeks.

751
00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:49.120
And the first thing he did when he was nurse back to health, he was,

752
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.050
he got up on two legs and I came up with the Turkey based to give him one last

753
00:46:53.051 --> 00:46:57.810
drink. And he bit me and I thought, Pop Lady Lady,

754
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.300
he bit my leg hod. And I thought, okay, he's back to hell. You didn't think Al

755
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.810
<v 18>could you? Well, I thought he said he's, he's healthy,</v>

756
00:47:04.811 --> 00:47:08.890
he's healthy again and he's behaving just as a goose or don't you see though

757
00:47:08.891 --> 00:47:13.891
that if the moment of true of your true most goosey moment is the moment when

758
00:47:14.321 --> 00:47:17.170
you're with the goose that you help bites you,

759
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.070
then you are out of this story in effect.

760
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.070
<v 9>I, I absolutely agree with that. In, in all of this, there's an implied, uh,</v>

761
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.313
loneliness.

762
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.520
I'm not his friend. I'm not a feathered creature.

763
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.430
I'm a human being among birds.

764
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.040
I'll vote curiously.

765
00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:46.041
Paul Theroux does have an approach to communing with his keys.

766
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.480
He takes a chair, puts it on the lawn, plops down in the chair

767
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.250
and disappears. You know,

768
00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.100
my writing day ends or the early afternoon I have lunch and after lunch there's

769
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:04.090
a long sunny period in the afternoon when I'm alone,

770
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.600
I'm with the case and I sit around with them and try to make out what they're

771
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:14.920
doing among each other and paying no particular attention to meet.

772
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.730
It's simply watching the world as it was.

773
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:24.190
You're seeing creatures who are behaving as though cities don't exist.

774
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.260
Presidents don't exist. Governments don't exist.

775
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.720
Roads don't exist as if it's before the fall. Hmm.

776
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.980
Well as though it's the peaceable kingdom,

777
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.640
simply watching animals who are content doing their thing.

778
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.830
Then you feel a bit like Adam

779
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:49.223
<v 5>[inaudible],</v>

780

<v 1>Wait a second, stop. Stop the machine.</v>

788
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:44.180
It just feels weird to end the show this way with this lonely geese thing.

789
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:48.550
So we're going to play for you. One final story. It's kind of a continuation,

790
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.740
uh, of Paul through in his geese,

791
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:54.280
except involves a very different guy in a very different climate. First of all,

792
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:56.110
who would, who are you, what's your name?

793
00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.310
My name is Paul Nicklin and I'm a contributing photographer to National

794
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.090
Geographic magazine. Paul Nicklin is basically national geographics, Arctic guy.

795
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:04.451
It's,

796
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:08.920
I've been pegged as their polar specialist and this particular tale involves his

797
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:13.000
attempt to photograph one of the Great Arctic predators, the leopard seal,

798
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.180
leopard seal, which by reputation is a very nasty creature.

799
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:21.100
Preface to this story is in 2003, tragically, a scientist was actually killed.

800
00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.120
Uh,

801
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.210
Kirstie Brown was doing underwater research and she was taken down by a leopard

802
00:50:25.211 --> 00:50:28.280
seal and drown, which she just yanked the ice. She was swimming

803
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.140
<v 20>and it just came up and grabbed her and took her down to 300 feet. Nonetheless,</v>

804
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:36.920
our story starts with Paul and his guide go down there in a boat in the Arctic

805
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.700
Ocean looking for seals. The first seal we encountered,

806
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:44.240
I'd never seen a leopard seal before. And we came around in,

807
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.830
into this bay where there was a penguin colony. And right away got on,

808
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.740
who's seen many, many leopard seals. He said to me, you know, bloody hell,

809
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:53.360
that's the biggest seal I've ever seen.

810
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.670
And she came up to the boat with a penguin in her mouth.

811
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.460
She went underneath the boat and she started ramming the pain,

812
00:50:58.461 --> 00:50:59.900
went underneath the knees, the whole of the boat,

813
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:03.080
lifting the bowel out of the water. And that's when good on looks to me.

814
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:05.360
And he says, Paul, it's time for you to get in the water. Yeah.

815
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.880
And his thick Swedish accent. Wow. Were you freaking out? I had dry mouth. Um,

816
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.390
just from the nervousness, I was trembling and you know,

817
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.450
I put my mask on and slipped over the 29 degree Fahrenheit water.

818
00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.570
And uh, there she was instantly right there.

819
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:22.130
<v 5>Mm.</v>

820
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:26.480
<v 20>Massive. Huge. Well, how huge. Probably over a thousand pounds. Oh my God.</v>

821
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.350
12 feet long.

822
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:28.500
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

823
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.370
<v 20>she dropped her pain when she came right over to me and she opened up her mouth</v>

824
00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.280
and she engulfed the front of the camera.

825
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.310
Her canines were on top of my head too, or below my chin.

826
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.410
And I'm basically staring down her throat.

827
00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:43.110
<v 11>I can't believe you managed to take a picture of this because I'm looking at</v>

828
00:51:43.111 --> 00:51:47.670
this picture and these teeth are huge. The canines you, they're like massive.

829
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:51.930
So you were doing business at this moment? Yeah, I'm working at that point.

830
00:51:51.931 --> 00:51:53.730
You can even see the texture of the seals.

831
00:51:53.731 --> 00:51:55.740
Tongues like she has these little fibers on it. Okay.

832
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.830
<v 20>Does 180 degree view. So he had to get that, that perspective.</v>

833
00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:02.400
I'm basically in the mouth to get that shot. Wow. So then what happened?

834
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:05.910
She backs off, looks at me, sniff my flippers, touched him with her nose,

835
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.360
poked me in the bum, came up and did this open mouth threat display again.

836
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.283
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

837
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.170
<v 20>and then she swims away.</v>

838
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.993
<v 5>Wow.</v>

839
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.000
<v 20>Just, I was just getting ready to swim back to the Zodiac. You know,</v>

840
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.780
I've been in the water for quite awhile and I'm cold and all of a sudden she

841
00:52:24.781 --> 00:52:28.200
shows up with a freshly caught life. Penguin chicken, her mouth, Huh.

842
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.950
And I'm sitting there staring at her and she stops about 10 feet away from me

843
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.340
and she's got the penguin by the feet and the penguin's flapping its flippers

844
00:52:35.341 --> 00:52:36.174
trying to get away.

845
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.750
She lines the penguin up the face perfectly in my direction and she lets it go.

846
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.590
The penguins swam right by me and she chases off after it and grabs it,

847
00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.280
comes back and does it again and again and again.

848
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.500
Why Gam and what was she doing?

849
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.240
At first I couldn't figure out what was going on.

850
00:52:51.241 --> 00:52:54.270
I thought maybe she was having a hard time eating it and then it dawned on me

851
00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.500
she was trying to feed me.

852
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.460
<v 5>Oh,</v>

853
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.120
<v 18>did you make any attempt during this period to say no, thank you.</v>

854
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.550
<v 20>Nope. Nope. I'm so in such disbelief at this point.</v>

855
00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:08.960
I'm just trying to capture it.

856
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:12.490
<v 5>Whoa.</v>

857
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:12.611
<v 18>Well,</v>

858
00:53:12.611 --> 00:53:17.530
didn't you feel compelled as a social human to just offer some kind of gestural

859
00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:21.100
explanation? I mean with me, I would have made some look like com.

860
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:22.640
I don't eat that stuff. Or

861
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:26.040
<v 11>maybe it's like you take, you take the penguin at that point and you're like,</v>

862
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.670
<v 1>well I went and some penguins swimming 15 miles an hour, you know. Oh,</v>

863
00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:32.700
so you mean when when she lets go and she goes film like a bullet. Oh,

864
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:35.420
he's pathetic because what he's saying is I'm a pathetic creature. I can't,

865
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.180
I actually,

866
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.200
<v 20>I'm thinking exposures. Get the shot, keeps shooting. You're such a photo dude,</v>

867
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.830
you know. Well I'm, I work for NASA.

868
00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.900
I don't want to anthropomorphize too much.

869
00:53:45.901 --> 00:53:49.260
But as the penguin was swimming by this huge seal,

870
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:53.070
she looked over at me and I swear she had a look of disgust interface.

871
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:59.060
So she goes off and gets another penguin and this penguin now is quite weak and

872
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:03.030
tired looking. And so I think she's worn it down and she lets the penguin go.

873
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.080
Penguin takes off,

874
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.200
she grabs it does out a couple more times and you're still not eating the

875
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:08.370
penguin, right?

876
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:12.090
Next encounter was bringing me dead penguins and sometimes she would just drop

877
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:15.640
off a dead penguin right on top of the camera and she would just sit there and

878
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.570
with this dejected look on her face staring at me.

879
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.500
And then she went to the stage of flipping dead penguins on top of my head and

880
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:25.710
trying to force feed me these penguins telling me at this point, you know,

881
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:29.520
eat these damn penguins. I'm trying to feed you. Why won't you eat my penguins,

882
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:30.383
eat the penguins.

883
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.570
And she would start to eat the penguins right in front of me and show me how to

884
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:35.700
eat them. She would rip them apart on the surface,

885
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.700
get the skin off them and she's stretching them in the water in front of me.

886
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.560
<v 1>And, and how much time is passing here? I mean, we're talking minutes, hours.</v>

887
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.380
This went on for four days. Four days.

888
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.310
And when you're in the water, you know, day after day,

889
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:52.500
what's happening for you at this point? Are you still just a guy with a camera?

890
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.220
<v 20>I mean, I was starting to fall in love with this seal.</v>

891
00:54:55.221 --> 00:55:00.080
It's just a this animal that's just so intelligent, so a powerful,

892
00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:02.820
and they could kill you in an instant. Yet you're, they mean, well,

893
00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.430
we'll usually, you're in love what you were,

894
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:08.450
were you in love with the idea of this or did you really like her?

895
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.970
I really liked her. She was beautiful. She was big. She had this,

896
00:55:12.971 --> 00:55:14.150
this beautiful face,

897
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.720
beautiful silver color to her and she kind of glow it underwater.

898
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:21.440
I'm just so in love with this seal at this point, not sleeping at night.

899
00:55:21.441 --> 00:55:23.600
I have a hard time eating. I just can't wait to see her.

900
00:55:23.601 --> 00:55:27.020
I can't the first thing in the morning, you know, first sign of light,

901
00:55:27.021 --> 00:55:27.920
I'm in that Zodiac

902
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.110
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

903
00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:35.780
<v 20>and then on the fourth day is when, you know, I was thinking, okay,</v>

904
00:55:35.781 --> 00:55:38.600
maybe she's weary of me and she's getting tired of me,

905
00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:40.010
so I'm just going to totally leave her alone.

906
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.080
And that's when I started going off and presenting myself to other seals who

907
00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.390
were swimming around the rookery and,

908
00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:49.900
and I was in the water and the same big female came up to me and she started to

909
00:55:50.001 --> 00:55:52.220
do all these really beautiful belly like moves.

910
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.460
I'm photographing her and looking at her and all of a sudden she drops her

911
00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.350
penguin, she turns upside down and she does this big guttural Cook, Cook, Cook,

912
00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:03.850
Cook, Cook, Cook, cook, this big jarring noise as vibrating my whole body.

913
00:56:03.851 --> 00:56:06.950
I can really feel it in my chest. It's so loud and I'm thinking,

914
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:07.850
am I being attacked?

915
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:11.270
She'd finally told me that she is sick of me and wants me off her feeding

916
00:56:11.271 --> 00:56:13.340
grounds, but as soon as she did that,

917
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.770
another leopard seal shot out from right behind me.

918
00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.210
And so this leopard seal had stuck in behind me and she did that noise to chase

919
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:24.430
that seal away, a smaller seal. She chased the seal it too, had a penguin.

920
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:27.640
She grabbed its penguin and brought me that seals penguin and dropped it off in

921
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:29.910
front of me. Oh

922
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:36.400
Wow. Sarah. Lucky guy. Wow. Me Moments getting emotional. We live in that.

923
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:37.390
I mean, it's very powerful.

924
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:42.040
Have you ever been in love with an animal in quite this way before? Never.

925
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:45.520
Never. Have you ever had an experience with, uh,

926
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:49.090
with another human that Reynolds is perhaps when I was a kid with my mom,

927
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.660
someone taking care of you and feeling safe and nurtured and protected,

928
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:56.620
but I've never had that in my life as an adult. It sounds,

929
00:56:56.621 --> 00:57:00.080
this is such an interesting species moment here. I mean,

930
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.220
it sounds like you're doing something if you're transgressing or something.

931
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.460
Sounds like you're stealing something from the gods right here,

932
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:10.620
right at this moment. I mean, I don't know what words I can find to,

933
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:15.670
to explain it. Thank you so much. Thank you guys.
