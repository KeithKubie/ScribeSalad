ALEX DANILO: Hi.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.110
I'm Alex Danilo from the
Google Developer Platform team.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.720
As a developer, I want
more people to use my apps,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.360
and to spend more
time using them,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.550
so I get more bang for my buck,
especially if it means more

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.540
in-app purchases, or
ad viewing time that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.930
turns into real
money in my pocket.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.740
The average TV viewer spends
up to three hours a day

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.520
in front of their TV set.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.200
If only there was a way to get
my apps onto that big screen

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.690
to take advantage of all
that time, I could be rich.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.940
Well, there is a way.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.040
It's called Google Cast.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.930
Google cast is a technology
that lets you, as a developer,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.440
extend your existing app onto
the big screen in people's

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.560
living room.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.220
It's so simple easy to
add casting capability

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.950
to your apps, that
soon enough, you'll

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.814
be reeling in more and more
users to enjoy your creations.

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:47.730
And I'm going to take
you through a quick tour

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.389
of how easy it is to do so.

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.930
Google Cast is a way to connect
different devices and screens

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.870
together.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.640
You can think of it as a way to
extend your app's functionality

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.570
out from where you
ship your app today,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.489
onto another big screen that
lots of people can share.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030
The app you already have is the
place where the magic starts.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.850
We call that the sender.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.910
Sender apps can be on a
phone, both iOS or Android,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.760
or a tablet, or even a laptop
running a web application.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.330
Senders start the action,
and they send or cast stuff

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.950
from the app onto
the big screen.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.335
When you cast something
from your app-- the sender--

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:24.270
it needs to get
caught by something.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.490
That's what the receiver is for.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.460
Google Cast runs on receiving
devices, like the Chrome Cast.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.830
At the start casting,
a small application

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.870
we call the receiver
gets downloaded

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.650
onto the receiving device.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.660
Your sender application controls
which receiver application

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.070
gets loaded onto
the cast device.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.530
The cast-enabled sender,
like your existing app,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.780
just needs to
integrate the cast SDK

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.670
to enable discovery
of existing cast

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.750
devices on the local network.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.640
Once it finds devices
nearby, the Google Cast icon

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.100
becomes visible to
users within your app.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.430
Clicking on that icon turns the
sender into a remote control,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980
and we have a ton
of UI guidelines

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.355
about how to make
everything that

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:04.890
follows a magical and
intuitive experience.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.840
Things like selecting
your cast device,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.902
pausing and scrubbing, or just
making it look really nice.

00:02:10.902 --> 00:02:13.110
So with the small amount of
code inside your existing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.850
application, you can trigger
a receiver application

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.370
on a cast-enabled device to
extend the reach of your app

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.170
onto the big screen
to let lots of people

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.450
enjoy the capabilities
you have to offer.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020
When you kick off a receiver
application from your app,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.190
the cast device just
pulls that in from the URL

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830
hosted on a server somewhere.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.340
Pretty simple, really.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.940
But that's where
the magic happens.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.207
Since the cast device
runs by itself,

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.290
you can tell it to load
things like media streams,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.700
which load directly from the
cloud, onto the cast device,

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.840
and your sender app
does no work at all,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.670
apart from setting it all up.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670
You can also send
messages from your app

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.920
to the receiver application,
so you can control things

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.210
like playing, and pausing,
and volume, et cetera.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.650
The receiver application itself,
which shows your content,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.040
is built with web
technology, and is in fact

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.450
an HTML5 application, written
in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.050
which makes it super
simple to develop.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.349
We've also provided a bunch
of sample receiver apps,

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.890
so you can get
started without having

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.290
to write any
receiver code at all.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.800
What you make the receiver
do is totally up to you.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.660
You can send pictures
across, make it

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.720
a game score display,
or almost anything

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480
that's up to your imagination.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.400
Getting started
couldn't be easier.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.370
If you develop Android,
iOS, or even web apps,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.710
we've got you all covered
with an SDK for each platform.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.330
We have full source
code examples

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.400
of a bunch of different
sender applications,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.150
with all sorts of
functionality that you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.265
can take a look at,
cut and paste code out

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.190
of, and integrate into your
existing applications in almost

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.679
no time.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.970
We also have a bunch of
different receiver applications

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.460
that can run on your cast
device right out of box.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.320
We also have an example of a
fully customizable receiver

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.820
application.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.390
It delves into more complex
receiver capabilities,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.520
such as licensed content
serving, different video

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.870
formats, adaptive streaming,
and all that other tricky stuff.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.400
To get started, you should jump
onto our developer console,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.360
and register as a
developer, so that you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.880
can begin making your
app cast enabled.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.350
So get to it.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.900
Cast enable your app now,
and watch the magic happen

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.690
as your app becomes
the main focus

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.140
in living rooms everywhere.
