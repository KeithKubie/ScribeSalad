even zoom inside this area so you can
 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.920
even zoom inside this area so you can
select the zoom factor you want to use

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930
select the zoom factor you want to use

so what do you have to do in order to

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940
so what do you have to do in order to
 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.879
so what do you have to do in order to
support this thing well your application

are changing the density on the fly so

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:49.539
are changing the density on the fly so
 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.480
are changing the density on the fly so
instead of seeing this with a teeny tiny

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490
instead of seeing this with a teeny tiny
 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.400

changing the density what do you have to

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919
changing the density what do you have to
 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.159

to density changes so going forward you

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.010
to density changes so going forward you
 

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.770
to density changes so going forward you
should definitely check out if the

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:13.780
should definitely check out if the
 

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.750
should definitely check out if the
density of your application is changing

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:15.760

behavior for directional navigation and
as I just mentioned this is for users

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.010
as I just mentioned this is for users
 

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.430
as I just mentioned this is for users
who might be using a d-pad or trackball

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440
who might be using a d-pad or trackball
 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.880
who might be using a d-pad or trackball
and before this the system will provide

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:08.890
and before this the system will provide
 

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.400
and before this the system will provide
a best guess as to which view should

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.410
a best guess as to which view should
 

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.800
a best guess as to which view should
receive focus based on the direction of

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:13.810
receive focus based on the direction of
 

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.650
receive focus based on the direction of
the layout of the views of the screen

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660
the layout of the views of the screen
 

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.840
the layout of the views of the screen
but to specify the order we can use the

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:18.850
but to specify the order we can use the
 

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.690
but to specify the order we can use the
set focus next set next focus attribute

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:21.700
set focus next set next focus attribute
 

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.610
set focus next set next focus attribute
and specify the direction that should

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:23.620
and specify the direction that should
 

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.860
and specify the direction that should
receive focus and provide the ID of the

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:25.870
receive focus and provide the ID of the
 

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.070
receive focus and provide the ID of the
widget that should receive focus and

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.080
widget that should receive focus and
 

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.120
widget that should receive focus and
something that I want you to know is

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.130
something that I want you to know is
 

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.430
something that I want you to know is
that if you fully support directional

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440
that if you fully support directional
 

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.350
that if you fully support directional
navigation in your application it's

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360
navigation in your application it's
 

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.450
navigation in your application it's
going to make testing much easier

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.460
going to make testing much easier
 

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.220
going to make testing much easier
because it's going to give you tools

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.230
because it's going to give you tools
 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.740
because it's going to give you tools
such as the UI Automator and you will be

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:40.750
such as the UI Automator and you will be
 

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.510
such as the UI Automator and you will be
able to automate a lot of your UI

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:42.520
able to automate a lot of your UI
 

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.870
able to automate a lot of your UI
testing I also talked about linear

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880
testing I also talked about linear
 

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.000
testing I also talked about linear
navigation using the tab key for the

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.010
navigation using the tab key for the
 

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.740
navigation using the tab key for the
coin box screenreader you can also

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:49.750
coin box screenreader you can also
 

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.160
coin box screenreader you can also
specify this behavior using the set next

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:53.170
specify this behavior using the set next
 

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.160
specify this behavior using the set next
focus forward and specifying the ID of

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.170
focus forward and specifying the ID of
 

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:59.310
focus forward and specifying the ID of
the widget in a similar manner I've

00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320
the widget in a similar manner I've
 

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.080
the widget in a similar manner I've
talked a lot about using the keyboard

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.090
talked a lot about using the keyboard
 

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.990
talked a lot about using the keyboard
and we often use the keyboard as a means

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000
and we often use the keyboard as a means
 

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.530
and we often use the keyboard as a means
of convenience as well for example I'm

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:07.540
of convenience as well for example I'm
 

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.300
of convenience as well for example I'm
sure that you all use the Enter key

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.310
sure that you all use the Enter key
 

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.430
sure that you all use the Enter key
you might use the indicate to submit

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440
you might use the indicate to submit
 

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.460
you might use the indicate to submit
forms or to send messages and this is

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.470
forms or to send messages and this is
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.440
forms or to send messages and this is
much easier than clicking the submit

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.450
much easier than clicking the submit
 

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.350
much easier than clicking the submit
button or finding the correct location

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360
button or finding the correct location
 

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.560
button or finding the correct location
on the screen and accessibility users

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:22.570
on the screen and accessibility users
 

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.110
on the screen and accessibility users
also expect the same that would expect

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120
also expect the same that would expect
 

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.150
also expect the same that would expect
the enter key to be able to provide them

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160
the enter key to be able to provide them
 

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.180
the enter key to be able to provide them
with the same actions and us developers

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.190
with the same actions and us developers
 

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.760
with the same actions and us developers
you can also do this by setting a key

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:32.770
you can also do this by setting a key
 

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.500
you can also do this by setting a key
listener and I'm going to show you how

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:34.510
listener and I'm going to show you how
 

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.380
listener and I'm going to show you how
to add this behave

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.390
to add this behave
 

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.069
to add this behave
to your application you first start by

00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079
to your application you first start by
 

00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:40.780
to your application you first start by
detecting that a key was pressed down

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:40.790
detecting that a key was pressed down
 

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.410
detecting that a key was pressed down
and you do this using the action art so

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:44.420
and you do this using the action art so
 

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.850
and you do this using the action art so
this actually tells you when you've

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:45.860
this actually tells you when you've
 

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.730
this actually tells you when you've
actually released the Enter key and

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:47.740
actually released the Enter key and
 

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.860
actually released the Enter key and
since we're using action up you might

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:50.870
since we're using action up you might
 

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.900
since we're using action up you might
think well is there an action down event

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:52.910
think well is there an action down event
 

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.480
think well is there an action down event
and there is and what is the difference

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:55.490
and there is and what is the difference
 

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.730
and there is and what is the difference
between these two well

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:57.740
between these two well
 

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.009
between these two well
the accent down returns multiple times

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:00.019
the accent down returns multiple times
 

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.139
the accent down returns multiple times
and this can be used for when you're

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:02.149
and this can be used for when you're
 

00:16:02.149 --> 00:16:04.630
and this can be used for when you're
pressing the enter key for a long period

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:04.640
pressing the enter key for a long period
 

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.639
pressing the enter key for a long period
of time for example whereas the action

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:06.649
of time for example whereas the action
 

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:09.970
of time for example whereas the action
up only returns once so maybe when you

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:09.980
up only returns once so maybe when you
 

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.920
up only returns once so maybe when you
just hold the key down like in this

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:11.930
just hold the key down like in this
 

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.620
just hold the key down like in this
example once we've detected that we've

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:14.630
example once we've detected that we've
 

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.290
example once we've detected that we've
indeed press the key we can go on to

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:17.300
indeed press the key we can go on to
 

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.090
indeed press the key we can go on to
detect that it was actually the enter

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.100
detect that it was actually the enter
 

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.519
detect that it was actually the enter
key that was pressed and we can do this

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:21.529
key that was pressed and we can do this
 

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:24.220
key that was pressed and we can do this
by using the key event and specifying

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.230
by using the key event and specifying
 

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.350
by using the key event and specifying
that we want the enter key and you can

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360
that we want the enter key and you can
 

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.630
that we want the enter key and you can
change the key event the key code of the

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:28.640
change the key event the key code of the
 

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.430
change the key event the key code of the
cabin and I'll show you how to do this

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440
cabin and I'll show you how to do this
 

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.470
cabin and I'll show you how to do this
later so I've talked about using the

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480
later so I've talked about using the
 

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.569
later so I've talked about using the
keyboard and how important it is for

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:37.579
keyboard and how important it is for
 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.819
keyboard and how important it is for
Android applications to be able to be

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:39.829
Android applications to be able to be
 

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:41.800
Android applications to be able to be
accessible by the keyboard as they're

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:41.810
accessible by the keyboard as they're
 

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.340
accessible by the keyboard as they're
able to be run on Chrome OS and when

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.350
able to be run on Chrome OS and when
 

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.439
able to be run on Chrome OS and when
you're adding keyboard navigation you

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:47.449
you're adding keyboard navigation you
 

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:49.960
you're adding keyboard navigation you
should remember that users accessibility

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:49.970
should remember that users accessibility
 

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.850
should remember that users accessibility
users are going to expect comment

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:51.860
users are going to expect comment
 

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.400
users are going to expect comment
keyboard shortcuts such as undo and redo

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:54.410
keyboard shortcuts such as undo and redo
 

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.530
keyboard shortcuts such as undo and redo
to work so I'll show you what you can do

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.540
to work so I'll show you what you can do
 

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.960
to work so I'll show you what you can do
here a shortcut that you all probably

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:58.970
here a shortcut that you all probably
 

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.180
here a shortcut that you all probably
use every day I mean I know I use this

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:01.190
use every day I mean I know I use this
 

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.620
use every day I mean I know I use this
every day when I'm writing my code is

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:02.630
every day when I'm writing my code is
 

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.150
every day when I'm writing my code is
the undo action this interaction is the

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160
the undo action this interaction is the
 

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.179
the undo action this interaction is the
keyboard shortcut is control Zen and

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:09.189
keyboard shortcut is control Zen and
 

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:12.210
keyboard shortcut is control Zen and
let's take a look at how we will do this

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:12.220
let's take a look at how we will do this
 

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.130
let's take a look at how we will do this
so I just talked about how you can use

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.140
so I just talked about how you can use
 

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.829
so I just talked about how you can use
the key code and now in this example

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839
the key code and now in this example
 

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.840
the key code and now in this example
let's change the key code to be Zed

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:19.850
let's change the key code to be Zed
 

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.630
let's change the key code to be Zed
because we're looking for control Zed

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640
because we're looking for control Zed
 

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.640
because we're looking for control Zed
once we've done that the control key is

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:24.650
once we've done that the control key is
 

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.710
once we've done that the control key is
a special key and we need to do

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720
a special key and we need to do
 

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480
a special key and we need to do
something that we call a me respect

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:28.490
something that we call a me respect
 

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.600
something that we call a me respect
check and this also applies to the alt

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:31.610
check and this also applies to the alt
 

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.049
check and this also applies to the alt
and the shift keys so once we've done

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:35.059
and the shift keys so once we've done
 

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:36.820
and the shift keys so once we've done
that we'll use the house modifies

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:36.830
that we'll use the house modifies
 

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.100
that we'll use the house modifies
function which returns true once this is

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.110
function which returns true once this is
 

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.799
function which returns true once this is
pressed and so now this example gives us

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:41.809
pressed and so now this example gives us
 

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:44.770
pressed and so now this example gives us
the ability to detect the ctrl z action

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:44.780
the ability to detect the ctrl z action
 

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.650
the ability to detect the ctrl z action
you can also combine multiple has

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:47.660
you can also combine multiple has
 

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.460
you can also combine multiple has
modifiers

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.470
modifiers
 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.060
modifiers
so

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.070
so
 

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.160
so
in this example we have the control and

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.170
in this example we have the control and
 

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.710
in this example we have the control and
the shift key press down so this allows

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720
the shift key press down so this allows
 

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.830
the shift key press down so this allows
us to detect the control or dead action

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840
us to detect the control or dead action
 

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.900
us to detect the control or dead action
which you might all know as the redo

00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:58.910
which you might all know as the redo
 

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:03.370
which you might all know as the redo
action so another really important

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.380
action so another really important
 

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.640
action so another really important
concept is grouping grouping is when

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.650
concept is grouping grouping is when
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.860
concept is grouping grouping is when
related content on your application is

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:08.870
related content on your application is
 

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.960
related content on your application is
organized into groups so that

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:10.970
organized into groups so that
 

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.510
organized into groups so that
accessibility services for example a

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520
accessibility services for example a
 

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.820
accessibility services for example a
screen reader will be able to announce

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:15.830
screen reader will be able to announce
 

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.980
screen reader will be able to announce
the content in a way which would reflect

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:17.990
the content in a way which would reflect
 

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.160
the content in a way which would reflect
its natural groupings this means that

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:21.170
its natural groupings this means that
 

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.760
its natural groupings this means that
users won't need to swipe scan or wait

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:24.770
users won't need to swipe scan or wait
 

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.370
users won't need to swipe scan or wait
in order to define some other additional

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.380
in order to define some other additional
 

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.400
in order to define some other additional
information so let's think about who

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.410
information so let's think about who
 

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.190
information so let's think about who
these users might be these users might

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200
these users might be these users might
 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.890
these users might be these users might
be some blind people but my blind friend

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:35.900
be some blind people but my blind friend
 

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.050
be some blind people but my blind friend
for example or it might be those we'd

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.060
for example or it might be those we'd
 

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.960
for example or it might be those we'd
say temporal impairments like Stefan

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:40.970
say temporal impairments like Stefan
 

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.060
say temporal impairments like Stefan

application but you got to keep your
 

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.450
application but you got to keep your
eyes on the road so we can't view the

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:49.460
eyes on the road so we can't view the
 

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.210

an application so I want to show you an
 

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.510
an application so I want to show you an
example of what grouping might be like

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520
example of what grouping might be like
 

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.930
example of what grouping might be like
in an application so I have an

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:04.940
in an application so I have an
 

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.940

if we don't specify any grouping at all

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840
if we don't specify any grouping at all
 

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.960
if we don't specify any grouping at all
the screen reader might read out

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:19.970
the screen reader might read out
 

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.090
the screen reader might read out
something like this bread Oh J a dollar

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.100
something like this bread Oh J a dollar
 

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.040
something like this bread Oh J a dollar
fifty two dollars ninety nine as we've

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.050
fifty two dollars ninety nine as we've

just heard after hearing the item it

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:32.930
just heard after hearing the item it
 

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.660
just heard after hearing the item it
takes a while before we can hear the

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:34.670
takes a while before we can hear the
 

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.630
takes a while before we can hear the
price but what might a better example be

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640
price but what might a better example be
 

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.890
price but what might a better example be
a better example might be the following

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:40.900
a better example might be the following
 

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.360
a better example might be the following
bread a dollar fifty Oh J two dollars 99

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:46.370

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.330
bread a dollar fifty Oh J two dollars 99
you can immediately hear the price of

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:49.340
you can immediately hear the price of
 

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.490

announcement the same goes for AJ and
 

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.590
announcement the same goes for AJ and
this makes such a big difference for

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600
this makes such a big difference for
 

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.630
this makes such a big difference for
users who primarily rely on the screen

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640
users who primarily rely on the screen
 

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.180
users who primarily rely on the screen
reader and you can do this with the

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.190
reader and you can do this with the
 

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.960
reader and you can do this with the
power of grouping

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:02.970
power of grouping
 

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.940
power of grouping
for this you would use an android screen

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:05.950
for this you would use an android screen
 

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.430
for this you would use an android screen
reader focusable attribute and this was

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440
reader focusable attribute and this was
 

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.190
reader focusable attribute and this was
introduced in Android P and Android X

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200
introduced in Android P and Android X
 

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.769
introduced in Android P and Android X
and is preferred over the Android

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:13.779
and is preferred over the Android
 

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:15.930
and is preferred over the Android
focusable attribute which had some

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:15.940
focusable attribute which had some
 

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.810
focusable attribute which had some
unwanted effects in regards to focus and

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:18.820
unwanted effects in regards to focus and
 

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.060
unwanted effects in regards to focus and
navigation for users who primarily

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.070
navigation for users who primarily
 

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.539
navigation for users who primarily
relied on the screen reader so in the

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:24.549
relied on the screen reader so in the
 

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:26.399
relied on the screen reader so in the
previous example for my grocery store

00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:26.409
previous example for my grocery store
 

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:29.340
previous example for my grocery store
you would group the item as well as the

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:29.350
you would group the item as well as the
 

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.440
you would group the item as well as the
price into a single focusable container

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:31.450
price into a single focusable container
 

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.769
price into a single focusable container
so that the screen reader will be able

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:34.779
so that the screen reader will be able
 

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.720
so that the screen reader will be able
to present this information into a

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:36.730
to present this information into a
 

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.700
to present this information into a
single announcement and say that these

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:38.710
single announcement and say that these
 

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.360
single announcement and say that these
two items are related to each other this

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:42.370
two items are related to each other this
 

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.000
two items are related to each other this
means that users such as you such as my

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.010
means that users such as you such as my
 

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.889
means that users such as you such as my
blind friend such as my grandparents

00:20:46.889 --> 00:20:46.899
blind friend such as my grandparents
 

00:20:46.899 --> 00:20:49.049
blind friend such as my grandparents
will be able to understand that these

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:49.059
will be able to understand that these
 

00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:50.820
will be able to understand that these
views are logically related to one

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:50.830
views are logically related to one
 

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.389
views are logically related to one
another another important concept that I

00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:54.399
another another important concept that I
 

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:57.389
another another important concept that I
want to talk about is labeling so

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:57.399
want to talk about is labeling so
 

00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:59.370
want to talk about is labeling so
labeling the purpose of this is to

00:20:59.370 --> 00:20:59.380
labeling the purpose of this is to
 

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.620
labeling the purpose of this is to
explain the meaning of interactive

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:01.630
explain the meaning of interactive
 

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.289
explain the meaning of interactive
elements to users I mean I think you

00:21:04.289 --> 00:21:04.299
elements to users I mean I think you
 

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:06.480
elements to users I mean I think you
often put labels on physical items in

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.490
often put labels on physical items in
 

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.759
often put labels on physical items in
everyday life just so you get a better

00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:08.769
everyday life just so you get a better
 

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:10.980
everyday life just so you get a better
understanding of them this also makes

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:10.990
understanding of them this also makes
 

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.810
understanding of them this also makes
sense in the context of an Android

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:12.820
sense in the context of an Android
 

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.230
sense in the context of an Android
application this will by doing adding

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240
application this will by doing adding
 

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.019
application this will by doing adding
correct labels screen readers such as

00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:19.029
correct labels screen readers such as
 

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:20.850
correct labels screen readers such as
chrome box will be able to properly

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:20.860
chrome box will be able to properly
 

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.430

explain the function of the UI widgets

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440
explain the function of the UI widgets
 

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.490
explain the function of the UI widgets
in your applications to users and I also

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:26.500
in your applications to users and I also
 

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.919
in your applications to users and I also
think I can demonstrate this better with

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:28.929
think I can demonstrate this better with
 

00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:32.940
think I can demonstrate this better with
an example so I have an application here

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:32.950
an example so I have an application here
 

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.060
an example so I have an application here
which is called choices cafe this

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.070
which is called choices cafe this
 

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:39.120

form job choices cafe and let's go and
 

00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:44.600
form job choices cafe and let's go and
look at how we structured this

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:44.610
look at how we structured this
 

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.700
look at how we structured this
application so you can see that I've

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:47.710
application so you can see that I've
 

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.009
application so you can see that I've
added some image buttons as well as the

00:21:50.009 --> 00:21:50.019
added some image buttons as well as the
 

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:52.769
