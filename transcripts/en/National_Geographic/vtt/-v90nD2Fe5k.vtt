00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:03.669 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm always trying to
look for flagship species,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.506 align:start size:84% position:16%
talismans to represent
whole ecosystems.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.741 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you wanna
photograph the Arctic,

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.176
you photograph polar bears.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.578 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you wanna photograph
Africa, you photograph lions.

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.448 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well, you can have a wildlife
experience in a city,

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.918
in the urban jungle that is
just as wild, just as crazy

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.887
as anywhere else.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.356 line:0%
(applause)

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.359 line:0%
So my job is basically
to dress up like this.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.193
I guess some of you are
sitting there wondering

00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:31.230
why on earth National
Geographic has got some

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.433 line:0%
young whippersnapper who
can barely grow facial hair

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.435 line:0%
to come give you a talk.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start size:88% position:13%
And that is a perfectly
valid question.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.772
The state of my facial hair, is,

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.307
quite frankly, embarrassing.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.342
So I guess I'll start from
the beginning to kind of

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:44.910
set things into context.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.447
This is me when I was two
with my older brother Tom,

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.417
and as you can see, I wasn't
always interested in wildlife.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start size:84% position:16%
Tom is holding an
alligator in his hand

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.988
and I wasn't that fussed.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.856
My mum used to make me
and my three brothers

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.659 align:start size:84% position:16%
wear matching
outfits on days out.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.728
The outfits didn't
get much better.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.165
(audience laughs)

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.067
10 years after this
picture was taken,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.935
I was still up to no good,
the only difference was,

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.071
now I had a camera in my hand.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.674
And everyone at high school
thought I was a total freak

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:17.977
because in any moment of
spare time, I'd run down

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.014 align:start size:94% position:6%
away from class or sports
practice or whatever

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.815 align:start size:88% position:13%
to jump in the little river
that ran past my school

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.351
and take pictures of
the friendly swans

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.687
or the not so friendly pike.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:30.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now they're awesome
animals and this whole time

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.725
I was teaching myself
by trial and error

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.794
how to get close
to these animals.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.096
Once I thought I'd mastered
getting close to one animal,

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.898
I'd apply that to a new one.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.200
I was just totally obsessed.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.169
Now I got my first
break when I was 17.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:45.905
I was selected to be
part of this project,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.473
the 2020 vision project.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:50.009 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now put simply, this
project brought together

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.578 align:start size:88% position:13%
the UK's top 20
wildlife photographers,

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:54.246
and 20 young photographers.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.982 align:start position:0%
I was lucky enough 
to get selected as 
one of those young guys,

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:00.653 align:start size:94% position:6%
and our job was basically
to go around the UK

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.125
and prove that British
wildlife is not (bleep).

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.560
That was our job.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.432
Now, I thought I'd drawn
the short straw because

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
while some of my colleagues,
they were getting to

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.270
dive with seals off
the coast of Devon,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.472
this is Alex Mustard.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.240 align:start size:84% position:16%
He was actually my
mentor on the project.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.709 align:start size:97% position:3%
While Andy Rouse was getting
to sneak up on wild boar

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.244
in the forest of Dean.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.747
Pete Cairns was getting to
photograph ospreys diving

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:30.483
into the lochs of the
highlands of Scotland,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.351
while I was tasked
with urban wildlife,

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.622
so I thought I was stuck
with pigeons and rats.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.523
But I was wrong.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.359
I found out that you can
have a wildlife experience

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.695 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a city in the urban
jungle that is just as wild,

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:46.599
just as crazy as anywhere else.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.702
And I found that the closer
you look, the more you see.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.137
So everything down
to the small stuff,

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.404
this is a great tit.

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:53.373 align:start size:84% position:16%
You can see that green
thing in its mouth,

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.774
that's a caterpillar.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well in that little
hole it has three chicks

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.144
inside a nest.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.179
You know the closer you
look, the more you find.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.716 align:start position:0%
And, you know, 
I'm always trying to look 
for flagship species,

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
talismans to represent
whole ecosystems.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.888 align:start size:88% position:13%
If you wanna photograph
the Arctic, well,

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.389 size:84% position:42%
you photograph polar bears.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.825
If you wanna photograph
Africa, represent Africa,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:13.859
you photograph lions.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.261
Well in the city,

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.164 align:start size:84% position:16%
you just have to
look a little closer.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.866
If you get close enough
to the grey squirrel,

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.670 align:start size:94% position:6%
you find out its got
buckets full of charisma.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.539 align:start size:97% position:3%
But it's not just the small
stuff, it's the big stuff too.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.108
Now these are two rutting
red deer, similar to your

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:32.178
North American elk, and
every year in October

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.313
during the annual rut, they
basically fight each other

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:35.648
for breeding rights.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.483
It's this crazy, wild thing.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.286
And you might think that red
deer, you only see them fight

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
in the wildest corner of the
UK or in the wilder parts

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.557
of Europe.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:47.392
Well these two are
rutting three miles

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:50.496
from the very center of London.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.165
It's pretty crazy.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.199
So where are we?

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.001 line:0%
Okay, we're gonna zoom in.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.535 line:0%
This is London.

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:59.238
Now I was in Richmond Park
for that rutting episode

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.672
down at the bottom left.

00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:02.575 align:start size:94% position:6%
And just like I
would with a wilder place,

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.243
I built up a map of all
the different places

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.546
that I could find and
photograph wildlife,

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.948
and there's just wildlife
absolutely everywhere.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.382
It was really, really cool.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.385 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now I'm particularly
grateful for this project

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.755 align:start position:0%
because I discovered
what is now my favorite animal.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.523
The peregrine falcon.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:20.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, there's a few
reasons why peregrines

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.393
are my favorite animal.

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:23.329 align:start size:88% position:13%
Firstly, they're the
fastest animal on earth.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.830
That's pretty cool.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.835
They can dive at speeds of
up to 180 miles per hour.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:30.502
But that's nothing.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.572
What really gets
me is that they are

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:36.776 align:start size:94% position:6%
a pigeon killing machine.
(audience laughs)

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.211
it's just epic to watch.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.812 align:start size:97% position:3%
So here you can see an
adult female with a pigeon

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:43.549
that is just nailed, and the
browner bird is a juvenile.

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.284
They start off brown and then
get the adult plumage

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.186
after a year or so.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.622 align:start size:94% position:6%
Peregrines are a real
good news story in the UK,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.092
because when I was born in
1993, seeing a peregrine was

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.128
a really rare event.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.497 align:start size:94% position:6%
A fleeting glimpse at an
estuary in Devon or something

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:00.032
was about as good as it got.

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:03.636 align:start size:94% position:6%
Whereas now they're doing
really well all across the UK,

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.871
particularly in cities.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.307
Now the reason they do well
in cities is because firstly,

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.643 align:start size:84% position:16%
there's lots of food,
as you all know.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.778
Cities are packed
full of pigeons.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:15.581
So this is a female having a
stretch of her tail feathers

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:18.817
before she goes off and
smashes another pigeon.

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:20.286
Just limbering up.

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:24.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now the other reason that
they do really well in cities

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:26.558
is because the ledges and
knobbles, particularly of

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:29.128
the older buildings are
very similar to their

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.763
natural cliff homes.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:34.433
So these two chicks are
in a nest 25 stories up.

00:05:34.433 --> 00:05:36.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
A really ominous looking
concrete tower block.

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:39.238
Again, right in the
center of London.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
These aren't migrants, they're
not temporary visitors,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.875
they are resident.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.843
They are urban birds.

00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:46.712
Now Cannon saw some of the
pictures that I was taking

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:50.015
on this project and very
kindly lent me some gear,

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.085
so I was getting to play
with some big boys' toys.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:55.154
Now it's amazing the amount
of trouble you can get in

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:58.391
walking around a city
with a lens like that.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.894
I had one episode, that
wasn't my finest moment.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.396
I had this position, this
location where I'd stand

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
on a main road on the
pavement on the sidewalk

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.402
to photograph this
nest, peregrine nest.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.270 align:start size:94% position:6%
And miles in the distance,
in the background,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.972
was this huge tower block.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:14.506
It was an apartment block.

00:06:14.506 --> 00:06:18.844
And one day, this woman in
a car came screeching up,

00:06:18.844 --> 00:06:21.814
stopped next to me, got out of
her car, marched over to me,

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.782
and said, "Can you please
stop taking pictures of me

00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:26.285 align:start size:88% position:13%
"getting changed through
my bedroom window?"

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.420
(audience laughs)

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.656
Now how do you react to that?

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:33.125
Back then, I wasn't very
good at dealing with these

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:34.526
awkward situations.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:37.062
So I said, "Don't
flatter yourself."

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.899
(audience laughs)

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:46.873
Just a teenage kid trying to
photograph some peregrines,

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:48.774
leave me alone.

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:51.577 align:start position:0%
As you can imagine, that didn't
go down particularly well.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.746 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I followed one particular
pair of peregrines

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
that live in Bristol,
which is a city

00:06:55.547 --> 00:06:57.316
in the southwest of England.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.785 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I'm not normally
one to name wild animals

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:03.355
but when something
like this happens,

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:04.990
it's quite difficult not to.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.458
(audience laughs)

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
So this is the
chick on the right.

00:07:08.327 --> 00:07:10.128
The browner bird,
he's called Sam.

00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:12.398 align:start size:84% position:16%
And this is the
female on the left,

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:15.501
and you can see the female is
about a third bigger than Sam.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.870
And that's not because she's
an adult and he's a chick,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.972
it's because she's a
female and he's a male.

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:23.008
Female peregrines are about a
third bigger than the males.

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:24.242
Now things were looking
really good for Sam,

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:27.212
because his parents
were awesome hunters.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.949
They were catching pigeons
like there's no tomorrow.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:32.818
They'd bring 'em in,
he'd then wolf it down

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:35.521
and screech at them to
go and get another one.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.657
He was also exercising
and stretching his wings,

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:42.127 align:start size:94% position:6%
ready for his maiden
voyage, his first flight.

00:07:42.127 --> 00:07:44.130
His voyage into the sky.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.667 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now this is where things went
a little bit pear-shaped.

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.503
This is where the fairy
tale ends, I'm afraid.

00:07:51.503 --> 00:07:54.673
So Sam took his first flight,
he jumped off that building,

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:58.811
and some gulls saw him and
they mobbed him down into

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start size:88% position:13%
the river which ran
below the nest building.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.516
Now this was a city.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:05.784
If it had been in a normal
river in a wilder place,

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:07.586
peregrines are actually
quite good swimmers.

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:09.187
They can kinda flap their wings

00:08:09.187 --> 00:08:10.623
and get them over to the edge.

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:14.794 align:start position:0%
But this was a city so
either bank was a six foot high

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.162
vertical concrete bank, so
there was absolutely no way

00:08:17.162 --> 00:08:18.831
he was gonna get
out of the river.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.434 align:start size:94% position:6%
He'd also, being a wild
animal, chosen the one day

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:23.803
in an entire month when
I wasn't standing on the

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:27.573 align:start size:88% position:13%
main road, on the
bridge there to see him.

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.508
Fortunately though, spending
all that time on the bridge

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.510
had attracted quite
a lot of attention,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.146
particularly from two builders
who worked on a building site

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.748 align:start size:94% position:6%
next door to the nest
building, and they saw Sam

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:39.585
get mobbed down into the river
and they grabbed an umbrella

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.586
and they ran over to help.

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.988
And they climbed down
on the ladder on the

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:45.357
concrete river bank and
leaned off the ladder

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:47.692
into the river and
tried to scoop Sam up

00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:50.329
out the river with an umbrella.

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:53.765
Unfortunately, Sam was a
little bit too far away.

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:57.236
So one of the builders had
the idea of taking bricks.

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.171 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, it's a building
site, lots of bricks.

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:02.441 align:start size:88% position:13%
And they threw them over
the top of Sam's head

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.077 align:start size:94% position:6%
to create a wave, a
splash that would wash Sam

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:06.479
back towards him.

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.982
Now when they told me
this story afterwards,

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:14.620
I was like, "Guys, I don't know
if this is genius or crazy."

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.291
"You threw bricks over
a protected species."

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:22.128
But it worked, they got Sam out.

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:23.195
Yeah, but no.

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:28.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
By the time they got Sam
out, it wasn't looking good,

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:30.769 align:start size:88% position:13%
he was pretty much
dead, he wasn't moving,

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.639 align:start size:94% position:6%
and the Bristol peregrine
expert Ed Drewitt

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
was called to the scene,
and he decided the best plan

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.744
of action would be to dry
Sam off, take him home,

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.980
and see what happened.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.351 align:start position:0%
Both Ed and I thought Sam
wasn't gonna survive the night.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
But Sam is no
ordinary peregrine.

00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.420
Oh no.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.688
Oh no.

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:51.223
In the morning, he
was fighting fit.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:52.725
And we decided to release him.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.494
Now on that month I had on
that road had also attracted

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.630
attention from a
couple of lawyers.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.164 align:start size:88% position:13%
They had an office
building really close to

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:01.267 align:start size:97% position:3%
the nest building and they
said that we could release Sam

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.768
on their roof.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:06.205 align:start size:88% position:13%
So walking into an
office, lawyer's office,

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:10.209
full of suited and booted
lawyers with a bird of prey

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:13.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a towel in your hands does
get you some funny looks,

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.913
but it had to be done.

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:16.849
We got Sam up onto the roof,
and you can see that blue band

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:19.485
and the metal silver
band on his ankle.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.419
We put them on so that we
can track his movements.

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:24.690 align:start size:97% position:3%
What scientists are finding
is that these urban peregrines

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.725
aren't tied to the city.

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:28.928
The chicks disperse
all over the place.

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.362
And vice versa.

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:32.331 align:start size:97% position:3%
If a chick is born in a wilder
place like on the coast,

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.065 align:start size:81% position:19%
they can come back
into the city.

00:10:34.065 --> 00:10:35.700
Shows how adaptable they are.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.236 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not genetic, it's
a behavioral thing,

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.738 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is really
cool they can adapt.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:42.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
Three minutes later,
he took flight.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:44.175 align:start size:94% position:6%
And bearing in mind how
his first flight had gone,

00:10:44.175 --> 00:10:45.811
our hearts were in our mouths.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.346
What was gonna happen?

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.014 align:start size:94% position:6%
But he made it back to the
nest building, woo hoo.

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:51.417 align:start size:97% position:3%
And just two days after this
near drowning experience,

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:56.021 align:start position:0%
I saw him flying high
alongside here the adult female

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:57.790
who again has got a pigeon.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.159
Now this is how the adults
teach the youngsters to hunt.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.661 align:start position:0%
They'll kill or disable a pigeon
and then let the youngster

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.162 align:start size:88% position:13%
come up from underneath,
take it off of him

00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:07.766
so they can practice
flying with weight.

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:10.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
Only problem was,
Sam was just rubbish

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.104
at flying with pigeons.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:15.307
It's like, come on,
dude, up your game.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.676 align:start position:0%
Now just after I took this
picture, Sam dropped the pigeon,

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:18.677
of course he did.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:19.678
He's an idiot.

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.614
(audience laughs)

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:25.450 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now the problem with
dropping a pigeon in a city

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
is that it tends to
land on someone's head.

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:31.590 align:start size:97% position:3%
And of all the places he could
have dropped that pigeon,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.027
he dropped it in
between two tables

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:39.164
in the outside restaurant
of the Marriott Hotel.

00:11:39.164 --> 00:11:42.234 align:start size:97% position:3%
So you can imagine the look
on these people's faces

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:43.702 align:start size:94% position:6%
when they're halfway
through their main course,

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:48.039 align:start position:0%
and this blood covered beheaded
pigeon lands next to them.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:50.442
This was a really cool
wildlife experience,

00:11:50.442 --> 00:11:51.877
but the thing that
I love most about it

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.646 align:start size:88% position:13%
was how it brought
together so many people

00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:56.482 align:start size:84% position:16%
from so many
different backgrounds.

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.717
We had the builders, the
suited and booted lawyers,

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.986
and all these passers by that
would walk on this main road

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:04.790 align:start size:97% position:3%
that showed such a keen
interest in these peregrines.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.293 align:start position:0%
Perhaps most promising was that
parents who they themselves

00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:10.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
admitted to having little
interest in nature

00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:12.964 align:start size:84% position:16%
were bringing their
kids down to watch Sam

00:12:12.964 --> 00:12:15.133
and his mom and dad in action,

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:17.736
and I think that's the
power of urban wildlife.

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most of us will never
see a polar bear,

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.340
will never see a lion.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.909
Modern day society is so
disconnected from nature.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:27.846 align:start size:97% position:3%
Urban wildlife provides a
bit of a bridge to that gap,

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:30.782
so please get out and see
what wildlife you can find

00:12:30.782 --> 00:12:32.618
if you live in a city.
