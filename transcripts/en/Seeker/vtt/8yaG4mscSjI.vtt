00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.029
NASA’s Kepler space telescope found a super
Earth!

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:06.430
But don’t start planning your interstellar
vacation just yet…

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.900
Hey guys!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.809
Amy with you on DNews talking distant worlds
that might be like our own.

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.110
The big exoplanet news from NASA last week
is that the Kepler space telescope has found

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.770
the first near-Earth-size exoplanet!

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.431
Called Kepler-452b, we know this exoplanet
is 60 percent larger in diameter than the

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.740
Earth and that it orbits in the habitable
zone of a G2 star like our own sun.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.660
The habitable zone is the region where it’s
warm enough for liquid water to exist on the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.660
surface.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.140
But we don’t know the planet’s mass or
its composition, so it might be rocky like

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.380
the Earth, or it might not be.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.880
But we’re still calling it by the tantalizing
name of super Earth.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.610
Which sort of raises the larger question:
what is a super Earth, and as we keep finding

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.170
different types of exoplanets, when should
we actually be getting excited?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.340
The most commonly found exoplanet types bear
some similarity to our own giant planets,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.460
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.300
We hear a fair bit about Hot Jupiters.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.469
These are gas giants like Jupiter that orbit
their parent stars closer than Mercury orbits

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.690
our sun making them scorchingly hot.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.270
There are also gas giants found around distant
stars, Jupiter-like bodies orbiting at Jupiter-like

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.159
distances from their host stars.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.760
Another neat exoplanet type that falls roughly
under the gas giant banner is a group called

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.240
Chthonian Planets.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.049
These are former gas giants who migrated so
close to their parent stars that their atmospheres

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.680
have completely roasted away leaving behind
a rocky or metallic core possibly covered

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.750
in molten lava.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.290
Then there are the exoplanets classified as
being somewhat Earth-like, somewhat being

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.590
the most important word.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.830
The main type we hear about are Super-Earths,
which sound like bigger, better version of

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.080
the Earth, but aren’t.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.540
Super Earths have masses roughly 10 times
greater than Earth’s and are ‘potentially’

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.460
rocky planets, so really, it’s just a mass
distinction.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060
Some of these Super Earths could be gas dwarfs
or Chthonian Planets.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.350
Far more compelling are Exo Earths, planets
with a similar mass and radius to the Earth

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.230
that have an atmosphere and also orbit their
star’s habitable zone.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.680
But, this doesn’t mean they’re Earthly.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.590
Some models show both Venus and Mars living
in our Sun’s habitable zone, albeit on the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.640
fringes, and neither of those worlds are teeming
with life like Earth is.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.820
So an Exo Earth could be a distant sulfur-rich
hell world!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.890
And because so much of the search for life
on other worlds is about finding water as

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.430
a necessary ingredient for life, a very interesting
type of exoplanet is a Water World.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.560
These planets are entirely covered in water,
likely from surface ice that melted as they

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.330
drifted close to their parent stars.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.090
Unfortunately, we haven’t actually found
a true Earth orbiting another planet.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.340
Earth-like, maybe, and planets with some similarities
to Earth, yes, but we’re not moving to another

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.459
Earth anytime soon.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.420
But that doesn't mean we should stop looking!

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.340
So, knowing that these exoplanet discoveries
are more scientifically fascinating than indicative

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.000
of another world for us to live on, are you
guys still excited about exoplanets?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.650
While we’re asking space questions, should
we be mining asteroids for precious metals?

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.209
Trace talks about one asteroid in particular
that could be worth trillions
