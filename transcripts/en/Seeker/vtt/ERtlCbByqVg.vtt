00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.400
Sometimes when I'm chopping onions I just
get all…

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.450
TEARY WOW.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:16.810
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.960
When I chop onions it's a constant battle
to not feel like I just watched the 1995 classic

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.270
A Little Princess.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.390
My eyes well up with tears and it HURTS.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.390
You know?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.390
What's going on?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.390
What is this witchcraft?!

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.710
Well, to be honest, you're doing it to yourself.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.270
Your tears reacting with a chemical released
by the onion which creates an acid IN your

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.270
EYE!!

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.270
SO CRAZY.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.620
Okay, so, onions are a delicious root vegetable
member of the genus Allium, along with garlic,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.579
leeks, chives, shallots, and some 400 other
species,.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.170
When you plant something, it doesn't just
suck up water and sunlight; it also needs

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.379
nutrients from the soil.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.770
Good soil contains organic matter that the
plant can absorb like nitrogen, phosphorous,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.700
carbon, AND sulfur -- which this bulbous fleshy
vegetable tends to absorb a lot of!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.619
When you cut open an onion you're breaking
apart its cell structure allowing amino acid

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.619
sulfoxides to form sulfenic acid.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.079
It also releases the enzyme lachrymatory-factor
synthase which reacts with that sulfenic acid

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.979
to form an airborne volatile chemical called
propanethiol s-oxide.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.770
As that chemical rises into the air it eventually
meets the tears already present in your eyes.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.130
There are three types of tears, emotional
or psychic tears that we cry when we're sad;

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.859
basal tears which are constantly replenished
to keep our eyes lubricated; and reflexive

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.119
tears which flush the eye in response to an
irritant -- like ACID.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.789
Tears contain water, mucus, oil, nutrients
for eye cells, and antibacterial lysozymes.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.329
When propanethiol s-oxide hits that water,
it rearranges YET AGAIN, forming sulfuric

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810
acid -- battery acid!

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.829
IN YOUR EYES!

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.950
So, you cry when an onion is cut because enzymes
create battery acid in your eyes.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.369
Just another day for nature.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.399
The more I learn about the world, the less
I feel like I actually know about anything.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.050
I know what you're thinking, "Why don't we
just breed this nightmare ingredient out of

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.050
onions?!

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.540
We can make seedless fruit, why not tearless
onion?

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.430
Well, you can refrigerate the onion to slow
down the chemical reaction and reduce crying,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.740
but getting rid of it altogether would involve
breeding it out, and previous studies of onion

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.240
biology concluded the onion's flavor AND the
acid reaction was thought to come, in part,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.220
from the enzyme alliinase.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.969
Breed out the alliinase and the onion wouldn't
taste like… well… an onion.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.290
Then in 2002, a study in Nature found that
may not be true at all!

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.049
Instead, they believe there's a quote "yet
undiscovered enzyme," at work here.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.299
That's right.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.480
Onions are confounding science.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.629
to Maybe we could breed onions that have less
of that mystery enzyme, maintain the flavor

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:21.650
and not get red and puffy, but we 
don't 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.069
know yet.
