00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:42.434
by the dawn's early light,
what so proudly we hailed

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:48.707
at the twilight's last gleaming?

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:53.045
Whose broad stripes
and bright stars

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:57.816
through the perilous fight?

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:06.825
O'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:15.901
And the rocket's red glare,
the bombs bursting in air,

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:35.321
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:45.097
Oh, say does that star
spangled banner yet wave.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.740
O'er the land of the free.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.708

for what you have come to know
as a distinctive university.

It was at this university
you gained solid ground

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.039
in your major field of study.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:35.507
It was here that
you collaborated

00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:38.143
with people whose
backgrounds were very different

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:39.244
from your own.

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:42.581
And it was here that
you discovered new ideas

about the world and new
aspects of yourself.

no university

of knowledge in the world.

and partnerships in areas
ranging from data science,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.613
energy, the workings
of the brain,

00:10:48.613 --> 00:10:52.284
and even the science
of learning itself.

The campus footprint
is growing with plans

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:57.122
for spectacular new
spaces designed

00:10:57.122 --> 00:10:59.458
to make CMU a standard setter

solving, and innovation.

00:11:13.638 --> 00:11:17.476

and who has already
made a tremendous impact

00:11:28.253 --> 00:11:30.889
on our institution
and in our future.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:33.892

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:34.539
who joined Carnegie
Mellon University last fall

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:37.709
as Vice President for Research,

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:43.148
and since then he's been named
the University's new Provost.

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:47.485
Farnam served for many years
on the faculty of Computer,

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:50.388
Science, and Engineering at
the University of Michigan.

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:54.859
He's a very successful
entrepreneur.

00:14:54.859 --> 00:14:58.363
He also did national service
as the point person in charge

00:14:58.363 --> 00:15:00.098
of Computer and Information
Science

00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:01.766
and Engineering Directorate

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:04.602
for the National Science
Foundation prior to coming

00:15:04.602 --> 00:15:07.405
to Carnegie Mellon University.

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:12.277
Dr. Jahanian is an outstanding
addition to our leadership team.

00:15:12.277 --> 00:15:15.113
And I would like to welcome him
and look forward to continuing

00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:20.085
to work with him in his new role
as Provost effective tomorrow.

00:15:21.486 --> 00:15:27.359
[ Applause ]

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:30.428
I'm especially pleased today
to introduce a new tradition

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:33.164
into our commencement ceremonies

00:15:33.164 --> 00:15:37.535
by officially acknowledging the
many alumni of Carnegie Mellon

00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:40.505
who are here this morning.

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:41.973
Alumni may be recognized

00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:45.543
by the blue stoles
they are wearing today.

00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:52.450
Attending CMU is a tradition in
many families with grandparents,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.488
parents, and children having
all attended the University.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:16:00.191
I would like to ask all
members of such families

00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:03.461
to stand and be recognized.

00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:12.537
[ Applause ]

00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:19.010
Now, I would like to invite
all alumni who are here

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.479
to stand and be recognized.

00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:30.555
[ Applause ]

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.494
The alumni are well represented
in the University community

00:16:36.494 --> 00:16:40.598
by the Carnegie Mellon
Alumni Association Board.

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:44.069
And it is now my pleasure
to introduce the President

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:47.705
of the Board, Rebecca Allison.

00:16:47.705 --> 00:16:51.076
Becca earned two degrees
from Carnegie Mellon.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:55.880
Her bachelor of humanities
and arts degree in 1996

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.916
and her masters of
public management

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:03.555
from Heinz College
in 2001 [cheering].

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:06.991
Becca lives in Phoenix,
Arizona and has spent her career

00:17:06.991 --> 00:17:11.096
as a teacher and a university
student affairs professional.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:15.467
I would now like to invite
Becca to say a few words.

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:24.109
[ Applause ]

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.077
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:29.481
You are members of
a historic class.

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:33.952
Your Class of 2015
carries us over the mark

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:38.490
of 100,000 living
Carnegie Mellon Alumni.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:46.030
[ Applause ]

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.333
I'm so honored to be here
to represent those alumni,

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:52.971
to welcome you and congratulate
you on this exciting day.

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:57.075
I love the energy that
exists on this campus.

00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:59.744
There's almost a palpable
energy that crackles

00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:02.480
in the air at all hours.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.051
From those crisp, early fall
mornings racing across the cut

00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:13.124
for buggy practice to the balmy
early spring evenings as people

00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:16.461
and music spill out of CFA.

00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:19.197
[ Cheers ]

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:23.701
This very same energy is
buzzing in the stadium today

00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:27.238
with anticipation,
excitement, and pride.

00:18:27.238 --> 00:18:29.274
You can feel it.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:33.378
This energy is truly the
embodiment of the creativity,

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.914
innovation, and collaborative
spirit

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:39.651
that makes Carnegie
Mellon so unique.

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:43.688
In your busiest moments
when deadlines, due dates,

00:18:43.688 --> 00:18:47.458
and finals were looming,
this energy sustained you.

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:52.197
I am confident that some of
this very energy carried you

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:57.168
through long nights in the
studio, lab, or library.

00:18:57.168 --> 00:19:00.071
This intense energy
provided some warmth

00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:02.507
in this winter months
as you braced yourself

00:19:02.507 --> 00:19:05.977
against the blowing
wind to cross campus.

00:19:05.977 --> 00:19:10.615
And in quiet, calm moments,
this is the rejuvenating

00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:13.885
and refreshing energy that
told you that you were

00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:17.722
in the right place
at the right time.

00:19:17.722 --> 00:19:20.692
This is a special place
that you're leaving today.

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:24.162
Take it from me, that you
might not find this energy

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:26.130
in other places.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.565
You'll look for it.

00:19:27.565 --> 00:19:28.733
You'll seek it out.

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:31.269
But you may struggle to find it.

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:34.606
You may not realize how
much you'll long for it.

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:38.876
So, my advice to you
is harness it today.

00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:43.047
Power up. What a
great day to do that.

00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:44.882
Take it with you.

00:19:44.882 --> 00:19:48.519
To infuse your new
workplaces and communities

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:49.721
and don't be surprised

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:53.758
when others recognize
this energy spark in you.

00:19:53.758 --> 00:19:55.059
They will remark on it.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:19:59.130
And they will be drawn to
you because you play to win.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.200
Because you are the
diligent hard workers,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.204
creative problem solvers,
and transformative leaders.

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:09.007
Harness it today while
you're still here.

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.074
Take this energy.

00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:12.210
Carry it out into the world.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.313
But here's the most beautiful
thing about this energy.

00:20:15.313 --> 00:20:18.850
There's more waiting to
replenish and recharge it.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.186
More amazing students
to follow after us.

00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:25.356
And we can continue to
support them and ensure

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:27.692
that this energy can continue.

00:20:27.692 --> 00:20:29.360
We can stay connected.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.864
We can show pride and give
generously of our time

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:35.366
and our talent and our
treasure from years to come.

00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:37.802
And eventually you'll miss it.

00:20:37.802 --> 00:20:40.538
And you too will
need to tap back

00:20:40.538 --> 00:20:43.741
into the energy source
so you come back.

00:20:43.741 --> 00:20:45.710
And come back often.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.914
Every time I return to campus
I'm reenergized, rejuvenated,

00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:53.418
and reminded of why
I love this place.

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.354
And I promise this will
happen for you too.

00:20:56.354 --> 00:20:59.557
Congratulations again.

00:20:59.557 --> 00:21:05.029
[ Applause ]

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:07.031
I'd now like to introduce
Ian Glasner,

00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:09.133
President of the Student Body.

00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:12.203
Ian is graduating today with
a double major in electrical

00:21:12.203 --> 00:21:14.472
and computer engineering
and business.

00:21:14.472 --> 00:21:16.507
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:21:16.507 --> 00:21:23.014
[ Applause ]

00:21:23.014 --> 00:21:31.089
[ Silence ]

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.490
&gt;&gt; Challenge.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:38.563
If I could describe my Carnegie
Mellon experience in one word,

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:41.032
it would be challenge.

00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:44.769
When I say challenge
I'm not simply talking

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:48.139
about the first computer
engineering exam I took

00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:49.741
freshman year.

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.609
I am actually more so referring

00:21:51.609 --> 00:21:54.879
to the subsequent phone call I
had to give my mom telling her

00:21:54.879 --> 00:21:56.514
that I failed [laughter].

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:00.551
Things didn't exactly
start off as planned.

00:22:00.551 --> 00:22:03.488
At the time, it felt

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:07.759
like Carnegie Mellon had
completely knocked me over.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:11.028
But we've all learned
things here.

00:22:11.028 --> 00:22:14.365
Like that a 0% chance of
rain really means the weather

00:22:14.365 --> 00:22:17.835
forecaster is just hoping
it doesn't rain [laughter].

00:22:17.835 --> 00:22:20.538
Those days usually
end with muddy shoes

00:22:20.538 --> 00:22:22.673
and a soaking wet backpack.

00:22:22.673 --> 00:22:24.542
Or that counting on a
Pittsburg bus to show

00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:29.547
up on time is a great way to
be very, very late [laughter].

00:22:29.547 --> 00:22:32.450
By knocking us over, Carnegie
Mellon has taught us how

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.185
to get back up.

00:22:34.185 --> 00:22:38.356
And sometimes getting back up
involves drinking a Red Bull

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:42.593
or several cups of coffee in the
basement of Hunt Library alone

00:22:42.593 --> 00:22:44.529
at 2:00 a.m. on a Saturday.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:52.069
[ Cheers ]

00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:55.540
We've all been there [laughter].

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.675
We've all learned.

00:22:57.675 --> 00:23:01.479
I hope everyone brought an
umbrella today [laughter].

00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:04.515
Everyone here today has a hit
a bump in the last four years.

00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:07.185
And we've all gotten
back up after.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:12.390
CMU has been a challenge, but
Class of 2015, we made it.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.858
look around.

00:23:13.858 --> 00:23:17.929
In less than 90 minutes,
we will all be graduates

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:20.498
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:23:20.498 --> 00:23:28.139
[ Cheers ]

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:31.776
Today, I would like to
share with you the first

00:23:31.776 --> 00:23:33.945
of many incredible
achievements I hope

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:37.648
that our class will
have as alumni.

00:23:37.648 --> 00:23:39.550
The Board of Trustees
challenged our class

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.686
to make a senior gift to campus.

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:45.089
Something similar to
the Class of 1987 room

00:23:45.089 --> 00:23:46.958
in the Cohen University Center.

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.760
But it's easier said than done.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.565
Asking college students to make
a donation is a tough sell.

00:23:54.565 --> 00:23:57.702
Considering many of us
have borderline or not

00:23:57.702 --> 00:24:00.638
so borderline negative
bank accounts [laughter].

00:24:02.006 --> 00:24:05.243
The Class of 2013
gave at a rate of 6%.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:09.146
And last year's seniors
gave at a rate of 15%.

00:24:09.146 --> 00:24:13.584
Today, I'd like to announce
that more than 432 members

00:24:13.584 --> 00:24:15.753
of our class contributed.

00:24:15.753 --> 00:24:18.489
That's well over 30%.

00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:26.030
[ Applause ]

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.231
It's more than double last year,

00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:29.500
and it's an all-time
record for Carnegie Mellon.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:35.139
[ Applause ]

00:24:35.139 --> 00:24:39.043
In a few days, we will be
spread out across the country

00:24:39.043 --> 00:24:43.281
and the world just like
we were four years ago.

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:45.783
Let's not make this the
last time we are all

00:24:45.783 --> 00:24:47.885
in Pittsburg together.

00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:50.588
Five, ten, fifty
years down the road,

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:52.623
remember Carnegie
Mellon University.

00:24:52.623 --> 00:24:56.894
Remember where you learned how
to get back up and keep going.

00:24:56.894 --> 00:24:59.130
So long Class of 2015.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.199
May your futures be bright and
your hearts forever in the work

00:25:02.199 --> 00:25:04.101
that we all did here together.

00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:05.469
Thank you.

00:25:05.469 --> 00:25:14.545
[ Applause ]

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.749

00:25:18.749 --> 00:25:22.820
And to the entire Class of 2015.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.822
Congratulations, again.

00:25:24.822 --> 00:25:31.495
Your determination, your
leadership, and your passion

00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:36.334
to make a difference will
continue to set new records

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:38.769
for Carnegie Mellon
University no matter

00:25:38.769 --> 00:25:41.872
where you reside in the future.

00:25:41.872 --> 00:25:47.878
I am now pleased to introduce
another wonderful member

00:25:47.878 --> 00:25:55.519
of your class, our student
speaker, Brooke Kuei.

00:25:55.519 --> 00:26:00.992
[ Applause ]

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:03.628
She was selected to speak
today by a committee

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:07.031
of faculty, staff, and students.

00:26:07.031 --> 00:26:11.502
Brooke is graduating
with a major in physics

00:26:11.502 --> 00:26:15.006
and a minor professional
writing and intends

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:19.977
to pursue graduate study in
material science in the fall.

00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:21.479
Brooke.

00:26:36.093 --> 00:26:38.763
&gt;&gt; When I pictured this
day four years ago,

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.564
this isn't what I thought
it would look like.

00:26:40.564 --> 00:26:45.036
I thought I'd have it
all figured out by now.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:50.041
I thought I'd know exactly
who I was, where I was going,

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:52.576
what direction my life
was going to take.

00:26:52.576 --> 00:26:56.580
I thought I'd be so ready
to get out of here and dive

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.084
into a world where I make
big changes and be respected

00:27:00.084 --> 00:27:04.588
and find success
around every corner.

00:27:04.588 --> 00:27:08.526
But instead I'm scared.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.463
I'm scared to leave this
Carnegie Mellon bubble

00:27:12.463 --> 00:27:15.299
where I live with
my best friends,

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:18.002
where I know every shortcut
around campus like the back

00:27:18.002 --> 00:27:22.306
of my hand, where the baristas
at the Starbucks on Forbes

00:27:22.306 --> 00:27:27.244
and Craig scribble down my name
without even having to ask.

00:27:27.244 --> 00:27:29.647
Maybe you're like me.

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:34.618
Maybe some part of you is scared
to leave the group me chats,

00:27:34.618 --> 00:27:37.188
the annoying but familiar
beeping of the crosswalk

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:44.462
at Morewood, the tipsy journeys
down Buehler [phonetic],

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:53.137
the long lines at La Prima, the
concerts, carnival, the wine

00:27:53.137 --> 00:27:58.909
and cheese nights
with red Solo cups.

00:27:58.909 --> 00:28:02.747
I'm scared because for the past
four years my life has been

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:05.483
organized by Post
It notes and lists.

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:07.551
And I've diligently
crossed of the problem sets

00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:10.387
and essays one by one.

00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:13.624
We all complain about
how busy we were.

00:28:13.624 --> 00:28:16.060
But we all know it was
actually a competition

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.229
of who was the busiest.

00:28:19.263 --> 00:28:21.031
It wasn't easy.

00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:23.834
I changed my minor four times.

00:28:23.834 --> 00:28:26.837
I cried when I got my first C,

00:28:26.837 --> 00:28:29.540
and I learned the limits
of sleep deprivation.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.979
But we were always surrounded
by friends to talk to,

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.449
professors who inspired
us, in a community

00:28:38.449 --> 00:28:44.922
that changed us the way a writer
revises a piece with love,

00:28:44.922 --> 00:28:48.526
little by little,
until we slowly evolved

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:50.161
into different people.

00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:55.299
But now we're here.

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:58.302
Now we're gently being
nudged out of the safe

00:28:58.302 --> 00:29:02.573
and nurturing world where even
the weather was predictable.

00:29:02.573 --> 00:29:04.608
Always rain [laughter].

00:29:06.143 --> 00:29:10.648
The most frightening part about
the future is the uncertainty,

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.984
the worry that your dreams could
come crashing down on you just

00:29:13.984 --> 00:29:16.687
as easily as they
could be achieved.

00:29:16.687 --> 00:29:19.590
Whether you're starting
your first real job or going

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.760
to med school or grad school
or still trying to figure

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:29.934
out what you want, the future
may seen obscured by fog.

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.102
But the best part
about uncertainty is

00:29:32.102 --> 00:29:36.273
that it's a equivalent
to possibility.

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:40.177
I've sometimes found
myself lamenting

00:29:40.177 --> 00:29:42.913
over the things I
should have done.

00:29:42.913 --> 00:29:45.716
I should have tried out for
dancer symposium instead

00:29:45.716 --> 00:29:48.819
of chickening out
before auditions.

00:29:48.819 --> 00:29:50.721
I should have taken
more philosophy classes.

00:29:50.721 --> 00:29:54.024
I should have stayed
on the Frisbee team.

00:29:54.024 --> 00:29:57.228
I should have said I
love you more often.

00:29:57.228 --> 00:30:01.999
I should have gone out more
or gone out less [laughter].

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:04.969
Or learned how to
use that expensive

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:08.672
and hipster DSLR camera I
bought instead of relying solely

00:30:08.672 --> 00:30:12.476
on my iPhone and
Instagram filters.

00:30:12.476 --> 00:30:14.812
Should have said more to
that cute barista than,

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:18.082
"Can I have a tall
chai, please?"

00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:25.823
But what am I saying [laughter]?

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:28.192
This is just the beginning.

00:30:28.192 --> 00:30:30.761
It wasn't that long ago
when we went out to bars

00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:35.399
for the first time and got our
Viking hats from Peter's Pub.

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:39.003
We've got our entire
lives ahead of us.

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:42.373
We've got all the time in the
world to do the things we want

00:30:42.373 --> 00:30:45.476
to do, visit the
places we want to see,

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:48.112
become the people we've
always dreamed of becoming.

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:53.951
Who did you want to be
when you first got here?

00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:56.687
When I first came
to Carnegie Mellon,

00:30:56.687 --> 00:30:59.757
I wanted to be an
astrophysicist.

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:03.727
I wanted to look up at the night
sky and understand how we came

00:31:03.727 --> 00:31:06.063
to be made of stardust
on this little planet

00:31:06.063 --> 00:31:09.366
in this infinite universe.

00:31:09.366 --> 00:31:11.835
I've discovered new
interests since then.

00:31:11.835 --> 00:31:13.504
We all have.

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:17.241
But this amazement, this
wonderment of the world,

00:31:17.241 --> 00:31:21.812
this sense of unbounded
possibility is something we must

00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:25.249
seriously hold on to.

00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:27.685
Throughout college, there
were plenty of times

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.354
when the workload was too much,

00:31:30.354 --> 00:31:34.291
when the stress felt
overwhelming, when I wondered

00:31:34.291 --> 00:31:36.560
if it was time to give up.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.064
But the thing about
Carnegie Mellon is

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:44.868
that inspiration is
everywhere whether it's one

00:31:44.868 --> 00:31:47.604
of those nerdy moments when you
learn something in one class

00:31:47.604 --> 00:31:50.107
that clicks with
something from another class

00:31:50.107 --> 00:31:52.309
or the pride you feel
when you see your friends

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:56.547
on stage during Greek sing or
culture night or the excitement

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.282
of reading about one of
your professor's research

00:31:58.282 --> 00:31:59.817
in the news.

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:03.320
Something always keeps the
spark going pushing you

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.859
to keep growing oftentimes in
ways you weren't even expecting.

00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:14.131
As Carnegie Mellon students,
we're sometimes so determined

00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:17.868
and driven that when we
set goals for ourselves,

00:32:17.868 --> 00:32:21.205
it's strange to see them
change or even fail.

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:24.441
I thought I was going
to be a physicist,

00:32:24.441 --> 00:32:27.277
but now I'm becoming
an engineer.

00:32:27.277 --> 00:32:30.447
My boyfriend is graduating as
an engineer, but now he wants

00:32:30.447 --> 00:32:32.716
to be an entrepreneur.

00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:34.785
Some of you were shy
when you first got here

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:37.888
and then became organization
leaders

00:32:37.888 --> 00:32:41.592
and performers and mentors.

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:45.062
But that's why we don't
have just one school color.

00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:46.830
We're plaid.

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.000
Carnegie Mellon taught us to get

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.202
out of the little box we
might have put ourselves

00:32:52.202 --> 00:32:55.439
in to explore the possibilities,

00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:58.742
to realize how many different
roles, we have the intellect

00:32:58.742 --> 00:33:01.945
and the talent to
pursue in this world.

00:33:01.945 --> 00:33:05.516
This is how Carnegie
Mellon has made be stronger,

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:08.952
how it's made you stronger,
and what we should all take

00:33:08.952 --> 00:33:11.522
with us when we leave.

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:14.024
As we got through our
lives, let's continue

00:33:14.024 --> 00:33:18.429
to keep our eyes wide
and our minds open

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:22.533
because although there are some
of you who took a perfect path,

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.668
that's not always the only path.

00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:27.838
"Look at the moon.

00:33:27.838 --> 00:33:29.239
Isn't it beautiful?"

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:33.777
my dad asked me during one
of my uninspired slumps.

00:33:33.777 --> 00:33:38.248
"Yeah," I sniffled wondering
where he was going with this.

00:33:38.248 --> 00:33:42.686
"But it's only ever a full moon
once a month," he continued.

00:33:42.686 --> 00:33:47.891
"Most of the time it's just
a crescent or a half moon.

00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:53.564
It's almost never a full moon,
yet it's always beautiful."

00:33:53.564 --> 00:33:57.868
None of us are perfect
and few of us are sure

00:33:57.868 --> 00:34:00.671
of exactly what we want yet.

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:04.208
We all break sometimes,
but we've also all made it

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:08.912
to this day, to the brink
of the rest of our lives.

00:34:08.912 --> 00:34:12.116
And we're ready for it.

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:13.650
What we learned, enjoyed,

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.321
and discovered along this roller
coaster ride we call Carnegie

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:21.492
Mellon is how true
success, happiness,

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:24.561
and full potential are achieved.

00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:28.332
We might be going our separate
ways after we graduate,

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:31.935
but we'll never forget the
time we spent here together,

00:34:31.935 --> 00:34:35.472
growing together,
doing firsts together,

00:34:35.472 --> 00:34:38.509
becoming great people together.

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:40.511
Let's take the strength
we've gained

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:42.513
through this transformation

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:46.850
and tackle the future
in front of us.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:51.455
I want to thank my friends,
my family, and my professors

00:34:51.455 --> 00:34:54.024
for always in believing in me.

00:34:54.024 --> 00:34:57.294
Thank you for the late
night conversations,

00:34:57.294 --> 00:35:02.399
for the unwavering support,
for the life philosophies.

00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:04.201
Thank you for being the mirror

00:35:04.201 --> 00:35:07.938
that reflects a better
version of myself back at me.

00:35:07.938 --> 00:35:10.908
And on behalf of all
my fellow classmates,

00:35:10.908 --> 00:35:13.844
thank you to everyone who
has helped us become Carnegie

day four years ago,

00:35:22.319 --> 00:35:23.921
this isn't what I thought

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:28.625

But instead, I'm
even better off.

00:35:51.248 --> 00:35:55.319
Sure, I don't know
exactly who I am yet.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:59.122
But I do know that
I can be anyone.

00:35:59.122 --> 00:36:01.725
You can be anyone.

00:36:01.725 --> 00:36:08.265
So, Class of 2015, I challenge
you to embrace the uncertainty.

00:36:08.265 --> 00:36:12.269
I challenge you to find
passion, to want something,

00:36:12.269 --> 00:36:14.871
to walk to the sky for it.

00:36:15.939 --> 00:36:17.274
I challenge you to let go

00:36:17.274 --> 00:36:22.379
of the fears while
holding on to each other.

00:36:22.379 --> 00:36:26.383
Let's take the knowledge, the
strength, and the confidence

00:36:26.383 --> 00:36:27.751
that we've learned
here together,

00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:31.655
and let's go make
this world ours.

00:36:31.655 --> 00:36:33.490

00:36:48.238 --> 00:36:50.407
It was wonderful and inspiring.

00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:54.578
And now we come to
the presentation

00:36:54.578 --> 00:36:59.549
of special doctors degrees
awarded to honor individuals

00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:03.287
who have had extraordinary
impact in areas

00:37:03.287 --> 00:37:09.092
that reflect Carnegie Mellon's
strengths in the arts, sciences,

00:37:09.092 --> 00:37:12.095
scholarship, and society.

00:37:12.095 --> 00:37:17.634
Recipients of these
honorary degrees have

00:37:17.634 --> 00:37:22.172
in common a notable
record of accomplishments

00:37:22.172 --> 00:37:24.474
in their chosen fields.

00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:28.412
And they each have made,
in their own domains,

substantial contributions for
the advancement of knowledge,

and to bettering the
well being of humanity.

00:37:40.123 --> 00:37:45.662
Interim Provost Nathan Urban
will present each candidate

00:37:45.662 --> 00:37:49.833
and cite the achievements
that merit this honor.

00:37:49.833 --> 00:37:51.168
Then all candidates
will together

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:56.139
receive their degrees and
their doctoral hoods.

00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:13.390
Our thoughts go out to
Dr. Pearl and his family.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.960
Carnegie Mellon plans to
confer the degree on Dr. Pearl

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.731

It looks like you picked
a good one [laughter].

00:40:53.383 --> 00:40:56.720

[ Applause ]

00:42:01.217 --> 00:42:05.655
Carl Wieman, you shared the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001

00:42:05.655 --> 00:42:09.225
for your path breaking
work on atomic physics.

00:42:09.225 --> 00:42:12.128
But since that honor, you've
dedicated your intellect,

00:42:12.128 --> 00:42:17.133
prestige, and energy to the
cause of better teaching.

00:42:17.133 --> 00:42:21.171
You want nothing less than to
revolutionize the way science is

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:23.540
taught everywhere.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.710
Using principles of learning
science and student engagement,

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.379
you are setting a high standard

00:42:29.379 --> 00:42:31.114
for university science
instruction

00:42:31.114 --> 00:42:33.316
that is helping more
students succeed

00:42:33.316 --> 00:42:36.886
in these challenging
disciplines.

00:42:36.886 --> 00:42:38.855
You have been a special
inspiration

00:42:38.855 --> 00:42:41.091
to Carnegie Mellon's
Simon initiative

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:44.894
in technology enhanced learning,
and you are a valued member

of the Global Learning Council.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.667
For your brilliant
achievement as a physicist

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:53.269
and for your impact
as an educator,

00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:57.040

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:24.134
Alan Alda, as actor, writer,
director, and science nerd,

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:27.604
you are a CMU kind of guy.

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.205
Your portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce

00:43:29.205 --> 00:43:31.541
in the series MASH
defined an era

00:43:31.541 --> 00:43:36.513
of American television comedy.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:40.450
[ Applause ]

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.419
In your later acting
and directing career,

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:46.623
your own special brand of
dramatic genius shown through.

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:50.560
And in all your productions,
you always entertain,

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.432
sometimes provoke, and
frequently move audiences.

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.766
You love to learn new things.

00:43:56.766 --> 00:43:59.169
And your skills as a
communicator have allowed you

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:02.372
to share your enthusiasm
for science and engineering

00:44:02.372 --> 00:44:05.041
with worldwide television
audiences

00:44:05.041 --> 00:44:08.511
where you clearly convey
your own underlying wonder

00:44:08.511 --> 00:44:11.815
at the nature of
discovery itself.

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.750
For your achievement
of excellence

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.720
in these diverse fields,
Carnegie Mellon is pleased

This is what is so unique and
wonderful about Carnegie Mellon.

This eclectic group
of high achievers.

00:45:31.494 --> 00:45:36.032
[ Applause ]

00:45:36.032 --> 00:45:37.433
Thank you.

00:45:37.433 --> 00:45:38.668
It is now my great honor

00:45:38.668 --> 00:45:43.039
to introduce our
commencement speaker today.

00:45:43.039 --> 00:45:46.876
Although I was a fan of Alan
Alda the actor for a very,

00:45:46.876 --> 00:45:51.447
very long time, I had the
pleasure of having a meeting

00:45:51.447 --> 00:45:54.317
with him as a science
communicator just a few years

00:45:54.317 --> 00:46:00.590
ago in Washington where
we hit it off right away.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:06.996
Alan's quick wit, his deep
curiosity about science,

00:46:06.996 --> 00:46:10.700
and his engaging energy
came through to everyone

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.169
who met him that day with me.

00:46:13.169 --> 00:46:16.973
If any one embodies Carnegie
Mellon's blending of the arts

00:46:16.973 --> 00:46:21.945
and sciences, it is
surely Alan Alda.

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.747
And I'm delighted to
welcome him to the lectern

00:46:24.747 --> 00:46:27.050
as our keynote speaker today.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.484
Alan?

00:46:28.484 --> 00:46:37.560
[ Applause ]

00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:41.130
&gt;&gt; All around the country
today, distinguished men

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.934
and women are looking
at graduates like you

00:46:44.934 --> 00:46:47.604
from the heights
of our achievements

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:54.310
and spraying advice
at you [laughter].

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:58.514
It's an indignity you have

00:46:58.514 --> 00:47:01.517
to suffer before they lift
the latch and release you

00:47:01.517 --> 00:47:03.353
into the wild [laughter].

00:47:05.054 --> 00:47:06.990
In settings like this today,
you're going to hear all

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.960
over the country many
of the same themes.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.162
Be true to yourself.

00:47:13.162 --> 00:47:15.765
Follow your passion.

00:47:15.765 --> 00:47:17.100
You are the future.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:22.205
Don't make a mess of the world
the way we did [laughter].

00:47:22.205 --> 00:47:26.542
I know these words because I've
said many of them myself often.

00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:27.744
And they're good ideas.

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:30.613
The only thing is they're
a little vague I think.

00:47:30.613 --> 00:47:34.617
And every time I am tempted
to make a speech like that,

00:47:34.617 --> 00:47:38.154
I wish instead I could just
give you a few good tips

00:47:38.154 --> 00:47:40.323
on how just to get through life.

00:47:40.323 --> 00:47:46.062
Like the Admiral last year who
gave one of these speeches.

00:47:46.062 --> 00:47:51.567
His advice was so
concrete, so simple.

00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:55.338
He said, "If you want
to change the world,

00:47:55.338 --> 00:47:58.808
make your bed every day."

00:47:58.808 --> 00:47:59.642
Isn't that wonderful [laughter]?

00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:03.980
I love that.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.451
I mean it's just,
it's utter simplicity.

00:48:08.451 --> 00:48:11.421
I mean if you could start off
a day with a little discipline

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:13.589
like that, there's no telling
what you can accomplish

00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:15.858
when the hard stuff
comes your way.

00:48:15.858 --> 00:48:18.895
The problem is, I can't really
give you that advice myself

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:21.164
because I don't make my
bed every day [laughter].

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:25.635
I do. I unscramble the covers.

00:48:25.635 --> 00:48:28.738
And I pull them up to the
pillow so it looks sort of neat.

00:48:28.738 --> 00:48:32.108
But I don't make it,
you know, all so tight

00:48:32.108 --> 00:48:33.409
that you could bounce a quarter

00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:39.182
on it the way the
Admiral does [laughter].

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:41.117
I'm looking at your faces.

00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:43.219
You're thinking, "Why are they
having this guy up here talking

00:48:43.219 --> 00:48:44.487
about making his bed?"

00:48:44.487 --> 00:48:48.024
[ Laughter ]

00:48:48.024 --> 00:48:51.127
There's actually a reason
for why I'm saying this.

00:48:51.127 --> 00:48:53.763
I think it's important
as you leave here today,

00:48:53.763 --> 00:48:58.401
if you haven't already done
it, to start paying attention

00:48:58.401 --> 00:49:01.637
to how your own particular
brain works.

00:49:01.637 --> 00:49:07.410
You know, the Admiral likes
a hard discipline approach.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.911
The experience of being tough.

00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:10.113
He likes that.

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:13.383
And I'm sure a lot of you
benefit from that too.

00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:15.918
But I'm a little more flexible.

00:49:15.918 --> 00:49:21.257
I pull the covers up just
enough so the next time I look

00:49:21.257 --> 00:49:24.327
at them it'll be a
little gift to myself,

00:49:24.327 --> 00:49:25.862
and I'll get a little jolt

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:28.064
of some happiness
hormones when I look at it.

00:49:28.064 --> 00:49:29.464
And that's good for me.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.960
That's the way I like it.

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:33.169
The point is that there
is no good or bad way

00:49:33.169 --> 00:49:35.471
to start the day I don't think.

00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:40.343
But I think you can learn to get
the most out of your particular,

00:49:40.343 --> 00:49:44.414
your own brain if you pay
attention to how it works.

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:46.916
I used to push my brain.

00:49:46.916 --> 00:49:50.720
You know, sort of like the way a
jockey would whip a horse trying

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.556
to make it run faster
than it can run.

00:49:53.556 --> 00:49:58.027
But now I'm more tolerant
of the way my brain works.

00:49:58.027 --> 00:50:00.029
I'm easier on it.

00:50:00.029 --> 00:50:03.132
I get it pointed in
a certain direction.

00:50:03.132 --> 00:50:05.701
And it works in the
background in its own time

00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:08.738
and when it's ready to come up
with the goods, it lets me know.

00:50:08.738 --> 00:50:12.375
But the thing is, it takes time.

00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:14.777
You know, I bring this
up because if I'm going

00:50:14.777 --> 00:50:19.816
to pass anything on to you
today, it has to be real to me.

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.452
For instance, my grandson
Scott is graduating today,

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:23.519
and that's very real.

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:30.159
[ Cheers ]

00:50:30.159 --> 00:50:31.427
That's real to me.

00:50:31.427 --> 00:50:36.866
And so is the fact that
he'll be entering my field.

00:50:36.866 --> 00:50:40.703
He's going to be facing
a lot of uncertainty.

00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:43.473
But, you know, uncertainty
is not always a bad thing.

00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:46.476
In fact, I kind of
welcome uncertainty.

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:51.781
I think instead of resisting
it, you can surf uncertainty.

00:50:51.781 --> 00:50:52.849
You know, keep your balance.

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:55.384
Stay agile.

00:50:55.384 --> 00:50:58.988
Expect the unexpected bumps.

00:50:58.988 --> 00:51:01.257
It's harder to do
when uncertainty comes

00:51:01.257 --> 00:51:02.625
at you like a tsunami.

00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:05.862
But it's a good principle
to live by.

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:08.698
The thing is, it's not just
Scott who is going to be going

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:12.568
out facing uncertainty
in his chosen field.

00:51:12.568 --> 00:51:16.239
Every one of you here today
is going to face uncertainty.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:19.709
It's going to hit you.

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:21.077
You'll face it no
matter what you do.

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:25.982
And sometimes it will make
you rethink what you're doing.

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:29.185
And here's an interesting thing.

00:51:29.185 --> 00:51:31.554
Uncertainty usually
comes from the outside.

00:51:31.554 --> 00:51:35.191
But sometimes it can
come from your own heart.

00:51:35.191 --> 00:51:37.360
If you suddenly are
up against a situation

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.562
where you remember what
your own principles are,

00:51:39.562 --> 00:51:44.500
what your values are, sometimes
the choice can be difficult.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.903
I'll give you an example.

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:49.539
My wife just wrote a book
about people who were brought

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:51.240
up in the Bronx [cheer].

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.576
The Bronx, right.

00:51:53.576 --> 00:51:54.977
Good. Very good [laughter].

00:51:54.977 --> 00:51:57.580
Excellent.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.347
Read the book.

00:51:58.347 --> 00:52:01.984
You'll love it [laughter].

00:52:01.984 --> 00:52:05.755
So, I met one of the people in
the book that she interviewed.

00:52:05.755 --> 00:52:10.726
And he told me such an
interesting, powerful story

00:52:10.726 --> 00:52:14.130
about this thing I was just
talking about knowing you values

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.298
and coming up against them,

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.567
coming up against
something in your own heart.

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.735
He came from a working
class family.

00:52:19.735 --> 00:52:23.739
And his father had lived
through the Depression.

00:52:23.739 --> 00:52:27.843
And his father told him
constantly, "Be a plumber.

00:52:27.843 --> 00:52:30.446
People will always
need plumbing."

00:52:30.446 --> 00:52:35.284
But this was a very smart kid,
and he went to medical school.

00:52:35.284 --> 00:52:39.922
And he was so smart that as a
young man, he invented a device

00:52:39.922 --> 00:52:42.959
that would save lives.

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:46.295
And a medical company offered
him hundreds of millions

00:52:46.295 --> 00:52:50.433
of dollars for the
patent to the device.

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:53.169
The only thing was,
they were going,

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.172
for some reason they were going
to hold it back from putting it

00:52:56.172 --> 00:53:02.144
on the market for a whole year
before they started selling it.

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:06.849
Now, that meant that he
could either release it

00:53:06.849 --> 00:53:10.553
to the public right away
and start saving lives

00:53:10.553 --> 00:53:13.889
or he could take the hundreds
of millions and wait a year.

00:53:13.889 --> 00:53:16.859
And his father, who had
lived through the Depression

00:53:16.859 --> 00:53:21.130
and kept telling
him be a plumber,

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.366
his father said, "Don't do it.

00:53:23.366 --> 00:53:26.202
Don't take the money."

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.504
He said, "Think of all
the people, the mothers

00:53:28.504 --> 00:53:30.373
and children you will die during

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:33.709
that year while this company is
waiting to put it on the market.

00:53:33.709 --> 00:53:37.146
Put it out there now."

00:53:37.146 --> 00:53:39.815
And then every night
when he went to bed,

00:53:39.815 --> 00:53:42.385
the father would say to him,
"When you wake up tomorrow

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:45.121
and you look in the mirror to
shave, don't look at yourself.

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.522
Don't think about
your own image.

00:53:46.522 --> 00:53:49.892
Think about those mothers and
children who are going to die

00:53:49.892 --> 00:53:52.128
if you wait for a year.

00:53:53.062 --> 00:53:54.397
So, what do you think?

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:58.167
Did he take the money or did
he put it out on the market?

00:53:58.167 --> 00:53:59.869
He had to make a decision.

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.771
It was a very tough decision.

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:05.207
Sometimes you have to
make really tough ones.

00:54:05.207 --> 00:54:09.578
And they come at you
unexpectedly like that.

00:54:09.578 --> 00:54:12.415
But you can certainly
surf uncertainty better.

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:15.251
You can find your balance better
if you know how to respond

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.520
to your own principles.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.990
So, I'll tell you - I'll
tell you what he did.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.293
He didn't take the money.

00:54:24.293 --> 00:54:27.830
And decades later when he told
me the story he was really happy

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:31.867
about it because he did
what he thought was right.

00:54:31.867 --> 00:54:36.138
It makes him feel
good to know that.

00:54:36.138 --> 00:54:37.173
But here's the thing.

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.175
That was many years ago.

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:43.045
In those days we had time
to think things through.

00:54:43.045 --> 00:54:47.083
We had time to consider
these things.

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:50.686
You don't have that
luxury so much anymore.

00:54:50.686 --> 00:54:54.256
All of the sudden now things
are going really fast.

00:54:54.256 --> 00:54:59.762
Let me give you an example
of how fast things are going.

00:54:59.762 --> 00:55:01.697
I love this example.

00:55:01.697 --> 00:55:07.203
A few years ago the Internet
was flooded with copies

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:13.142
of a graduation speech that
Kurt Vonnegut had given at MIT.

00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:14.577
It spread across the country.

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:16.746
It spread all over the
Internet, all over the world.

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:20.116
And it did that in
just a few hours.

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.016
That's how fast it was.

00:55:21.016 --> 00:55:23.753
I was quoted everywhere.

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:26.622
And I'd like to read
some of it to you.

00:55:26.622 --> 00:55:29.358
I love it because it
gives very simple advice.

00:55:29.358 --> 00:55:33.262
Clear cut, every day, how
to live your life advice.

00:55:33.262 --> 00:55:38.467
He said, "Here's a few words
for the graduating class.

00:55:38.467 --> 00:55:40.536
Wear sunscreen.

00:55:41.737 --> 00:55:44.073
If I could offer you only
one tip for the future,

00:55:44.073 --> 00:55:47.209
sunscreen would be it.

00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:50.579
The long-term benefits of
sunscreen have been proven

00:55:50.579 --> 00:55:55.351
by scientists, whereas the
rest of my advice has no basis,

00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:59.722
more reliable than my
own meandering thoughts.

00:55:59.722 --> 00:56:03.092
I will dispense this advice now.

00:56:03.092 --> 00:56:06.762
Enjoy the power and
beauty of your youth.

00:56:06.762 --> 00:56:07.863
Oh, never mind.

00:56:07.863 --> 00:56:09.598
You will not understand
the power and beauty

00:56:09.598 --> 00:56:12.535
of your youth until
they've faded.

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:16.205
But trust me, in 20 years you'll
look back at photos of yourself

00:56:16.205 --> 00:56:20.943
and recall in a way you can't
grasp now how much possibility

00:56:20.943 --> 00:56:24.313
lay before you and how
fabulous you really looked.

00:56:24.313 --> 00:56:30.319
You are not as fat
as you imagined.

00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:34.623
Sing. Don't be reckless
with other people's hearts.

00:56:34.623 --> 00:56:38.127
Don't put up with people
who are reckless with yours.

00:56:38.127 --> 00:56:43.699
Floss. Remember compliments
you receive.

00:56:43.699 --> 00:56:45.935
Forget the insults.

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:49.638
If you succeed in doing
this, show me how.

00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:54.210
Stretch. Get plenty of calcium.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.378
Be kind to your knees.

00:56:56.378 --> 00:56:59.548
You'll miss them
when they're gone.

00:56:59.548 --> 00:57:00.850
Get to know your parents.

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.320
You never know when
they'll be gone for good.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.589
Be nice to your siblings.

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:10.092
They're your best link to your
past and the people most likely

00:57:10.092 --> 00:57:12.194
to stick with you in the future.

00:57:12.194 --> 00:57:16.899
Don't expect anyone
else to support you.

00:57:16.899 --> 00:57:19.468
Maybe you have a trust fund.

00:57:19.468 --> 00:57:22.738
Maybe you'll have
a wealthy spouse.

00:57:22.738 --> 00:57:26.809
But you never know when either
one might run out [laughter].

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:32.681
Be careful whose advice you buy.

00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:35.651
Advice is a form of nostalgia.

00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:38.053
Dispensing it is a way
of fishing the past

00:57:38.053 --> 00:57:40.122
from the disposal,
wiping it off,

00:57:40.122 --> 00:57:42.691
painting over the ugly
parts, and recycling it

00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:45.327
for more than its worth.

00:57:45.327 --> 00:57:48.264
But trust me on the sunscreen."

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:51.433
Now, the thing about
this charming piece

00:57:51.433 --> 00:57:56.705
by Kurt Vonnegut is that it
wasn't written by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:57:56.705 --> 00:57:59.808
It was written by a
newspaper columnist

00:57:59.808 --> 00:58:03.078
in Chicago called Mary Schmich.

00:58:03.078 --> 00:58:05.447
Some unknown person
had posted it

00:58:05.447 --> 00:58:09.051
on the Internet saying it
was written by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:58:09.051 --> 00:58:12.755
And it spread all
around the world in hours

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:19.228
with his name attached to it.

00:58:19.228 --> 00:58:23.632
Schmich said it went to Italy
and France to Israel and Brazil,

00:58:23.632 --> 00:58:27.303
to places I didn't
know had electricity.

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:29.204
And she said even
Mr. Vonnegut's wife,

00:58:29.204 --> 00:58:31.640
the photographer Jill
Krementz received it,

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.677
emailed it to several friends,
and then asked her husband,

00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:36.512
"Why didn't you tell me you
spoke at MIT [laughter]?"

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:39.982
And he said, "Because I didn't."

00:58:39.982 --> 00:58:44.653
Somebody said it was the
most widely distributed piece

00:58:44.653 --> 00:58:47.423
of email in the history
of the Internet.

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:50.559
But after only a few
hours of bouncing

00:58:50.559 --> 00:58:53.128
around the world it was
identified as a hoax.

00:58:53.128 --> 00:58:59.134
And in a flash, the Internet
was flooded with retractions.

00:58:59.134 --> 00:59:03.806
By the end of one
extraordinary day, vast numbers

00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:08.444
of people had accepted and
then rejected a worldwide hoax.

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:13.148
And that's what makes this
Internet event a great image

00:59:13.148 --> 00:59:16.251
for the age we live in now.

00:59:16.251 --> 00:59:18.954
There were probably
just as many lies going

00:59:18.954 --> 00:59:21.490
around now as there ever were.

00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:24.360
But these days they're
traveling at the speed of light.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.997
And with the help of an engine
for repetition that works

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:35.904
on a scale unheard of in
human history, the lies stick.

00:59:35.904 --> 00:59:37.239
People are still sending

00:59:37.239 --> 00:59:41.243
around that talk saying it
was written by Kurt Vonnegut.

00:59:41.243 --> 00:59:42.111
All right.

00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:43.379
So, big deal you
may be thinking.

00:59:43.379 --> 00:59:46.448
You may be thinking it's
just a few jokes about youth

00:59:46.448 --> 00:59:49.318
and beauty and trivial things.

00:59:49.318 --> 00:59:51.420
But think about it.

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:54.123
It could be selling
you anything.

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:57.259
It could be a cult religion that
could separate you from friends

00:59:57.259 --> 01:00:01.430
and family or a quack medicine
that could leave you paralyzed

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:05.300
or bogus political information
that could decide and election.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.671
Being able to know what's true

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:13.442
and what's a lie is a
lot harder to do now.

01:00:13.442 --> 01:00:16.211
Harder than every before.

01:00:16.211 --> 01:00:18.947
And so now more than
ever you need the wisdom

01:00:18.947 --> 01:00:22.851
of a trusted partner or
a friend or a mentor,

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:26.055
somebody who can remind
you of what counts.

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:30.392
Now, more than ever, I think
you need to know who you are

01:00:30.392 --> 01:00:31.493
and what you believe in.

01:00:31.493 --> 01:00:35.597
And who you are is a
tough one because most

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:38.067
of us have many people
inside us.

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:43.572
But in your finer moments,
you aspire to things

01:00:43.572 --> 01:00:47.142
that make sense even
while you're enjoying a

01:00:47.142 --> 01:00:48.510
momentary distraction.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.046
You know that down the road
something is going to come along

01:00:51.046 --> 01:00:54.883
that is going to require skill,
ability, and you're going

01:00:54.883 --> 01:00:57.152
to know you can't wing it.

01:00:57.152 --> 01:01:00.222
So, you're going to
be prepared for it.

01:01:00.222 --> 01:01:02.925
You're going to know that one
of the deepest pleasures comes

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:07.229
from knowing how to do
something that's hard well.

01:01:07.229 --> 01:01:10.099
And you'll be prepared.

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:14.036
You'll take the time that
it takes to learn it.

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:17.539
And we have a challenge
about time now.

01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:21.210
So, let yourself be all
the yous that you are,

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.712
but don't let them
crowd out the smart one.

01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:31.253
And as for what you believe
in, values are really not

01:01:31.253 --> 01:01:35.190
so much what you
say is what you do.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.792
The more you bring
those two things

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:39.328
into line the easier it'll
be to get where you're going.

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:42.097
You know, you may say you
want to go to Chicago.

01:01:42.097 --> 01:01:43.365
But it's going to
be hard to get there

01:01:43.365 --> 01:01:45.968
if you keep buying
tickets to Las Vegas.

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:52.908
I think we don't realize
how important time is.

01:01:52.908 --> 01:01:54.977
When we couldn't communicate
at the speed of light,

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:57.379
we didn't think about
it that much.

01:01:57.379 --> 01:02:00.449
But things do take time
like the time it takes

01:02:00.449 --> 01:02:02.951
for your brain to
work on a problem.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:06.522
And chemical reactions
take time.

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:09.491
Mourning a loss takes time.

01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:14.229
In fact, all the transitions
of our life take time.

01:02:14.229 --> 01:02:17.466
Getting your brain or your
body in shape takes more

01:02:17.466 --> 01:02:21.170
than a weekend no matter what
they tell you in the brochure.

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:25.140
It takes time for a
species to adapt to changes

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.976
in the environment that we
cause which makes us one

01:02:27.976 --> 01:02:30.846
of the most dangerous
species that's ever lived.

01:02:30.846 --> 01:02:36.218
We can make changes in
the environment so rapid

01:02:36.218 --> 01:02:40.556
that nature doesn't have time to
replenish species that can live

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:43.559
in that changed environment.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.828
And I don't want to kid you

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.529
into thinking I've got
this all worked out,

01:02:47.529 --> 01:02:48.497
that I know how to do it.

01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:50.465
I'm still working on it myself.

01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:52.267
But this is what I aspire to.

01:02:52.267 --> 01:02:56.238
So, this is real to me, and
I'm passing it on to you.

01:02:56.238 --> 01:03:00.943
So, as you make the transition
from this page in your life

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:08.283
to the next chapter, I wish all
of you what I wish for Scott.

01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:16.925
I wish you health, happiness,
resilience, love, laughter,

01:03:16.925 --> 01:03:25.934
patience, cash [laughter],
strength, plenty of time,

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:29.805
and a friendly relationship
with your own brain.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:34.877
And if all else fails, floss and
wear your sunscreen [laughter].

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.511
Thank you and good luck.

01:03:36.511 --> 01:03:45.587

&gt;&gt; Thank you, Alan, for

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:58.533
You've inspired and
enlightened us all.

01:03:58.533 --> 01:04:03.639
At this point, I'm very pleased
to recognize our faculty.

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:09.978

and years of service
to the University.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:33.021
[ Applause ]

01:06:33.021 --> 01:06:35.023

to stand and be recognized
in turn

01:06:46.968 --> 01:06:49.137
as you are introduced
by your Dean.

01:06:49.137 --> 01:06:51.506
When all schools and

01:06:51.506 --> 01:06:54.476
the President will ask
students to stand again,

01:06:54.476 --> 01:06:59.181

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.515
Got that [laughter]?

01:07:00.515 --> 01:07:04.820
OK. OK. The commencement program
gives each students degree

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.456
in areas of study, which will
be called out and celebrated

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.192
at the department

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.794
I encourage families
and friends to look

01:07:12.794 --> 01:07:15.564
and listen beyond just
your own graduate's listing

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:18.600
to get a sense of the unique,
educational environment

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.070
at Carnegie Mellon and also
to appreciate the many areas

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:25.607
of interest and expertise
in this graduating class.

01:07:25.607 --> 01:07:28.510
I want to begin by
acknowledging the achievements

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.414
of this year's group of
doctor degree candidates.

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.983
These outstanding scholars
received their academic hoods

01:07:34.983 --> 01:07:37.652
at a special ceremony
last night.

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:40.021
In earning their doctorates,
they have made a commitment

01:07:40.021 --> 01:07:43.658
to a life of scholarly pursuits
and reaffirmed the importance

01:07:43.658 --> 01:07:46.094
and prominence of
Carnegie Mellon as one

01:07:46.094 --> 01:07:50.031
of the nation's premiere
research universities.

01:07:50.031 --> 01:07:52.100
I would invite the
doctor degree candidates

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.503
to please rise and
be recognized.

Mr. Provost, on the
recommendation

01:12:55.036 --> 01:12:58.039
of our distinguished faculty,

01:13:22.497 --> 01:13:26.501
[ Cheers ]

01:13:26.501 --> 01:13:28.670
Dean Moore returned to
Carnegie Mellon this year

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.672
to lead the School
of Computer Science

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:33.675
after a successful tenure at
Google's Pittsburg office.

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.510
We are delighted
to welcome him back

01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:37.879
to welcome him back
to CMU as a dean.

01:13:37.879 --> 01:13:40.315
&gt;&gt; Will all the candidates
from the School

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:43.518
of Computer Science please rise.

01:13:43.518 --> 01:13:52.594
[ Applause ]

01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:59.734
Mr. Provost, upon
the recommendation

01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:03.104
of the distinguished faculty of
the School of Computer Science,

01:14:03.104 --> 01:14:08.610
I would ask for conference of
the degrees for the masters,

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:12.480
bachelors, and doctoral
candidates.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.020
[ Applause ]

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.522
Will the graduates of the School

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:25.126
of Computer Science
please sit down.

01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:27.395
&gt;&gt; I now call on the
Dean of the Tepper School

01:14:27.395 --> 01:14:30.498
of Business Robert Dammon.

01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:36.037
[ Cheers ]

01:14:36.037 --> 01:14:37.772
&gt;&gt; Will all the candidates
from the Tepper School

01:14:37.772 --> 01:14:39.507
of Business please rise.

01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:44.512
[ Cheers ]

01:14:44.512 --> 01:14:47.782
Mr. President, upon
the recommendation

01:14:47.782 --> 01:14:50.418
of our distinguished
faculty, I have the honor

01:14:50.418 --> 01:14:53.321
of presenting the
bachelors, masters,

01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:57.525
and doctoral degree candidates
from Tepper School of Business.

01:14:57.525 --> 01:15:04.999
[ Applause ]

01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:11.472
Will the new Tepper School
graduates please be seated.

01:15:11.472 --> 01:15:14.242
&gt;&gt; Carnegie Mellon is
justifiable well known

01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:15.343
for its success

01:15:15.343 --> 01:15:18.313
in interdisciplinary
research and education.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:21.649
This has given rise to several
University-wide intercollege

01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:24.052
and joint degree programs.

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:26.421
I'd now like to present
the candidates for degrees

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.923
from these special programs.

01:15:28.923 --> 01:15:32.093
Will all of the bachelors,
masters, and doctoral candidates

01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:36.497
in the interdisciplinary
programs please rise.

01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:43.271
[ Applause ]

01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:48.076
Mr. President, upon
recommendation of our faculty,

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:50.244
I have the honor of
presenting these candidates

01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:52.180
from our University-wide
intercollege

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.516
and joint degree programs.

01:15:55.516 --> 01:16:04.325
[ Applause ]

01:16:04.325 --> 01:16:06.661
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Nathan.

01:16:06.661 --> 01:16:10.398
By virtue of the authority
granted to me by the Board

01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:14.936
of Trustees, I hereby confer
these degrees upon these

01:16:14.936 --> 01:16:21.275
candidates with all the
rights, honors, privileges,

01:16:21.275 --> 01:16:24.979
and responsibilities
pertaining thereto.

01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:28.383
I'm pleased to join the
deans and the faculty

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:32.186
of the entire University
in congratulating you.

01:16:32.186 --> 01:16:34.489
Congratulations.

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:43.564
[ Applause ]

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:52.774
I will now officially welcome
you as the newest of more

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:57.812
than 100,000 global alumni of
Carnegie Mellon University.

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:07.055
[ Applause ]

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:09.891
You have much to be proud of.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:16.497
Today is as much about looking
ahead as it is looking back.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:19.333
As you anticipate
your next endeavor,

01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:26.774
I would like to encourage you to
do so confident in the knowledge

01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:31.813
that CMU has equipped you
for whatever comes next.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:36.417
And in ways that are
totally unpredictable today

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:39.987
that you might not
even recognize.

01:17:41.222 --> 01:17:44.192
You already know that
you've been deeply educated

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:47.628
in your major field of study.

01:17:47.628 --> 01:17:51.599
Employers around the
world tell us consistently

01:17:51.599 --> 01:17:56.237
that CMU graduates are
exceptionally well prepared

01:17:56.237 --> 01:17:59.640
to contribute to their
organizations from Day 1.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.113
You know how to conceptualize
a complex problem,

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:08.082
frame a novel interpretation,

01:18:08.082 --> 01:18:11.753
how extraordinary
artistic talent,

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:16.224
and work effectively on a team.

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.893
The content knowledge you
acquired here will almost

01:18:18.893 --> 01:18:21.929
certainly require renewal.

01:18:21.929 --> 01:18:26.434
But the conceptual foundations
you have established will allow

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:30.772
you to continue to learn over
the course of your lives.

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:35.309
But I want to suggest that you
have also been learning other

01:18:35.309 --> 01:18:41.315
lessons both inside and
outside the formal curriculum.

01:18:41.315 --> 01:18:44.919
You've been immersed in
an environment that drives

01:18:44.919 --> 01:18:48.523
on innovation, collaboration,
collegiality,

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.725
and a creative response
to the unexpected.

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:55.696
You learn to invent new
things, to work with others

01:18:55.696 --> 01:19:00.368
on a club activity, a buggy
team on a community project.

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:03.004
You learn to communicate
with people who are different

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:06.107
in background and
style of working.

01:19:06.107 --> 01:19:11.379
These are critical skills
for the future and the world

01:19:11.379 --> 01:19:15.950
where the momentum of
innovation will only accelerate.

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:19.821
None of us can predict how
these threads will intertwine

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:22.323
through our lives.

01:19:22.323 --> 01:19:26.694
Small moments can circle
back in our lives in ways

01:19:26.694 --> 01:19:29.530
that are totally unforeseen.

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:33.968
You cannot imagine them today.

01:19:33.968 --> 01:19:36.404
Let me give you a few examples.

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:45.479
On the 24th of August, 1977,
I took my maiden flight,

01:19:46.814 --> 01:19:52.320
traveled over several thousand
miles and landed in Ames,

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.190
Iowa for a graduate study
in mechanical engineering

01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:58.292
at Iowa State University.

01:19:58.292 --> 01:20:02.663
A step that will
permanently force me to speak

01:20:02.663 --> 01:20:04.899
with an Iowa accent [laughter].

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:10.571
I turned on my, within a few
days of arriving I turned

01:20:10.571 --> 01:20:13.507
on my first American TV.

01:20:13.507 --> 01:20:16.544
Most of you will not
know what it was like.

01:20:16.544 --> 01:20:21.549
Small, vacuum tube,
black and white.

01:20:21.549 --> 01:20:23.784
And what was on?

01:20:23.784 --> 01:20:27.054
The very first image I saw

01:20:27.054 --> 01:20:33.828
on my first American television
was the image of Hawkeye Pierce

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:41.302
from the sitcom MASH
starring Alan Alda.

01:20:41.302 --> 01:20:48.075
At that moment, I would
never, ever have believed

01:20:48.075 --> 01:20:51.779
that I would meet this
world famous actor

01:20:51.779 --> 01:20:55.049
or have the opportunity to
discuss science literacy

01:20:55.049 --> 01:20:57.919
with him at the National
Science Foundation,

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:01.923
let alone award him an
honorary degree right here

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:05.493
at Carnegie Mellon University.

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:13.034
[ Applause ]

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.869
Traveling to Iowa
State University

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:20.241
for me was only possible because
I received a travel grant

01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:22.977
from a trust established

01:21:22.977 --> 01:21:29.450
by the Indian major
industrial conglomerate Tata.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:33.688
Two years ago, on
this very stage,

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:37.425
Mr. Ratan Tata received
an honorary degree,

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:40.861
and I met him here at
Carnegie Mellon University.

01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:44.332
How could I have
ever known in 1977

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:46.000
that this would be
the path I would take.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.037
None of us can predict
the trajectory

01:21:50.037 --> 01:21:53.441
of our lives and careers.

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:58.512
Carl Wieman, who grew
up in rural Oregon,

01:21:58.512 --> 01:22:03.284
who received an honorary degree
today, struggled to get even

01:22:03.284 --> 01:22:05.720
to a library close to
the house that he lived

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.190
in which was a hundred
miles away.

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:13.794
More than 50 of those miles
were on unpaved roads.

01:22:13.794 --> 01:22:18.199
Winning a Nobel Prize in Physics
was not even in his universe

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:20.768
of imagined possibilities.

01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:25.006
Yet he did win a
Nobel Prize in 2001

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:27.708
for his pioneering
discoveries related

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:30.745
to the Bose Einstein condensate.

01:22:32.513 --> 01:22:38.052
[ Applause ]

01:22:38.052 --> 01:22:41.489
Carl beautifully complements
that profound accomplishment

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.424
with the deep empathy
is has today

01:22:43.424 --> 01:22:46.994
for students struggling
to learn science.

01:22:46.994 --> 01:22:55.336
In 1967, right here on
our own campus, a young,

01:22:55.336 --> 01:23:00.074
undergraduate junior
wrote a musical written

01:23:00.074 --> 01:23:04.311
by a fellow student,
wrote a musical for Scotch

01:23:04.311 --> 01:23:08.015
and Soda performed
by fellow students.

01:23:08.015 --> 01:23:10.918
That was Stephen Schwartz.

01:23:10.918 --> 01:23:16.490
The show he called Pippin
became a major sensation

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:18.626
and remains one of the
biggest Broadway hits

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:24.498
of our time nearly 50 years
after its CMU premiere.

01:23:24.498 --> 01:23:31.338
[ Applause ]

01:23:31.338 --> 01:23:33.607
I could tell similar
stories about many

01:23:33.607 --> 01:23:38.212
of the people sitting
behind me on the stage.

01:23:38.212 --> 01:23:42.616
Many of the people on whom we
have bestowed honorary degrees.

01:23:42.616 --> 01:23:48.255
Life did not unfold
according to any precise plan.

01:23:48.255 --> 01:23:51.525
But these success stories are
built up on the ability to bring

01:23:51.525 --> 01:23:57.498
to each new circumstance one's
individual strengths, purpose,

01:23:57.498 --> 01:24:00.801
passion, and principles.

01:24:00.801 --> 01:24:03.971
These are innovators able
to pivot, [inaudible],

01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:07.808
and adopt the unexpected.

01:24:07.808 --> 01:24:09.076
And they respond with aspects

01:24:09.076 --> 01:24:13.013
from their hearts
as from their heads.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:17.451
This will be true
in your lives too.

01:24:17.451 --> 01:24:22.890
As the strengths of your
lives unfold and intertwine.

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:26.827
Things will arise
that you did not

01:24:26.827 --> 01:24:29.530
and could not predict
or plan for.

01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.933
That's OK.

01:24:32.933 --> 01:24:36.036
Your generation has lived
with almost non-stop change

01:24:36.036 --> 01:24:38.806
for your entire lives.

01:24:38.806 --> 01:24:41.876
You simply expect that
new ideas, new tools,

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:44.945
and new devices will
emerge continually.

01:24:44.945 --> 01:24:49.683
And that long established
truths and practices could be

01:24:49.683 --> 01:24:52.453
and would be discarded.

01:24:52.453 --> 01:24:57.057
You are innovators on a scale
unprecedented in human history.

01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:59.727
This is just normal
life for you.

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:07.101
This explosion of knowledge
has come about at least in part

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:10.137
because many disciplines are
coming together more readily

01:25:10.137 --> 01:25:12.273
than ever before.

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:15.976
Abetted by technologies of
discovery and new sources

01:25:15.976 --> 01:25:21.015
of data, the confluence of
biology, behavioral sciences,

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:26.220
and computation, [inaudible]
advances in brain sites.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.288
Progress in energy

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:29.456
and sustainability
requires engineers

01:25:29.456 --> 01:25:34.461
of every sort plus economists,
architects, designers,

01:25:34.461 --> 01:25:38.566
policy analysts, historians,
and computer scientists.

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:42.002
The fine and performing arts are
continually engaged with science

01:25:42.002 --> 01:25:46.740
and technology both as new
expressive media and as sources

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.211
of artistic themes and concerns.

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:54.148
No matter what your field
is, you have already come

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:58.085
to appreciate the creative
clash of disciplines.

01:25:58.085 --> 01:26:00.988
That is something that Carnegie
Mellon is very well known for.

01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:06.260
As we look at the 21st century
ahead of you, ahead of all

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:09.997
of us, one of the most
defining characteristics

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:12.132
of the 21st century is the way

01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:16.470
in which technology
impacts human condition.

01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:19.974
No other university can
prepare its graduates

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:23.811
at the intersections of
technology and human condition

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:27.481
as Carnegie Mellon can.

01:26:27.481 --> 01:26:33.320
[ Applause ]

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.424
Alan Alda has the rare and
probably even unique distinction

01:26:37.424 --> 01:26:44.531
of being named for an Oscar,
an Emmy, and a Tony as well

01:26:44.531 --> 01:26:49.303
as a bestselling book
all in the same year.

01:26:49.303 --> 01:26:51.305
An incredible achievement.

01:26:51.305 --> 01:26:55.042
But with the expansion and
intricate connection of areas

01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:58.612
of inquiry, new and even
more amazing possibilities

01:26:58.612 --> 01:27:00.114
will emerge.

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:04.385
Some day we could
have the possibility

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:08.255
that there will be somebody
who is nominated for an Oscar,

01:27:08.255 --> 01:27:13.627
an Emmy, a Tony, the
bestselling book, a Turing Award

01:27:13.627 --> 01:27:16.530
in computer science,
and a Nobel Prize all

01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:17.698
in the same year [laughter].

01:27:17.698 --> 01:27:22.469
And that's likely to
happen at Carnegie Mellon.

01:27:22.469 --> 01:27:28.008
[ Applause ]

01:27:28.008 --> 01:27:30.444
The ability to respond
productively

01:27:30.444 --> 01:27:36.116
to unanticipated outcomes, to
be open to innovative ideas,

01:27:36.116 --> 01:27:39.253
and to grow your capacity to
work across diverse fields

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:45.092
with diverse others while
keeping your hearts in the work

01:27:45.092 --> 01:27:48.696
and having your work
come from your heart.

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:53.167
And connecting to the work
that is in your hearts.

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.836
These brought you here today.

01:27:55.836 --> 01:27:59.039
They will be even more
important for your future.

01:27:59.039 --> 01:28:04.244
And I'm very confident that
you are perfectly ready today.

01:28:04.244 --> 01:28:11.752
And we, your families, your
professors, your mentors,

01:28:11.752 --> 01:28:16.323
and Carnegie Mellon University,
look forward to seeing you,

01:28:16.323 --> 01:28:22.396
seeing the impact of the Class
of 2015 around the world.

01:28:22.396 --> 01:28:26.700
We want to support and celebrate
you every step of your way.

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:32.106
So, my final request to you
today is to stay in touch.

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:35.709
Be connected with Carnegie
Mellon University forever.

01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:37.544
Stay involved.

01:28:37.544 --> 01:28:40.981
Take advantage of the
CMU alumni network.

01:28:40.981 --> 01:28:43.183
Connect to one another.

01:28:43.183 --> 01:28:45.285
If the 115-year history

01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:49.056
of Carnegie Mellon
University is any indication,

01:28:49.056 --> 01:28:52.726
those of you sitting here
receiving your degrees today

01:28:52.726 --> 01:28:58.198
will be movers, shakers,
leaders, innovators,

01:28:58.198 --> 01:29:01.235
extraordinary artists,
humanists,

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:05.139
social scientists, designers.

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:09.843
So, as is a piece of
practical advice, when you look

01:29:09.843 --> 01:29:12.179
to the person sitting in
front of you, next to you,

01:29:12.179 --> 01:29:16.750
or behind you, remember
20-30 years

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:21.088
from now they'll be leaders.

01:29:21.088 --> 01:29:22.489
They'll have a lot of resources.

01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:26.894
Some of them may be your boss.

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.829
Be nice to them.

01:29:28.829 --> 01:29:31.298
It will come in handy.

01:29:31.298 --> 01:29:34.201
Keep in touch with them.

01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:37.704
Together with them, you
will change the world.

01:29:37.704 --> 01:29:41.308
My warmest congratulations
and best wishes

01:29:41.308 --> 01:29:43.110
to each and every one of you.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.479
Congratulations.

[ Applause ]

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.424
We will conclude
today's ceremony

01:29:57.424 --> 01:30:03.697
by singing the Alma Mater by the
Vocal Performance Class of 2015.

01:30:03.697 --> 01:30:07.401
We invite you to please
rise and sing along.

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:11.205
The words to Alma Mater can
be found in your program.

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:16.043
Also, please remain standing at
the conclusion of the Alma Mater

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.545
for the recession of graduates.

01:30:18.545 --> 01:30:20.514
Congratulations.

wildernesses robed the fountains

01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:53.447
of the west.

01:31:10.864 --> 01:31:17.571
Where the savage strife

01:31:17.571 --> 01:31:20.207
and stresses brought the
settlers' crimson quest.

01:31:20.207 --> 01:31:29.283
Land of legend, glory, graces.

01:31:55.976 --> 01:31:57.044
Gypsy tide and toiling shore.

'Mid they hilltops, Alma Mater.
