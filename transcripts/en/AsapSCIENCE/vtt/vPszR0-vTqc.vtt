00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
We all know to stay away from poisons.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.160
Like mercury where ingesting a 200 milligram dose would kill you.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.420
Or polonium which only requires 1 g of vaporized substance to wipe out 50 million people!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.600
But did know that 70 cups of coffee contains enough caffeine to kill a 70 kg person?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.820
This amount of caffeine can trigger heart palpitations or even cardiac arrest.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Prefer alcohol as your beverage of choice?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.280
13 consecutive shots could be lethal too.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.000
Because alcohol is a depressant, the area in the brain controlling basic life functions

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.840
like breathing and heart rate brgin to shut down.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.800
Too much liquid in general can be dangerous as well.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.440
Though it takes a lot, water intoxication from around 6 liters causes brain cells to swell,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.880
leading to headaches, seizures, comas and even death in extreme cases.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.960
But if you stop drinking water or consume too much salt, your cells will start to shrink leading

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.280
to the condition known as hypernatremia. 48 teaspoons of your favourite seasoning at once

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.240
is enough to trigger this reaction, also leading to seizures, coma or even death.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.480
Stick your head underwater or simply hold your breath and it takes around 4 minutes without oxygen

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.080
to cause severe brain injury and at 6 minutes, you could die.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.520
However, in extreme cases, some freedivers have been able to hold their breath fo over 20 minutes.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.800
Cherries can also deprive you of oxygen. Say what? If you ever swallow a cherry pit, you shouldn't worry

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.600
too much, just don't bite into one. 1 or 2 ground cherry pits contains enough cyanide to take you down.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.200
And these cyanide ions inhibite the enzyme cytochrome coxidaze, causing your cells to be unable to use oxygen.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.840
Speaking of a lack of oxygen, it's at around 8000 meters above sea level that our bodies can no longer

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.000
acclamatize to delemited oxigen

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.440
this is known as the "death zone" in mountaineering

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.040
simply being to talk is also kill you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
if you worry about your pet's life you may ever not to give them chocolate

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.920
the same chemical Theobromine can kill us too

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.600
our body metabolize Theobromine more effectively the with one thousand per kilogram being total humans which the equivalent at eighty-five for size chocolat bars at once

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.120
you may want that many chocolate bars after getting hire

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.800
howerver, you will need to eat twenty-two kilograms of marijuana to be a risk of death

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.560
smoke it and a mere required  over those is comically high
