this works and that's what launched me

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
this works and that's what launched me
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.819
this works and that's what launched me
on this career if you will of

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920
 
went to graduate school that are mighty

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
went to graduate school that are mighty
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.830
went to graduate school that are mighty
and there I started working for the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
and there I started working for the
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.959
and there I started working for the
legendary Claude Shannon the man who

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969
legendary Claude Shannon the man who
 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.109
legendary Claude Shannon the man who
invented and created information theory

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
invented and created information theory
 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.999

brilliant guy and he was he was then and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
brilliant guy and he was he was then and
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.990
brilliant guy and he was he was then and
still is my role model and I notice that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000
still is my role model and I notice that
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.090
still is my role model and I notice that
all my classmates were doing their PhD

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
all my classmates were doing their PhD
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.789
all my classmates were doing their PhD
research on the area that he had created

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
research on the area that he had created
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.940
research on the area that he had created
information theory and in my mind this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
information theory and in my mind this
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.089
information theory and in my mind this
was a very crowded area Shannon had done

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
was a very crowded area Shannon had done
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.639

who always left was hard and probably

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
who always left was hard and probably
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.210
who always left was hard and probably
inconsequential so I imagined but I was

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
inconsequential so I imagined but I was
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.539
inconsequential so I imagined but I was
surrounded by computers both at MIT and

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549
surrounded by computers both at MIT and
 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.030
surrounded by computers both at MIT and
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory where I spent

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory where I spent
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.520
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory where I spent
my summers working and I said one day

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
my summers working and I said one day
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.690
my summers working and I said one day
these computers are going to have to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
these computers are going to have to
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.699
these computers are going to have to
talk to each other and there was no

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
talk to each other and there was no
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.850
talk to each other and there was no
adequate way by which they could do so

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
adequate way by which they could do so
 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.559
adequate way by which they could do so
so this really challenged me this is a

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569
so this really challenged me this is a
 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.289
so this really challenged me this is a
good problem it'll probably be important

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299
good problem it'll probably be important
 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.350
good problem it'll probably be important
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit let's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit let's
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.300
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit let's
go for it so I started working in the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
go for it so I started working in the
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.770
go for it so I started working in the
area which eventually became the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
area which eventually became the
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.449
area which eventually became the
internet and what I did for my

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459
internet and what I did for my
 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.020
internet and what I did for my
dissertation was to basically create the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030
dissertation was to basically create the
 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.940
dissertation was to basically create the
mathematical theory of data networks

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950
mathematical theory of data networks
 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.199
mathematical theory of data networks
suggested and introduced the idea of

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
suggested and introduced the idea of
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.729
suggested and introduced the idea of
taking messages and breaking them up

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739
taking messages and breaking them up
 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.160
taking messages and breaking them up
into fixed length blocks we now call

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
into fixed length blocks we now call
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.559
into fixed length blocks we now call
those things packets and develop the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569
those things packets and develop the
 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.240
those things packets and develop the
underlying technology of packet

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
underlying technology of packet
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.220
