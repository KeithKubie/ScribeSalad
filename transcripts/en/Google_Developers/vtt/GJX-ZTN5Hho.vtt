ROB DODSON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.529
What's up?

00:00:01.529 --> 00:00:04.750
It's Rob Dodson
here at I/O 2015.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.080
I just got done with my
sessions, and holy cow,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.190
there was so much at
this year's event.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.030
On the web platform,
we got stuff

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.650
for Service Worker,
Push Notifications,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.940
and Add to Homescreen.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.370
And my personal favorite,
Polymer 1.0, rolled out.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.439
So if you're interested
in Polymer or any

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.480
of the other stuff that
we've been talking about,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.300
you can catch all of it on
the Google Developers YouTube

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.862
channel.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.820
I've got a show on there
called Polycast, where

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.650
we recap all the
latest cool stuff

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.370
with Polymer, LazyWeb, for what
happened last week on the web.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.954
We've also got HTTP 203
and Totally Tooling Tips.

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.870
So a lot of really great
stuff to catch there.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.410
Also, all the Sandbox
talks from I/O this year

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.220
are being recorded and posted
to the YouTube channel as well.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.700
We've got a whole summer of
DevBytes for you to check out.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.590
So you can catch up
on all the I/O content

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.150
that you missed out on.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.699
It's great seeing you.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.740
I'll catch you on the
YouTube Developers channel.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.680
Be sure to click that
little subscribe button.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680
And I'll see you later.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.630
