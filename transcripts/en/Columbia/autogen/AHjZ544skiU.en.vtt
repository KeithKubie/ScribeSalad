00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919
there they're obviously risks that but i
 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.610
there they're obviously risks that but i
but i also think that when i have this

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620
but i also think that when i have this
 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.440

yourself either is there something more
 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.450
yourself either is there something more
and it strikes me that when we're used

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460
and it strikes me that when we're used
 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.640
and it strikes me that when we're used
to looking at Eastern Europe as a block

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650
to looking at Eastern Europe as a block
 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.490
to looking at Eastern Europe as a block
we did see something more than just the

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500
we did see something more than just the
 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.560
we did see something more than just the
politics much more than we do now and

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570
politics much more than we do now and
 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.390
politics much more than we do now and
that's culture and that doesn't really

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400
that's culture and that doesn't really
 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.900
that's culture and that doesn't really
come through I don't know the people who

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910
come through I don't know the people who
 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.520
come through I don't know the people who
are actually living in Ukraine and

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530
are actually living in Ukraine and
 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.670
are actually living in Ukraine and
experiencing Ukrainian culture directly

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680

they might have something to say about
 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.909
they might have something to say about
that but I find it really sort of

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919
that but I find it really sort of
 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.350
that but I find it really sort of
disturbing when you think about it that

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360
disturbing when you think about it that
 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.720
disturbing when you think about it that
the Balkans is the Balkans our former

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730

Yugoslavia is consider kind of a problem
but then you look at the kind of

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230
but then you look at the kind of
 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.170
but then you look at the kind of
literature and artistic creation that

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180
literature and artistic creation that
 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.360
literature and artistic creation that

that would be something interesting to

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460
that would be something interesting to
 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.119
that would be something interesting to
to show what would not that these are

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129
to show what would not that these are
 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.249

and made interesting I think to a
 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.929
and made interesting I think to a
Western audience and that's not being

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:22.939
Western audience and that's not being
 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:24.879
