And mutation causing enhanced ADH activity, would

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.510
result in a person feeling less intoxicated.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.660
Remember, ethanol is the actual substance that

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.170
makes you feel intoxicated. If ADH works really

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.430
efficiently, then it metabolized ethanol pretty quickly

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.570
to acetaldehyde. That means we're removing ethanol from

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.270
your system so you won't feel as intoxicated by it. If we reduced ADH activity.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.040
Then we'd have a buildup of ethanol

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.270
and then that would increase our intoxication effects.
