00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.600
Science proves that YouTube commenters are
just the worst.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.020
They said it, not me!

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.940
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with DEFINITIVE
PROOF that YouTube trolls exist, science has

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.610
proven it, officially - and it is out of my
hands!

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.470
A study published in PLOS One this week, conducted
an extensive analysis of TED Talks, to see

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.180
if comments on the YouTube version of them
differed from comments on the TED Talks website.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.370
Now if you're unfamiliar with TED talks, they
are a collection of recorded conferences covering

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.410
every intellectual topic imaginable - but
always with a very inspiring slant.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.550
And they're super informative, so one might
expect the comments on them to be on-topic

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.070
or, dare we say, even positive.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.239
But once again, science has proven us wrong.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.010
For their study, a team of researchers looked
at 595 different TED talks relating to science

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.330
and technology, which currently account for
around two-thirds of all TED talks.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.430
And they looked at the comments on each video,
comparing those on the YouTube platform, to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.370
ones on the Ted.com version.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.290
They found that 72% of the comments on the
Ted.com videos were related to the actual

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.750
content of the talk - while only 57% of comments
on the YouTube version were relevant.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.170
Even less surprising, 5.7% of the comments
on YouTube were personal insults, compared

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.610
to less than 1% on Ted.com.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.350
The study also looked at the disparity of
comments on talks featuring female presenters,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.060
versus ones featuring males.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810
And while there were no differences in the
number of negative or positive comments related

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.660
to the actual subject matter - female presenters
did tend to elicit more emotional responses

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.170
than males, whether positive and negative.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.560
Perhaps most interesting, the study found
that commenters were significantly more likely

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.310
to discuss a female presenter's looks - than
they were for a male-hosted talk.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.390
SAY IT ISN'T SO, YOUTUBE!

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.240
In fact, the only advantage YouTube had over
Ted.com - was that people were more likely

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.509
to engage with one another in the comments.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.260
And it's not clear whether personal insults
actually count as "engagement," but at this

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.880
point - nothing would surprise me.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.259
Now I thought this study was very interesting,
so I did some research myself - and looked

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.729
at all 984 comments on this YouTube video
about the science of flirting - a topic that's

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.570
sure to attract only the nicest and most socially
capable of individuals.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.450
Turns out - it's scientifically impossible
to read through 984 comments on a YouTube

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.210
video - it just can't be done.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.690
So my study was inconclusive, BUT on the bright
side - several people did say that I look

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.390
like a man, soooo......there's that.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.760
You know what, I'm gonna start an anti-trolling
movement.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.760
The next time you leave a comment on YouTube,
I want you to write the kindest, most overwhelmingly

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.350
positive thing you can think of.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.350
Even if it's not true.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.810
And you can start with this video.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.810
Please.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.814
I really need this.
