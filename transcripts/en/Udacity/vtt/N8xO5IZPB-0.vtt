00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.160
Current Procedural Terminology, CPT,
is maintained and updated annually

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.330
by the American Medical Association
to classify all medical procedures.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.070
And it is required for
virtually all billing and reimbursement.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.360
CPT codes are divided
into three categories.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.637
Category I codes are widely
performed procedures.

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:31.080
And are 5 digits long divided
into sections for anesthesiology,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.740
surgery, radiology, pathology,
laboratory medicine, and medicine.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.702
Category II codes are for
the collection of quality and

00:00:41.702 --> 00:00:44.642
performance metrics and are 4 digits.

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:47.524
Category III codes are for new or

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:52.330
experimental procedures and
are also 4 digits.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.780
For each code there are full, medium,
and short names or descriptions,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.590
as you can see here for
flu vaccine, influenza vaccine.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.760
These are used for
different purposes and

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.840
provide varied levels
of detail as needed.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.370
Given it's used for billing,
a CPT code may need to provide

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.260
details necessary to
determine the proper charge.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.770
Here, we see a series of codes for
a psychiatry visit.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.730
Different codes are used to
indicate the visit length.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.580
The charge would be more for
longer visits.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.620
These codes are used to indicate
how much dead, damaged or

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.170
infected tissue has been
removed to promote healing.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.840
Removing more results
in a larger charge.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.300
CPT codes are simple but
given this critical role in billing and

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.660
subtleties such as these, selection
of the right code is important and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.730
billing personnel are extensively
trained to code correctly.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.389
Typically, to ensure that the largest,
but hopefully legitimate,

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:01.450
bill is submitted.
