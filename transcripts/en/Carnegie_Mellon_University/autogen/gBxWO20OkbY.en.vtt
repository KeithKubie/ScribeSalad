00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.790
 Good afternoon 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.840
 Welcome everyone here 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.690
 We have more than 400 people here. 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.750
 There seems to be no space on campus. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.840
 Can accommodate all those who want to participate together 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.230
 To this end, we have many video playback devices on campus. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.580
 It will receive the image of the presence and transmit it to the network. 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.200
 therefore 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.710
 Countless people will join us in this moment 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.190
 My name is Randy. Bryan 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 I am the dean of the Computer Science Academy. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.420
 Returning from Randy back to Carnegie Mellon as a professor 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.220
 By the time I was promoted to the dean last year. 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.630
 I am very happy to work with Randy. 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.460
 Randy passed away on July 25 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.090
 Forty-seven years old 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.340
 It’s a tragedy 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.130
 We all miss him very much 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.260
 And we will continue to miss him 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.660
 But our main purpose today is to commemorate Randy 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.210
 His life and his legacy 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.340
 Special mention is 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.270
 His influence on many people 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.300
 Not only the people Carnegie Mellon knows 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.890
 Or people who met on his life journey 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.920
 And spread to the rest of the world through the Internet in the past year. 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.130
 Those inspired by his story 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.450
 Please turn off your mobile phone first. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 You can't engage in any photography activities. 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.300
 The puppets on the stage are donated by people. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.960
 of course 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.710
 Randy is known for his interest in filling puppets 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.870
 Although I think his interest lies in getting, not owning 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.560
 These puppets will be donated to charity after the event. 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.870
 You will also find the memorial on this occasion. 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.680
 This is Irene 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.740
 Of course this is the Tigger 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.460
 Thank you all 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.140
 When you think about Randy’s famous lines 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.730
 "Selecting a side station: Tigger or Earl 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.090
 I think I know exactly where I will stand. 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.040
 I quote Randy's famous Irene and Tigger arguing 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.990
 Of course, I am also a Tigger 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.970
 Today we have a lot of speakers. 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.910
 In order to prevent me from jumping up and down, I will introduce them one by one. 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.460
 I will finish them all. 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.400
 Then they will come to the stage to give a speech. 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.020
 this is me 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.330
 Next, I have something to say. 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.720
 Andy is Randy's teaching professor at Brown University. 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.190
 After reading Randy's entire book 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.560
 I will know that he is called "Uncle of the Netherlands" 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.330
 Jessica is a friend of his time at the Institute. 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.420
 They have always been in good contact 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.550
 And greatly helped Randy and his family last year. 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.890
 Cope with all kinds of situations they must face 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.930
 Dennis is a colleague at the University of Virginia. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.300
 Randy says he is an indispensable partner 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.010
 They have completed many virtual reality projects together. 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.670
 Dan is the director of the Human-Computer Interface Research Institute. 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.170
 The unit is part of Carnegie Mellon University 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.290
 Randy has also been involved in the past. 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.160
 In many ways, that’s his home. 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.650
 Dennis. Kaskov 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.660
 I didn't want to mention this. 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.550
 But he is mentioned in the "Last Speech" book. 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.100
 The person who was calculus (c) 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.980
 He was a student at the University of Virginia. 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.040
 At that time, Randy was teaching there. 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.320
 After that they still work together 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.820
 Dennis is now the leader in Alice's program technology 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.380
 Tang is the executive producer of the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.420
 And what you need to know 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.450
 Is the email address of Don 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.000
 Jesse is also heavily involved in the entertainment technology center. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.990
 in every aspects 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.120
 He played Randy’s role in the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.920
 Jerry Cohen is the principal of the University 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.650
 And he is also a very good friend of Randy. 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.000
 At last 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.140
 David is the first Christian church priest in Pittsburgh 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.270
 Will be the end of the whole speech by him 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.030
 I will make a small update for the "Last Speech". 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.450
 Part of the speech was cut off on many YouTube videos. 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.970
 But that part is a series of presentations. 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.650
 Part of the cut is 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.310
 Jerry got up and announced 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.670
 Name a bridge in the name of Randy 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.830
 This bridge is very symbolic 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.930
 It is connected 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.890
 New Computer Science Building under the name of Bill Gates 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.930
 With the Purnell Art Center 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.680
 The connection between the two buildings has already been planned 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:10.560
 This makes it easier for students and people to cross the campus 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.130
 Link the computer science building to the main part of the campus 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.930
 It’s quite unbelievable to say. 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.470
 The bridge is also connected 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.810
 Randy has tried to combine two departments (CS &amp; ART) 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.530
 When principal Cohen announced the bridge last year 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.000
 This is the look of the bridge. 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.250
 Its previous construction progress is still in its early stages. 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.610
 The potential of this imaginary map is much greater than the authenticity. 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.250
 But now I just want to tell you what it looks like. 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.260
 This bridge does exist now 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.240
 Although it has not been built to allow people to walk on it 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.190
 In the Gates Center in the Computer Science Building 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.770
 The steel bone has been put on 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.480
 You can climb the upper floor of the Gates Center 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.510
 Watching how the bridge will be in the future 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.770
 Link Computer Science Building and Purnell Art Center 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.520
 Then you can imagine to 

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.410
 How many people will walk through the bridge every day? 

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.410
 In fact, Jerry talks about 

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.270
 Students after several generations 

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.860
 Will pass this bridge named after Randy 

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.280
 They will have the opportunity to meet Randy 

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.180
 And for us, he is so special 

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.160
 And this is why this bridge seems to have the characteristics of an artist. 

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.220
 Now you can see that the bridge already exists. 

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.070
 If you want to climb the fence 

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.790
 I should not tell you that you can do this. 

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.390
 Then you might as well take the bridge to the new building. 

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.590
 One year from now 

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.940
 This bridge will exist in reality 

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.600
 People will walk on this bridge 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.080
 This will be a wonderful thing 

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.270
 I want to tell some of my own memories of Randy. 

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.840
 As I said 

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.290
 When he was a graduate student here 

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.470
 I don't know much about him. 

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.130
 But when he became a faculty member here 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.240
 I am quite familiar with him. 

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.360
 I have to say this time with Randy. 

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.500
 Is an extraordinary journey 

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.280
 Especially his last speech in the last year. 

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.560
 For all of us 

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.880
 Randy’s life is a great experience. 

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.020
 So I thought a little bit about it. 

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.080
 What kind of characteristics is it? 

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.410
 Make him so extraordinary and outstanding 

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.160
 And make him a person so important to many people 

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.960
 So I came to the stage to introduce four points. 

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.340
 The first point 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.660
 Randy’s inner life is always in childlike 

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.900
 And fully displayed 

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.470
 In The Last Lecture 

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.740
 He talked about his dream of chasing childhood 

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.250
 For example, playing with the National Football League 

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.210
 Play a role in Star Trek 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.960
 And floating in space 

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.790
 When I heard him say this 

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.120
 My response to this matter is 

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.080
 I also recall my childhood dreams. 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.470
 If I pursue my childhood dreams 

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.890
 I might become a vet or a racing designer. 

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.460
 I really appreciate Randy. 

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.770
 Have a childlike innocence in your life 

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.800
 Excited and inspired by things 

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.160
 Second point 

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.970
 He has a unique personality trait 

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.140
 Also has amazing ways of thinking strategically 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.940
 Randy pursues his dream as a goal 

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.630
 And do what the average person can't do. 

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.360
 Whether it is to take the opportunity to take a "vomiting comet" 

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.690
 To announce his flight to the outside world 

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.920
 Or attract the attention of the dream lover Jie Yi 

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.380
 I don't know who else can stick like Randy. 

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.720
 He is setting goals and continuing to chase 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.810
 Third point 

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.060
 He is an amazing risk bettor 

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.930
 Many times when people see that the results are not good 

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.250
 They become risk averse 

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.450
 Because they saw that when things didn’t go according to normal procedures 

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.500
 All bad results 

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.460
 But Randy has the ability to see the future and all possibilities 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.120
 And see all the bad results 

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.130
 Then still go to adventure 

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.490
 I want to some extent 

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.710
 As he described 

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.300
 He does not regard mistakes as bad situations 

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.300
 Think of new things that can be learned and tried 

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:19.740
 Because of this 

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.150
 He can always stand up and accept the challenge 

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.990
 Even if it might not work 

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.400
 Let me take the example of starting an entertainment technology center. 

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.330
 Here he is a very successful professor 

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.990
 He is engaged in the study of virtual reality. 

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.000
 And very successful in teaching and popular 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.180
 He does not take the road of the general staff 

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.900
 Instead, set up a master's degree with someone. 

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.520
 That person's email address is thedon@cmu.edu 

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.830
 That field did not exist at that time. 

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.830
 The entire education method has not been tested yet. 

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.260
 Of course it has been successful now. 

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.110
 This is also an example of his pursuit of goals. 

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.020
 Have the courage to stand up and take on such a huge risk 

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.830
 the last point 

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.950
 Randy generously uses his time and talent to help others. 

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.430
 Of course he has the ability to pursue the right things. 

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.950
 At the same time, he also has the ability to see things for others. 

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.800
 He will give generous advice to others very generously 

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.550
 Sometimes those people don’t really want those suggestions 

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.070
 But he will be honest, straightforward, and not showing a sense of superiority. 

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.870
 And don’t provide advice in a selfish way 

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.510
 Everyone thanked him 

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.950
 Think Randy is sincere 

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.660
 And calculate the situation that is most beneficial to you. 

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.100
 I am with many in Carnegie Mellon 

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.560
 Even people from other universities have talked 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.030
 They talked about Randy sitting down and sharing the idea of ​​a successful teacher. 

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.370
 Help them overcome many problems 

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.090
 And then have a huge impact in their lives. 

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.440
 Randy is really incredible and generous in this regard. 

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.490
 I want to be in the past few years 

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.310
 We can all see from many different faces 

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.900
 He showed the world his advice to others. 

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.680
 So influential and inspiring 

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.710
 The above is a summary of some of my characteristics. 

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.590
 Now let us know about him. 

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.460
 The opportunity to speak with people who have worked with him for many years 

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.780
 thank you all 

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.850
 Miss Ladies, Good afternoon. 

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.670
 I am Andy. 

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.310
 I am very honored to be at Brown University. 

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.190
 Become Randy's guiding professor and friend 

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.230
 Open his teaching career and research career 

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.410
 And interactive graphics research 

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:00.460
 Can participate in the recollection of Randy’s incredible and stimulating life 

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.810
 For me 

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.400
 Is both sad but also profound glory 

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.970
 This is the favorite Randy photo of my life. 

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.510
 At that time, I was the head of the department. 

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.440
 I must personally award a diploma at the graduation ceremony. 

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.150
 Randy is looking forward to getting a diploma 

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.140
 But he got the Chinese menu. 

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.070
 You may ask, "Why?" 

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.260
 I often take my entire group of students out to eat Chinese food. 

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.750
 Randy, Mr. White Bread 

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.960
 I really don't like Chinese food. 

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.230
 He hates Chinese food very much. 

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.990
 He didn’t learn how to eat with chopsticks. 

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.950
 But he will still come anyway. 

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.740
 Because even if he is still just a college student 

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.140
 He also understands the importance of group interaction. 

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.790
 However, this picture always makes me scream 

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.030
 His piercing and uncontrollable laughter 

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.910
 And his ability to always turn any situation into a joke 

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.660
 Even if the joke happened to him 

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.110
 When Randy started studying at Brown University 

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.950
 Actually it is somewhat unstable 

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.570
 He performed very well on the introductory course. 

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.800
 But the university assistants suggested me 

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.880
 Don't hire him as a teaching assistant 

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.570
 Because they think Randy is a little arrogant and a bit arrogant. 

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.660
 Especially when you are with a newbie 

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.860
 His speech is too strong 

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.380
 Once I wisely overthrew the views of the assistants. 

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.960
 Because I was lucky to find 

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.700
 He is a piece of uncut jade 

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.220
 He has obvious talent and abundant ability 

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:38.930
 And this boy has repaid the grace of my knowledge. 

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.930
 He became an excellent teaching assistant 

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.420
 Then become the leader of the teaching assistant 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.780
 The rest of his life is like what we say 

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.150
 Become history 

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.180
 He is in my graphic research team 

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.500
 Also an excellent university research assistant 

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.320
 In our hypermedia project 

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.990
 The part he is mainly responsible for 

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.500
 User interface for the most advanced illustration tools 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:06.880
 When most people focus on the functional and performance aspects 

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.970
 But Randy has uniquely raised the concern of "user experience." 

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.110
 Make "user experience" a focus of attention 

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.180
 Established a perfect customizable viscosity (Note: the higher the viscosity, the lower the transfer) 

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.440
 This is the first time I saw something like this. 

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.410
 We will always remember the work ethics of his "good spirit" 

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.470
 And the fun he got from everything 

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.530
 Like making cool stuff we have never seen before. 

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.620
 In addition, this is also very important 

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.480
 He has the ability to have a perfect presentation 

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.490
 He is a master 

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:44.300
 He is very good at questioning and responding. 

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.830
 At least his questions and responses are well rehearsed. 

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.640
 Prompt role and humor on the spot 

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.120
 At that time, because he was very enthusiastic about helping students. 

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.840
 There are very talents and traits that are good at expression. 

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.050
 And creative in research 

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.460
 I keep persuading him to go to the Institute. 

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.420
 Get a Ph.D. that proves that you can teach 

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.380
 But when he arrived at Carnegie Mellon University 

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.470
 He was the same as when I was studying at the institute. 

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.390
 He often feels discouraged 

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.160
 Then he will call me 

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.330
 I wonder if the research is really worth it. 

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.400
 I keep talking to him. 

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.680
 How beautiful my life in the academic circle is. 

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.780
 Because I insist and get a degree 

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.400
 He just insists on sticking to me. 

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.820
 I feel that I have done some of the power 

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.310
 Hanging carrots in front of him to lure him forward 

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:36.200
 Help him stay in the entire academic circle 

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.640
 I want to share two letters he wrote to his college girlfriend. 

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.800
 At the time, his girlfriend was also a teaching assistant. 

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.060
 Then when it comes to the head of the teaching assistant 

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.540
 She is called Heidi. 

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.190
 Randy writes to her after the Disney holiday 

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.640
 And return to Carnegie Mellon University to teach 

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.050
 He wrote to tell her 

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.000
 "I feel that I have access to super rich resources." 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.760
 "And this rich resource is the student team working with me." 

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.610
 Letter with instructions 

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.430
 "In many ways, I have become a young Andy." 

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.980
 "Besides those who dare not eat spicy food" 

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.080
 Needless to say 

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.950
 I am very proud of that lovely comment. 

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.040
 Next, I will show the letters. 

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.160
 Although you can't see clearly under the stage 

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.220
 But basically Randy talked about 

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.680
 Eighty-five dollars of speeding ticket 

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.620
 He talked about the reasons in the middle of the letter. 

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.850
 And claiming that "I am innocent" 

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.070
 And support him with some simple physics 

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.130
 In addition to visual computing 

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.820
 Draw the whole thing chart to the college girlfriend 

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.480
 By this matter 

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.470
 We can see Randy’s persuasive ability. 

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.450
 There are other parts in the letter. 

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.460
 But I didn't show it. 

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.730
 I am very happy to tell you now. 

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:03.640
 Brown University in recognition of Randy's outstanding contribution 

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.750
 And let the students of the university department 

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.560
 Can also experience these experiences that have a major impact on life. 

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.320
 And these experiences start with Randy. 

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.800
 Then passed on to the next generation 

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.580
 To students at Virginia and Carnegie Mellon University 

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.790
 Brown University is setting up 

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:23.030
 A summer research internship program donated by the outside world 

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.940
 We can be proud of the first announcement 

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.660
 "Randy Bowes University Summer Research Intern Program" has been established 

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:35.080
 Thanks to the generosity of the former Girl Scout leaders who honored Randy 

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.390
 I want to ask you some questions. 

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.140
 And will provide my answer 

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.340
 Why is Randy so amazing? 

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.360
 Why can he make more than just the people at this venue? 

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.270
 But people from any place resonate? 

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.350
 Why can he be the most famous computer scientist? 

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.770
 And become a global trend? 

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.290
 I believe that because people know 

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.160
 He is really a real hero 

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.120
 In an era with many traditional heroes 

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.860
 Especially like political leaders and sports stars 

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.540
 They all have one original form 

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.130
 of course 

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.610
 Randy does not fly 

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.080
 He is no greater than life. 

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.490
 But he has played his life to the fullest 

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.130
 Not through the madness in life 

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.490
 But through his enthusiasm and persistence 

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.890
 He did realize his dream 

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.580
 And provide us with the best example 

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:48.510
 I hope he can exist in our memory forever. 

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.230
 And continue to inspire us 

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.680
 thank you 

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.050
 Randy likes some props 

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.240
 I brought this little doll 

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.340
 Next I will tell you a story of him. 

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.340
 My name is Jessica. 

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.070
 When the Randy Institute was in the mid-1980s 

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.290
 I am one of his friends. 

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.110
 And in recent years 

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.360
 I am his colleague at Carnegie Mellon University. 

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.220
 The first time I met Randy was in 1983. 

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.760
 At the time, I was a prospective graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. 

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.420
 And he is a first-year graduate student. 

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.070
 I am not sure if Shelen knows 

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.330
 The social importance of these visits 

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.320
 Many of the people she had inadvertently introduced to us at the time. 

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.010
 Still very good friends 

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.010
 A few of them are still married. 

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.270
 Randy and I later realized 

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.960
 We have something in common 

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.930
 We enter the institute not through the "regular" pipeline. 

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.300
 When he was first admitted to school 

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.420
 He came here to defend himself 

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.210
 I am because a friend helped me to say a few words. 

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.940
 And can be listed on the waiting list 

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.900
 Finally we all become 

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.570
 Professor of tenure at Carnegie Mellon University 

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.310
 Perhaps this also proves 

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.220
 Many admissions pipes are unknown. 

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.490
 I think Randy publicly acknowledged this for the first time. 

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.960
 In his "Last Speech" 

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.340
 As you know 

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.550
 Randy loves to use the to-do list 

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.490
 And do your own time management very well 

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.120
 Once he laughed at himself 

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.420
 He wrote "Get a tenure" on the to-do list. 

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.680
 This is really not a project that should appear on the to-do list. 

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.400
 But you may not know 

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.330
 He has considerable enthusiasm for getting a tenure. 

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.290
 He usually eats oatmeal for breakfast. 

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:40.130
 Mix about two-thirds of the water to eat 

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.250
 If we use a standard measuring cup with only one-third of the water 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.110
 It takes two strokes to reach two-thirds of the amount. 

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.700
 And Randy is a cup that can find two-thirds of the water. 

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.260
 And save more than one step 

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.750
 Please don't mind if he will take several years to make up. 

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.960
 The time he spent looking for a measuring cup 

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.680
 Although he has great passion for time management 

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.810
 He is spending time on 

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.400
 Friends, students, colleagues are generous 

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.080
 He is the best consultant candidate 

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.450
 He will listen intently 

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.540
 And give you a clear and clear answer 

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.750
 His answer is not a decisive comment. 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.690
 He put his most real thoughts into the answer 

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.750
 When his answer is impeccable due to the guarantee of academic logic 

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.600
 He will be very happy 

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.290
 During the research period 

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.290
 We are very serious 

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.230
 But compared to now 

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.590
 At that time, it seemed to be relatively free 

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:36.340
 In those days 

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.810
 TV shows of "Street Street Blues" will be broadcast every Thursday night. 

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.940
 We will gather in "Bucha Feder" 

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.440
 A house rented by Randy with his friend 

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.260
 Eating ice cream while watching the show 

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.290
 of course 

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.590
 This is a long time since the birth of TiVos. 

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.920
 But between watching TV shows and interspersed ads 

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.490
 We have more fun chatting with each other. 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.760
 We also did a lot of parties. 

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.470
 And provide a lot of cheap food at the party. 

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.520
 Usually Italian pasta 

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.450
 Because it can fit into Randy’s small palette 

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.860
 Then we make a salad in the garbage bag. 

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.080
 Because we don't have a large enough container to hold the salad 

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.440
 Randy is very brave 

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.260
 His most heroic act is nothing more than 

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.460
 Always publicly announced to everyone 

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.620
 He has struggled with cancer in the past few years. 

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.620
 I am honored to help him. 

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.680
 Choose all feasible medical methods together 

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.920
 For his children 

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.820
 What I want to say is 

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.730
 If cured Randy's medical technology already exists 

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.510
 That will allow him to stay with the child. 

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.730
 And watch them grow up 

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.840
 We have already killed the disease. 

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.880
 Randy can no longer afford 

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.340
 Any pain in order to defeat the disease 

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.580
 But in the early days 

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.520
 He is very brave about many things. 

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.630
 His research direction has changed twice. 

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.300
 From the field of "database trading" in the postgraduate era 

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.540
 "Human Machine Interface" when you go to the University of Virginia 

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.240
 Finally, the "Entertainment Technology" field of the Entertainment Technology Center 

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.090
 Every transformation is not just a new field of research 

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.090
 It is also an academic field that is not widely accepted. 

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.210
 He is really very good at this. 

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.710
 Randy also bravely to his friends and recently to the world 

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.280
 Show that he cares the most 

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.030
 At the time of research 

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.230
 Randy will wear corduroy and flannel shirts 

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.900
 And his high school leather jacket work 

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.170
 This is a bit strange 

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.820
 Because most of us are busy forgetting 

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.440
 The embarrassing social situation in high school 

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.320
 But he is very proud of the leather jacket. 

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.660
 He feels comfortable in letting others know about it. 

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.710
 For us 

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.350
 We have passed the stage of laughing at him. 

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.170
 So we made this doll 

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.650
 Dressing Randy into his appearance at the Institute 

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.620
 Corduroy, flannel shirt, leather jacket 

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.030
 If this doll is recently made 

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.220
 Then it will wear Carnegie Mellon's POLO fir and khaki pants 

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.000
 As if he was a teacher 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.800
 Walking in the Carnegie Mellon University building 

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.470
 Those who watched the "Street Street Blues" program together 

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.140
 On the fourth of July every summer 

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.690
 Will gather together and hold parties 

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.590
 Although we only held it once on the 4th of July 

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.310
 The first time was held in 1985 

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.310
 Notice that our clothes are quite fashionable 

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.000
 A few years later 

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.200
 We started to build the human flesh pyramid 

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.650
 We must be very good at this 

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.640
 Until someone started complaining 

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.700
 And started to make some mistakes 

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.150
 Then we thought that we could put the child to the top. 

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.700
 And reach the new height of the pyramid 

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.110
 This is our party photo for the summer of 2007 

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.380
 It happened to be known before Randy’s cancer recurred. 

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.300
 Absolutely no doubt 

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.600
 Randy is the catalyst for our annual party 

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.060
 We will continue to do it. 

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.440
 So we can tell his children 

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.300
 And remind yourself of the good and bad of the past. 

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.040
 Think of their father, our friend Randy 

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.800
 I have done the stupid things I have said. 

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.590
 thank you 

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:10.950
 Hello 

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.240
 I am Danny. Poft 

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.310
 I am from the University of Virginia. 

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.400
 I am an experimental psychologist. 

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:21.310
 Randy worked with me in the early 1990s. 

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.290
 Even if he returns to Carnegie Mellon University 

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.100
 We continue to cooperate 

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.970
 Until the last few years 

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.280
 more importantly 

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.830
 Randy is one of my very good friends. 

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.140
 When I first met Randy 

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.360
 On the basis of only knowing a few days 

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.190
 I will look at him 

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.900
 Then he will say his opinion 

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.270
 Then I will say, "What have you done?" 

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:45.490
 for example 

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.240
 He teaches a human-computer interaction 

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.110
 Or a human-machine interface 

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.730
 I said, "I am a psychologist." 

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.980
 "There are some buttons on the machine." 

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.910
 "Try to let the machine run out of the results with these buttons." 

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.970
 Hey~ I pressed the keyboard 

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.240
 We continue 

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.450
 Well, I am a psychologist. 

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.290
 I saw what Randy did. 

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.930
 So every time on the first day of the class 

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.770
 He will knock a video recorder with a big hammer 

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.140
 He will bring a video recorder 

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.140
 And explain how bad its interface is. 

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.830
 Then he will knock it out with a big hammer 

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.460
 And that’s how he started his first class. 

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.420
 In psychology 

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.510
 We will not do this 

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.860
 For me, get along with Randy. 

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.240
 I have to touch some people. 

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.730
 And to some extent 

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.510
 Become part of that professional community 

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.910
 If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t touch it. 

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.690
 I have to know 

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.050
 People in the field of computer science and computer graphics 

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.400
 And Disney Dream Project, Microsoft, Intel 

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.340
 And found interesting things created by engineers 

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.640
 These are not easily accessible to psychologists. 

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.860
 I want to tell you a story. 

00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.980
 It’s very special to make friends with people like Randy. 

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.380
 And interesting stories with him 

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.380
 In the early days 

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.570
 We started to participate in computer graphics seminars 

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.190
 Sometimes it will be like "perception basis" 

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.720
 Or a workshop such as virtual reality. 

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.100
 So we joined together 

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.150
 Computer Graphics Symposium in Orlando, Florida 

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:22.820
 one day later 

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.800
 I learned that there is no speech suitable for me. 

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.810
 For writing programs or graphics 

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.840
 I am a layman. 

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.650
 So I don't have to care so much. 

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.940
 Disneyland is really close to it 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:34.920
 So I decided to go right away. 

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.490
 Because I have never been to 

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.800
 I want to take this opportunity. 

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.390
 Take a bus to Disneyland to play 

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.120
 And I really did it. 

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.940
 About an hour passed 

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.290
 I found out 

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.560
 Unless you are going to the Disney with the kids 

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.950
 Otherwise it is a meaningless place 

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.520
 I am staying alone. 

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.350
 After a day like the melancholy of Little Oyster 

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.050
 I returned to the seminar 

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.390
 I told Randy. 

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.740
 I don't understand why Disneyland is so attractive. 

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.700
 The next day I went to Disneyland with Randy. 

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.890
 I mentioned before 

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.590
 Through Randy, with childish eyes 

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.170
 Come to watch Disneyland 

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.920
 It’s so wonderful. 

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.920
 It's really wonderful 

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.720
 At the end of the day at Disneyland 

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.290
 Randy told me 

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.800
 Danny, fast, they are going to close! 

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.100
 We have to hurry 

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.320
 And this represents a special attraction. 

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.890
 The sweet spot of Disney World (note: the location that best understands the Disney essence) 

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.470
 Have a bridge 

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.190
 At the end of each day 

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.570
 Disney World will arrange a fireworks bridge 

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.160
 And Randy knows to stand there. 

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.040
 Is the best place to watch a fireworks show 

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.540
 We stood there watching the fireworks show 

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.760
 This is really wonderful. 

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:57.300
 I am really grateful to know Randy. 

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.200
 thank you all 

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.840
 Hi 

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.870
 I am Dan. Swatch 

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.730
 I am the director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. 

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.070
 I want to be from the point of view of the person in charge of the department. 

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:26.230
 To share Randy’s contribution to the Human-Computer Interaction Institute 

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.940
 One week before the opening of the "Last Speech" 

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.930
 Randy asked me for a photo of me. 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.800
 I sent him a photo that didn't meet his needs. 

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.380
 Randy asked me for another photo. 

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.650
 I know that he must have his purpose in doing this. 

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.870
 In the course of the speech 

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.040
 Can be listed in Randy's slides of his bosses 

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.740
 See your photo 

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.060
 I am surprised and honored 

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.660
 But how did I become the owner of Randy? 

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.310
 I was about to quit at the time. 

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.710
 The position of director of the National Science Foundation Research Center 

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.930
 Randy entered my office 

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.840
 Then Randy asked me to say 

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.980
 Willing to take over the position of director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute 

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.510
 As a trained electronic engineer 

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.010
 I used to design computers with some 

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.060
 Working with students from the Department of Computing 

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.440
 And there have been social scientists and cognitive psychologists. 

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:12.650
 And the idea that the designer works together 

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.730
 Tigger is disturbing in my heart 

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.220
 So I asked Randy. 

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.810
 Why does he think 

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.020
 I can be qualified as the director of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute. 

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.380
 Randy said 

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.580
 He is a member of the New Leaders Committee 

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.410
 Those research committees threatened him to say 

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.750
 If he does not find a leader candidate 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.710
 Nalandi will be the leader 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.020
 And Randy doesn't want that job. 

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.990
 So Randy is really honest enough. 

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:38.540
 I almost didn't wait for me to be ready. 

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.900
 Randy started to his new boss 

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.480
 Infusion time management principle 

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.310
 He does not want to attend the faculty meeting 

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.010
 But if there is a difficult job that I have to do 

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.530
 Just call Randy 

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.790
 He will help 

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.570
 in every aspects 

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.840
 When the leader of the department is a lonely job 

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.840
 Only a few people can explore new ideas with you. 

00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:59.930
 Several times 

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.680
 I bothered him during Randy’s working hours. 

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.380
 I hope his assistance 

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.970
 I will send an email to Randy. 

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.020
 Ask him if he has time to talk to me 

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.770
 After a few hours 

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.250
 He will appear at my door 

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:12.660
 I will explain to him in my cognition. 

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.850
 This is a very complicated situation 

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.150
 Then he will make a simple summary 

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.150
 And showed his conclusion 

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.170
 His vision is very accurate in human behavior. 

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.620
 In the middle of his conversation 

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.690
 Randy will always stand at the door 

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.490
 Let us stay focused on each other 

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.980
 This is another dogma of his time management. 

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.980
 a dogma he believes in every day 

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.020
 In August 2006 

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.310
 One day Randy ran into my office. 

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.450
 He is carrying a laptop 

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.570
 And sitting at my conference table 

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.850
 I feel an unusual thing is about to happen. 

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.990
 Randy did not comply with his time management dogma 

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.410
 He told me that he had pancreatic cancer 

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.740
 Scanned 

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.430
 Cancer cells can be seen 

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.150
 Randy will come to my office regularly 

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.810
 Tell me the latest situation of the condition 

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.440
 His office description in August 2007 

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.320
 Especially I feel sad 

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.590
 But then 

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.320
 Randy is still holding 

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.080
 He will be a minority of hopes to survive 

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.030
 Randy is a good citizen forever. 

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.030
 When there is a problem with the faculty on the department 

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:12.470
 Will help fill the required funding gap 

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.580
 Randy is in his own medical problem 

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.900
 I thought about the plan that I didn’t need to support at all. 

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.650
 To support his research and salary 

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.860
 Randy is also very practical 

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.380
 He often humorously states his own grace. 

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.540
 So he won’t be too complacent. 

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.930
 In one communication 

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:33.590
 I told Randy 

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.310
 When I told someone about his story of pancreatic cancer 

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.990
 I feel great glory for him. 

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:39.620
 I never thought I would know one. 

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.390
 You can go to Oprah's talk show 

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.710
 Can also be on the cover of Parade magazine 

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.140
 Randy’s answer is 

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.200
 I should put my goal a little further. 

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.950
 This is of course how Andy teaches Randy how to reply to those 

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.820
 Has reached a set of responses from his standard students 

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.130
 Randy’s concern for her companions is amazing. 

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.110
 Surprisingly 

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.610
 When his cancer relapses again 

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.520
 And preparing his "final speech" 

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.340
 His family moved to a nearby Virginia home. 

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.150
 And manage his finances 

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.640
 Everything mentioned above 

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.370
 Are a full-time job 

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.780
 He sent me a few emails to confirm 

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.090
 If I didn't appear in the final speech 

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.080
 Will I be hurt because of this? 

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.780
 That kind of thought never appeared on me. 

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.780
 But it happened to Randy. 

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:35.190
 So when the faculty heard Randy’s cancer recurring 

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.440
 Many suggestions from different places 

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.470
 Spontaneously appeared 

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.540
 This also highlights Randy’s inspiring leadership 

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.510
 They decided to put "the third stage laboratory" 

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.500
 Renamed "Randy Bowt Lab" 

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.190
 This is Randy’s photo of the laboratory’s signature 

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:58.180
 This photo also appeared in the Last Lecture. 

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.090
 The word above is made by Sarah. 

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.930
 She is a professor at the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.640
 The picture is provided by Reagan 

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.100
 He is an alumnus of the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:11.810
 The sign was placed behind a mirror 

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.920
 So you have to see it through a piece of glass. 

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.840
 to conclude 

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.810
 Randy has a mysterious ability 

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.980
 Ability to translate complex problems into simple principles 

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.440
 And he will use some good-looking image stories. 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.340
 To describe those principles 

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.060
 Randy called for 

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.420
 Those principles can be applied to all situations 

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.560
 I have a photo of him at my desk. 

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.550
 And I am looking forward to Randy 

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.590
 Tigger 

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.850
 Come visit me at any time. 

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.540
 I miss Randy very much. 

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.030
 And his wise advice 

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.220
 When I have a difficult problem to solve 

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.890
 I will ask myself 

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.250
 What does Randy say? 

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.570
 thank you all 

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.450
 Hello 

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.600
 I am Dennis. Kaskov 

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.600
 We pull back the time 

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.430
 Randy is a professor who just entered the University of Virginia. 

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.320
 very quickly 

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.550
 You can learn from the mouth of college students. 

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.880
 If you want to take Randy’s class 

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.980
 You have to make a thorough adjustment of your entire trip. 

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.030
 No matter what the prerequisites are 

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.960
 No matter what happens 

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.020
 You must reschedule your itinerary 

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.670
 You confirm that you want to go to the information structure he opened in the spring. 

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.920
 Or a lesson that his friend opened in the fall. 

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.690
 And this is for people 

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.750
 Should not cause much surprise 

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.580
 We have heard a lot of people applaud 

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.920
 He is a very great teacher 

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.020
 We have heard that he received the Good Teacher Award. 

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.130
 We have also heard about building virtual world courses. 

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.190
 This class will be handed over to students from outside the school. 

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:46.570
 Let me think a little more 

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.810
 Danny mentioned the famous 砸VCR event 

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.700
 I think Randy has the ability to attract people’s attention. 

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.020
 And can achieve a balance between teaching and attraction 

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.440
 So he has the ability to teach them 

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.380
 This is very admirable 

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.070
 You can see why he became famous. 

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.050
 This story is easy to tell 

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.790
 And it is a very good and great story 

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.030
 But his class is great 

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.920
 Not because of those eye-catching gimmicks 

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.180
 But the essence behind the class 

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.960
 Especially in "data structure" and "algorithm" 

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.360
 In the two lessons at a glance 

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.370
 For those who have not taken a computer science course 

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.590
 Algorithm is a very mathematical thing 

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:27.590
 There is a former Randy professor instructor. 

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.580
 You will be very surprised 

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.130
 Randy was arrested for teaching algorithms 

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.190
 But this is a necessary lesson 

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.640
 He still went to teach 

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.110
 He did 

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.510
 And this thing is really outside his comfort zone 

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:46.180
 The algorithmic course has no eye-catching way of attending classes. 

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.700
 There are no real objects visible 

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.470
 There is no graphic to attract people's attention to it. 

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.480
 For many people 

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.790
 It can be a boring lesson 

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.410
 Can also be a great course 

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.330
 This class is not just good. 

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.150
 But it’s great 

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.750
 This is the ins and outs of the whole thing. 

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.000
 you know 

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.330
 He made these things great and gorgeous 

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.700
 This is great 

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.620
 He deserves a lot of appreciation. 

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.170
 And this is really what he deserves. 

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.050
 The hidden meaning behind this is 

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.470
 He has the ability to find the most appropriate example in the algorithm. 

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.550
 As of today 

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.770
 My understanding of Huffman coding 

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.400
 Maybe more than what I have learned 

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.700
 That's because he raised the Italian parliament. 

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.020
 And how the parliament is formed into a perfect analogy 

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.350
 So now I understand 

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.390
 How does compression work? 

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.800
 Parliamentary government organization 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.870
 And this is what I have learned. 

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.540
 you know 

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.570
 Just like in the 1980s 

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.900
 So if anyone is interested in this 

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.900
 I can talk to me afterwards. 

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:43.400
 I will be very happy to share this with you. 

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.450
 I think there is an analogy 

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.440
 Can be likened to "Randy is a great teacher" 

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.950
 And "How does he fight against pancreatic cancer?" 

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.130
 We all saw the "Last Speech" 

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.720
 How incredible is it to inspire people 

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.830
 And in an unimaginable coercion 

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.520
 Can also speak 

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.270
 And show people to himself 

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:10.410
 This minute he explained that the matter is coming to an end. 

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.940
 This is his death. 

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.040
 But in the next minute 

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.970
 He made us all laugh 

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.180
 How incredible this is. 

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.490
 How inspiring this is for people 

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.540
 How impressive his conversation is 

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.330
 What kind of speech is this? 

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.560
 How can you take him off? 

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.140
 I think 

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.500
 This thing has a greatness that exceeds our expectations. 

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.030
 And far-reaching effects 

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.100
 But I am not surprised that it has such influence. 

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.390
 We should be inspired by these words 

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.380
 And I think this will be his great heritage. 

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.830
 But for me 

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.720
 more importantly 

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.210
 I will remember the words behind them. 

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.240
 What kind of true meaning exists hidden 

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.670
 From the time I have known Randy for a long time 

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.420
 He has such virtues 

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.370
 Don't spend any time 

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.230
 Don't waste any moment 

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.400
 Don't say "Why me?" 

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.580
 It means "What is the problem, how can we solve it?" 

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.020
 Turn a corner 

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.270
 despite this 

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.550
 He doesn't have to do this. 

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:08.160
 I am referring to the matter of "knowing the problem and solving the problem" 

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.330
 If I can "handle the cold air in my rental house, I have to deal with it" 

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.970
 Can have the above ideas 

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.750
 It will be quite admirable 

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.160
 Everyday things in life are treated like this 

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.430
 But surprisingly 

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:23.370
 In the unfair to unbelievable pancreatic cancer 

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.540
 Still able to keep this idea 

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.840
 Even more surprising is 

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.810
 Behind this matter 

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.400
 He can still maintain amazing consistency 

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.440
 He got pancreatic cancer 

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.920
 Then immediately think with Jessica 

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.270
 How do you go next? 

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.720
 What is the best solution? 

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.250
 At a speed that is too fast 

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.240
 To proceed to the next countermeasure 

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.450
 He will say 

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.370
 "They clear the cancer cells just like removing the fish's internal organs." 

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.100
 "Everything will end safely" 

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.350
 "This will be my best chance." 

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:02.950
 "I will receive the strongest chemotherapy and radiation therapy." 

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:06.120
 "Because I only have the greatest chance to survive." 

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.760
 "And continue to live with my wife." 

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.400
 And he is not only concerned about this. 

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.470
 "I may die in this extremely dangerous operation." 

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.560
 "So I have to guide Caitlin's paper quickly." 

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.650
 "For her, because of my death" 

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.580
 "And she wants to complete the paper under such circumstances." 

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.030
 "How unfair this is." 

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.350
 Who would think so right? 

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.480
 He has such incredible ability 

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.410
 To keep his persistence 

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.850
 And what he did later 

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.410
 Has become his witness to persistence 

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.100
 When Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C fail 

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.330
 He can still be a week before the deadline 

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.900
 Thinking plan K and plan J 

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.300
 And think about something in his heart. 

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.300
 Just like a horror picture 

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.070
 Sitting in the study room with him 

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.790
 He seems to be a portrayal of strength 

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:54.970
 Continue to struggle 

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.240
 Care about you and your research team 

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.060
 And some negligible questions 

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.180
 He is there to help 

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:09.530
 I think this is why I always remember Randy. 

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.150
 "The most persistent thing about his persistence" 

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.860
 At last 

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.580
 This is actually not entirely surprising. 

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.180
 This is exactly what you expect Randy to do. 

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.480
 From knowing his deep and shallow 

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.520
 He will give different levels of feedback 

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.470
 But this does not make you less impressed 

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.950
 So why is this? 

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.120
 I will remember him forever. 

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.080
 thank you all 

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.440
 Hello 

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.500
 I am called Don. 

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:49.040
 I am building and guiding with Randy. 

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.670
 Carnegie Mellon University Entertainment Technology Center 

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:57.080
 For those who know me through Randy’s "Last Speech" 

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.580
 "Tornado" is a more widely known nickname for me. 

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.160
 Randy's speech 

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.330
 Built a lot of fame in the world for me. 

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.840
 Actually 

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.290
 My wife has dinner with me recently. 

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.890
 I was wearing a POLO shirt at the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.870
 And noticed that the waiter is constantly aiming 

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.070
 Entertainment Technology Center logo in front of my shirt 

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.660
 He finally asked me finally. 

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.180
 Do you know Randy? 

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.880
 I nodded 

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.960
 From the "Last Speech" 

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.480
 I have been asked many times like this. 

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.730
 And explain how Randy created the Entertainment Technology Center with me. 

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.630
 While I am speaking 

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.640
 The waiter suddenly stepped back and shouted 

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.040
 "Oh! God!" 

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.850
 "You are the guy who made him live in hell for six years." 

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.100
 Without doubt 

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:52.770
 This will be the way to win a generous tip. 

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.640
 We will work together 

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.730
 Because Jerry’s principal thinks 

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.280
 The new field of entertainment technology is a 

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.670
 Compared with other separate fields 

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:08.720
 a broader field 

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.510
 I said those geniuses. 

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:12.450
 John Lassat 

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.570
 Ed Katemore, Steve Jabbers 

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:15.570
 And a few other people 

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.170
 They are not willing to move to Pittsburgh. 

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.570
 So in addition to a group of people with sincere desire 

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:27.240
 a technical barrier between technology and art 

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:32.770
 Breakthrough computer scientists gathered together 

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.680
 but me 

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:35.990
 a professor of drama 

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:40.370
 Boldly toward a place where there is no drama at all 

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.640
 School of Computer Science 

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.250
 I am trying to learn from there. 

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:52.500
 Interactive entertainment behind this amazing new world 

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.550
 It is called video game 

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.020
 First encounter Randy 

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.570
 Not because of personal factors 

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:03.250
 But because I participated in the "Building a Virtual World Show" 

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.980
 To tell the truth 

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.840
 I was confused about the "Building a Virtual World Show". 

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.700
 I am from the theater 

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.860
 A show is everything 

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.660
 When I first saw the construction of a virtual world show 

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.010
 I think it is still more like 

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:22.780
 Spring Carnival Funny Short Play Collection 

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.820
 Honestly 

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.150
 I couldn’t understand the true meaning of it at that time. 

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.400
 I often secretly yelled in my heart. 

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.550
 Is this a student at Carnegie Mellon University? 

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.620
 An extraordinary show that must be watched at the end of the semester 

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:40.110
 Why is such an amateur funny short play, essay 

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.900
 And technical hodgepodge 

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.290
 For many students 

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.660
 Is it the climax of their entire semester? 

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.940
 After pondering 

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.200
 I went on to understand 

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.710
 In fact, after so many years 

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.730
 Building a virtual world is a combination of technology 

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.650
 And the vision created through interactivity 

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:04.190
 To understand the stage of imagination 

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.020
 This impression is in my visit 

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.900
 The third stage of the Wean building 

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.040
 More enhanced 

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.580
 Unlike a monotonous lab 

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:22.120
 I saw a real, multicolored, spatial lighting 

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.230
 And a toy kingdom filled with stuffed toys everywhere 

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.230
 And the most important 

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:33.620
 Committed to enabling students to learn while playing 

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.770
 This achievement is worthy of respect 

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.530
 This respect is also mentioned by Randy in the "Last Speech" 

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.090
 And get approval 

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.610
 He and I are very different in many ways. 

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:52.550
 Although we have similar places in many other ways 

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.390
 This will be mentioned later 

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.020
 We are all tough guys 

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.980
 We are not people who will retreat 

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.500
 So Jerry wants us to be together 

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.170
 This is called the Entertainment Technology Center. 

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.610
 The colleagues inside are betting 

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.890
 Who will I be with Randy first? 

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:16.000
 One of the three rivers in Pittsburgh 

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:22.530
 I found out that Randy is intimidating. 

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:25.630
 But that is not his fault. 

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.060
 Randy has some 

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.410
 I think the qualities I need when I grow up as adults 

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.120
 I mean 

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.660
 His tall man 

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:41.990
 Brunette, handsome, healthy, outstanding, masculine 

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.080
 And attractive scientists 

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.950
 Dress up and join the look of the beach boy 

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.670
 Instead of being a professor in the Department of Computer Science 

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.820
 For me, when I have these qualities 

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.330
 Randy is a standard American 

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.390
 but me 

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.420
 relatively 

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.230
 Is a mature 

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.040
 American-born Liberian from Brooklyn, New York 

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.960
 a lifetime actor 

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.820
 In addition to having a theater, history, literature 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.000
 And a critical doctoral degree 

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.060
 Dressed up like an overweight Italian 

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.620
 Or the mafia killer 

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.700
 Especially for computer scientists 

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:22.600
 Randy is a real sense of humor and good at expressing 

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.870
 a man of good demeanor and dare to dream 

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.990
 He is so straightforward and beneficial to people. 

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.960
 As a member of the world's human race 

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.010
 It’s hard to see people like this 

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.110
 In my growing up of Brooklyn or Miami 

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.370
 It is absolutely invisible 

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.520
 He does not smoke 

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.990
 do not drink 

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.750
 At most, it is a polite drink. 

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.450
 He will not be caught by him. 

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.200
 He is a real workaholic 

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.590
 Even if he is not qualified enough to get overtime pay 

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:58.340
 He also has incredible attention to health. 

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.530
 Really exercise in the gym every day 

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.090
 Playing team sports 

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.470
 Avoid spicy food 

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.500
 Italian salami, Italian cooked meat and ham are not cut 

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.010
 Never listen to rock music 

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.330
 Never figured out to participate 

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.700
 Drug research that makes people feel happy 

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:29.440
 And proud to be a blindly optimistic person 

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.940
 Boasting to everyone at the same time 

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:35.430
 He is a tigger rather than an eel 

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.800
 Trust me 

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.620
 Bensonhurst in Brooklyn 

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.140
 Is a claim that no one will be proud 

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.250
 I am a tigger 

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.790
 Tigger is named after the syllable of the drive (tigger, trigger) 

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.160
 It is one when you walk on the 14th Street 

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.340
 Read aloud the words that people will erect 

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.200
 This guy is an eagle scout 

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.130
 I am looking forward to his flying wings. 

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.610
 For me 

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:07.680
 The real finale is 

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:14.450
 I know that Randy eats the same thing every day in Chinese food. 

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.980
 White noodles wrapped in a layer of mayonnaise 

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.240
 With turkey 

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.280
 Shortly after we first met 

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.320
 I told him that 

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.850
 Other unique one 

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.950
 I know people who eat the same thing every day at lunch. 

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:31.310
 Is my wife 

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:35.150
 This sign is somewhat disturbing 

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:41.750
 Because my wife and I are the best witnesses of the opposite sex. 

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.060
 This seems to explain 

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.060
 Randy and I will not only work together 

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.250
 And also because of the entertainment technology center 

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.980
 Professional marriage (meaning cooperation) 

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.180
 And it happened too 

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.820
 Randy and I soon became "twin" movies. 

00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.000
 Carnegie Mellon version of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny 

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.410
 But this is a new field of interactive entertainment. 

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.210
 Need a combination of art and technology 

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.280
 Randy and I learned 

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.760
 We must be the first model 

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.930
 If he and I can overcome the difference between us 

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.050
 And work together 

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:24.130
 Then we have a good chance to see 

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.390
 Software that truly embodies leadership and educational implications 

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.540
 It can create new processes, new tools 

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:37.300
 And a new vision for storytelling, entertainment and education 

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.930
 So today I am here to appeal to everyone. 

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.290
 We can't let Randy die. 

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.920
 The worst thing in my estimation is 

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:53.350
 Randy's wisdom and his life story 

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:57.470
 Will be forgotten on New Year's Eve 

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.680
 Or discard it after three weeks of doing what Randy said. 

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.410
 If it is so long, it will be fine. 

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:02.400
 for example 

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.620
 Allow your child to draw in his own room 

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:05.980
 Is the best example 

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.340
 But this is just a relationship in life. 

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.780
 A small step in caring, caring, respecting and sharing experiences 

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.390
 in other words 

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:18.510
 Randy’s life values 

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:19.690
 Honestly 

00:53:19.690 --> 00:53:21.520
 In our country 

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.970
 Parents are allowed to draw in the room and be educated 

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.990
 This fact needs to be watched 

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:31.550
 An essential component of a great story 

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:35.380
 A truly great story with great appeal 

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.380
 Is the protagonist and hero of the story. 

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.250
 Got some conversions 

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.440
 a journey that will change lives 

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:48.260
 Or the main conversion of adventure 

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.740
 For those who know Randy or work with Randy 

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.170
 a hot professor 

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.080
 University life full of fun 

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.430
 And the pursuit of Jie Yi 

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:03.880
 Their marriage 

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:07.280
 And Randy becomes a super family man 

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.160
 Randy in the process 

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.740
 The changes experienced are unquestionable 

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.390
 How to play Jie Yi’s husband 

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.780
 Dylan, Logan and Chloe's father 

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:18.170
 Is his most famous 

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.420
 Talking about love 

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.110
 Before with Jie Yi, family 

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:26.520
 Randy is not the person who hangs "love" all day long. 

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.830
 Maybe he needs to love his job. 

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:33.490
 But this love will never be more than their entry into his life. 

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.420
 Such deep and meaningful 

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.690
 In my estimate 

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.330
 Randy’s most eloquent words are 

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:42.310
 He said at the Carnegie Mellon University graduation ceremony this year. 

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:43.020
 When he mentioned 

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.490
 He waited until he was thirty-nine years old to get married. 

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.060
 Because it takes so long 

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.250
 Can find one 

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.050
 People who are more important than their own happiness 

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.170
 This is a very touching confession 

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.520
 This is a confession of wisdom and truth. 

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.070
 Can constitute a degree of self-realization 

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.430
 Sufficient to prove 

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.070
 He has not been white in this life. 

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.230
 For human well-being 

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:05.950
 He also did his best 

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.780
 Randy wants us to find 

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:14.020
 Is there a person whose happiness is more important than happiness? 

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.250
 In fact, this is to tell us in his way. 

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:19.430
 We have to think for others 

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.870
 Everyone who thinks for themselves 

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.670
 Will walk into the dead end 

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.530
 This is the limit of arrogance failure 

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:28.160
 and so 

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:31.660
 The origins of the Carnegie Mellon University Entertainment Technology Center 

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:35.030
 Randy-Comet 

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:38.350
 And a trip to Tang-Tornado 

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:40.380
 When Randy used his extraordinary light 

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.360
 As well as insight, knowledge, fatherly advice 

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.550
 Crystal particle tail with wisdom 

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.560
 To illustrate the so-called paradise 

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.540
 I will continue to look for confirmation. 

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:55.440
 The paradise he believes is evidence of non-existence 

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.050
 Randy never likes to discuss or argue 

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.230
 Things about religion or supernatural powers 

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.390
 And these are things that I totally believe. 

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:03.110
 Actually 

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.440
 It is my fascination with human beings. 

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.740
 But there is a heavenly and spiritual level. 

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:14.690
 That is, Randy is indeed deep inside me. 

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.070
 Changed me profoundly 

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:18.640
 deep in the heart 

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:20.230
 He elaborated an intrinsic dimension 

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.170
 Make me think again 

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:28.210
 I think that I already know the knowledge, information, causality 

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.630
 And let everyone's life 

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.900
 Live faster and more fulfilling meaning 

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:35.240
 Yes 

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.260
 Randy 

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.370
 I 

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.090
 a short accomplice 

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.920
 Loudly and clearly heard 

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.920
 Because this morning 

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:46.840
 Early morning 

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.670
 I went to buy an Apple computer. 

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:10.980
 My signing is poor 

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:12.460
 So I have to be behind Don. 

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.740
 I am called Jesse. Shel 

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.060
 I first met Randy in 1995. 

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.020
 When I was working in the Disney Dream Project 

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.040
 I was a new person at the time. 

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.420
 I just got a job for about three weeks. 

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.470
 But my boss John 

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:32.640
 Call me into his office and tell me 

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.950
 listen 

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:37.090
 There is a university professor coming 

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:38.460
 And dangle in our studio 

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.560
 It’s a bit of observation 

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:42.480
 I want you to do a few things. 

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:42.870
 the first 

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.390
 I want you to give him anything he might need. 

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:48.140
 Technical support, collecting information, etc. 

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.150
 second 

00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:53.880
 Make sure he doesn't get any trouble 

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.430
 For people who know Randy 

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:57.170
 You may guess 

00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:01.000
 These two things are more difficult to engage in 

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.740
 From now to now 

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:08.010
 Few people mentioned that Randy likes to give others straightforward advice. 

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.650
 Whether you believe it or not 

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.660
 Many people who have been in Hollywood for 30 years 

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.960
 Not necessarily ready to listen to a university professor 

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.320
 Give them straightforward advice on how to improve the process 

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:25.120
 So I am a little bit helping him. 

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:29.280
 Learn about some of Disney’s policies 

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:32.720
 And he also learned very quickly 

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.660
 Then we start working 

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.380
 What we have to do is 

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.900
 In Florida 

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:42.290
 There is a virtual reality experience that builds the Aladdin Magic Blanket. 

00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:44.010
 Randy wants to study very much. 

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.430
 Because he is very fascinated by how it works. 

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.770
 And my job is to help him. 

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:52.030
 So that we can collect data from it. 

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:53.670
 And this amount of information is really big. 

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:54.220
 You didn't get it wrong 

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.450
 This is something in 1995 

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:58.020
 We have collected several megabytes of data. 

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:00.070
 Every little trick on everyone 

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.140
 Have been recorded 

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.500
 We must reinvent the system built in Florida. 

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.900
 We want to make sure it doesn't break 

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:11.100
 And it won't suffer any damage to performance 

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.770
 That is a big project 

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.070
 I have to write all the programs 

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:17.940
 And I am not sure if this will work. 

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.060
 I told Randy 

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.670
 We don't have much time 

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:21.880
 This is not easy 

00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.310
 If you messed up, there will be big trouble. 

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:26.690
 And I don't know if I can do it. 

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:28.820
 He just watched me tell me 

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:33.250
 "Do you know, you can do more than you think." 

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:34.930
 He is right 

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:35.800
 I work very hard 

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.780
 We are very focused on this matter. 

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.780
 And finally completed the construction 

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:41.360
 We have completed and collected a lot of information 

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:45.450
 Later became the material in his outstanding paper 

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.030
 When he left 

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:55.570
 We still keep in touch 

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:57.430
 to me 

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.120
 He is like a spiritual teacher 

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.360
 Even if we are not a partner at work 

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.500
 For many people 

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.230
 Randy plays the spiritual teacher in this way. 

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.720
 We often chat and discuss many things together. 

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.050
 After a while he said 

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.070
 "I hope that you can come to the Imaging Annual Conference to give a speech." 

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:13.110
 I said, "I? Go to the Video Academic Annual Conference?" 

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.800
 "I don't know, the Image Academic Annual Meeting feels very badly bullied." 

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.480
 "I don't know what I can do to make people feel good." 

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:24.180
 "I don't know if I can make them interested and impressed." 

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.000
 He told me again 

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:28.810
 "You can do more than you think." 

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:30.280
 So I went and gave a speech. 

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.430
 What surprised me was that this speech was very successful. 

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.950
 quickly 

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:37.290
 I became a frequent guest at the Image Academic Annual Conference and other seminars. 

01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.840
 I am very grateful for his encouragement to me. 

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.460
 After a few years 

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.440
 We started talking about 

01:00:42.450 --> 01:00:45.570
 Is it possible for me to teach at Carnegie Mellon University? 

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.280
 I really want Carnegie Mellon to teach. 

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.880
 But I said again: "I am not sure!" 

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.470
 "Do you think I can really help those students?" 

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.870
 Then he said 

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.890
 "Yes, you can do more than you think." 

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:02.720
 After that, I came here to teach. 

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.510
 A publisher has contacted me and said 

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.730
 "We hope to ask you to write a textbook about game design." 

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:07.130
 I think 

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.220
 It sounds very exciting 

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.700
 But I never wrote a book. 

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.620
 I don't know how to write 

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.040
 I started talking to other people about this. 

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:12.920
 Then I talked to Randy about this. 

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.970
 I said, "What do you think about this?" 

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.740
 "I am not sure, I don't seem to be suitable for writing books." 

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.530
 Then he said, "You still don't understand it until now?" 

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:24.840
 "You can do more than you think!" 

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.710
 And when my students are 

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.340
 Whether they can complete the project and feel confident 

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.560
 This sentence is always with me. 

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.200
 I will think of Randy and tell them 

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:40.460
 "You can do more than you think." 

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.360
 Tiger father has no dogs, they have completed the project. 

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:47.010
 to some extent 

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.150
 I regard this sentence as the philosophy of Randy in the nut. 

01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:52.000
 There is no doubt that 

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.000
 This is his philosophy of life. 

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:56.160
 I think 

01:01:56.170 --> 01:02:01.540
 Thanks for the "Last Speech" 

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:07.030
 It expresses intimate messages to family and friends. 

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:11.930
 Eventually moved many people around the world 

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.580
 And care about their relatives and friends 

01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.450
 The Last Speech will be ours 

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.240
 Witness to "Man who can do more than I imagine" 

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.860
 Thank you Randy 

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.800
 Thank you for your challenge to me. 

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.790
 Thank you for challenging us all. 

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.910
 I am called Jerry. 

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:51.990
 I am the principal of Carnegie Mellon University. 

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.730
 Randy was in my eleven years as president 

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.610
 Come to me twice 

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.150
 Both are his own 

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.240
 We will meet regularly 

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.740
 To update my news about the Entertainment Technology Center 

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.880
 The first time I met was ten years ago. 

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.490
 This gives me a chance to correct this record. 

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.990
 Tang gave you an impression 

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.170
 Is the principal of the university 

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.200
 Sitting in his office and saying 

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.580
 "We need to design a master's degree in video games." 

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:32.250
 "And I know that two people can do this." 

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.530
 Things are not like this. 

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.900
 At the time, this meeting was on my calendar. 

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.650
 Tang and Randy, Drama and Computer Science 

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.350
 Aroused my interest 

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.660
 They came to my meeting room 

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.550
 And give me the ball directly. 

01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:50.750
 "What we want is to design a master's degree in video games." 

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:51.360
 "But please don't worry." 

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:53.650
 "We will name it entertainment technology." 

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:55.310
 "No one will know its real name." 

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.540
 "You must find space and find money." 

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:02.710
 Actually 

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.440
 When they learned that they could not find financial support 

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.630
 They said, "Don't worry, we will find a way to get it running." 

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.190
 "Can we continue to do it?" 

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.740
 I said, "Of course, why not?" 

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:15.410
 To the day of his death 

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:17.110
 Randy will tell me 

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:19.160
 "I am a lucky guy." 

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.230
 "Being crazy in college" 

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:27.980
 "Put people like Tang and me to do these things." 

01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:31.390
 Randy’s second visit was two years ago. 

01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:35.900
 That day is September 11, 2006. 

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:40.570
 I went to the waiting room and wanted to greet him. 

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.620
 Like everyone who knows Randy 

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:48.760
 My relationship with him is based on jokes. 

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.870
 He is very thin 

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:54.830
 I said, "God, it seems that you are in good shape." 

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.920
 "It's like your youth in high school." 

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.180
 He came in to my office and said 

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:04.360
 "I am getting dying because of cancer. I have cancer." 

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.240
 Those who have seen his "The Last Speech" 

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:11.140
 I know what he did. 

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.150
 He fell to the ground 

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:14.810
 And began to make a push to stand up 

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.650
 Just like what Dennis said before. 

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.440
 Randy uses his remaining time 

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.010
 Come to me to make sure everything goes well 

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.740
 Alice’s plan is going smoothly 

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.810
 Entertainment Technology Center will continue to operate 

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:30.570
 I tried to tell him 

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:31.780
 "Randy, what can we do for you?" 

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.930
 Randy: "No, no, no, Alice plans will continue to do it." 

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:36.570
 "Don't worry about the Entertainment Technology Center." 

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.540
 This is a very classic Randy 

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:44.990
 That was what he said on the same day of the "Last Speech" a year ago. 

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.850
 You all know 

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.900
 Many people mentioned 

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:54.410
 It really touched thousands of people 

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.300
 He and Jeff 

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:59.930
 A book written by our alumni in 1980 

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.940
 Sold four million copies 

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.000
 Translated into 36 languages 

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.300
 Randy took the Oprah show twice, BBC News 

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.770
 And special reports from the Entertainment Technology Center 

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.570
 When you ask Randy why do this? 

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.240
 Is the most concerned thing for all media 

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.620
 He quickly gave an answer 

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.620
 There are two reasons 

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.140
 the first 

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:29.090
 Let the world know this horrible disease - pancreatic cancer 

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:30.200
 Second point 

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.610
 Because he loves Carnegie Mellon University 

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.150
 He is not shy to promote Carnegie Mellon University. 

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.410
 Only Randy can be his way 

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.580
 Promote Carnegie Mellon University 

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.170
 I am employed to promote Carnegie Mellon University 

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:45.230
 For his promotion 

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:47.200
 I feel ashamed of myself. 

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.600
 He loves Carnegie Mellon 

01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:51.000
 Talking about love 

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:53.380
 I want to talk about it again. 

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.020
 For Randy 

01:06:55.050 --> 01:06:58.060
 "Love" is a word with special meaning 

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.440
 I don't think he has any advice from Don. 

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.880
 And often put that word on the lips 

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.170
 I am not talking about the status of Carnegie Mellon University. 

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:07.320
 Equal to Jieyi and his children 

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.410
 Please don't misunderstand me. 

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:11.750
 But he really loves this place 

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.540
 you know 

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:15.340
 I received many condolences after Randy’s death. 

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:18.780
 I have received letters from many friends and relatives. 

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.130
 I also received letters from many people I don’t know. 

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.860
 They only know that I am the principal of Carnegie Mellon University. 

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.620
 I met people on the street. 

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:29.760
 They expressed their condolences to me. 

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.640
 This really makes sense 

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.020
 Part of the reason is of course because 

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:39.260
 Want to convey their grief to those who are willing to receive 

01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:41.310
 That is, I am mourning together. 

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:45.620
 But I also learned from it. 

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.870
 When Randy passed away 

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:52.510
 Carnegie Mellon University lost a very important treasure 

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:55.870
 He is a good professor and a good teacher. 

01:07:55.870 --> 01:08:00.780
 Good scholar, good colleague, good friend 

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.630
 But Randy wants a different way. 

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.480
 Come to Glory Carnegie Mellon University 

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.310
 For him after the "Last Speech" 

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:13.510
 In the last few months of life 

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.820
 Unscrupulous promotion of Carnegie Mellon University 

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.640
 We owe him a lot 

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.560
 The purpose of his doing so 

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.720
 It is his understanding of Carnegie Mellon University. 

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.910
 This is an allowable professor 

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.320
 Do the places where he used to do crazy things. 

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:38.520
 One can make people like Randy rise 

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:40.580
 And let the world know the environment 

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:43.420
 For this we will always be grateful 

01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:45.420
 Tang is right 

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.960
 We can't let Randy die. 

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:50.730
 Can't let Randy's heritage disappear 

01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:54.270
 We will do everything we can to pass on everything 

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:56.910
 This may not be appropriate 

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.910
 But this bridge 

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:00.860
 Is our hope 

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:06.310
 a building that everyone walks through every day 

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.790
 I dare say 

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.020
 Because of its location 

01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:11.970
 It will have hundreds of people walking by 

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:14.480
 I want everyone to understand clearly. 

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.540
 This is not my idea 

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.160
 I am just honored to be at the end of the Final Speech. 

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.620
 Announce the news 

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.330
 This is Randy. Brian's idea 

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.360
 a great idea 

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.040
 We told the architect of the Gates Center Building 

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:33.710
 Thinking about how to build a 

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:38.380
 Can show the basis of the Randy concept 

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:44.850
 And to the world, everyone passing the bridge 

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:49.540
 Or people who watch in the distance convey such ideas 

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:50.950
 We are very lucky to have 

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:53.530
 a top architect, McKekin 

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:56.730
 He is definitely a very good and very sensitive person. 

01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:59.110
 He is very concerned about this case 

01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:01.210
 And also very concerned about Randy 

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.960
 He read Randy's article 

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:08.250
 He seriously realized the inheritance given by Randy. 

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.040
 Extremely concerned 

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.120
 And put these heritages in his design philosophy 

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.590
 And show the spirit of Randy 

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:19.100
 I show you his idea for you. 

01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.240
 The origin of his design is out of 

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.140
 Chapter 39 of the Final Speech 

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.700
 "Don't be afraid to be the first penguin" 

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:31.550
 In this chapter, Randy talks about 

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:35.160
 He prefers glorious failure 

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:43.150
 He created an award in the Construction Virtual Reality class. 

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.390
 Give those plans the most daring 

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.320
 But the students who ultimately failed 

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.210
 "The first penguin" 

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:52.600
 Because as you know 

01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:54.410
 The biggest challenge for penguins is 

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.800
 When they want to forage 

01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.500
 They must jump into the water with carnivores 

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.360
 Who can escape the carnivorous animal 

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.430
 Be the first penguin to find food? 

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:09.560
 This is the concept of the first penguin award. 

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.130
 And the starting point of Mack Scodin's conception 

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.020
 He uses this metaphor 

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.910
 The same idea 

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:20.440
 The first brave penguin jumped into the water 

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:30.310
 And gradually integrate it into the foundation of the design 

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:33.480
 This design still expresses the concept of penguins 

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:38.770
 And at the same time, the sea they are immersed in 

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:45.430
 And this will be what you saw on Randy Bosh Bridge. 

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:51.180
 The side panels 

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.000
 This is a view from the center of Purnell. 

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.700
 You can see these side panels 

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.580
 obviously 

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.570
 He completely integrated the idea into the building 

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:04.690
 And let you know what his philosophy is. 

01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:06.090
 Base of the bridge 

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:10.240
 Walking inside will also get the same idea 

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:14.040
 Looking towards the Gates Building 

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.390
 The bridge will be lit 

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.550
 For it there will be a lot of LED bulbs on the bridge 

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.000
 We are very happy 

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.990
 These are specially designed LED bulbs 

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.580
 Provided by Color Kinetics 

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.170
 Now part of the Philips company 

01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.660
 Is a group of companies founded by Carnegie Mellon University alumni 

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.210
 So it is especially meaningful to us. 

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.470
 Will also be taught by the Academy of Drama in the field of lighting 

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.620
 To interpret the ideas to be expressed 

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.690
 And these bulbs will be controllable through the program 

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:44.070
 If you understand the idea of ​​these lighting 

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.960
 It can show unlimited changes through the program 

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.240
 Students can also write programs 

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:52.180
 Watch on the bridge or from a distance 

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.000
 Will be quite extraordinary 

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:56.560
 Yes 

01:12:56.570 --> 01:13:01.870
 At the end of the bridge we will have brick walls 

01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.950
 We won't use other ways to present 

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.920
 This will be another key topic 

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.420
 Of course this is what Randy found. 

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.570
 I talked at the end of the "Last Speech" 

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.040
 There will be several generations of students 

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.950
 Came to Carnegie Mellon University 

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:17.370
 They don’t know Randy 

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.370
 There is no way to know Randy. 

01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:22.340
 And this bridge 

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:24.650
 Let them know 

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.360
 There is an amazing person among us. 

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.780
 Randy Bowsch 

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:33.720
 Let them know the whole picture of things 

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.460
 Also inspired them to understand 

01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:38.560
 The meaning of Randy's inheritance 

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.430
 When they ask 

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.930
 We will tell them 

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.980
 I am called David. Helden 

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.480
 I am a pastor of the First Christian Church in Pittsburgh. 

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.550
 I am very honored to host 

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:23.140
 The wedding of Jie Yi and Randy on May 20, 2000 

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.880
 after that 

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.890
 Sometimes I will welcome them as a member of the church. 

01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:35.510
 Sharing the joy of their child's birth 

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.460
 And grateful 

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:42.660
 Observing them with other community members 

01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:45.990
 Develop a permanent sense of community 

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:50.960
 Two years with Randy’s condition 

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:53.940
 My mood is ups and downs 

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:58.780
 I do my best to help him with Jie Yi. 

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:01.480
 Last July 

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.640
 I am honored to be in Chesapeake, Virginia. 

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.280
 Hosting Randy's funeral 

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:12.330
 I will talk about it next. 

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:18.310
 What I heard in Randy's "Last Speech" 

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:21.600
 Somehow 

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.110
 I heard him say 

01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:25.700
 Try to find out 

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:30.260
 For things that are inescapable, limited, fleeting 

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:32.650
 And the conditions under which humans will die 

01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:38.090
 The most creative and rewarding solution 

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.030
 Those creative and rewarding solutions 

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:45.510
 Will highlight yourself 

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:48.730
 And what can you do? 

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.620
 You may only have 35 years 

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:56.430
 Respond to the dilemma of life with creativity and profitability 

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.840
 But there may be 95 years 

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:08.190
 Or less time 

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.630
 But a creative and rewarding response 

01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:18.180
 Better than a good life 

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.700
 Also better than the fragment of incompleteness 

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:25.780
 These clips often upset our good life 

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.280
 These creative and rewarding responses 

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.990
 Will need a good life for a lifetime to brew 

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:40.310
 And these wonderful moments 

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:46.440
 Interdependent in a deliberate and open manner 

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:52.580
 This is the inheritance I heard from Randy. 

01:16:54.780 --> 01:17:04.860
 Perhaps this is the highest compliment that can be expressed to Randy. 

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.540
 We will give Randy a living testimony forever. 

01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:12.000
 By living 

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:16.410
 I mean our survival to a certain extent 

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:20.390
 Reflecting the message that Randy wants to pass on 

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:21.570
 I am not suggesting you. 

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.590
 Accepted his message without criticism 

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:27.430
 I am not saying these messages. 

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:32.160
 Will be intertwined with other wisdom 

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:36.110
 But if Randy’s message is to take us to 

01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:41.390
 a higher level of mindfulness and imagery 

01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:44.600
 That watery acceptance 

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.940
 Will not be able to keep his heritage forever 

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:55.160
 It’s really a reminder to myself and an ambition 

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.540
 Is to keep his message in mind 

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:05.050
 Really increase the moment of good life in life 

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:10.190
 Is our highest tribute to Randy 

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:12.150
 Holding such a spirit 

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:14.600
 I am willing to share with you 

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:19.150
 Those who adapted their self-colleague Dennis Hamilton 

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:27.540
 Spread hands today 

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.630
 Kindly show us it 

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:39.070
 Everyone here is taking time to come here. 

01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:46.930
 Everyone here is also getting help. 

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.560
 We still have time 

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.200
 Tell our love to our loved ones 

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.030
 We still have time 

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.240
 Apologize to those we have offended 

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.740
 We still have time to look up at the clouds in the sky 

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.320
 Sight catching the sky with birds 

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:22.750
 And watch the sun sink into the woods in the evening 

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.880
 We still have time 

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.810
 Bring our pain to the relief 

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:37.060
 And find the complete peace in there. 

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.820
 We still have time to extend our hands 

01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:46.010
 We still have time to stretch our hearts 

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.970
 We still have time to face in the mirror 

01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:00.300
 Our face is our sorrow and our freedom 

01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:03.580
 We still have time to sing 

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:07.990
 We still have time to pray, plan and build 

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:12.220
 We still have time to love 

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:18.580
 We still have time 

01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:21.710
 Because we all took the time 

01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:25.090
 Because we all get help 

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.630
 We still have time 

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.850
 Maybe it can be said 

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:34.120
 We still have time 

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.630
 Can make your personality more like a Tigger 

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:44.650
 So we have to make good use of our time 

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:48.150
 I will invite all of us. 

01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:51.140
 Stand up together for this blessing 

01:20:55.550 --> 01:21:00.420
 We all live in a profound and eternal mystery 

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.040
 With a simple heart 

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.880
 We bowed our heads in front of the veil 

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.240
 This veil blocks us and the people we love. 

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.300
 When we remember our love 

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.180
 And give the final farewell 

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.090
 Let us fearless 

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.240
 Let us transcend sentiment with love 

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.600
 Let us be confident 

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:25.730
 And believe that life is full of meaning and goals. 

01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:27.250
 Even after death 

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.830
 Human life is sacred 

01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:34.050
 His birth is sacred 

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:36.880
 His years are sacred 

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:41.010
 And his dying is also sacred 

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:44.950
 May peace be able to pass on good solutions 

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.420
 May peace be accompanied by 

01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:49.220
 Accept the facts and grateful heart 

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:50.750
 Supreme soul 

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.780
 Will resolve the growing pressure on the planet 

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.410
 And will always exist in our hearts 

01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.260
 Not only today 

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.860
 But forever 

01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:05.920
 please sit down 

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:21.110
 Randy's family, friends, colleagues 

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:22.550
 By the inheritance of his legacy 

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:26.520
 And become closer because of his passing relationship 

01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.190
 This range starts from a few small things. 

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:32.840
 Full letter in the mailbox basket 

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.180
 Lots of emails 

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:38.640
 These people who have sent letters have never seen Randy himself. 

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.260
 despite this 

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:41.250
 They used letters to indicate the legacy of Randy’s legacy. 

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.060
 How profoundly they affect them 

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.580
