There's a very clever solution to this that was developed

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by David Chaum and colleagues in 1988.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The key idea is that if the cash is only spent once, then it's anonymous,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but if it's spent twice, then the identity of the double spender is revealed.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to see if you can guess how to do it. It uses cryptographic tools that we've seen before.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The key idea is to provide this property.
