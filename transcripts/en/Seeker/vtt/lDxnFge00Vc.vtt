00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.970
Scientists are sending a submarine to Saturn's
moon Titan to explore its alien oceans in

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.370
search for life and to possibly understand
how life began on our own planet!

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.509
Researchers are studying two main oceans on
Titan.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.480
The Kraken Mare and Ligeia Mare.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.689
Both of which were discovered fairly recently
by the Cassini space probe.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.369
Ligeia Mare is less than 200 meters deep.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.110
But the Kraken Mare, we don't know how deep
it is.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.880
So sending this Submarine could answer a lot
of questions including the depth.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.579
Titan might also answer a lot of geological
Earth questions, because Titan is composed

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.910
of a nitrogen-rich atmosphere… it also has
seasonal cycles, ocean waves, possible ice

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.559
water, landscape erosions, and a hot rocky
core...

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.579
Which all sounds very familiar, it seems to
have a lot in common with with our own planet,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
Earth.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.620
The goal is to have the submarine dive deep
into the oceans and look at heavy metals that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.310
might have settled down to the bottom.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.200
They'll use a mass spectrometer to measure
the elements and see what they’re made of.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.370
In order to gather data, the submarine will
have to be prepared for these mysterious and

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.730
icy cold oceans on the moon.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.720
And there are a few obstacles to that.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.560
The pressure on Titan, for example, is about
60% more than on Earth, about the same pressure

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.280
as at the bottom of a swimming pool.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.760
So, researchers at Washington State University
partnered with NASA to try and re-create the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.890
oceans of Titan, but in a lab... here on Earth.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.020
They did this by making a pressurized chamber
and filling it with liquid methane, liquid

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.680
ethane, and nitrogen gas to simulate the environment
on Titan.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.720
Then they cooled it to about -150 degrees
C and boom a mini-Titan ocean!

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.600
Inside they were able to test possible space-going
equipment.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.850
For example, they engineered a borescope and
a video camera that could withstand the super

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.780
cold temperatures and high pressures on Titan.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.900
But unlike other probes, we can’t rely on
solar power for this mission, so they’re

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.550
planning on installing instead an RTG -- or
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.980
Basically, this sucker is nuclear.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.180
The challenges of engineering a submarine
to head to another moon is just astronomical

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.860
to use exactly the right word.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.670
But hopefully we're going to answer a lot
of unanswered questions about how life began

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.690
on our own planet, and possibly life in our
solar system.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.030

sister show Space Crafts here!

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.940
Please take a second and subscribe.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.600
Scientists know how geochemistry happens on
Earth, by the way but don’t know how the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.570
process went from geo-chem to bio-chem.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.640
So hopefully studying Titan could tell us
a lot more about how we got life on our planet.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.590
Thanks for watching.
