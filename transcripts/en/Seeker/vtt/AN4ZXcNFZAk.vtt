00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.460
Most people think they know all about the
most famous volcanic disaster ever, but the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:15.480
factual story is even more incredible than
the fiction.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.029
This August 24th is the 1936th anniversary
of the violent erasure of Pompeii from the

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.070
shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.490
I've been to Pompeii, it's beautiful, but
it's also amazingly expansive.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.400
The city of Pompeii is three square kilometers,
and excavation has been ongoing since it was

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.440
rediscovered in 1748.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.930
As archaeology continues, modern scientific
techniques are teaching us more and more about

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.180
that infamous day.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.890
Around lunchtime on August 24, 79 CE, Mount
Vesuvius exploded.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
Eyewitness Pliny the Younger (whose grandfather,
Pliny the Elder was a military officer stationed

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.520
in the region) wrote, "a cloud of unusual
size and appearance," shot into the air from

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.070
Vesuvius, reminding him of an umbrella pine
tree.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.080
At its' height on that day, Vesuvius' column
reached 27 miles (43km) into the sky before

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.800
branching out, and raining ash and pumice
stones on the 2,000 Pompeians who hadn't already

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.430
fled the city.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.860
The eruption caught people by surprise, many
fleeing the city after that initial explosion

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.990
but before the city was completely buried
by ash.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.720
But from surviving records, we know there
were signs something bad was coming.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.180
Fish were floating dead in the rivers, wells
were drying up, and the vines on the slopes

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.159
of the volcano inexplicably dried up; not
to mention increasingly violent and regular

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.720
earthquakes were hitting the region.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
Today we know, before volcanoes erupt, they
swell slightly as the pressurized magma bulb

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.620
rises through the earth, like a massive zit…

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.370
Eventually, the mountain can begin to leak
noxious gases, which might have contributed

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.020
to the death of the plants.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.799
Measurements before the eruption of Pu'u O'o
on Kilauea in 1983 found 150 tons of Sulfur

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.250
dioxide was released from the mountain per
day!

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.980
People who fled Pompeii on August 24th would
have escaped the coming disaster, but after

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.269
midnight on August 25th, between three and
six massive superheated pyroclastic surges

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.810
-- like an avalanche, but of rock, dust and
volcanic gas travelling 100 kph (62mph) -- slammed

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.900
into the city… burying Pompeii (and the
people who remained) in volcanic dust for

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.360
many hundreds of years.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.910
Looking at the distribution and type of debris
in the ash layers, scientists estimated the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.420
velocity and power of the 79 CE explosion
of Vesuvius at 165,000 tons of debris per

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.480
second, with 84 rocks per square yard per
minute raining down on the cities and temperatures

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.599
reaching 482 F (250C).

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.230
A 2013 study in Nature Communications found
a mass extinction event in the lower Cretaceous

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.480
caused by a volcano resulted in exceptional
fossil preservation, and Pompeii plays out

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480
something similar.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.030
If volcanic ash gets wet, it hardens like
cement, preserving anything trapped inside.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.450
Over time, the clothing and soft tissues of
the Pompeians decayed, and today, their dry,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.930
fragile bones and jewelry are all that survives.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.131
Some of the most famous artifacts from Pompeii
aren't the superb frescoes, houses, and even

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:27.350
bread in the ovens of the bakeries… but
casts of the Pompeians themselves.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.920
In 1777 excavators discovered an air pocket
in the shape of a body, and in 1864 (almost

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.120
100 years later!) the director of excavations
found a special mix of plaster of Paris which

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.480
could be poured INTO the cavities to mold
out a body, revealing the heartbreaking detail

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.690
of the last moments of these people.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.300
The wrong mixture of plaster can damage the
delicate remains, so of the 1150 bodies found,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.800
only 100 have been cast.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.500
Today Pompeii is a UNESCO world heritage site,
and now feeling the pains of exposure to pollution,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.190
light, weathering, and water damage.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:11.990
After heavy rains in some buildings in the
city collapsed.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.539
Even after preservation in volcanic ash for
over 1600 years, we're losing Pompeii to the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.539
elements.

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.750
Today, Vesuvius is the only active volcano
on the European continent and 700,000 people

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.490
live in "death zones" immediately surrounding
the mountain, ironically, they were drawn

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.819
there because the ash and lava flows emitted
by volcanoes create some of the most fertile

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.189
soil on earth.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.100
After a volcano erupts, the rock fragment
particles ejected are called tephra, and over

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.270
time tephra breaks down thanks to chemical
interaction from the atmosphere, resulting

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:57.639
in that super-rich soil.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:15.949
And it's only a matter of time until Vesuvius
hits it again.
