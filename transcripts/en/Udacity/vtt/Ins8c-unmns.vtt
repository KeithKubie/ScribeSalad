Welcome to Lesson Four. You've done a lot so far.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.880
You created an app and a database, you added fields

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.410
and objects, and you connected them all with relationships. You

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.730
took the default UI and you modified it, created ports

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.250
and dashboards. Yeah, your app looks pretty snazzy right now,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.510
but the underlying app just doesn't do quite enough yet.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.870
Let's go back to the music festival with Samantha and

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.939
Andy and figure out what you need to do next.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.320
&gt;&gt; So we've already talked a bit about

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.640
the planning and the business sides of the festival.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.130
&gt;&gt; But then there's actually running the festival.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.600
&gt;&gt; Right, because in my experience, there's a ton of things

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.750
that can and do go wrong, that usually get fixed immediately.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like at a festival, there could be

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.680
broken microphones, blown speakers. Bands might be running late.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.740
&gt;&gt; Right. And ideally, the solution to

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.000
these problems would be as automated as possible.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.400
SalesForce, we would use things like workflows or

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360
approval processes to solve these kinds of problems.
