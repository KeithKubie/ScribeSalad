00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.907
- [Voiceover] Over here, we have the graph

00:00:02.907 --> 00:00:06.082
of the function Y is equal to E to the X.

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:08.467
Actually, let me make that clear.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:11.953
That right over there is
Y is equal to E to the X.

00:00:11.953 --> 00:00:13.505
This is, of course, our X axis.

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.034
This is our Y axis.

00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:17.858
And so, this blue area right over here,

00:00:17.907 --> 00:00:19.766
this blue area, we can denote that

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.120
as the definite integral from zero to one

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.269
of E to the X, DX and let's say we know

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.113
in the future, we'll learn how to come up

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:29.282
with this number but
let's just say we know

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:34.282
that that area is equal to E minus one.

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:39.231
Given that, I have these
other three definite integrals

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.521
and what I encourage you to do is

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:43.065
try to pause this video
and try to evaluate

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:45.881
what this three other
definite integrals are

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:47.939
using only this information

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:49.530
and what we already know

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.790
about definite integral properties.

00:00:53.816 --> 00:00:58.155
I am assuming that you
have given a go at it.

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:00.015
You might first say, okay, let's see

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:01.440
E to the X plus two.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.461
You might be tempted to decompose this

00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:05.950
into definite integral of E to the X, DX

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.097
plus the definite integral from one to--

00:01:09.097 --> 00:01:10.965
So that you could decompose
this from one to one

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.916
at E to X, DX plus one to one,

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.636
plus the definite integral from one to one

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.793
of two DX but you have to remember

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:18.839
if you're taking the definite integral

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:20.089
where your bounds are the same.

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:22.318
This is the definite
integral from one to one.

00:01:22.318 --> 00:01:24.837
This is going to be zero.

00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:27.312
This is going to be equal to zero.

00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:28.217
Once again, you can imagine

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:29.831
that you're trying to
find the area of something

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.484
that has no width.

00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:32.826
You're not moving at all.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:35.742
You have no width along the X axis here.

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:38.585
That was pretty straightforward.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.744
From one to one, your
area is going to be zero.

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:43.913
Now, let's think through
this one over here.

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:46.108
Here my bounds are different.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:49.684
They are the same as these
bounds right over here.

00:01:49.684 --> 00:01:51.262
I guess that gives me a pretty good clue

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:53.108
that maybe if I can break
this up a little bit,

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:54.841
especially if one of these is in the form

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.896
of E to the X, I might be able

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:58.891
to evaluate this definite integral.

00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:00.061
Let's do that.

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:01.339
The first thing I could do

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:02.398
is I could break this up

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:05.091
as the definite integral from zero to one

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:08.494
of 3DX and then I could say

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:12.522
Plus the definite
integral from zero to one

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:15.622
of negative E to the X, DX

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:17.377
and then I can take the negative.

00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:19.042
That negative is really
just a negative one.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.763
We saw that you could
take that scaling factor

00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:22.583
out of the integral so let's do that.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.335
This is the same thing as the
integral from zero to one.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:29.669
3DX minus the integral from zero to one,

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.220
E to the X, DX.

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:33.703
Well, lucky for us,

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:36.742
we already know what, let me do this

00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:37.752
in that same color.

00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:39.157
We already know what this,

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:40.901
I have trouble changing colors.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.706
We already know what
this right over here is.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.569
That's going to be equal to E minus one.

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:50.591
If you subtract an E minus one,

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.868
you're going to get,

00:02:51.868 --> 00:02:52.951
actually, let me just write it out

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.466
so we donï¿½t get confused.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:59.466
We're going to subtract an E minus one,

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.478
what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.483
The definite integral
from zero to one of 3DX.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.601
We just have to graph that to imagine it.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.563
We're going from zero to one

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:16.429
and the function is that one, two, three.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.944
I'm not doing it at the same scale.

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:20.225
The function looks like that.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.605
This right over here is just this area.

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:28.845
Under the function F
of X is equal to three.

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:30.880
from zero to one

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.390
So, what's this area?

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.819
Well, this is just our base.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.144
Our width is one.

00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:36.809
Our height is three.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.625
This is just going to evaluate to three.

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.179
That's just going to be equal to three

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.049
and so, this is going to be equal to three

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.717
and you're going to have minus E,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.875
just distributing the negative side

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.742
and then plus one.

00:03:54.657 --> 00:03:57.812
And then of course, three plus one is

00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:01.756
going to be equal to four.

00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:04.139
This is going to be equal to four

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.139
minus four, minus E and we're done.

00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:12.251
We're able to solve or
I guess we say, evaluate

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.868
or find the value of
this definite integral

00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:16.409
using only integration properties

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.898
in the value of this definite integral.

00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:20.311
Now, what about this one over here?

00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:22.365
This one is interesting way.

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:23.907
I have different bounds here.

00:04:23.907 --> 00:04:25.624
Definitely go from two to three.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.968
Having E to X minus two.

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:30.245
And when you see something like this,

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:31.611
especially, if you're
trying to evaluate this

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:33.173
only with integration properties,

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.944
the big thing that may or
may not jump out of you

00:04:35.944 --> 00:04:39.010
is that E to the X minus
two is shifted version

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.875
of E to the X.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.637
It's shifted by two to the right.

00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:44.923
Let me draw that.

00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:46.310
Instead of this point being there,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.955
this point is going to be there

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:53.648
and so, the curve is going
to look something like

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:55.288
let me draw my best attempt.

00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:58.111
My best attempt to do it.

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.343
It's going to be like there.

00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:02.889
It's going to be like there.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.211
It's going to look something.

00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:09.679
I'm trying my best to just shift it over.

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:11.375
So each of these,

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:14.741
this is going to be
shifted to right over here.

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:17.729
There you go.

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:20.856
E to the X minus two.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.229
We're going from two to three

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.311
and so, what are the bounds now?

00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:26.530
The bounds are from two to three.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.323
We're going from this
point right over here

00:05:29.323 --> 00:05:31.889
to three, which is going to be over here.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.487
Just going to be over here.

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:38.208
Take this point, you shift one and two.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:39.851
You're going to get right over here

00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.903
and what do we just do?

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:44.380
We're thinking about this
area right over here.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.300
We shifted the curve
over to the right by two.

00:05:48.537 --> 00:05:51.265
This is the curve of E to the X minus two

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:53.864
and we shifted the interval event

00:05:53.864 --> 00:05:56.295
that we're trying to find the area under.

00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:57.570
We shifted that by two.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.398
This is going to have the exact same area.

00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:01.864
I just shifted everything
to the right by two.

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:07.088
This area is also going to be E minus one.

00:06:07.088 --> 00:06:08.573
In my mind, this one's
a little bit tricky.

00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:11.043
You just have to realize that this

00:06:11.213 --> 00:06:13.576
is just a shifted version of that

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:16.049
and that we also shifted the two bounds

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:17.932
to the right and we already saw that

00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:21.225
in one of the integration property videos.
