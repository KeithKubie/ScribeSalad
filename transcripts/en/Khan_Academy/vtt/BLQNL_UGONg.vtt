00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.460
We see in a triangle, or I
guess we know in a triangle,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.560
there's three angles.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900
And if we're talking
about a right triangle,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.816
like the one that I've
drawn here, one of them

00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:09.640
is going to be a right angle.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.450
And so we have two other
angles to deal with.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.220
And what I want to
explore in this video

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.020
is the relationship between
the sine of one of these angles

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.770
and the cosine of the other, the
cosine of one of these angles

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.240
and the sine of the other.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.220
So to do that, let's just
say that this angle--

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.330
I guess we could call
it angle A-- let's say

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.780
it's equal to theta.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.280
If this is equal to
theta, if it's measure is

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.810
equal to theta degrees, say,
what is the measure of angle B

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.920
going to be?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.790
Well, the thing that
will jump out at you--

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.070
and we've looked at
this in other problems--

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.750
is the sum of the
angles of a triangle

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.480
are going to be 180 degrees.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.850
And this one right over
here, it's a right triangle.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.100
So this right angle takes
up 90 of those 180 degrees.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.720
So you have 90 degrees left.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.370
So these two are going to
have to add up to 90 degrees.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.050
This one and this one,
angle A and angle B,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.150
are going to be
complements of each other.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.120
They're going to
be complementary.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.815
Or another way of
thinking about it is B

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:07.400
could be written
as 90 minus theta.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.880
If you add theta to 90
degrees minus theta,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.810
you're going to get 90 degrees.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.900
Now, why is this interesting?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.520
Well, let's think about what
the sine of theta is equal to.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.730
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.160
The opposite side is BC.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.920
So this is going
to be the length

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.830
of BC over the hypotenuse.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.740
The hypotenuse is side AB.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.040
So the length of BC
over the length of AB.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.830
Now, what is that
ratio if we were

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.810
to look at this angle
right over here?

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.560
Well, for angle B, BC
is the adjacent side,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.970
and AB is the hypotenuse.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.810
From angle B's
perspective, this is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.880
the adjacent over
the hypotenuse.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.777
Now, what trig ratio is
adjacent over hypotenuse?

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:08.610
Well, that's cosine.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.500
Sohcahtoa, let me
write that down.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.130
Doesn't hurt.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.030
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.870
We see that right over there.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.940
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse, cah.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.790
And toa, tangent is
opposite over adjacent.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.970
So from this
angle's perspective,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.240
taking the length of BC,
BC is its adjacent side,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400
and the hypotenuse is still AB.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.030
So from this
angle's perspective,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120
this is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.620
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.100
it's the cosine of this angle.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.340
So that's going to be
equal to the cosine

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.670
of 90 degrees minus theta.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.120
That's a pretty
neat relationship.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.620
The sine of an angle is equal
to the cosine of its complement.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.720
So one way to think about
it, the sine of-- we

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.740
could just pick any
arbitrary angle-- let's say,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.530
the sine of 60
degrees is going to be

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.984
equal to the cosine of what?

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.400
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.190
Well, it's going to be
the cosine of 90 minus 60.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.800
It's going to be the
cosine of 30 degrees.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.829
30 plus 60 is 90.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.870
And of course, you could
go the other way around.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.230
We could think about
the cosine of theta.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.170
The cosine of theta is going to
be equal to the adjacent side

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.630
to theta, to angle
A, I should say.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.160
And so the adjacent
side is right over here.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.790
That's AC.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.420
So it's going to be AC
over the hypotenuse,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.910
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.110
The hypotenuse is AB.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.850
But what is this ratio from
angle B's point of view?

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.920
Well, the sine of
angle B is going

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.200
to be its opposite side,
AC, over the hypotenuse, AB.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.210
So this right over here,
from angle B's perspective,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.270
this is angle B's sine.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:07.700
So this is equal to the sine
of 90 degrees minus theta.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.760
So the cosine of an angle
is equal to the sine

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.510
of its complement.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.873
The sine of an angle is equal
to the cosine of its complement.
