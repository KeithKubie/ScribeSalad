00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.390
&gt;&gt; Alright, Michael. So, let's write that

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.670
down in math, okay? You like math, right?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.360
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.810
&gt;&gt; Okay. So here's the math version of it. I'm going to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.980
just say that the utility that we receive for visiting a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.440
sequence of states, S0, S1, S2 ellipsis, is simply the sum

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.600
of all the rewards that we will receive for visiting those states.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.850
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.480
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.000
&gt;&gt; Is that consistent with what you were

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
doing when you were thinking about the grid world?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. But I thought we were going to make that not

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.360
definitional, we were going to derive that it had to be that way.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.290
&gt;&gt; No, we're not. They can read about it. It'd

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.910
take me, like, an hour and a half to do it.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.550
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.970
&gt;&gt; And I'm already losing my voice. But. What I do want

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.750
people, I want you to believe is that the utility of the sequence

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.430
of states, thinking of it as the sum of all the rewards, makes

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.830
sense, right? And then if nothing else, at least it makes, it's consistent

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.540
with what you've been doing as we've been talking about this grid work.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. I mean it, it also kind of makes me think about money.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.780
&gt;&gt; Go on.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
&gt;&gt; Well, so, so, I mean, that's sort of how money works. If we get some kind

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.830
of payoff each day, those payoffs get added

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.700
to each other. They don't get, you know, subtracted

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810
or multiplied or square rooted or whatever. They

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.520
just, you know, they go into your bank account,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.800
and things add. So this feels like, kind

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.610
of like that. It's like money in my pocket.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130
&gt;&gt; Sure, if you have a big enough pocket.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.750
Okay, I'm with you on that. Alright, so I'm going to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.330
say that this all makes sense. It, it's really awesome

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.450
and it sort of doesn't work. And to illustrate why

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.800
this doesn't work, I'm going to give you a quiz.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.300
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.870
&gt;&gt; because you like quizzes.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.030
&gt;&gt; So I've been told.
