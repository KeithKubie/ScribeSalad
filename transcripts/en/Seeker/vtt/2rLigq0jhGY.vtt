00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
This is a honeycrisp apple.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.860
It was designed and created to be the best.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.860
It’s a feat of science and economics, patience,
and ingenuity all culminating in this one

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.860
remarkable fruit.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.860
This apple was designed and created to be
the best.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.980
It’s a feat of science and economics, patience
and ingenuity all culminating in this one

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.520
remarkable fruit.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.320
The honeycrisp.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.109
To understand what makes honeycrisps so appealing,
you have to go to the cellular level.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.380
The cells of the honeycrisp are much larger
than other apples, meaning they have larger

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.310
sugar-filled pockets of water called vacuoles.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.439
As apples ripen, they produce enzymes which
alter the pectins that glue the cell walls

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.070
together, reducing the adhesion between cells.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.280
Apples like the Honeycrisp, retain the strong
bonds between cells even as they ripen so

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.640
when you bite into it, the cells burst open
releasing the juices inside.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.910
In apples like the red delicious, the enzymes
are able break down the bonds so your teeth

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.780
just cleave off the cells at the cell walls,
giving you that unpleasant mealy texture.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.429
So, how did we get from here to here?

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.050
Back in the 1800s, there were upwards of 14,000
unique varieties of apples in the United States.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.710
Apples like the Streaked Pippin, Boys Delight,
the Babbit, and the Lady Finger.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.140
An overabundance of apple varieties all unique
in size, color, and taste.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.880
But 100 years later, most of them have been
forgotten.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.800
The birth of industrial agriculture sent refrigerated
trains crisscrossing America, delivering a

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.860
bulk supply of apples to supermarkets across
the country.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
Apples had to last longer and, in order to
sell, look prettier.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.070
So the apple industry settled on perfecting
the look of just a handful of varieties at

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.200
the expense of their taste.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.409
This cosmetic breeding meant a pretty, shiny
apple with tough and bitter skin.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.159
This is where the hero of our story enters:
David Bedford, an apple breeder from the University

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.480
of Minnesota.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.060
Tired of the Red Delicious’s reign atop
the the produce aisle, he was determined to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.060
find something better.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.340
And he did, after taking a bite from an apple
off a tree that was marked to be cut down.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.079
This was the very beginning of the honeycrisp
apple.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.810
He spent the next 30 years cultivating that
apple, finally introducing it to the marketplace

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.189
in 1991.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.320
But, why did this take three decades?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.009
An apple is basically a womb of the mother
tree, inside are its offspring and like humans

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.020
each individual seed is a little different.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.550
If a seed grows into a tree, its apples will
not be identical to its parent tree.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.739
Which is a problem when you’re trying to
create a product that should look and taste

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.319
the same, every time you eat it.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.400
Apple trees can take up to 10 years to produce
fruit so the selective breeding process is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400
very slow.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.390
So, in order to produce identical apples,
trees must be cloned.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.030
A tree is cloned by grafting a shoot from
the original tree onto a living root, and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.330
then sold to farmers.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.980
Meaning every McIntosh apple you’ve eaten
is a clone from the original tree discovered

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.510
in 1811.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.780
Since its release in 1991 the Honeycrisp has
taken off.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.319
It’s now the fifth most purchased apple
variety and the fastest growing in popularity.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.840
But there’s another important point to make
here.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.140
This lack of biodiversity is dangerous for
crops.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.040
Since the commercialization of the apple in
the past century we may have lost 80 percent

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.390
of traditional apple varieties.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.099
The identical genetic code of most of America’s
apples means a single disease could wipe out

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.390
huge portions.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.069
The Ireland Potato Famine, was caused when
a bad fungus was able to spread through the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.540
country because all the potatoes were genetically
identical.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.980
So beyond being crisp, juicy, and delicious,
Honeycrisps are heralded because they show

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.620
that apple diversity could be marketable.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.420
Basically, because of the popularity of Honeycrisps,
more breeders are making more varieties of

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.049
apples to try to dethrone the new king.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.230
Hundreds apples have been released around
the world in the past decade.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.150
Apple growers and eaters are lining up to
get a taste of new varieties like Cosmic Crisp,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.310
SweeTango, Rave, and Juici.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.580
Returning us closer to our rich history of
apples.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.420
Thanks honeycrisp.
