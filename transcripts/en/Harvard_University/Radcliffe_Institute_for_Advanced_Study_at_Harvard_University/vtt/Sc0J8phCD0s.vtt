[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:06.910
- Hello.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.970
Welcome.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.620
My name's John Huth,
and I'm your host today.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.340
I'm Radcliffe Ventures's
faculty member,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.780
which means I help Radcliffe
do a variety of programming

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.080
here, most notably the
science programming.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.620
This is the last in a series
of lectures on the ocean.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.910
This is a thematic
year about oceans.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670
We had a symposium,
a science symposium,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.250
on oceans in the
fall, and we've had

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.970
a number of topics that
are pertinent to oceans

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.980
throughout the year.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.730
This is the last of these.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.810
The title of this talk is
"More Oceans, Less Plastic"

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.200
by Anna Cummins, who is the
co-founder of the 5 Gyres

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.250
Institute.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.580
And because I guess
I'm introducing,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.010
I get to blather on just
a little bit, so you'll

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.540
have to forgive me, OK?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.960
So this is a topic near
and dear to my heart.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740
I'm a sea kayaker and a member
of the Main Island Trail

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.400
Association.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.770
We have three
members over there.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.340
And every year we
participate in a cleanup

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.360
of some of the main islands.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.680
So we go out on a skiff,
get a bunch of garbage bags.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.790
We scour the ground.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.940
And what we see is
a ton of plastic.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.220
I mean, you wouldn't
believe how much there is.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.059
Lobstermen, they all
take a bleach bottle.

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:23.600
They'll rinse off
their deck and just

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.770
toss it out in the Gulf
of Maine or oil bottles.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.170
And this is most of the
stuff that we clean up.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.017
And it's rather amazing,
because they don't even

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:34.850
realize that they're
tossing the stuff where

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.430
they earn their living.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.280
And it's a bit
unfathomable, but it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
says that they probably think
that is an infinite resource

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.850
and it's not exhaustible.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.740
So that's one thing that
I found of interest.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.807
Another one was there
was a recent paper that

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:53.390
was published that
was in the New York

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.010
Times about the discovery
of large amounts of plastic

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.920
in the Arctic Ocean were
being transported there

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.220
through a kind of current called
a thermohaline current which

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.970
is not a typical
surface current,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.259
but it has to do with salinity.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.810
And I should mention
that this was

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.690
found through the work of,
partly, Chris Bowler, who

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.940
I don't think is here.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.790
But he's a fellow at the
Radcliffe Institute this year,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.480
and he runs an
expedition vessel called

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.520
the Tara that found this.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.210
And so as you'll
probably hear, there

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.990
are five subtropical
gyres in the oceans.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.690
However, there is a sixth
gyre called the Beaufort

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.250
Gyre in the Arctic Ocean.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.655
So you might have to
change the name to sixth--

00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:40.550
- There are 11 gyres.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.060
- There are 11?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.650
- Yes.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.230
- OK.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.520
OK.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.478
Well I stand corrected.

00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:44.089
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.130
This is why I'm here to
listen, and I should just

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.510
keep my big mouth shut.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.460
Thank you.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.797
OK, so Anna, she's
been spending 20 years

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:54.755
studying and protecting
the oceans in undergrad

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:58.340
at Stanford, master's
from Monterey Institute

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.090
for International Affairs,
a Sustainable Communities

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.440
Leadership Fellowship.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.330
In 2009, she founded the 5
Gyres with Marcus Eriksen.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.214
And since the founding, she
spent a huge number of trips,

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.630
and one in particular that I
look forward to hearing about

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.790
is on a junk raft out of Hawaii.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.583
So without any
further ado, Anna.

00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:22.529
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.700
- Well, thank you so much.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.950
Thank you, especially,
to John, and to Linda,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.440
and all the people, the
staff who made this possible

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.910
and brought me out here today.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.691
I wonder how many
people can say that they

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:35.690
were given the floor at
one of our nation's most

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.790
prestigious institutes
to talk trash.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.270
But in all seriousness,
at 5 Gyres,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.907
we really appreciate
the opportunity

00:03:42.907 --> 00:03:44.990
to share some of our
research with your community,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.900
and hopefully not inspire
guilt, but hopefully

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.340
inspire new thoughts and
ideas about solutions.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.270
So when I first was
exposed to this issue

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.360
of plastic pollution
in 2001, it was barely

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.670
a blip on the public radar.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.130
I was a student at the time
at the Middlebury Institute

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.020
for International Studies
in Monterey, California,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.560
which is known as a hotbed
for marine conservation

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.820
around the world.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.390
And it was at this time that
I heard a lecture, in 2001,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.760
from a man named Captain
Charles Moore who

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.380
was a hero in my world
of plastic pollution.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.649
He was the first to really
go out into the gyre

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.919
and bring this to the
public's attention.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.460
But what's really
interesting to note

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.700
is that the research in
the literature on plastic

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.550
predates Charlie
Moore's work by decades.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.640
Some of the first reports and
observations about plastic

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.780
impacting marine life date
back to the '60s and the '70s,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.380
the first major publication
in Science Magazine

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.830
in the early '70s on plastic
in the North Atlantic.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.320
But as never happens
in the academic world,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.080
these studies pretty
much sat on a shelf--

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.950
oh my goodness-- sat on
a shelf, gathering dust,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.070
until Charlie went out and
gathered the first samples,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.470
brought them back,
samples like this,

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.810
and media really began
to pay attention.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.850
So that was in 2001.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.730
I left this lecture
absolutely horrified by what

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.720
I was hearing--

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.900
both by the content
but also by the fact

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.610
that no one was really
talking about this

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.700
in my graduate program.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.700
Nobody knew about it.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.490
So fast forward
now 16 years later,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.410
there is a global movement
now around plastic pollution.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.080
Major institutes from the
Ellen MacArthur Foundation,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080
to the United Nations,
to major corporations

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.220
like Dell and Unilever, people
are now paying attention.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.380
There is a movement
called the Break Free

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.700
from Plastic Movement, which now
encompasses more than 800 NGOs.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.560
So there really is
some traction now,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.110
and the awareness is
getting out in a big way.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.890
We've had federal legislation
passed and lots of wins.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.440
But at the same time,
as the movement grows

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.100
and as more public
pay attention,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.060
and as there's pushback
from the community,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.360
the opposition is right
there getting equally strong.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.410
To give you an idea of what
we're up against, in 2014,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.310
we produced around 311
million tons of plastic,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.280
and those numbers are expected
to triple in the next 50 years.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.060
So we have a long way to go, and
some of the same interests that

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.170
serve the most to profit
by this are the same ones

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.680
that are using, at times,
some pretty dirty tactics

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.600
to fight us.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.660
So with that, I
wanted to also mention

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.650
that we're now seeing new
signs of this opposition

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.010
between industry and the
environmental movement that

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.420
date back many, many years.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.900
But before I go further,
I want to do something

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.466
that parents, especially
newly enamored parents,

00:06:41.466 --> 00:06:42.840
do a little too
often, and that's

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.980
share photos of
their little ones.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.450
I've managed to include her
in every presentation I've

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.760
given for the last four years.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.690
So thank you for indulging me.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.430
But to me, she
represents what's really

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.800
at stake for the
next generation.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.300
What sort of quality
of life will we

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.520
expect for the next generation?

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.050
I love bringing her to nature.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.810
I especially love
bringing her to the beach.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.549
And I wonder how I will
explain this to her.

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:08.090
So anyone who has
been to Los Angeles

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.260
might recognize this beach.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.593
This was the same beach where
I used to play as a child.

00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:13.786
You can see the Santa Monica
Pier in the background.

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:15.410
Now, it normally
doesn't look like this

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.200
because it is a very
popular tourist attraction.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.460
And immediately,
after a big rain,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.880
the sweepers and trucks will
be out there to make sure

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.570
that the public
doesn't see this.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.440
And as a kid, on
this same beach,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.750
I would go and
wander around looking

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.550
for seashells and rocks.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.150
Today, I cannot walk this beach
or really virtually any beach

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
that I've been to anywhere in
the world without finding trace

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.040
levels of plastic.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.860
Now, we with 5 Gyres had a
chance over the last eight

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.060
years to conduct 17 expeditions
around the world's oceans,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.280
collect over 600 samples.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.180
And I have a few basic
observations I wanted to bring.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.400
And that is, where
there is sea water,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.890
there is plastic, which is
a pretty remarkable thing

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.710
to be able to say, given that
plastics have only really been

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.970
popular for the last 100 years.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.980
Of those 600 samples
I mentioned, only two

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.020
have come up free of plastic.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.380
And this was at a time when
we weren't using high tech

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.360
research equipment to
look for microfibrils

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.640
or nanoparticles of plastic.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.920
Second, that plastic
pollution is a design flaw,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.150
and I think this is really
important messaging.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.200
I'm going to share solutions
later, after I horrify you

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.610
with all the gory bits.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.700
And it's important to come
back to the messaging.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.850
How is the messaging about
plastic being portrayed to us?

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.679
Who is responsible
or shouldn't be

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.049
responsible for
plastic pollution?

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.390
Third, and this kind
of goes hand-in-hand

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.510
with plastic pollution
being a design flaw,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.770
and that is that solutions
must begin upstream.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.610
We've taken this material,
fossil fuel based, incredibly

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.730
valuable, and we use it to
make things that we throw away

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.840
after one time.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.930
And that not only makes
poor environmental sense,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.110
it makes some very
poor economic sense.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.882
So how did we get here in
such a short period of time?

00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:10.090
I like beginning with this
image, because this really

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.030
encapsulates our
thinking about plastic.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.750
So this was the cover of
Life Magazine in 1955.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.840
This article was titled
"Throwaway Living."

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.610
And the copy in
this article said,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.370
"The objects you see flying
around in this picture

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.160
would normally take
40 hours to clean

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.350
except no housewife
need bother,"

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.530
because we can just
throw it all away.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:38.200
Now, we talk today about, where
is this place called "away"?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.990
Something I found recently,
after showing this photo

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.434
many, many, many times,
is the cleanup that

00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:45.100
happened after this
photo, which I think

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.410
is equally fascinating
and prophetic,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.550
when you think about it.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.790
Because this stuff doesn't
just disappear into thin air.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.710
It all has to go somewhere.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.380
We began seeing evidence
of this as early

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.780
as the '60s and the '70s.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.170
And no sooner did the first
examples of plastic pollution

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.450
littering roadsides
start to become

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.834
an issue when a trade
group came into being,

00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:09.250
a nonprofit group
came into being,

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.040
called Keep America Beautiful
with funding provided

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.130
by Coca-Cola and Pepsi and
some of the same interests

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.710
that really wanted to
keep us from staying

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.170
using a reusable,
refillable system,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.120
and moving to disposables.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.460
One of their first big very
successful ad campaigns,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.860
I'm sure many people
here will recognize.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.340
I want to show this photo not
to suggest that this didn't have

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.140
a great impact,
because there are

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.230
a lot of statistics about
how litter abatement really

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.920
improved.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.040
People were littering
less after this campaign.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.630
But coming back to messaging--

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.130
I don't know if you can see in
the bottom right hand corner.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.340
It says, "People
start pollution,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.140
so people can stop it."

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.840
And that messaging right
there diverted attention

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.510
from the system, that
we were switching

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.090
from a reusable system
to a disposable system.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.330
Instead it put the onus of
responsibility on the public.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.380
It's a people problem.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.580
It's people littering.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.680
It has nothing to
do with design.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.630
And here in lies a big
part of the problem

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.180
that we're still facing today.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.820
Now, starting in the
'50s, we saw an explosion

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.430
of plastic being produced.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.400
It did start fairly
innocently in that some

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.130
of the early prototypes for
plastic came from a response

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.450
to things like precious
resources being overused,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.910
ivory from elephants
and shellac and rubber

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.110
and all these different things.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.640
And then we saw a boom
during World War II, a boom

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.770
for plastic production.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.050
And that coupled with
a lot of messaging

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.840
about how we needed to
stimulate the economy with lots

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.210
of consumption was
the perfect marriage

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.250
for plastic and disposable
plastics to come into being.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.890
So you can see the
skyrocketing of production to,

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.670
I mentioned before, today,
311 million tons of plastic

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.870
expected to double and triple
in the next 25 to 50 years.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.220
But what has not kept pace
with this extreme explosion

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.600
of production is our ability
to recover and recycle,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.970
and there's a lot to
say about recycling.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.130
But starting there, so
out of that big number

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.930
there, around 78 million tons
of that are for packaging.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.310
Of that, only 14% is
recovered, and I'm not

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.510
going to say recycled.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.550
Of that 14%, only 2% is truly
recycled in a closed loop

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.630
system.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.610
So where is the rest going?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.090
It's going to landfills.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.610
It's going to incinerators.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.460
And it's being leaked out
into the world's oceans

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.660
and the environment.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.324
And that leakage
is where I'm going

00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:40.490
to focus for the next while.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.540
That's really where are our
focus with 5 Gyres has been

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.300
for the last eight years or so.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.970
I saw this in a big
way for my first time

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.740
when I was on the
Big Island of Hawaii.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.030
Has anyone ever heard of or been
to Junk Beach or Kamilo Beach?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.590
Perhaps seen photos of it?

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.650
Well, this is a unique
beach in that it lies right

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.660
in the heart of where
a lot of currents

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.620
that make up these ocean systems
just bring lots of debris.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.590
And it used to actually be a
forging ground for islanders

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.660
looking for logs and
things like that.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.430
As I walked around
this beach, it

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.460
was like looking at
Walmart washed ashore.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.640
You can find pretty much
everything that you needed.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.820
And as I looked at the writing
underneath a lot of objects

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.410
here-- shampoo bottles,
and detergent bottles--

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.970
I saw writing in Spanish,
English, Korean, Japanese,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.290
and Chinese.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.770
So this is literally washing
up from the entire Pacific Rim.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.080
I would venture to guess
that very little of this

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.690
is coming from local islanders.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.300
And it's not just an
environmental ecological issue.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.120
There's also a human
rights component here

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.966
and a social justice component.

00:13:45.966 --> 00:13:47.840
As you see, I'm sure
many people in the world

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.170
have had a chance to travel
to some areas that don't yet

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.980
have infrastructure to deal
with all of this waste.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.260
And here you can see a young boy
in Manila in the Philippines.

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.150
This river here is so
choked with plastic

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.669
you can't even see the water.

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:05.210
And he's looking
for anything that he

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.280
might find that has some value.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.000
So here we can look
to really the waste

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.780
picker, this informal sector,
to inform what things really

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.980
do have value.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.370
So going back to the oceans.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.907
There are five subtropical
gyres, 11 gyres total.

00:14:22.907 --> 00:14:24.740
But I'm going to show
you a current modeling

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.880
study that really shows how
currents in the ocean travel.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.630
And this study was conducted
by some scientists at NOAA,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.360
using various modeling,
computer models simulations,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.750
to figure out where new
drifters travel and accumulate

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.620
over a 20-year period.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.350
So I like to tell
people to imagine

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.550
any one of those
squares is an object.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.280
And you can track
it around the oceans

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:52.620
for the next 20 years, half a
year, one year, three years.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.030
You can see also how quickly
the currents from Japan

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.970
are making a beeline for the
United States and then others

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.330
sort of getting up
into that other gyre,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.250
the Aleutian currents.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.370
10 years-- so in 10
years, a single object

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.630
can travel from California
all the way to Japan and back.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.290
And in 20 years, it starts to
pool in these concentrations

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.650
zones that we used to
call garbage patches.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.190
And we're now referring
to it as more of a smog,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.840
and I'll get more into that.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.300
So you can see here the
five subtropical large gyres

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.885
in the world.

00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:30.260
Now, I want to
focus a little bit

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.050
on what are the
impacts of taking

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.590
this non-biodegradable
fossil fuel material

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.600
and saturating our oceans
with these products.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.100
So entanglement.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.100
Now as I mentioned before, some
of the studies on entanglement

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.020
were first reported
back in the '60s.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.180
So this has been going
on for a long time,

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.330
and we're only now really
beginning to wake up.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:56.680
This snapping turtle
does have a happy ending.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.730
She was found outside of the
swamps of New Orleans so,

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.290
you know, common
snapping turtle.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.610
And a young boy found her.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.680
So for the young
people in the audience,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.880
you guys can really
make a difference.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.730
They brought this turtle
to the Audubon Zoo.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.420
They named her Mae West,
for reasons that some of us

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.160
will understand.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.740
And they were able to cut that
ring off, and she did survive.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.510
We brought her back
to Los Angeles,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.970
and she's now at a
wildlife rehab center

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.380
where children can see her.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.350
Because she really tells a story
about how even the small stuff

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.080
can have devastating impacts.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.570
And ingestion-- this
is the other big way

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.970
that plastic can
affect marine wildlife.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.740
Many different species that
feed and forage in the gyres

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.590
are now increasingly
finding our waste competing

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.290
with their natural food source.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.030
And the numbers are stark.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.020
These are likely
conservative estimates

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.620
on how many marine
animals are impacted.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.800
Today it's roughly
over 600 species.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.400
And the numbers are
probably increasing.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.370
I do want to show you,
though, that it's not just

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.270
marine animals.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.240
And I brought something
to illustrate that here.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.849
So my husband Marcus, who
co-founded this organization

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:11.060
with me, had a chance to go to
the deserts outside of Dubai

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.589
two years ago, visiting some
of the same places where,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.540
as a combat veteran, he
served in the Gulf War

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.410
and saw a different side of
the whole fossil fuel issue.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.720
He brought this back
along with five others.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.260
The one I wanted to bring was so
large that I couldn't carry it.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.590
This was inside the
stomach of a camel.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.440
I'll show you the larger one.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.857
So there are now so
many examples of this.

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:37.690
The first one that was
sent to us we thought

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.540
was maybe the anomaly, but
we have five of them now.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.640
And according to some
camel researchers--

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.000
they're at the largest
camel center in the world--

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.070
when you find a carcass
of camels today,

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.770
you inevitably will find
plastic in their stomachs,

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.070
plastic bags, plastic
packaging, ropes.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.000
Why do they eat it?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.130
They may be attracted
to food residue

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.890
or maybe it mimics something
that they might naturally

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.000
eat stuck in trees.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.660
It looks like leaves.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.870
So the point is that
this is a marine issue

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.600
and a terrestrial issue.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.670
So I had a chance to see
this firsthand in 2008.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.860
I had been haunted by
this issue since 2001,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.980
and I finally got my chance
to join a research expedition

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.010
across the North Pacific from
Hawaii all the way back to Los

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.600
Angeles.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.760
And what we saw day
after day after day

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.620
were samples that
look like this.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.650
This is actually a sample
from that very journey,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.870
mostly broken down
confetti mixed

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.240
in with a lot of marine life.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.200
And when people talk about
the island the size of Texas,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.510
to de-bunk that, what
you see and here,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.150
it looks like maybe a
handful of confetti.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.330
We collected over an area maybe
two nautical miles inside.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.570
So it's incredibly
diffuse, very spread out.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.270
But it was what we saw at
night that really struck me.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.350
We collected samples during
the day and at night.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.270
And at night, our samples
were full of life.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.730
We have the largest
migration of any species

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.920
in the world in the
oceans every single day,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.170
creatures coming up to
feed on zooplankton.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.610
And now there are
so much plastic

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.180
in their feeding grounds, that
this is what we're seeing.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.270
This is a myctophid, also
called a lantern fish.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.400
We brought over 600
of these back to land

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.590
and found that roughly
one third of them

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.470
had plastic in their stomachs,
along with the zooplankton they

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.670
should be eating.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.640
Scripps has also done a study
like this, and they found 9%.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.260
So discrepancy is
probably due to methods

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.030
and how these fish
were collected.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.520
But the point being
we're seeing plastic

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.370
in the stomachs of fish that are
extremely important in the food

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.460
chain.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.900
These fish make up 60% of
the ocean's fish biomass.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.610
And why we know
this is a problem

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.330
is that plastic in the oceans
can absorb contaminants

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.490
at very high
concentrations, things

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.540
like PCBs and DDT, flame
retardants, chemicals

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.370
that are hydrophobic--

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:56.680
won't mix with water,
but only oleophilic.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.380
They'll stick to
oily substances.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.650
And a single particle of
plastic, the size of a lentil,

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.130
can have up to a million
times higher concentration

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.380
of these pollutants than
the ambient sea water.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.050
So this was a pretty
profound realization for us.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.300
Two things happened
on that trip--

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.460
seeing the food chain
impacts and then

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.810
also one day when Marcus, who
I had known for a few months,

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.600
fished out a piece of derelict
fishing gear on that voyage,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.000
made a little ring and
proposed right there.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.160
And so that was how our
personal and professional

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.870
collided together.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.940
But he had one big
adventure he wanted

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.520
to do before we got married.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.070
And that was to build a
raft out of plastic bottles

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.150
and sail across
those same currents

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.610
and use that as a way
to try and draw new eyes

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.770
and ears to this issue.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.260
So there is JUNK.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.260
That's the boat that we built.
It took two and a half months

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.040
to build it.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.320
It took him three
months to sail it.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.960
He often quips that he could
have walked faster to Hawaii

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.330
than sail in this boat.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.600
We collected 15,000 bottles
from all over Los Angeles

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.960
and had schoolchildren all
over the state helping us

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.370
with the materials.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.070
And the point was to ride
those same currents that

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:15.380
would take any drifting object
from California out to Hawaii.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.540
It didn't go as
smoothly as we expected.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.600
It ended up taking three
months instead of six weeks

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.740
as we had predicted.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.720
They ran really low
on food, and they had

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.630
their worst storm on day four.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.380
So I'm going to show
you a couple of clips

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.830
from that voyage, including
what happened during that storm

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.180
was that all the labels on their
canned food got washed off.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.200
And the last video shows a more
sobering look at the food chain

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.486
impacts that I spoke about.

00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:44.474
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:03.896 --> 00:22:06.490
- The ocean stripped all
the labels off our cans.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.230
They got rusted.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.936
Now we've got to eat them.

00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:11.950
It's all beans and
corn-- and peas.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.544
- Come on, corn!

00:22:14.544 --> 00:22:15.511
Give me corn.

00:22:15.511 --> 00:22:16.052
Give me corn.

00:22:16.052 --> 00:22:16.534
Give me corn.

00:22:16.534 --> 00:22:17.075
Give me corn.

00:22:17.075 --> 00:22:19.426
Give me corn.

00:22:19.426 --> 00:22:20.880
Corn!

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.438
Beans!

00:22:23.438 --> 00:22:24.372
- One more?

00:22:24.372 --> 00:22:26.240
Hey, we'll see what it is.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.826
- We have to asess the
scope of the task before us.

00:22:28.826 --> 00:22:29.640
More beans.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.580
- No wind.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.250
We're completely "becalm" today.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.630
There's no wind whatsoever.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.740
So we're just going
to fish and eat.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.234
- Here fishy,
fishy, fishy, fishy.

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:48.900
Oh, there he is.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.024
Right there.

00:22:50.024 --> 00:22:52.886
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.010
- Lunch.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.670
- We are now skirting the edge
of the North Pacific Gyre,

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.534
roughly 1,000 miles
east of Hawaii.

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.470
And we're finding
lots of plastic

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.950
on the surface of the ocean.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.290
- It's mostly small fragments--
blue, green, white, and black,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.090
among many different
kinds of zooplankton.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.205
Everywhere you go in North
Pacific Ocean, we find plastic.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.840
- So I filleted this fish,
thinking we're going to eat it.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.920
And here's what I found.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.666
It's full of plastic.

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:55.540
This is the whole reason
that we're out here,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.550
to bring this to your attention.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.880
The plastic isn't benign.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.400
The fish won't pass it.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.770
The plastic is full of
persistent organic pollutants,

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.330
things like PCB,
DDT, PAHs, things

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.910
that are known human
carcinogens and endocrine

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.930
disruptors, things you
don't want in your body.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.952
But they're in the
fish that we eat.

00:24:14.952 --> 00:24:16.410
- I don't want
plastic in my sushi.

00:24:28.257 --> 00:24:28.840
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.320
- So that was a very long summer
for the fiancee back on land.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.040
I was mission control and
doing the weather reports

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.619
and raising the
funds back on land.

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:38.910
This is what really shocked us.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.670
Because we'd seen plastic in the
stomachs of these small fish,

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.909
those myctophid fish
that I shared before.

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:45.450
But this was the
first time we'd seen

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.620
plastic in the stomachs of fish
that people would normally eat.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.270
Marcus didn't end
up eating this one

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.670
because of what we know
about that transfer,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.950
that plastics
absorb contaminants

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.310
and that those can then desorb
into the fatty tissues of fish

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.690
and other organisms.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.770
But the science is going
smaller and smaller on this

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:06.870
to where we're now seeing
fragments of plastic

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.180
in the bodies of
zooplankton, very

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.010
important at the base
of the food chain,

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.410
and even nanoparticles
of plastic

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.050
inside the circulatory
system of mussels

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.730
and clams and other bivalves.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.730
And there have even been studies
looking at common shellfish

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.670
eaters and seeing the sum
total of microplastics

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.280
that they're ingesting, because
you eat the whole organism.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.330
You don't take out the stomach.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.090
Which brings up the question--

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.880
what impact is this
having on you and I?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.250
And the science here
still needs a lot of work.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.510
There are a lot of points in
that puzzle that can be proven.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.280
But looking at the
whole link to see

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.930
how are humans affected by
plastic is challenging still.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.120
What we do know is that
there's enough evidence

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.490
to suggest that we
proceed with caution.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.120
I was personally interested
in this after Marcus

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.280
and I got married and
thought about having a child.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.446
You saw the results of that.

00:25:57.446 --> 00:25:59.790
She's healthy and
everything came out fine.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.710
But when we took a
sample of my blood

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:05.790
and sent it off to a lab to
be sampled for contaminants,

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.220
we found all four contaminants
that we were looking for.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:13.440
We were finding PCBs, DDT, PFCs,
and flame retardants, higher

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.200
levels of flame retardants.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.700
And it was really interesting
when I got those studies back,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.450
because a toxicologist
helped me color code them

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.670
for where I fell on the national
spectrum-- green for good,

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:29.130
or orange for so-so,
and red for not good.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.340
And I was green for three
out of the four contaminants.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.630
And at first I celebrated.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.200
It was almost like getting
good grades back on an exam.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.030
But then I thought
this is just crazy

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.420
that this is the new baseline.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.720
This is the new normal
that every single one of us

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.910
has these contaminants
in our body

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.280
and that the flame retardants
were slightly higher

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.780
being a Californian.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.040
Now, again we have so much that
we don't understand about this.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.000
It's very difficult to say that
there's a cause and effect.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.060
We also don't know how do these
chemicals interact with one

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.590
another inside the human body?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.070
There are studies looking at
those chemicals and isolation.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.560
But again, my personal
feeling, and a lot

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.592
of sentiment shared by
people in this field,

00:27:11.592 --> 00:27:13.050
are that we have
enough information

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.660
to suggest that we
proceed with caution,

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.820
that the burden of
responsibility for proving

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.570
that these chemicals are safe
should be put on industry

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.040
and corporations
and should not be

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.500
placed on the general public.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.080
So these ideas were
swirling around for us

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.690
when we decided we
need to get more

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.550
information about this issue.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.200
We'd seen a lot
of research thanks

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.230
to Captain Charles Moore about
plastic in the North Pacific,

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.600
but there was zero
research on plastic

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.520
in the southern
hemisphere gyres.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.810
So this was our inspiration
to launch a new organization

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.580
and sail around
the world looking

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.940
at this issue of
plastic pollution.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.160
So part of what we did was
invite the public to join,

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.400
and this is something that
we still do, is invite

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.730
other scientists, filmmakers,
students, teachers, artists,

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.860
musicians, and even
heads of companies,

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.390
including people from the
industry, to come with us,

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.120
roll up their sleeves,
get their hands dirty,

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.100
participate in the
science, and then go back

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.590
to their communities
to be ambassadors.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.170
So I'm going to share
another short video,

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.640
very low production quality.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.802
This was iPhone and
laptop on a boat.

00:28:19.802 --> 00:28:21.260
But this gives an
idea of what it's

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.180
like to be out in the
middle of the ocean

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.990
and see evidence of
plastic contaminating

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.670
some really remote regions.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.542
This was also our honeymoon.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.367
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:33.200
- Let's bring it in.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.290
- Found some larval
fish, sargassum,

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.300
and little plastic particles.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.440
Look at that.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.230
- We're in the middle of
the North Atlantic Gyre,

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.800
also called the Sargasso Sea.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.820
It's called the Sargasso
sea because of sargassum.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.840
It's a kind of seaweed
that filled our nets.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.170
But it's also full of
small particles of plastic.

00:29:08.044 --> 00:29:10.725
- Ah, there we go.

00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:11.600
- What you got, Anna?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.996
- It's a mouthpiece,
I think, for a boxer.

00:29:13.996 --> 00:29:18.433
It's got some barnacles,
some sargassum.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.790
This is 45 minutes of scooping
through another windrow

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.380
in the middle of
the Sargasso Sea.

00:29:37.364 --> 00:29:40.850
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.840
- Yeah.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.270
- It's going to flop out.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.490
So we just pulled out
this plastic bucket,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.600
and we found a
triggerfish inside

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.250
that's so big that it looks
like it can't get out.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.810
- I think its entire
life is in this jar.

00:30:02.474 --> 00:30:03.911
- There we go.

00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:04.869
Oh my god.

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:05.840
- He's still alive.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.207
- Here's a triggerfish.

00:30:07.207 --> 00:30:08.040
Look at these teeth.

00:30:10.527 --> 00:30:11.860
Now look at this plastic bottle.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.440
Now, we find these all around
the North Atlantic Gyre,

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.830
bits of plastics chewed
on by marine life.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.920
- 10 degrees to Port

- You know how gross that is?

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:28.473
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:29.620
- Very salty.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.730
Probably pretty clean.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.550
So I could show
hundreds of photos

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.080
that all pretty
much look like this,

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.210
and this is a typical sample.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.370
This one is from
the South Atlantic.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.760
You can see just this mixture
of life, Portuguese man-of-war,

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.700
mixed in with these
fragments of plastic

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.420
that are impossible to really
attribute to any source.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.700
We can't tell what
product these came from,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.390
what country they came from.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.500
So coming up with solutions
can be challenging

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.630
when you're looking
at microplastics.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.620
But when we took all of our
data from all five gyres

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.570
and other hot spots
around the world

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.090
and paired it with data
from seven other scientists

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.710
from regions around
the world, we

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.590
were able to come up with
the first global estimate

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.690
of plastic floating
in the oceans.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.750
Now, this is very different from
plastic entering the oceans.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:21.700
But this is what we found,
roughly 270,000 metric tons

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.790
made up of 5.25
trillion particles.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.640
And that, I think, is
the important part.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.350
Who can visualize 5.25
trillion particles?

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.000
None of us.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.160
But the point is that we
can't go out to the oceans

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.300
to clean up this problem.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.810
You can't skim the ocean
of 5.25 trillion particles

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.550
without removing so
much life that you'd

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.510
be probably doing more damage.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.260
We've got to go upstream and
solve this problem closer

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.760
to the source of
the problem, which

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.470
really with any
environmental problem

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.980
is a much more efficient
way to go than cleanup.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.850
So this caused us to
look at it differently.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.670
Instead of calling
it a Garbage Patch

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.740
to call it a Plastic Smog.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.780
And we would apply the
same kind of thinking

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.160
to dealing with smog.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.040
You wouldn't clean it up with
vacuum cleaners in the air.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.720
You would look at
smarter, emissions,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.790
and smarter vehicles,
and smarter technology,

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.450
better ways of design.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.850
Really, it's about design.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.370
So I want to share
one example of how

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.470
we can use science,
in this case,

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.690
to actually drive a solution.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.310
And we'd been around
the world looking

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:24.880
at plastic in many of
the world's oceans.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.700
And engaging people who don't
live directly on an ocean

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.880
can be challenging.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.757
Even though we all know that
we need oceans for health,

00:32:31.757 --> 00:32:34.090
it can be hard to engage
people to care about the coasts

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.820
if they're not right
connected to an ocean.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.970
So that inspired us to go
into the Great Lakes in 2012

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.190
to do the same sort of research.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.370
We spend 2012 and
2013 serving all five

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:47.050
of the Great Lakes
in partnership

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.234
with a great scientist from
SUNY Fredonia, Dr. Sam Mason.

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:52.150
And I'm going to share
with you what we found.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.040
It wasn't at all
what we expected.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.060
- There are a lot of reasons why
we should protect our oceans.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.270
They give us oxygen. They
regulate our climate.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.770
Our oceans give us food.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:14.440
But what's really going on
is we've turned our oceans

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.940
into a plastic smog.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.070
in all five oceans and then
leverage those findings back

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.595
to land to drive solutions.

00:33:41.595 --> 00:33:42.970
- We began in the
North Atlantic,

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.880
was our first
expedition in 2010,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.630
did the South Atlantic
across the Indian Ocean,

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.850
the South Pacific,
Chile to Easter Island,

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.450
then up to North Pacific,
finding microplastics

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.220
in 21% of the planet's surface.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.360
Out there in the
oceans, you really

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.860
can't identify the product,
because it's so broken down.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.159
I mean, how do you solve
the problem with this?

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.530
I can't point to a company.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.150
I can't point to a country.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.340
You've got to get
closer to land,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.139
into our rivers and lakes.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.810
- So we went into
the Great Lakes

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.360
doing the same research,
the same methods that we've

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.059
used in all five oceans.

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:32.600
- There we could
point to a country--

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.030
if we found something,
Canada and the United States

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.449
share those waters.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.900
We began to find these
small, perfectly round

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.250
little spheres, one
third millimeter in size.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.699
I had never seen that
anyplace else in the world.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.840
We had a hunch what they were,
went to your local pharmacy.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.550
We got the facial
scrubs, the one that

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.120
even say microbeads
on the front,

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.012
put them through a sieve.

00:35:01.012 --> 00:35:03.790
And there they were.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.590
They matched.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.140
Polyethylene and
polypropylene-- it's

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.490
a designed microplastic
that goes on your face,

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.893
down the drain, out to our
rivers, lakes, into the ocean.

the final resting place

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.150
for microplastics.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.620
It's settling to the
sea floor, but it's also

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.620
disappearing via the stomachs
of animals that consume it.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.620
- A tiny particle of plastic
the size of a microbead

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.860
may look like a fish egg for
many different organisms.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.990
Each one of these
particles of plastic

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.850
is like a sponge
for contaminants,

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.220
things like PCBs or DDT.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.310
Many different toxic
chemicals can be absorbed

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:06.460
by plastic in the ocean.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.760
- It's not just, you know, one
bird, one whale, and one fish.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.830
It's ecosystem-wide.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.090
They're eating
all those plastics

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:25.130
that go up the food
chain back to you and I.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.660
- Whether or not
we're a fish eater,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.840
we all depend on the
oceans for health.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.470
Everyone has a local
lake, stream, or a river,

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.620
or a watershed that
they care about.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.600
- We can change our
throwaway culture,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.820
the way we treat each
other and the environment,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.330
and make it much better
than it was last century.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.890
You start with these, facial
cleansers and toothpastes.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.450
These microbeads, these designed
microplastics which you cannot

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:56.050
recycle at all, that's a design
that needs to be changed.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.140
That starts with us and
our purchasing power.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.440
So zero waste your
plastic footprint.

00:37:05.617 --> 00:37:06.200
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.880
- I'm going to skip
the ending part.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.810
This is the sample that
caused us to really pause.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:15.020
This one sample had more plastic
than any of the ocean samples

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.590
we'd looked at
anywhere in the world.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.620
And now you know the
rest of that story.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.182
We published those results
in a peer reviewed journal,

00:37:21.182 --> 00:37:22.890
and we thought that
that would be enough.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.840
We called the vice president
at Procter &amp; Gamble

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.310
and presented our findings.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.740
And what they said was, you
need to do more research.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.860
Until you can prove that
it's our products going

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:36.780
into these waters, then we're
not going to do anything.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.620
What was really interesting
is that during this time,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.290
I found out that they've known
about this for a long time.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.720
I found an internal document
that was on the web.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.520
I saved it, because
it's not there anymore,

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.320
basically saying that we
recognize that these beads may

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.824
be entering the
aquatic environment

00:37:52.824 --> 00:37:54.740
and that we will probably
need to do something

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.540
about this at some point.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.380
Well, we didn't want
to wait for that point.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.880
When we heard you need
to do more research,

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.710
we decided to go legislative.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.780
We hired an attorney
in San Francisco.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.080
We co-drafted a bill, and we
presented it in California.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.260
And in 2014, we came
devastatingly close,

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.460
lost by two Senate votes.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.626
Meantime, Illinois passed
a bill that everyone

00:38:19.626 --> 00:38:21.500
jumped up and down and
got all excited about,

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.410
and the same bill language
was spreading from state

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.654
to state to state.

00:38:25.654 --> 00:38:27.320
And what people didn't
know is that this

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.650
had a huge loophole,
that basically changed

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.060
the entire spirit of the bill.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.060
Way down in the draft,
that very few people read

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.810
in the definitions, how they
defined plastic microbeads was

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.590
any intentionally added
non-biodegradable--

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.170
so just by putting in that
non-biodegradable piece,

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:48.480
they opened up the door
to put in bioplastics.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.140
PLA does not break down.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.089
PLA is one kind of
bioplastic made from corn.

00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:55.130
It does not break down in
the marine environment.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.710
It needs a high heat
municipal composting facility,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.660
and even then, a
lot of recyclers

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.520
tell us that they
don't want them.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.010
So that was pretty underhanded.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.870
We kept on with the
battle, and what really

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.230
made a difference in 2015
was getting a full coalition

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.310
on board.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.350
And this, again,
just underscores

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.650
the power of collaboration, when
lots of NGOs and policymakers

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.000
come together.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.350
And students played a role here.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:21.020
These students at UCLA
spent three months

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.000
getting microbeads out
of their student store.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.760
And that made a difference
as we were fighting

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.830
this fight in California.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:31.790
And then finally, after we
passed the bill in California,

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.960
this really laid down the
momentum for a federal bill.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.630
And in the final
days, weeks of 2015,

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.750
President Obama signed the
Microbead-Free Waters Act,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:42.920
a federal bill.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.650
So that was great news,
but it's not enough.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.850
The plastic pollution movement
celebrates these victories.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:50.810
We ban bags.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.160
We ban beads.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.810
But how are we really
going to move the needle?

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.800
And I want to share a couple
more examples of solutions.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.830
How are we going to move
towards a circular economy?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.130
And this is a concept that's
now really getting traction.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.870
Instead of the way
we do things now,

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.030
we take products
that are largely

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.760
toxic in the environment,
in a linear fashion,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.820
we produce products that
mostly go to the landfill.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.160
And how can we change that idea?

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.460
So we thought instead of
picking off products one by one,

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.380
we came together
with a couple of NGOs

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.520
and produced a first
draft of the ban list.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.660
And that was taking
available data

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.480
on coastal cleanups
and waste management

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.820
and trying to pair it
together to come up with, what

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:36.440
are the 10 to 15 worst products
that we just need to get rid of

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.570
and redesign and back
it up with good data?

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.230
And one of the things we came
to is a large majority of those

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.570
were polystyrene.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.480
So this is a campaign
that we are launching now,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.820
and a lot of groups
around the world

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.800
are really looking
at polystyrene

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.030
due to its high toxicity and
due to its low recoverability

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.950
and recyclability.

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.711
And so this is just an example
of what we're trying to do

00:41:00.711 --> 00:41:02.210
is we're trying to
really facilitate

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.470
people taking local action.

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.580
And I think especially now with
our current political status,

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.520
it's reminding us of why we
need to get even deeper involved

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.877
in our local politics.

00:41:11.877 --> 00:41:14.210
And I was pleased to see that
you have a number of bills

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.850
here in Massachusetts,
including a statewide bill

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:20.220
to ban polystyrene.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.900
Another key part of
the solution is really

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.360
putting the onus, as I
said in the very beginning,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.040
back on producers.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.680
So producers need to
take responsibility

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.180
for what happens
to these products

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.070
after they leave their hands.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:35.550
And there's a big fight
here, you can see,

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:39.370
this map that shows where
we have EPR as of 2015.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:42.280
And there seems to be a little
bit of a desert in the United

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.060
States.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.060
But fortunately, there are new
bills being introduced now.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.710
There's a lot of
opposition to this

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.140
because they don't want
to pay for the recovery

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.130
of these products.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.560
But the fight is on, and
I'm hopeful that this will

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.570
happen in the coming years.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.650
Better design-- how can
we engage corporations

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.430
in involuntary design?

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.282
No one wants to spend
five, 10, 15 years,

00:42:03.282 --> 00:42:04.990
fighting these
legislative battles, which

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.160
we'll continue to do.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.440
But when companies--
like this is a product

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.900
that Rainbow Light put out.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.400
It's.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.000
A 100% post-consumer
recycled plastic.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.340
And if we can incentivize
the recovery of that,

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.910
that's a great place to start.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.250
I came across this recently.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.430
It's just in the concept
phase, but the idea

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:24.490
being, create packaging that
when you're done with a product

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.780
doesn't exist anymore.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.270
So this concept of
disappearing packaging, this

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.960
is one example of where
the package is the product.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.850
This is a thesis
project from a student.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.820
I'm really hoping that
this will come to fruition.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.760
But this is the kind of thinking
that we need really to get out

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.070
of our packaging dilemma.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.220
Better systems-- can we
come up with new systems

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.020
in how we deliver goods?

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.590
For example, sharing--
this is a project

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.800
to New York to the left.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.900
Not only is there a
bikeshare happening here,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.130
but there's a vessel share.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.630
The company is called Vessel.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.064
And the idea is, you
go to a coffee shop.

00:42:58.064 --> 00:42:59.980
You pick up your vessel,
and you can return it

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.870
at the next coffee
shop, because we're all

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:02.980
busy forgetful people.

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.490
We don't always remember.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.180
Can we come up with
new ways of doing this?

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.990
Same thing in Portland, where
this similar concept with to-go

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:13.270
wear, with to-go packaging,
where you can pick it up

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.970
at one place, return it
at another, and get rid

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.980
of all that packaging waste.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.690
And refillable, of course--

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:23.080
coming up with new ways that
we can avoid packaging entirely

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.000
and just bring in our own
containers and get our goods.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.120
Some post-consumer examples--
you know, again, none of these

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.620
alone are going to
move the needle.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.220
But together, if we can come up
with more creative approaches--

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.440
to the left is a
company called Bureo,

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.080
that are taking
back fishing nets

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.060
from all over the coast
of Chile and moving

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:46.210
on to other countries,
grinding it up, and turning it

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.760
into products like
skateboards, and sunglasses,

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.320
and other durables.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.590
On the right, I put an example
from a bigger corporation

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.370
that I haven't
thoroughly vetted.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.846
So I don't yet know how
they're defining beach plastic,

00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:00.970
but this is a new product
that Head &amp; Shoulders has

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:05.020
put out that is, in
theory, 100% recyclable

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.790
and made with beach plastic.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.380
More research there needed,
but I did want to share this.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.690
And moving away from fossil
fuels entirely as a feedstock--

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.470
putting more research into
truly compostable, biodegradable

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.800
plastics that can be made
from mushrooms or from algae

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.640
or from shrimp or from compost.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.690
The point being, we will need
to get away from fossil fuels.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.210
And finally, getting
the community involved--

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.560
the power of artwork.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.280
So when we were doing
the microbeads campaign,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.540
Marcus, who's also a
sculptor, created this piece

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.890
called "Anthropocene."

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:39.980
It's pretty massive.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.360
It's a big steel ring
with the Vitruvian Man,

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.650
four bikes power LED
lights, and water

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.010
that is inside, that is
filled with microplastics.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.400
And the tubes of water go
in and around the man's body

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.060
to show this connection between
microplastics and human health.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.652
And some artwork that you
will see out in the lobby

00:45:00.652 --> 00:45:02.860
here-- wonderful group that
you've heard a little bit

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.780
about from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.210
We were so enamored of
that photo on the right

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.610
that we ended up using
it to make a t-shirt,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.130
and I was really excited to
see that the original is out

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.210
in front.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.210
So I highly encourage
you to go take a look.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:17.290
The student art
here is phenomenal.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.990
And we all respond
to different things--

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.720
science, art, et cetera.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.746
Wrapping up here--
this is an example

00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:27.620
of what you can do, just
on a personal level.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.560
As John mentioned the
beginning, reducing

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.090
your plastic footprint.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.550
Our friend Lauren
is able to save

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:37.180
all the garbage she produces in
a year in one small Mason jar.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.370
So it can be done.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.890
And the role of
influencers a new campaign

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.830
from Adrian Grenier and
the Lonely Whale Foundation

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.380
to try and combat
our straw obsession.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:51.320
And the campaign
is #stopsucking.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.820
So influencers can
play a great role here.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.410
And finally, what we do in
our home, on our campus,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.300
in our family, can really
have ripple effects

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.952
that we might never anticipate.

00:46:02.952 --> 00:46:04.660
And that was the case
with these students

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.600
from a middle school in Los
Angeles, in Silver Lake.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.820
They decided to get
rid of Styrofoam trays.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.130
They created that long
piece of all the trays

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.374
that they used in one week.

00:46:14.374 --> 00:46:15.790
They got rid of
the tray, and they

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.860
saved their school $12,000.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.535
This is a public
school in one year.

00:46:19.535 --> 00:46:21.160
That got the attention
of the district,

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.550
and they banned Styrofoam trays
across the entire district.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.250
So again, these actions can
have far-reaching consequences

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.410
that we might never imagine.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.810
Now, I hope I shared some
positivity in addition

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:33.610
to the negativity.

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:38.150
One final short clip
from a wonderful place

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.714
that I know Linda Cabot has
been a big supporter of as well

00:46:40.714 --> 00:46:42.130
called the Island
School, where we

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.325
had a chance to engage youth in
really talking about solutions.

00:46:45.325 --> 00:46:46.270
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.160
- When I heard about
the plastic problem,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.130
I never really noticed,
but then when you actually

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.890
start to see it,
there's a lot of trash.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.486
Like, there's literally
like trash right there.

00:46:56.486 --> 00:46:57.400
So.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.720
- When I was a child,
you'd walk on the beach

00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.511
and pick up shells.

00:46:59.511 --> 00:47:00.970
Now you pick up
pieces of plastic.

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:01.685
It's everywhere.

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.910
- It's everywhere.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.320
- And this is where it starts
to come back to you and I,

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.337
because we're now seeing
no shadow of doubt

00:47:07.337 --> 00:47:09.170
that plastic is getting
into the food chain.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.600
- As plastic is out there
floating in the ocean,

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.150
it never biodegrade,
which means--

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:14.650
- It never fully goes away.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.157
- Animals are eating
these plastics

00:47:16.157 --> 00:47:17.490
because they think they're food.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.870
- We go out and we
fish for these fishes.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.150
When we eat them,
the same toxins

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.231
that the animals were
eating gets in our bodies.

00:47:25.231 --> 00:47:26.980
- It's not an issue
we can ignore anymore,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.271
because it's right in our face.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.590
- We're here at the 5 Gyres
SEA Change Youth Summit.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.480
Sea Change stands not
only for sea change

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.120
but also for science,
education, and action

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.640
which is what we've been up
to for the last three days.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.910
We have an amazing
crew of people,

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.290
people like Jack Johnson.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:58.790
We have Jordan Howard here.

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:00.020
With Celine Cousteau.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.700
We have David Stover here
from Bureo skateboards.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.900
- He uses old nets, like
he recycles it and makes it

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.820
into a skateboards.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.442
I really thought that was cool.

00:48:08.442 --> 00:48:09.900
- We actually made
some toothpaste,

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.680
some environmentally
friendly toothpaste.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.022
- My favorite activity was
the storytelling exercise.

00:48:15.022 --> 00:48:16.730
- The kids started
telling their stories,

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:19.021
and then they started building
on each other's stories.

00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:22.130
That's where we see activism
spread like a grass bushfire,

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.820
you know?

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.510
That's what we want to
happen at a summit like this.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.490
- I get inspired because
I meet young people,

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:30.610
like here at this
youth summit, that say,

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.180
I know it's a problem.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.275
This is what I'm doing.

00:48:33.275 --> 00:48:35.711
This is the one
change I'm making.

00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:37.836
And the ideas are pouring
out of these young minds.

00:48:44.024 --> 00:48:45.830
- Well, it's World
Environment Day.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:48.460
We've collected a bunch
of plastic pollution.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.484
You got some?

00:48:49.484 --> 00:48:50.900
And now we're
taking a look at it,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.280
kind of seeing what we find.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.435
- This is the turtle bite.

00:48:53.435 --> 00:48:53.800
- Yeah.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.070
- And this is like
the triggerfish bite.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:55.570
- Yeah.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.590
- This is representative
of one of the quadrants

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.800
that we sieve through
the surface sand.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.595
So this is one square
meter of beach.

00:49:02.595 --> 00:49:04.090
- (SINGING) Got to get home.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.608
There's a garden to tend, all
the seed from the fruit buried

00:49:07.608 --> 00:49:09.560
and begin there.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.380
There own family trees teach
them thank you and please.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.920
Spread their own
roots then watch

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.910
the young fruit grow again.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.520
- So yesterday, we collected
a bunch of plastic pollution

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520
on the beach.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.635
And today, we decided to make a
community art piece out of it.

00:49:24.635 --> 00:49:27.605
- (SINGING) So I
try to understand

00:49:27.605 --> 00:49:31.600
what I can't hold in my hand.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.250
And whatever I find, I'll
find my way back to you.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.130
- So one person
can tell another.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:37.350
That person tells two.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.330
Two turns to four.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:41.180
Four turns to hopefully 4
million, who knows, you know?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.040
I'm optimistic.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.677
- So we have to see the what?

00:49:45.677 --> 00:49:46.177
- Change!

00:49:46.177 --> 00:49:46.677
- Seek?

00:49:46.677 --> 00:49:47.400
- Change!

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.130
- I see change every day.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.150
- I see change in the way
the world sees the future.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.210
- I see change when we take
responsibility as individuals.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.811
- But I also see
change in the youth.

00:49:57.811 --> 00:49:58.810
- In the Bahamian youth.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:01.082
- I see change when a
youth finds their voice

00:50:01.082 --> 00:50:03.290
and knows that they can be
a leader in our community.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:05.664
- Things that our generation
would have never dreamed of.

00:50:05.664 --> 00:50:07.580
- I see change in all of us.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.035
We all can make a difference.
