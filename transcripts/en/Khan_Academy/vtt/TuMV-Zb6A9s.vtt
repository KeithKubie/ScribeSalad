00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.256
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can find the product

00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:05.437
of X minus four, and I'll
put that in parentheses,

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:09.431
the product of that and X plus seven.

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:11.939
And like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.185
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.140
Well there are a bunch of
different ways to tackle

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.344
multiplying two binomials like this,

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:21.017
but the way that I like to tackle it,

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.083
especially if we're just
learning how to do this

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:24.638
is to just realized that we can apply

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:27.889
the distributive property
that we all know and love.

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:29.260
And how do you do that?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.766
Well you could just think
of this X minus four,

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.111
we can distribute the entire binomial.

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.223
We can multiply the X
minus four times the X

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:41.079
and we can multiply it times the seven.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.379
So let me rewrite this.

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.119
We can rewrite this as,
if we distribute it,

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.980
it would be X minus four times this X,

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.073
times that blue X and then plus,

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.954
we're also distributing the X minus four,

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.973
we have to distribute it on
every one of these terms.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.959
So plus X minus four,

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.794
X minus four times this seven.

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:06.975
Times the seven.

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:10.645
Now what is this going to
be on the left-hand side?

00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:15.173
Well the X times the X
is going to be X squared.

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:18.005
And then the X times, this is minus four,

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.443
or X times the negative four is

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:22.533
negative four X.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.969
And then over here I distribute the seven.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.476
Seven times X is seven X.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.938
So plus seven X.

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:35.700
And then seven times
negative four is negative 28.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:37.831
And now we can simplify this a little bit.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.269
We see that we have
two first degree terms,

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:43.543
two terms where I have
a certain number of Xs

00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:45.349
and so we can combine these.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.103
So we have X squared.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.219
If I take these two middle terms,

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.375
if I take negative four
X and then add seven Xs,

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.697
that's going to give me positive three X.

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:59.995
Negative four plus
seven is positive three.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.061
So positive three X.

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.614
And of course we have the,

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:07.030
we have the minus 28.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.959
And we're done.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.233
We just multiplied these two binomials

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.856
just using the distributive
property twice.

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:16.271
First we distributed
the entire X minus four

00:02:16.271 --> 00:02:17.920
onto the X plus seven, so you got

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.890
X minus four times X plus X
minus four times the seven.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.816
And then we distributed
the X onto the X minus four

00:02:24.816 --> 00:02:27.021
to get what we see in yellow here.

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.528
And we distributed the
seven onto the X minus four

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:31.479
to get what we got in green here.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.845
And then we just simplified a bit.
