00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.250
&gt;&gt; Amy Puryear: It's a pleasure
for me to introduce Tonya Bolden.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.120
She is an award winning author
of over 20 children's books,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.700
and she's written about the
emancipation proclamation.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.160
She's written about Martin Luther
King, and she has won a number

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.150
of awards and today, she's
going to talk about the museum

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.030
that opened today of African
American history and culture.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.510
Please welcome Tonya Bolden.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.520
[ Applause ]

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.820
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Hi.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.120
Good afternoon.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.420
Can you hear me?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.720
Okay. Good.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.020
Good afternoon again.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.320
Thanks for being here.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.490
Thanks for coming with love
and joy and faith and hope.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.110
I really think we're
in a crossroads,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.910
and I should have asked
one of my hosts

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.830
to take my pocketbook,
but that's okay.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.210
And earlier today -- oh, it's cool.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.620
It's fine, baby.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.010
Earlier today, I had
some time in the hotel,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.140
and I was watching, I guess, NBC.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.700
And I'm watching, and
I'm saying, "Don't cry.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't cry."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.300
John Lewis comes.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm like, "Don't cry.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.900
Don't cry."

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
And I said, "You're going
to be all puffy eyed."

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500
And I was like, "Oh, well.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.800
Hide behind my glasses."

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.480
But let me start with this.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.580
A museum is a treasure trove of
things, things lost then found,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.100
things perennially prized, things
-- objects once deemed worthless.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.620
Whatever a museum collects,
paintings, pottery

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.740 position:56%
or play things, its aim is the same.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.770
To safeguard remnants of history
and culture that inspire, enlighten

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.260
and kindle the curiosity of the
children and adults who come

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.650
through its doors,
generation after generation.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.940
Smithsonian's National Museum
of African American History

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.290
and Culture is a treasure trove of
paintings, photographs, posters,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.600 position:56%
[inaudible], pottery, documents,
dolls, diaries, books, balls, bells,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.990
benches, medals, medallions
and more.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.010
Objects that deepen
our understanding

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.190
of the black experience in America

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.110
and so strengthen our
grasp of American history.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.060
This is the story of
how that magnificent

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.660
and monumental museum got built.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.030
So it was February, 2014.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.120
I received an email through
the account that's attached

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.810
to my website, which means somebody
I don't know who doesn't know me

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.060
because friends have
the other email.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.310
So I get this email, and the
subject line is something

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.440
like possible project.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.480
And this woman introduces herself.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.760
Her name is Sheila Keen,
and she's with Viking.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.700
I do not know her, but she
knows my work, and she says,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.020
"I'd like to talk to you
because -- about an idea."

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.810
She basically said that I
think it's right up your alley.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.110
So we talk.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.930
And the project was this
book, How to Build a Museum.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.050
The museum that took 13 years to
build but 100 years to come about.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.270
Now, I had all kind of problems
-- because, right, we're always --

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.840
you have something in production.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.550
You have something
on the first draft.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.850
You have something
else, this [inaudible].

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.150
And you always have all this stuff.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.830
Plus it was February, which is
like equal employment opportunity

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.720
for black writers and illustrators.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.270
So I'm thinking I'm feeling
overwhelmed, but I just said

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.520
to self so you won't sleep some.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.860 position:56%
I could not not do this book because
the museum represents everything

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.730
that I'm about, like large --
like a thousand times over.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.980
So I said I'll get a little less
sleep, but I have to do this book

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.630
because history is my passion and
because [inaudible] the last museum

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.030 position:56%
in the mall is the first Smithsonian
Museum built from scratch.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.370
And so I think in many ways
[inaudible] is sort of reflective

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.500
of black lives upon these shores.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.320
It was a long time coming.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.190
A hundred years to come about.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.400
People were campaigning for
this back in 1915, 1916.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.990
Meanwhile, other museums
and galleries go up

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.480
and people continue to
believe in the dream.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.350
The dream really started as
a monument to black veterans

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.760
in the American Revolution
and all the other wars onward.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.490
And they couldn't -- they didn't
have any friends in court,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.470
but they kept campaigning
and the dream got bigger.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.280
So this was a book that I had to
do because it is about, as I said,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.710
everything that I'm about
[inaudible] I think sums it up.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.130
Now you know the [inaudible]
symbols.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.910
I think it's usually presented
as a bird with a neck,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.490
a very limber bird, but the neck
is sort of turned back [inaudible].

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.810
And some people --
what does it mean?

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.160
Some people say go
back and pick it up.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.030
Some people simply say remember.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.600
I like to use it as remember.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.900
I know that's something

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.240
that [inaudible] is all
about is remembering.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.000
But there's a minister, a Baptist
minister, in Brooklyn, New York.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.310
He translates [inaudible] as
the way out is back through.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.930
What does he mean by that?

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.180
The way out is back through.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.510
You all shy?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.390
Okay, yeah.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.480
And I think, for example,
the way out is back through.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.790
It's saying you have
-- history is vital.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.700
It's saying as MLK said
we are made by history,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.110 position:56%
and Baldwin said history is
literally present in all that we do.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.900
So if you take someone
[inaudible] remember,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.590 position:56%
you take someone of African descent.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.950
The way out through lingering shame
and fear and doubt and despair is

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.510
to go back and pick up that history
and find out whence you come.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.070
I think the wonderful thing
about the museum that makes it

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.620 position:56%
so fantastic is it really, really
shows that people of African descent

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.350 position:56%
in this country are not bit players.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.180
And I'm constantly always
telling people that if we came

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.260
from a nothing people, people
like me wouldn't exist.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.040 position:56%
[Inaudible], I think too as you know
the museum basically is saying what

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.610
I always try to say in my books is

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.340
that black history is
everyone's history.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.030
I also think that all the
histories are everyone's history.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.330
I always say that the building

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.390
of the transcontinental
railroad is my history.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.330
The trail of tears is my history

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.240
because we are all
made by the history.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.160
And so you may have someone
who's not of African descent

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.140
who may not know intimately
any black people

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.680
and so maybe they hold
stereotypes about them.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.400 position:56%
And maybe they think when they see
them from afair up in the helicopter

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.580
that they all look like bad dudes.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.930
And maybe, though, if you go to
the museum and you read more books,

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.700
maybe you'll see wow, black people
are as different and complex.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.300
Yeah, there's some bad dudes among
us and some bad girls among us

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.040 position:56%
and all that, but there's also
Jacob Lawrence and Thurgood Marshall

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.020
and geniuses and [inaudible]
and all of that.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.950
That's why we need the
history because it's

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.470
about educating ourselves, and I
think we're at a crossroads now,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.070 position:56%
and the only hope -- I think we
have to decide whether we want to go

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:29.440
into insanity and stupidity or if
we really want to take another stab

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.930
at getting this country to
live up to its own ideals,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.770
to catch up its own ideals.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.080
So again, everyone
needs the history.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.950
Needs to understood, too, as
the museum will show that yes,

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.450
there's slavery and Jim Crow.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.750
There was pain.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.050
There was tears.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.350
There was sorry.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.650
But it's also about the jubilees.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.950
It's about celebrating.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.250
It's about praise.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.550
It's about uplift.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.760
The whole design of the
museum is praise and uplift

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.760
so that you say yeah, you had
the slaughter and the beatings

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.970
and the brandings on the cheeks and
people getting their ears cut off

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.250
because they tried to run
away or getting a finger --

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.670
[inaudible] of their index finger
chopped off because they tried

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.970
to learn to read and write.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.660
But you also had people escape
like Josiah Henson carrying his kid

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.090
on his back until his
back got raw and bled.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.500 position:56%
You have going on down the line,
you have people like Michael Shiner.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.580
I did a book about him, Michael
Shiner, about his journal.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.860
In D.C., he was an incredible man
with agency here in Washington,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.780
D.C. Then later on down the
line, you have the people

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.670
who fought the 54th glory
corps and on down on down.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.670
You have Charles Dorsey,
Tommy Dorsey.

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.540
You have Thurgood Marshall.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.460
You have Jacob [inaudible].

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.250
You have -- and we go on and on
and on to the point where you have

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.310
in the White House
Barack Hussein Obama.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.410
And one of the things I did
last night as I was privileged

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.160 position:56%
and honored to attend the Library of
Congress gala for the book festival.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.470
And there, it was the first
-- I belive I'm correct --

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:08.850
public event presided over by
the 14th Librarian of Congress,

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.010
Carla Hayden, a black woman.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.600
[ Applause ]

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.350
And that tells us that
so much is possible,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.320
and I think it was Obama
referenced this in his speech.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.270
Somebody did, but I'm
always telling kids is

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.800 position:56%
that Jim Crow was not that long ago.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.320
My parents lived in a
Jim Crow South Carolina.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.870
Civil War was not that long ago.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.290
So yes, we have enormous promise --
problems, but if you'd look at it,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.970
you can say, "Wow, we have
made some giant strides.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.800
We have made some progress."

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.300
And we can't let people
turn us around now.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.780
Now -- not at this moment
because what we're talking

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.610
about is not just white
people and black people.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.620
We're talking about all the people

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.420
because this nation is
becoming something different.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.150 position:56%
I did a school visit in the Bronx,
and I didn't know what the kids were

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.400 position:56%
because there were some that were
part Latino, part black, part white,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.240
part Japanese, and I
looked at all these colors

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.540
and all these beautiful kids.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.270
And I said, "This is beautiful."

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.290
And they all -- I can imagine when
they have international night,

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.090
that school must be really jumping.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.660
But I looked at it and said,
"This is a good thing."

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.290
Because all the multiculturalism
is a good thing

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.250
because then we all
learn from each other.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.870
And I can't help multiculturally
because when I grew up --

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.400
I grew up in the 60's in a
place called East Harlem,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.120
also called Spanish Harlem.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.570
And at the time, it was --
it used to be Little Italy.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:44.430
So I had Latinos, mostly Puerto
Ricans around me, Italians,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.730
and they would have their festivals

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.150
with the saints marching
in the street.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.040
You have people from the Caribbean.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.460
I remember one guy from
Trinidad would do steel drumming

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.760
in the park at night.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.940
You had Africans, and
you had people like me,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.980
my parents been in this country.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.530
And to me, it was like life was
a festival and life was rich

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.370
and my friend, Rosa,
introduced me to [inaudible].

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.800
And I thought that's a good thing.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.100
I would never want
to make [inaudible]

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.950
because that's also a lot
of work or from Italians.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.850
I would see them marching
around with the saints,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.750
and I [inaudible] a
little something like that.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.110
And I think growing up --
because I wrote in a poem once --

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.930
when I grew up, being multicultural
wasn't an agenda or work.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.010
It was the every day way of life.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.770
And again, my father worked in
the garment center so I knew

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.600
about the [inaudible] and
egg creams and all that.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.470
And to me, it was like wow.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.170
Spice, spice.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.780
So, that's why I'm sort of
devoted to multiculturalism

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.860
in a very gut kind of way and
because being in New York,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.440
I don't know anything else.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.990
I see [inaudible] on the trains.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.290
I see Muslims on the train.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.590
I see Asian people.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.140
I see Japanese, Chinese,
and I just know

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.500
that I think I'm a richer
person for being in a city

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.210
where I can meet the world.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.180
Where's my science -- okay.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.780
Well, I'm going to stop.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:10.660
We can take questions or comments.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.960
Yes.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In the museum, is there a
section celebrating African American

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.030
illustrators and authors?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.270
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Well, I think
there's -- I'm not sure about that.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.890
I think there probably is
in cultural expressions,

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.840
which as I understand it does --
the cultural galleries, I mean.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.400
The cultural expressions
may cover things,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.270
some hairdos to body language,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:45.860
then you have visual
arts, stage and screen.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.880 position:56%
So I'm not sure how they're handling
it, but I'm sure they will be

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.400
because I know in my
book I have examples

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:57.900
of black books and black art work.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.720
Next? Yes [inaudible].

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.940
&gt;&gt; Obviously, you had to have a
lot of help from the Smithsonian

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.740
and the designers and the curators.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.370 position:56%
Can you talk a little bit about that

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.860
because this book is
chock full of --

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.940
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Right, and see
it's -- my favorite quote --

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.610
Lonnie Bunch once said that
building the museum was like being

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.280
on a cruise in uncharted
waters at the same time

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.840
that you're building the ship.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.160
So I'm also working on
the book at the same time

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.490
that they're building the
museum so things are shifting.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.960
They did give my editor and
I access with [inaudible]

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.330
so we could see what
was in the collection

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.690
for the different galleries
and from that,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.320
then we're choosing what we think
most appeal to young people,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.130
and then because of the internet
too and because of the Smithsonian

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.840
when it came to the
design competition,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.900
I had access to those documents
so I could really say, okay,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.980
this is the process and then
I was able to talk with people

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.270
like Sharon Parks there to sort

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.050
of clarify things about
the design shift.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.220
So it really was -- I mean, I
think those people must be working

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.600
for like ten years
eight days a week.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.850
I don't now when they slept.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.950
So through that and
then, like I said,

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.710
I was able to -- I
love doing research.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.130
Research is what I love to do.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.050
So I was able to read
Lonnie Bunch's book.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.870
I was able to access videos
of him to get a feel of okay,

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.730
this is this man --
this is this vision.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.780
And just digging in and
then Googling things.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.200
Like I said, I always believe

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200
when the student is
ready, the teacher appear.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.070
Like when I'm really in the zone on
a project, stuff just seems to leap

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.270
up at me and say here
you need this article.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.620
I said wow.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.290
But it was a little hectic
because when I started it,

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.510
we thought the opening
would be 2015.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.810
So it was a really a little -- you
need -- so for example, it had --

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.170
it [inaudible] come
out in September.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.630
It had to be at the
printer last March.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.930
Yes?

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.230
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.960
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Oh,
can I hold -- I'm sorry.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.130
I'm such a good [inaudible]
capitalist.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.410
How to Build a Museum
by me, Tonya Bolden,

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.430
and it's all about the new
museum that opened today.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.200
How many of you have
been to the museums?

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.370
Anyone been to -- can
you tell us about it?

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.670
Tell us about what you saw.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.970
What was it like?

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.290
&gt;&gt; It gave me goosebumps.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.590
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Really?

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My daughter has worked for the
Smithsonian so she had extra tickets

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.130
for a preview last weekend,
and it's phenomenal.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.430
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Really?

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.790
Share a little more.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.090
What -- ?

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.230
&gt;&gt; There is Harriet
Tubman's shawl that was given

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.390
to her by Queen Victoria.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.130
Nat Turner's Bible.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.430
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Wow.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.490
&gt;&gt; Just so many things, and
Hall of Athletes, everything.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.790
It's phenomenal.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.090
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Yeah
because I heard that --

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.230
what I understood Bunch wanted
everything to be on a human scale

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.330
so that you're not so much learning
about events, but you're learning

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.360
about people who experienced
these things.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:07.690
&gt;&gt; Athletes, artists, entertainers,
and it's a multimedia experience.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.040
There are videos all around you.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.460
You can see cabinets with their
artifacts and right beside you,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.300
a video of Jesse Owens
and his memorabilia.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.600
It's wonderful.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.900
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Wow.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.200
Thank you.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.580
Anyone else want to testify?

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.880
Anyone have a question?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.180
Anyone been to the museum?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.480
You want to talk about it?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.050
Oh, yes, sweetie.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.410
&gt;&gt; How many times have you
been to the new museum?

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.660
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: I will go this
evening at five for the first time.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.480
I was here two days
ago to have a meeting.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.020
So it's close -- the panels were
going up, but I got only as close

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.970
as the trailer outside the museum
that had the models because I think

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.020
at that time because of
construction, they didn't want

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.320
to let people walk through.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.950
So when I go, assuming I make it
in time, it'll be the first time,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:06.070
and I'm trying to brace
myself for the experience.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.060
Hello. Yes?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.970
&gt;&gt; Hey, I just want
to say I'm a huge fan.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.990
I'm trying to think of
a question on the fly.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.320
I will be going to
the museum on Monday,

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.780
but when you're researching
a book, what's the --

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.590
when you find something that
surprises you, what do you do?

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.490
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: When you find
something that surprises you?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.490
You follow it because I
think -- see, writing to me,

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.290 position:56%
when I start a book, I may know ten
percent of what ends up in the book.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.340
I think you have to be
true to the subject.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:45.660
When you surrender to a
subject, you find what you find.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.440
I was writing about the boys once,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.760
and I found out some things
that I thought, oh wow.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.200
But then given him and his
context, I thought, okay,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.410
I'm going to mention
it a little bit.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.700
But I think you should
never have an agenda.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.310
I mean, other then to do good work,
and other then to enlighten people,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.550
inspire people, [inaudible]
curiosity.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.640
But other then that, I start
with a subject and say so what?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.940
That's kind of [inaudible].

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.290
So you kind of sometimes --
especially if you know something

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.550
about the subject, you have
to like clear your mind

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.130 position:56%
and just say why does this really --
why did Martin Luther King matter?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.910
You have to be able to --
don't say that to other people

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.740
because you'll get stoned,
but you have to be able to say

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.280
to youself why does he matter?

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.830
Why does he matter?

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.000
And especially in the 21st century.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.450
And that gets you to the
point of well King wasn't just

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.620
about Tonya can fly first
class, okay we have arrived.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.900
No, because he was about
something bigger than that,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.340
a [inaudible] in the community
so I think when you start

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.820
with the question, so what,
and who is this person really,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.200 position:56%
then you're open to discover things,
and I think that's the best thing

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.330
about writing is that
it is an adventure.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.490
Sometimes you do not know
what you're going to find,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.540
and you don't like what you're
going to find, what you find.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.900
I'm working on a project
now, and he had a quote.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.160
He said something that
I thought, "Well,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.910
that's not very race man-like."

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.750
And then I said, "But you know,
maybe he had some ambivalence

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.330
about identity," and I include
the quote and let readers decide

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:19.810
because we don't want
to do propaganda.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.120
We want to make history come alive.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.080
We want to tell stories that
not so much just inform people,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.610
but I think that when I write about
King or Frederick Douglas or DuBois

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.250
or Bethune or FDR's alphabet
soup, I'm always wanting

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.350
to not just give kids --

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.020
young people information,
but point the way.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.480
Give them also a jumping off point.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.910
So in the new deal book, I wrote

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.500
at the end people still debate
whether the new deal was a good

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.310
deal, a bad deal, raw deal, and
then I say what do you think?

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.570
And then I say your answer
will depend on what kind

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.970
of government do you want.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.930
So it's not just giving
them information.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.870
It's saying you take this to the
-- how do you feel about this?

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.530
And emancipation proclamation.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.830
Was Lincoln racist?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.130
Was he not?

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.430
What do you think?

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.730
I'm not going to give
you the answer.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.030
What do you think?

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.330
Or maybe there is no
one right answer

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.570
as the question who
freed the slaves?

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.080
Was it Lincoln, radical
Republicans in Congress?

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.700
Was it the stiff neck
aristocracy, the slaveholders?

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.430
Because sometimes I think we
need to let young people know

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.480
that sometimes there
is no one answer.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.200
It depends on perspective
and sometimes it's a mystery.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.500
Yes?

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.450
&gt;&gt; How do you suggest
talking with very young kids

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:37.240
about the most difficult
parts of American history?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.680
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: I think young
people are more resilient then we

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.620
give them credit for.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.590
I think you tell them the truth,
and I think what it is is not

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.990
to just say there was a time when
people of African descent were held

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.260
in slavery in this country.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.090
Then maybe look at have we had
slavery other times in the world?

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.200
And then ask the question why?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.480
Why were they held in slavery?

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.070
How -- why were they held
in slavery for so long?

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.660
Because I think just as when
you explore, how did this --

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.490
how did this monstrosity happen?

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.270
You'll come upon the thinkers who
will say things like the desire

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.140
to exploit and plunder came first

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.540
and then came the racism
to get people on board.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.420
And I think -- I've
talked to kids, and I said,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.810
if you look at all the conflict and
the horrors and all of this stuff

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.910
around the world throughout
time, it comes down to one group

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.390
of people wanting the other
group of people's stuff.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.690
It's not personal.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.040
It's not -- and they
have to [inaudible].

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.920
Okay. I'm from New York, right?

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.360
Let's say I have a campaign
to say, you know what?

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.410
I'm going to get rid of
all these Washingtonians.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.810
New Yorkers are going to
have these townhouses,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.240
this convention hall,
everything, right?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.880
People will be like,
"You crazy, Tonya."

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.880
Right? But if I go back to New
York and day in and day out I talk

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.630
about how Washingtonians are
dogs, they filthy, they're ugly.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.050
They don't know how to do anything.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.350
They're inferior.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.830 position:56%
You will have droves of New Yorkers
coming over here to take your stuff.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.330
So we need to understand
-- help people understand.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.140
We're talking about economics,
and of course to convince people

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.510
to enslave people and brand
people and cut off their finger

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.850 position:56%
and cut off their ear, you have to
convince them that they're not human

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.500
because no one can do
those horrors to people

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.490
if they think they're human.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.160
So I think you tell
people the truth.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.100
I was saying recently
because somebody said --

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.490
I said I was 12 or under
when accidentally --

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.110 position:56%
I was living in the Bronx or Harlem.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.210
But I accidentally in the magazine
or book came across the photo

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.020
of Emmett Till's corpse in
the casket, the open casket.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.310
And I remember getting
like -- it was horrifying,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.230
and I remember my mother said we
were going to tell you about that

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.910
but not yet, but they had
to tell me about it then.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.220
Now, I probably had a
sleepless night and nightmares,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.680
but it didn't kill me, and
my parents, like I said,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.220
who are from the Carolinas
had to sit me down and tell me

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.520
about some facts of life.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.240
And I started to learn
horrors my mother experienced

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.080
like her grandfather who was
like a father being out at night

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.290
when the Klan is riding
looking for a black man

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.590
who supposedly did something

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.950
and knowing my parents
lived with that terror.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.920
But I had to confront it,

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.970
and I didn't have nightmares
forever about Emmett Till.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.360
I still don't like
to see that image.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.010
I got over it.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.000
Who knows what role that moment
played in later my becoming

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.650
so fascinated with history?

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.950
Kids can take it.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.070
And kids see -- kids
understand better

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.100
because they understand not
fair more than adults do.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.620
Adults -- we can justify
things, but kids will be

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.950
like that's not fair
to take their things.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.870
But I think you have to break it
down and say behind all of this --

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.820
I know a lot of times people quote
DuBois, and they say the problem

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.240 position:56%
with the 20th century is the problem
of color -- he backed off of that.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.020
And the 50th anniversary of
souls of black [inaudible],

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.350
he said it's what's
behind all of this,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.620
this desire to exploit and take.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.360
So if we start to look
at this as pure business,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.180
then we can see oh
behind all of this,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.880
one group of people wants
another group of people's stuff.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.180
Did that help?

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.780
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Tell
the children the truth.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.080
I think in the museum
there's a building that --

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.850
a button, a pin from the 60's that
says tell the children the truth.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.150
Yes?

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.450
&gt;&gt; Okay. We still have time?

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.750
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Yes.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.050
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.350
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: For you.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.950
Thank you for being here today.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.250
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Thank you.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.550
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering as you
were doing the research

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.850
on this book, which is beautiful --

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.150
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Thank you.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.120
&gt;&gt; Was there anything
that surprised you?

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.390
Because you're very well read,
you know a lot of history.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.710
What meant the most to you?

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.480
What's something you learned?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.780
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Well, I think --

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.000
I know one of the artifacts that
means the most to me is a sack.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.300
It's in the book.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.410
And it was created in a hurry by
a woman named Rose in the 1850's

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.070
after she learned that her
daughter, 9-year-old Ashley,

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.020
had been sold and would
soon be gone.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.340
And into the sack went some pecans,
some kind of nuts, I think a lock

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.100 position:56%
of her hair, a few bits of clothing,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.060
and she told the daughter
and all my love.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.650
And I think for me it just makes me
well loved because I think so often

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:10.610 position:56%
when enslaved people are presented,
they're presented as getting through

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.410
but not retaining their humanity.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.030
And saying -- we're
not usually presented

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.250
as loving, loving family members.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.590
We know about all the separation,
but no one talks about the love.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:28.060
So I think that always
is precious to me.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.810 position:56%
I think what made me stop and think
with the Jim Crow card that they had

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.370
to lower into the museum
before it was even built --

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.650
because you remember the Jim Crow
-- the Jim Crow [inaudible] --

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.730
but then I thought about it, and
when I realized people can walk

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.800
through it, they're going
to experience that --

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.520
the front 2/3 for white
people has bigger everything

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.790
and nicer everything,
and the back --

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.610
and when I realized people
would walk through it,

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.890
I in myself envisioned people
on the Jim Crow [inaudible].

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.250
I imagined you're black and
you're going to a funeral.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.250
On top of that grief,
you got to ride Jim Crow.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.990
And then I thought, too,
when I could visualize it,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.920
very often we talk about Jim Crow.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.780
We talk about what it did to
and against black people, right?

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.020
But it also victimized white
people because I thought wow,

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.940
you had this car and
you have someone

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.670
who could have been a professor
at Tuskegee or whatever

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.980 position:56%
and the white people in the front
aren't getting to know these people,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.190
and these people love like
them and laugh like them,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.980
and maybe they could have had
something to offer each other.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.080
So it makes you say oh my God.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.540
This was really [inaudible]
and bad for everyone.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:41.800
So I think because I had
to think about the objects

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.180
and because I was looking at
them from the files they sent,

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.480
I was able to sort of sense
memory and so being there myself.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.900
So I hope that helps.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.200
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.500
Thank you.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.800
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Two minutes left?

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.100
Yes?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.760
&gt;&gt; The monument looks
beautiful from outside.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.900
I haven't visited yet inside.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.740
But my question is is it front
of the Washington Monument,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.840
and it's difficult to see that
beautiful Washington Monument.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.080
The location -- what
can you tell about that?

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.320
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: I don't think
it blocks it because I know

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.760
in fact I think its
angle had to be shifted,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.940
and that's the reason I think it's
one of the most below ground --

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.680
it has more stories underground
than any other thing --

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.230
was precisely not to
mess up sight lines.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:32.870
So like I said, I haven't
physically been there,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:36.290
but I don't think it blocks because
I think they were very careful

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.350
about sight lines of
everything on the mall.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.280
Thank you.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.580
Yes?

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.990
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
book and why?

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.880
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: In the
world or written by me?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.180
&gt;&gt; Written by you.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.480
&gt;&gt; Tonya Bolden: Oh.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.890
Right now, it is How
to Build a Museum.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.180
This is my absolutely favorite
book in the whole wide world.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:06.710
But when January comes around and
the a book called Pathfinders,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.900
the stories of 16 extraordinary
black souls comes out,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.940
that might be my favorite
and then in May

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:20.380
when Crossing Ebeneezer Creek comes
out, my novel about Sherman's march

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.870 position:56%
to the sea, that may be my favorite.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.330
But I have to say this right now.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.750
You guys are my favorite
audience, and we are out of time.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.450
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
