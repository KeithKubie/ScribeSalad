00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.697
Hi Charles, welcome to the next lesson.

00:00:01.697 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; Hi Michael thank you for
welcoming me to the next lesson.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.840
What is the next lesson?

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.410
&gt;&gt; So I don't know, can you read it?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.316
&gt;&gt; I can read some of it I
can't quite see all of it.

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:10.540
[LAUGH] I get it.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.200
&gt;&gt; So the other topic is
partially observable MDPs but

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.545
I made MDPs partially observable.

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:16.500
&gt;&gt; Brilliant.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; Kind of fell off
the bottom of the screen.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.560
So yeah so this is the idea of talking
about Markov decision processes

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.590
like we've been talking about, but
ones where the agent has to make

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.750
decisions based on what it can see
of the Markov decision process,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.720
not necessarily the true and
current state.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.470
&gt;&gt; You know we talked a little
bit about this in the old

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.630
machine learning class, didn't we?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.480
But just a little.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, well so

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.670
then we're going to get a little bit
more into it, maybe, I don't know.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.920
What did we talk about last time?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.540
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.310
I don't remember,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.210
just that there was-- we mentioned I
think we mentioned that they exist.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.320
we're going to talk about how they work.
