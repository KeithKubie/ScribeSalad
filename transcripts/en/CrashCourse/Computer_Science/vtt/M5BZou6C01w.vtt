00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.339
Hi, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome to CrashCourse
Computer Science!

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.440
As we discussed last week, the idea of having
a computer all to yourself – a personal

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.110
computer – was elusive for the first three
decades of electronic computing.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.150
It was just way too expensive for a computer
to be owned and used by one single person.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.460
But, by the early 1970s, all the required
components had fallen into place to build

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.010
a low cost, but still usefully powerful computer.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.780
Not a toy, but a tool.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.510
Most influential in this transition was the
advent of single-chip CPUs, which were surprisingly

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.140
powerful, yet small and inexpensive.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.629
Advances in integrated circuits also offered
low-cost solid-state memory, both for computer

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.760
RAM and ROM.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
Suddenly it was possible to have an entire
computer on one circuit board, dramatically

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.920
reducing manufacturing costs.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.780
Additionally, there was cheap and reliable
computer storage, like magnetic tape cassettes

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.989
and floppy disks.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.750
And finally, the last ingredient was low cost
displays, often just repurposed televisions.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.280
If you blended these four ingredients together
in the 1970s, you got, what was called a microcomputer,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.080
because these things were so tiny compared
to “normal” computers of that era, the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.440
types you’d see in business or universities.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.030
But more important than their size was their
cost.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.530
These were, for the first time, sufficiently
cheap.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.750
It was practical to buy one and only have
one person ever use it.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.890
No time sharing, no multi-user logins, just
a single owner and user.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.120
The personal computer era had arrived.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:31.200
INTRO

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.880
Computer cost and performance eventually reached
the point where personal computing became

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.880
viable.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.110
But, it’s hard to define exactly when that
happened.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.770
There’s no one point in time.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.200
And as such, there are many contenders for
the title of “first” personal computer,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.950
like the Kenback-1 and MCM/70.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.690
Less disputed, however, is the first commercially
successful personal computer: The Altair 8800.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.950
This machine debuted on the cover of Popular
Electronics in 1975, and was sold as a $439

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.500
kit that you built yourself.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.940
Inflation adjusted, that’s about $2,000
today, which isn’t chump change, but extremely

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.420
cheap for a computer in 1975.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.090
Tens of thousands of kits were sold to computer
hobbyists, and because of its popularity,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.370
there were soon all sorts of nifty add-ons
available... things like extra memory, a paper

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.159
tape reader and even a teletype interface.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.469
This allowed you, for example, to load a longer,
more complicated program from punch tape,

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.060
and then interact with it using a teletype
terminal.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.650
However, these programs still had to be written
in machine code, which was really low level

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.569
and nasty, even for hardcore computer enthusiasts.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.430
This problem didn’t escape a young Bill
Gates and Paul Allen, who were 19 and 22 respectively.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.879
They contacted MITS, the company making the
Altair 8800, suggesting the computer would

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.480
be more attractive to hobbyists if it could
run programs written in BASIC, a popular and

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.870
simple programming language.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.670
To do this, they needed to write a program
that converted BASIC instructions into native

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.370
machine code, what’s called an interpreter.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.000
This is very similar to a compiler, but happens
as the programs runs instead of beforehand.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.670
Let’s go to the thought bubble!

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.910
MITS was interested, and agreed to meet Bill
and Paul for a demonstration.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.900
Problem is, they hadn’t written the interpreter
yet.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.299
So, they hacked it together in just a few
weeks without even an Altair 8800 to develop

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.540
on, finishing the final piece of code on the
plane.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.469
The first time they knew their code worked
was at MITS headquarters in Albuquerque, New

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.700
Mexico, for the demo.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.740
Fortunately, it went well and MITS agreed
to distribute their software.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.519
Altair BASIC became the newly formed Microsoft’s
first product.

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.010
Although computer hobbyists existed prior
to 1975, the Altair 8800 really jump-started

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.029
the movement.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:35.480
Enthusiast groups formed, sharing knowledge
and software and passion about computing.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.340
Most legendary among these is the Homebrew
Computer Club, which met for the first time

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.790
in March 1975 to see a review unit of the
Altair 8800, one of the first to ship to California.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
At that first meeting was 24-year-old Steve
Wozniak, who was so inspired by the Altair

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.639
8800 that he set out to design his own computer.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.639
In May 1976, he demonstrated his prototype
to the Club and shared the schematics with

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.669
interested members.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:05.049
Unusual for the time, it was designed to connect
to a TV and offered a text interface ‒ a

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.909
first for a low-cost computer.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.489
Interest was high, and shortly after fellow
club member and college friend Steve Jobs

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.761
suggested that instead of just sharing the
designs for free, that they should just sell

00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:14.819
an assembled motherboard.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.600
However, you still had to add your own keyboard,
power supply, and enclosure.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.639
It went on sale in July 1976 with a price
tag of $666.66.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.629
It was called the Apple 1, and it was Apple
Computer’s first product.

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.180
Thanks thought bubble!

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.650
Like the Altair 8800, the Apple 1 was sold
as a kit.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.560
It appealed to hobbyists, who didn’t mind
tinkering and soldering, but consumers and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.610
businesses weren’t interested.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.090
This changed in 1977, with the release of
three game-changing computers, that could

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.940
be used right out of the box.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.770
First was the Apple II, Apple’s earliest
product that sold as a complete system that

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.170
was professionally designed and manufactured.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.800
It also offered rudimentary color graphics
and sound output, amazing features for a low

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800
cost machine.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.220
The Apple II series of computers sold by the
millions and quickly propelled Apple to the

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.650
forefront of the personal computing industry.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.460
The second computer was the TRS-80 Model I,
made by the Tandy Corporation and sold by

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.620
Radioshack – hence the “TRS”.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.389
Although less advanced than the Apple II,
it was half the cost and sold like hot cakes.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.120
Finally, there was the Commodore PET 2001,
with a unique all-in-one design that combined

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.380
computer, monitor, keyboard and tape drive
into one device, aimed to appeal to consumers.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.629
It started to blur the line between computer
and appliance.

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.310
These three computers became known as the
1977 Trinity.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.360
They all came bundled with BASIC interpreters,
allowing non-computer-wizards to create programs.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.800
The consumer software industry also took off,
offering games and productivity tools for

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.039
personal computers, like calculators and word
processors.

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.150
The killer app of the era was 1979’s VisiCalc,
the first spreadsheet program – which was

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.389
infinitely better than paper – and the forbearer
of programs like Microsoft Excel and Google

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.389
Sheets.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.710
But perhaps the biggest legacy of these computers
was their marketing – they were the first

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.919
to be targeted at households, and not just
businesses and hobbyists.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.379
And for the first time in a substantial way,
computers started to appear in homes, and

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.330
also small businesses and schools.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.080
This caught the attention of the biggest computer
company on the planet, IBM, who had seen its

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.740
share of the overall computer market shrink
from 60% in 1970 to around 30% by 1980.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.720
This was mainly because IBM had ignored the
microcomputer market, which was growing at

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.360
about 40% annually.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.430
As microcomputers evolved into personal computers,
IBM knew it needed to get in on the action.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.530
But to do this, it would have to radically
rethink its computer strategy and design.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.740
In 1980, IBM’s least-expensive computer,
the 5120, cost roughly ten thousand dollars,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.240
which was never going to compete with the
likes of the Apple II.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.770
This meant starting from scratch.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.030
A crack team of twelve engineers, later nicknamed
the dirty dozen, were sent off to offices

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.789
in Boca Raton, Florida, to be left alone and
put their talents to work.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:59.100
Shielded from IBM internal politics, they
were able to design a machine as they desired.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.639
Instead of using IBM proprietary CPUs, they
chose Intel chips.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.930
Instead of using IBM’s prefered operating
system, CP/M, they licenced Microsoft's Disk

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.409
Operating System: DOS and so on, from the
screen to the printer.

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.750
For the first time, IBM divisions had to compete
with outside firms to build hardware and software

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.300
for the new computer.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.180
This radical break from the company tradition
of in-house development kept costs low and

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.830
brought partner firms into the fold.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.790
After just a year of development, the IBM
Personal Computer, or IBM PC was released.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.250
It was an immediate success, especially with
businesses that had long trusted the IBM brand.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.030
But, most influential to its ultimate success
was that the computer featured an open architecture,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.409
with good documentation and expansion slots,
allowing third parties to create new hardware

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:42.789
and peripherals for the platform.

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:47.210
That included things like graphics cards,
sounds cards, external hard drives, joysticks,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.780
and countless other add-ons.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.289
This spurred innovation, and also competition,
resulting in a huge ecosystem of products.

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.909
This open architecture became known as “IBM
Compatible”.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:00.830
If you bought an “IBM Compatible” computer,
it meant you could use that huge ecosystem

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.850
of software and hardware.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.439
Being an open architecture also meant that
competitor companies could follow the standard

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.110
and create their own IBM Compatible computers.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.870
Soon, Compaq and Dell were selling their own
PC clones...

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.759
And Microsoft was happy to license MS-DOS
to them, quickly making it the most popular

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.340
PC operating system.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.960
IBM alone sold two million PCs in the first
three years, overtaking Apple.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.990
With a large user base, software and hardware
developers concentrated their efforts on IBM

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.139
Compatible platforms – there were just more
users to sell to.

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:32.860
Then, people wishing to buy a computer bought
the one with the most software and hardware

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.940
available, and this effect snowballed.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.930
Companies producing non-IBM-compatible computers,
often with superior specs, failed.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.290
Only Apple kept significant market share without
IBM compatibility.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.100
Apple ultimately chose to take the opposite
approach – a “closed architecture” – proprietary

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.430
designs that typically prevent people from
adding new hardware to their computers.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.000
This meant that Apple made its own computers,
with its own operating system, and often its

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.690
own peripherals, like displays, keyboards,
and printers.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.630
By controlling the full stack, from hardware
to software, Apple was able to control the

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.209
user experience and improve reliability.

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:11.329
These competing business strategies were the
genesis of the “Mac” versus “PC” division

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:15.950
that still exists today... which is a misnomer,
because they’re both personal computers!

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.950
But whatever.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.062
To survive the onslaught of low-cost PCs,
Apple needed to up its game, and offer a user

00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:23.490
experience that PCs and DOS couldn’t.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.000
Their answer was the Macintosh, released in
1984.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.710
This ground breaking, reasonably-low-cost,
all-in-one computer booted not a command-line

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.020
text-interface, but rather a graphical user
interface, our topic for next week.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.600
See you then.
