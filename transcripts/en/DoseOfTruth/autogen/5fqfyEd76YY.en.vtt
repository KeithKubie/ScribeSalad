question how is capitalism compatible

question how is capitalism compatible
 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.120
question how is capitalism compatible
with your definition of good if it

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
with your definition of good if it
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.130

requires ever-increasing uses of the
finite resources of the planet where

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
finite resources of the planet where
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.780
finite resources of the planet where
once depleted would mean our end well I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
once depleted would mean our end well I
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.999
once depleted would mean our end well I
would say capitalism isn't compatible

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
would say capitalism isn't compatible
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.039

finite resources of the planet but
that's by no means self-evident even

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380
that's by no means self-evident even
 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.590
that's by no means self-evident even

especially among the environmentalist

especially among the environmentalist
oriented types who might have some

regards to ocean depletion there's a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
regards to ocean depletion there's a
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.120
regards to ocean depletion there's a
huge argument and there has been for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
huge argument and there has been for
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160
huge argument and there has been for
many many years between the economists

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
many many years between the economists
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.660
many many years between the economists
and the biologists and this is a really

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
and the biologists and this is a really
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.430
and the biologists and this is a really
important thing to know and the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
important thing to know and the
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290
important thing to know and the
economists point out that human

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
economists point out that human
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270
economists point out that human
ingenuity is such that were continually

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
ingenuity is such that were continually
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.430
ingenuity is such that were continually
able to make more with less and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
able to make more with less and
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.650
able to make more with less and
certainly over the last well 500 years

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660
certainly over the last well 500 years
 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.479
certainly over the last well 500 years
especially in the last 150 years that's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
especially in the last 150 years that's
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.279
especially in the last 150 years that's
just absolutely evident you know like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
just absolutely evident you know like
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.959
just absolutely evident you know like
people say we're going to run out of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
people say we're going to run out of
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.250
people say we're going to run out of
energy and I think that's absolutely

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
energy and I think that's absolutely
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799
energy and I think that's absolutely
preposterous it's like it's as crazy as

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
preposterous it's like it's as crazy as
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.599
preposterous it's like it's as crazy as
thinking we're gonna run out of matter I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
thinking we're gonna run out of matter I
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.759
thinking we're gonna run out of matter I
mean we're we're going through a bit of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
mean we're we're going through a bit of
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.500
mean we're we're going through a bit of
a bottleneck right now because you know

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
a bottleneck right now because you know
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179
a bottleneck right now because you know
the population is going to increase to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
the population is going to increase to
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.800
the population is going to increase to
about 9 billion and then it's going to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
about 9 billion and then it's going to
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260
about 9 billion and then it's going to
decrease that's that's the most reliable

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
decrease that's that's the most reliable
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.899
decrease that's that's the most reliable
projections and 9 billion isn't a lot

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
projections and 9 billion isn't a lot
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880
projections and 9 billion isn't a lot
more than we have now and you know

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
more than we have now and you know
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.310
more than we have now and you know
there's going to be some environmental

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
there's going to be some environmental
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320
there's going to be some environmental
disruption as a consequence of that but

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
disruption as a consequence of that but
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.760
disruption as a consequence of that but
I don't think there's any reason to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
I don't think there's any reason to
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.679
I don't think there's any reason to
assume at all that capitalism

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
assume at all that capitalism
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929
assume at all that capitalism
necessarily requires ever-increasing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
necessarily requires ever-increasing
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789
necessarily requires ever-increasing
uses of the finite resources of the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
uses of the finite resources of the
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890
uses of the finite resources of the
planet it's also not obvious to what

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
planet it's also not obvious to what
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539
planet it's also not obvious to what
degree the resources of the planet are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
degree the resources of the planet are
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.990
degree the resources of the planet are
actually finite because we can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
actually finite because we can
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999
actually finite because we can
continually think up new uses for things

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
continually think up new uses for things
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429
continually think up new uses for things
that nobody thought had any use at all

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
that nobody thought had any use at all
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469
that nobody thought had any use at all
and so it depends to some degree on

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
and so it depends to some degree on
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210
and so it depends to some degree on
whether or not you're willing to bet on

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
whether or not you're willing to bet on
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.020
whether or not you're willing to bet on
human imaginative Ness or you're going

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
human imaginative Ness or you're going
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.960
human imaginative Ness or you're going
to be a Malthusian pessimist and I'm not

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
to be a Malthusian pessimist and I'm not
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.310
to be a Malthusian pessimist and I'm not
saying that there aren't reasons for

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
saying that there aren't reasons for
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.410
saying that there aren't reasons for
both I'm just saying that it is by no

both I'm just saying that it is by no
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149
both I'm just saying that it is by no
means self-evident that things are

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
means self-evident that things are
 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090
means self-evident that things are
getting worse you know like I can give

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
getting worse you know like I can give
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.670
getting worse you know like I can give
you an example so you know in the last

you an example so you know in the last

you an example so you know in the last
in the last 15 years the Millennium goal

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
in the last 15 years the Millennium goal
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.789
in the last 15 years the Millennium goal
for the UN was to have world poverty

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
for the UN was to have world poverty
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.820
for the UN was to have world poverty
like absolute poverty so that's less

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830
like absolute poverty so that's less
 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.010
like absolute poverty so that's less
dollar fifty day by fifty percent within

dollar fifty day by fifty percent within
 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.380
dollar fifty day by fifty percent within
fifteen years that was actually reached

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
fifteen years that was actually reached
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.600
fifteen years that was actually reached
ahead of schedule and we've lifted

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
ahead of schedule and we've lifted
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.370
ahead of schedule and we've lifted
hundreds of millions of people into the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
hundreds of millions of people into the
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.020
hundreds of millions of people into the
middle class over the last thirty years

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030
middle class over the last thirty years
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.720
middle class over the last thirty years
and so there is an increasing inequality

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
and so there is an increasing inequality
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.910
and so there is an increasing inequality
in the West because the working class

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
in the West because the working class
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.560
in the West because the working class
has taken the brunt of that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570
has taken the brunt of that
 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.810
has taken the brunt of that
say that redistribution to third-world

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820
say that redistribution to third-world
 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.670
say that redistribution to third-world
countries but by the same token you know

there's no starvation in the world

there's no starvation in the world
 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.720
there's no starvation in the world

purpose and people are becoming richer

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
purpose and people are becoming richer
 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.060
purpose and people are becoming richer
and more educated all the time and you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070
and more educated all the time and you
 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.680
and more educated all the time and you
know when we are waking up to our

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
know when we are waking up to our
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.900
know when we are waking up to our
planetary responsibilities once people

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
planetary responsibilities once people
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.300
planetary responsibilities once people
stop starving to death and having to

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
stop starving to death and having to
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.120
stop starving to death and having to
burn like dirt and and eat you know the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
burn like dirt and and eat you know the
 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.800
burn like dirt and and eat you know the
substandard food that they've scraped

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810
substandard food that they've scraped
 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.080
substandard food that they've scraped
out of the ground they do start to turn

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
out of the ground they do start to turn
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.550
out of the ground they do start to turn
their attention to things that might be

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560
their attention to things that might be
 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.650
their attention to things that might be
more aesthetic and so look I don't think

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
more aesthetic and so look I don't think
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.020
more aesthetic and so look I don't think
there's any reason to be pessimistic not

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
there's any reason to be pessimistic not
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.810
there's any reason to be pessimistic not
fundamentally and I guess the reason

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820
fundamentally and I guess the reason
 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.880
fundamentally and I guess the reason
that capitalism is compatible with my

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890
that capitalism is compatible with my
 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.680
that capitalism is compatible with my
definition of good I wouldn't say that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690
definition of good I wouldn't say that
 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.290
definition of good I wouldn't say that
exactly I would say that I don't see an

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300
exactly I would say that I don't see an
 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.810
exactly I would say that I don't see an
alternative that has manifested itself

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820
alternative that has manifested itself
 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.180
alternative that has manifested itself
that doesn't have far more negative

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190
that doesn't have far more negative
 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.310
that doesn't have far more negative
consequences you know it's sort of a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320
consequences you know it's sort of a
 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.650
consequences you know it's sort of a
minimal pessimism issue it's like well

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660
minimal pessimism issue it's like well
 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.020
