00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.490
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
good morning everyone.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.050
Good morning and welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.100
for the first time
for several of you.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.620
And welcome back to those of you
who are able to join us last night.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.120
I'm John Cole.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.630
I'm the Director of the Center
for the Book in the Library

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.820
of Congress an organization was
created by Dr. Daniel Boorstin back

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.270
in 1977 to reach out on behalf
of the Library of Congress

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.790
to promote books and reading
and to promote the study

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.690
and encourage the study
of books and reading.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.320
To that menu since 1977,
we've added literacy

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.180
which was not discussed
much in 1977.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.810
Another major topic that
where there's difference

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.250
but similarity was the
threat in 1977 of technology.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.910
Everyone was worried but the
technology we were worried

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.760
about was television and Dr.
Boorstin created the center,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.410
in part, I learned after
accepting his offer

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.720
to become the founding director.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
He had an idea and that was to
start using commercial television

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.050
to promote books and reading.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.960
And we were able to
do that through--

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.880
for 10 years through a project

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.200
with CBS television
called Read More About It.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.120
And we put those from
reading messages at the ends

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.220
of major CBS programs and
start with the programs.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.060
And if you enjoyed the program,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.910
the Library of Congress suggests
these books and we have books

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.150 position:56%
that came across the screen that the
message was go to your local library

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.000
or bookstore, not the
Library of Congress.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.630
Go to your library or
bookstore, they will be happy

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.910
to help you read more about it.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.040
And from that grew one of our
reading promotion networks

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.040
with not only television
and technology involved.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.980
But booksellers and librarians
and gradually we are Center

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.920
for the Book will have its 40th
anniversary next year in 2017.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.870
But the project that brings us
together is a special project

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.110
that came to the Center for the
Book through David Rubenstein,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.810
a philanthropist who's doing
some many wonderful things

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.080
for our country but in Washington,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.840
DC in terms of helping
support government institutions

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.590 position:56%
that have a relationship to American
history, largely and that appeal

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.080
to Mr. Rubenstein in
terms of his interest.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.690 position:56%
And we did not know when Mr.
Rubenstein first started giving help

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.280
to the National Book Festival
which is another major Center

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.280
for the Book endeavor,
now in its 16th year

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.090
that Mr. Rubenstein had
this interest in literacy.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.290
And that came a little
later and he is the one

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.320
who initiated this project
and he's funding it.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.040
And I'm so pleased to have
you here and to be able

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.300
to explain a little bit about the
framework that's brought us here.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.400
We have aboard, the
Literacy of Advisory Board

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.730
to help us during the 5-year
pilot grant from Mr. Rubenstein.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.360
And he has encouraged us to think
about the future in the hopes

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.130
that this will be extended and
maybe developed in a permanent way

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.450
that might be endowed, but that
the first 5 years would be almost a

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.160
period of experimentation in trying
to embrace awareness of the problem

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.540
of literacy and by doing award
work but also by symposium

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.790 position:56%
and by other means that are kind of
generic to this Center for the Book.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.290
We also have affiliates
in every state.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.370
So everyone of your states has a
partner with us to promote books,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.520
reading, literacy, and
libraries in the state.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.310
So, this is the second
symposium held by the literacy--

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.040
advisory of our literacy
program and we're so proud

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.240
to have Nemours as
a partner in this.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.930 position:56%
The first symposium was literacy and
poetry and we learned about a number

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.270
of organizations in poetry that
have common interest with us

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.490
and have been able to bring several
of them into our network of reading

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.790
and literacy promotion partners
and Laura Bailet from Nemours is

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.140
on our board and she was someone

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.690
who when we had our first
board meeting was talking

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.350
about what we're talking
about today.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.990
How important literacy is to health
and in many ways, and this was news

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.430
to other members of the board,
and we immediately put this

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.430 position:56%
on the agenda for a future symposium
and we're here today and I thank you

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.980
for your participation
and I will, I'm afraid,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.450 position:56%
tell you a little bit more about the
overall endeavor as we move ahead.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:38.060
But now, I am going to move
ahead and follow our program.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.190
We-- I would like to
introduce, however,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.620
a special guest Dr. Louis
Sullivan who has joined us today.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.170
He was unable to join us yesterday.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.630
I met Dr. Sullivan for the
first time just a few weeks ago

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.930
when we had him as a
speaker about his new book

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.910
at the Library of Congress,
his memoir.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.880
And he pointed out and I
stand up straight when he said

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.710
so that the Georgia
Center for the Book has--

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.040
was featuring his book on his
website as part of their program

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.700
of putting up on the website
books every Georgian should read.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.420
And this is a rotating
list of course.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:25.820
But nonetheless, it still is
headlined by Dr. Sullivan's memoir.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.000
He was the secretary of health

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.100
and human services during the
administration of George H. W. Bush

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.810
and is the chairman of the boar

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.030
of the National Health
Museum in Atlanta and what?

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.320
He talked about a lot was
being the first president

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.690
of the More House School
of Medicine.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.640
He also is the head of
the deep Washington,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.180
DC based Sullivan Alliance

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.990
to transform America's
health professionals

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.990
and he's going to be
with us all day.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.510
I'd like him just to stand
and be acknowledged please.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.410
[ Applause ]

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.960
Last night, we had a wonderful
keynote address by Dr. David Bailey

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.450
and I know that a number of
you were not able to join us.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.390
But we're very fortunate
that he is today going

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.890
to be the introducer
of the keynote today.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.880
But I just wanted to thank him
publicly for getting us off

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.820
to such a good start because
his talk, no surprise,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.170
really was a wonderful
keynote that focused on how

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.430
and why reading proficiency
and literacy are

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:46.600 position:56%
such strong indicators of-- actually
of overall health through adulthood

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.670
and that is what we're trying
to bring together as we do

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:54.150
in these symposia are fields
and learn about other fields

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.190
from the perspective of literacy

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.880
to see how we not only
conform new alliances.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.940
But perhaps look ahead together
for new ways of solving some

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.630
of the problems that
we were faced with.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.890
And last night, Dr. Bailey
nicely lined up the alignments

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.040
of various worlds that we occupy
and literacy and in education

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.830
and in health and pointed to this
is an opportunity for us to think

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:28.850
about coming together in ways that
would affect policy and to try

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.300
to keep the broadest possible
perspective on this on behalf

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.210
of our society rather than what we
all tend to do and we're all guilty

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.530
of this is spending so much time
on our specialties and trying

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.020
to prove ourselves and
prove our organizations

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.710
that we often forget
the broader picture.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:57.050
So this is an attempt to talk about
and learn about and do something

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.910
about the broader picture.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.420
Dr. Bailey is the president
of Nemours Foundation,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.220
which he became president in 2006.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.050
He is leading light and we--

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:16.150
the whole world of health with many
honors and for those I know a few

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.070
of my friends are here
today who don't know

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.400
about Nemours is an integrated
children's health system

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.970
with two hospitals in the
Delaware Valley in Florida

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.860
and it serves children from
across the United States

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.690
and internationally.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:36.530
Nemours also operates 45 primary,
specialty and urgent care clinics

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.000
in 4 states and is responsible
for the website Kids Health,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.750
which we have all learned
about through Laura in our work

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.510
on the Literacy Advisory Board.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.510
And I am very pleased to
present Dr. David Bailey

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.140
who is the distinguished
introducer of a--

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.430
our distinguished keynoter
for the morning.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.230
David Bailey.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:06.230
[ Applause ]

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Bailey: Well, good morning.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.250
I am Dave Bailey.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:17.100 position:56%
And I would just like to add my
welcome to Dr. Cole's to this summit

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.440
on literacy, health,
and new perspectives.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.820
You know, the Library of
Congress staff, Dr. Cole,

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.540
have been extraordinarily
kind and accommodating.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.060
They arranged the great weather.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.120
The only thing they forgot was
to get cherry blossoms blooming.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.230
&gt;&gt; And the trains.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.900
&gt;&gt; The train-- Yeah, the
trains are another thing.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.880
Yeah, we're delighted
that you've all joined us

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.270
for this I think very important
symposium and the connections

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.880
between literacy and health.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.610 position:56%
In this morning, I really have the
distinct honor and personal pleasure

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:04.690 position:56%
to introduce our first speaker,
keynote speaker, Dr. Sandra Hassink.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.530
Dr. Hassink is a pediatrician's

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.570
She is consummate physician

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.890
and she's what we know
as a triple threat.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:26.720
A superb clinician, a esteemed
researcher, and admired educator.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.170

that has an aggressive child health
policy agenda both nationally

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.030
and internationally.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:04.170

Among them, "A Parent's
Guide to Childhood Obesity",

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.980
"Pediatric Obesity,
Prevention, Intervention

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.410 position:56%
and Treatment Strategies for Primary
Care", and "The Clinical Guide

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.470
to Pediatric Weight Management".

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.280
And if all of this weren't
enough, Dr. Hassink has served

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.310
on the Institute of Medicines
committee on accelerating progress

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.320
on obesity prevention
and was an author

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.010
on the expert recommendations
for obesity.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:25.610
And probably a reason she's been
able to get through all of this

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.640
and maintain such a calm exterior
and that she holds a master's

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.310
of science in pastoral
care and counseling.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.510
Please help me welcome Dr. Hassink.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:48.250
[ Applause ]

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.550
&gt;&gt; Sandra Hassink:
So David, thank you.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.310
I wasn't sure exactly
who you were speaking

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.280
about for a moment, but
thank you very much.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.200
So as Dr. Bailey said, I spent this
several years as president elect,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.520
president, now past present
of the academy speaking wildly

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.160
around the country
and internationally,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.880
and speaking about the
foundations of child's health.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.570 position:56%
And I love this quote by Louis
Pasteur that I think typifies how we

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.420
as pediatricians and how we really
feel all of us about children.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.820
"When I approach a child he
inspires in me two sentiments;

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.900
tenderness for what he is, and
respect for what he may become."

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.250
And I think that holds
the hopes of all of us

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.290
that in the moment we can
respond to the needs of the child

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.110
in that very moment that we
all are encountering the child

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.410
and their family.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.780
But we hold the hopes for
the future of that child.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.530
And we know without a
doubt that what we do

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.940
in this moment is significant
for that moment but significant

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.370
for the child's future
and I hope to illustrate

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.750
that as we move through this talk.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.330
So I always start my talks by
asking how are the children?

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.150
How are the children doing?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.440
And you can look at this
through many lenses and I picked

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.300
out a few things to look at
just nationally how we're doing.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.950
And you know this varies
widely state to state,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.040
but our diet quality only 50%

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.120
of children are now meeting federal
standards, diet quality standards,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.460
18% of our children have obesity,
30% nationally have overweight

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.330
and obesity, and 9% of our
children have activity limitations

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.970
from some other chronic condition.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.170
When we look at emotional
and behavioral health,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.610
we see the parents are reporting
significant serious emotional

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.270
and behavioral problems
in 5% of their children.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.630
And our adolescence, 8% of them,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.960 position:56%
12 to 17 have had a major
depressive episode in the last year.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.560
I think we need to just
pause a moment on that one.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.200
10% of our children have asthma and
52% of our children, ages 3 to 4,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.750
are not enrolled in
quality or any preschool.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.130
And I think you'll see today how
literacy interweaves itself among

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.010
all these childhood problems.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.120
And almost half of our children,
0 to 6, lived 200% are below

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.280
of the poverty level with
11% of our children living

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.960
under 50% for the poverty level.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.420
So, when we think about the
foundations of child health,

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.860
I've been using a framework
from the Harvard center

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.500
for the developing child
because I want to be able

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.580
to have a conversation about
every child in this country

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.640
and what every child
in this country needs.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.160
Because I think, as Dr.
Bailey, so rightly pointed

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.220
out that we often live
in our silos and live--

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.370
and look at the world through
the-- our own particular lenses.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.850
And I think we need to broaden
this conversation and now think

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.150
about what every child needs.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.390
Every child needs sound
and appropriate nutrition.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.660
That means that if we combine food
and security, hunger, obesity,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.970
and overweight, 50% of
our children are suffering

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.600
from a nutritional hardship.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.550
Every child needs stable response
of nurturing relationships at home,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.110
early childcare and education at
school and in their community.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.580
And every child needs safe
supported physical, chemical,

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.410
and built environments and you'll
see how literacy weaves itself

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.300
through these foundation
elements of child health.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.730
And so at this conversation
in this country right now,

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.460
should be about what
every child needs

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.360
and how we all together can
build those foundations.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.320
So the academy of pediatrics
has it's strategic plan

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.290
and about 10 years ago we renamed
our strategic plan the Agenda

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.590
for Children.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.860
And you'll see in this circle
some of our guiding principles,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.570
Medical Home, Health Equity, our
own Profession of Pediatrics.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.770
You'll see pillars, Access,
Quality, and Finance,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.910
which really mean the
ability of children

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.690
to access health and health care.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.390
But those elements in the middle
really are a pivot for us.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:48.470 position:56%
So 10 years ago, you might have seen
oral health, immunizations, tobacco,

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.160
very important child
health topics on this list.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.730
But what you see now are
Epigenetics, Early Brain

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:57.090
and Child Development,
Poverty and Child Health.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.530
And we just released our
poverty statement this month.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.300
We are now looking carefully
at the foundational elements

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.270
that build health for children.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.840
And I think it's a very important
pivot for us to have taken.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.440
And it's out of our anxiety

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.020
that children are not receiving
these foundational elements

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.320
that build good health.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.640
So our agenda now speaks to the
socioecologic framework of children

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.390
because you build health
everywhere for children.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.730
You build it in the
home with your families.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.300
You build it in the community.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.670
You build it with infrastructure.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.970
You build it with literacy.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.010
You build it all together
for children.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.710
And so you can see the
socioecological model,

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.410
just some elements that are
important to child health

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.080
and they really run the
gamut from school nutrition

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.670
which I've been speaking
about extensively this year

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.730
to injury prevention, taking
care of the mother infant dyad,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.230
taking care of the
intrauterine environment.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.110
You can see them there and
how it calls us to work

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.400
in a cross-sectoral fashion.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.880
So, why are we speaking today
about health and literacy?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.850
Well, we know as physicians
low health literacy--

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.320
low literacy is associated
with low health literacy.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.110
And so, more than 90
million US adults at least

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.300
in 2003 lack the literacy needed

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.390
to effectively negotiate
the health care system.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.370
So those of you who have high
literacy, know how difficult it is

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.850 position:56%
to negotiate the health care system.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.940
It can be sort of a laboring
thing process of paper work

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.780
and phone calls and appointments.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.460
And if you have basic or only basic
literacy, you are significantly

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.810
at risk for not being able to
get the healthcare you need.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.960
And you can see that if you look
at below basic and basic literacy,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.340
basic literacy is searching a short
simple text to find out what you

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.950
as a patient might be allowed
to drink before a medical test,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.350
signing a form, adding the
amounts on the bank deposit slip,

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.060
finding a pamphlet for jurors,
using a TV guide to find out what's

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.780
on the program, comparing
ticket prices.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:05.230
So if you don't have these
skills above basic skills,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.270
you simply can't negotiate
the health care system

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.440
with any efficacy.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.130
And then we write a lot of things

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.930
in the health care
profession for patients.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.170 position:56%
We write a lot of patient education.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.940
But you can see here the percentage
of the population of each state

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.180 position:56%
that has below a 5th grade level of
literacy, the darkest red is the 30%

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.120
or greater, the orange is 20%
to 30, 15 to 20 in the green,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.700
and 10 to 15 in the blue.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.210 position:56%
And you know that many patients
can't literally read the information

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.510
that we're putting out.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.090 position:56%
So I was in one of our clinics in
North Wilmington and we were handing

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:42.600
out an obesity paper that's
said 520, fruits and vegetables,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.400
exercise, juice, and TV
had very simple information

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.100
and what was happening is we
were finding those pamphlets

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.070
in the trash can in
the waiting room.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.720 position:56%
People simply couldn't process that.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.760
And we had tried to be very
careful about the language we used.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.360
So we decided then we have to
model the behavior we wanted,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.880
but this is a huge handicap
for our adults and our adults

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.660
or the parents of our
young children.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.830
So low literacy and related
low health literacy and parents

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.050
of young children increases
developmental risk

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.660
because they can't access what
they need to support their children

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.380
and something very mundane
in the health care system

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.950
but incredibly important.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:26.200
They can't negotiate medication
dosing or adhering to routines

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.720
or goals or-- are preop
preparation or goal setting

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.020
around the chronic illness.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.320
They can't adhere to that

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.000
because they don't have
the health literacy skills.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.360
And then the perpetuation of this
really perpetuates the cycles

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.800
of poverty, poor health and
dependency across the life course.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.530
So it's really important for us.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.490 position:56%
Adults with limited health literacy,
and you'll hear this probably over

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.600
and over today, have
diminished diseased knowledge.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.600
They don't use preventive
services at the same rates.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.170
They have increased
hospitalizations,

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.030
poor health status, poor
control of chronic illness,

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.790
and you know we have an epidemic
of chronic illness in this country.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.190
Globally, we would call this
noncommunicable disease,

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.360
lifestyle-related diseases,
and the ability

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.600
to control chronic illness
is crucial to your ability

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.550
to prevent early death
and severe morbidity and,

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.060
of course, and mortality.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.960
So reading a routine for a
person with type 2 diabetes

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.340
and managing insulin dosing is
actually quite a complex set

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.650
of interactions that have to
occur and can occur in adults

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.950
with limited health literacy.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:34.070 position:56%
So in 2014, we put out a statement
at the academy on literacy promotion

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.250
and just highlight some of
the things that you all know

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.320
that greater than 1 and 3 US
children start kindergarten

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.290
without the language skills
needed to learn to read.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.350
Reading proficiency by third grade
is the most important predictor

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.360
of high school and career success.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.070
And 2/3 of children each year,
80% of whom live in poverty fail

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.940
to develop reading proficiency
by the end of third grade.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.880
Saw a father in my
office and he was--

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.850
actually was a grandfather
raising his grandson

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.840
and his grandson wasn't
learning to read in school

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.460 position:56%
and he had begged the school to hold
him back so he could learn to read.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.550
But the school had-- your own
promotion criteria and were set

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.850
on promoting the young man.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.840 position:56%
So I have the situation of a
grandfather pleading with the school

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.990
and pleading essentially
with me for some help

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.050
in helping his grandson
learn to read because he knew

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.480
if he got farther into school
without learning to read

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.440
that was a sentence for him and it
was a sentence about not being able

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.680
to complete high school, not
being able to get a good job,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.890
not being able to execute on the
dreams the grandfather had for him.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.590
So, we talked about early
childcare and education.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.670
This is the early learning
unmet need in our country.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:49.290 position:56%
And you see the maps, the light pink
here is a 0 to 25%, the dark is 76

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.480
to 100% and it's a map that looks
a little different than some maps.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.080
So, when we look at these
maps of the United States,

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.130
the health disparities and the
disparities in accessing solutions

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.020
to health problems
often look the same.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.070
This looks a little different
but we had a lot of 4-year-olds

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.440
that don't have about
preschool education.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.130
And this is sort of
an interesting map

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.260
about the change in
preschool enrollment.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.110
So some preschool enrollments
have gone down in the orange,

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.310
some have gone up in the dark blue.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.290
We don't have a uniform
approach to this.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.660
So merely by being born in
your county, in your town,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.270
in your state really sets your
health trajectory for the rest

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.650
of your life because these
disparities are reproduced

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.580
on every health measure
that we can find.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.650
So no one state is doing
perfectly on everything but I think

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.300
that that leads to our
saying that the zip code it--

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.080
maybe your most important health
indicator as a young child.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.290
So, where does literacy start?

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.420
Well, we look at young children.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.050
This is a slide courtesy of Pam
High from presentation to us

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.830
at our national meeting that
language environment of children

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.310
at home is highly variable
and really tracks

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.220
with socioeconomic status often.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.720
So the vocabulary at age 3
and the parent words per hour,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.160
you can see how that track.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.200
So the ability to be in
a high word environment

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.090
or not will set your word
gap by kindergarten entry.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.970
So, there have been studies
that show the kind of talk

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.030
that happens in families.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.910
So some families talk a
lot to their children,

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.990
some families talk very little.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:28.560
Business talk gets things done.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.860
Brush your teeth.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.160
Sit at the table.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.460
Finish your vegetables.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.760
Don't say I said that.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.520
But nonbusiness talk is sort
of that chitchat, the mother

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.260
or father leaning over the child
and just having a conversation,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.850
talking about what's
in their environment,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.970
talking about a book for instance.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.360
Business talk was constant
across families

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.620
but it was this nonbusiness talk,
this sort of relational talk

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.440
that really made the
difference and you'll see here.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.990
So the talk of the families had
more praise than prohibitions.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.770
The more silent families
more prohibitions than praise

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.070
because if you're doing a lot

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.800
of task-oriented talk,
that's what happens.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.820
At 3 years, the IQ correlated
with nonbusiness talk.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.410
And at third grade,
the receptive language.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.810
So even very, very early on and
this is what makes early reading

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.960
and early relational attention
to those early relationship is

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.000
so important for our young children

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.170
because long before they can
read your laying the groundwork

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.940
for literacy and reading.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.640
So talkativeness predicted
IQ and vocabulary.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.190
I want to talk a little bit
about literacy and poverty

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.380
because as I told you,
half of our child--

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.520
almost half of our children live
200% or below the poverty level.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.640
Children from low income
family have fewer words

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.850
in early childhood know
fewer word by 3 years,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.360
have fewer literacy
resources which--

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.540
within their home and you'll hear
a lot more about that less likely

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.360 position:56%
to be read regularly and more likely

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.770
to experience early childhood
adversity and toxic stress

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.410
and we'll talk about that.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.000
And these are our poverty
rates in these countries.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.090
So this is the dark red are
the 20 to 30 Percent of poverty

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.770
and you can see courtesy of the
2008 recession what has happened

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.940
to child poverty in this country.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.860
And so children are sort of
the first affected and the last

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.210
to be lifted out of poverty.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.360
So I want to talk a
little bit now about some

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.000 position:56%
of the science that's emerging about
what happens in early childhood

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.280
and the impact for later
health trajectories.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.830
And many of you are familiar
with Vince Felitti study

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.560
on Adverse Childhood Experiences.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.890
And Dr. Felitti was a physician
at Kaiser Permanente and study

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.440
over 17,000 adults and many

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.060
of whom had chronic
illnesses including obesity

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.640
and he merely asked them what
happened to you as a child?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.190
So he asked them about abuse,
emotional, physical and sexual,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.010
household dysfunction,
mother treated violently,

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.460
household mental illness, divorce,
incarcerated household member,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.920
and later about emotional
and physical neglect.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.850
And in this study, these were
the percentages of adults

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.260
who reported having experienced one

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.950
of these adverse events
in their childhood.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.250
And I would say if
you'd look at this,

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.800
you would say this is pretty high.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.180
Physical abuse, 29%.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.960
Mother treated violently, 27%.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.070
This is pretty and is
disturbing in and of itself.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.900
But what happened when he looked
at their current health status,

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.640
he realized that the
current health status

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.650
of these adults had
a graded relationship

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.630
to the adverse experiences
they experienced in childhood.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.310
So if you experience more of these
adverse events, you're more likely

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.650
to have chronic heart disease,
cancer, chronic lung disease,

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.630
skeletal fractures,
and liver disease.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:41.340
If you experience more
adverse childhood events,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.450
you would have more risk factors
for chronic disease, smoking,

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.300
alcoholism, promiscuity,
obesity, substance abuse.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.820
These ACEs, this Adverse Childhood
Experiences were associated

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.740
with general health and social
functioning, poor general health

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.580
and social functioning, poor
mental health, depression,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.980
sleep disturbance, anxiety,

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.010
poor anger control, and
memory disturbances.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.640
So this takes us right
back to where we started

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.250
which was what's happening to the
child as a child immediately is

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.540
so important and needs
to be attended to.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.580
But what happens to that child
imbeds itself in our biology

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.610
and has lifelong health effects.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.020
So this was a study of a
maternal report of ACEs

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.200 position:56%
at a 5-year followup study and
these were fragile families at risk.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.290
It was a fragile family
and child well-being study.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.830
And these were mothers of children
age 5 reporting maltreatment

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.220
in their families.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.350
Physical, sexual, psychological
abuse and neglect and I think

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.820
that you can look at this numbers
and say that's really disturbing.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:40.460
How many of these children
had experienced this ACEs

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.720
household dysfunction?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.390
And then, the children
that had no ACEs were 45%.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.550
But over half the children
in this study had one

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.550
or more adverse childhood
experiences, 27%, 1; 2,

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:59.050
adverse childhood experiences
16%; 3, 8%; 4, 3%; and 5 ACEs 1%.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.760
And so they connected these
adverse childhood experiences

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.680
to their experiences with literacy.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.800
So children who had not yet
or not began to understand

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.210
and interpret a story or other
text that was read to them,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:17.300 position:56%
if you had one adverse experience,
you had a slightly higher odds ratio

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.960
of not being able to
understand and interpret a story.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.700
If you had 3 or more, you
had an odds ratio or 2.2.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.050
Not yet or beginning to easily

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.450
and quickly name all upper
and lower case letters.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.080
You can see that the trajectory,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.980
the trend for more ACEs
less ability to do that.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.930
Not yet or beginning to read simple
books, you can see the trend.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.210
Not yet or beginning to
demonstrate understanding of some

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.270
of the conventions of print.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.020 position:56%
So, we know that literacy is
interwoven here with the experiences

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.970
of childhood that can
either promote literacy,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.530
prevent literacy, interfere
with literacy.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:57.550
And we know that this is also
affecting children's brains.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.470
So the first years of life
hold the most critical periods

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.770
for brain development.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.260 position:56%
This is the classic slide that
shows the synapses you have at birth

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.990
and then you develop a lot of them
at 6 and then they're pruned by 14.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.130
And the pruning is
really the refinement

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.140
of the circuitry of the brain.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.380
So-- And that refinement
is experience-based.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.650
It doesn't happen the
same for every person.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.230
Based on your experiences,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.470
your brain is altering
your synaptic connection

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.860
and literally its anomaly.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.750
So, the regions of the
brain that are most affected

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.460
by these toxic stress and adverse
childhood experiences are the

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:35.030 position:56%
hippocampus, learning, memory,
discrimination of danger and safety.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.870
The prefrontal cortex,
impulse control.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.010
The amygdala, increase
in impulsive behavior

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.340
and that mediates fear and anxiety.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.480
So these toxic experiences are
shaping the children's brain

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.560 position:56%
development, shaping their exposure
to protect the factors like literacy

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.080
and the context from which the
child comes is so important.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.640
So part of what we're asking
pediatricians now and all of us is

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.920
to not just deal with that
immediacy of what the situation is

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.550
when the child walks
into your clinic,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.590
but ask what's happening
to that child?

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.980
What's the context of the child?

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.920
What's the state of family?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.370
What's the state of
their experiences?

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.020
And we're trying to
build resilience.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.860
And so the flip-side of this
is how do we build resilience

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.400
in our children and
you'll hear later

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.600
on this conference how
literacy is a promotion

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.390
in children is a powerful
skill, tool,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.330
and pathway to build
resilience in children.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.630
It's powerful.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.360
It's something every parent can do.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.210 position:56%
And it involves building
relational support for the children.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.060
It actually I think and maybe
Bob-- we don't know this, Bob.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.910
But it forces-- I think it
reduces stress in the adult

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.470
to have these quiet
moments with children.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.000
So I used to literally
prescribe time to my parents.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.300
So I was in clinic.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.600
We were trying to do a hard thing.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.640
We were trying to really
shift lifestyles

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.940
to promote a healthy weight.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.590
And any of you who've tried
do that that is very hard.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.510
So I literally would prescribe 15
to 20 minutes a day for the parent

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.960
and they were not allowed
to do tasks

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.080
like you couldn't be 15 minutes
on the homework or 15 minutes on,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.110
you know, what you're
going to wear tomorrow,

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.110
it had to be this engagement time.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.410
You could read.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.710
You can paint each
other's fingernails.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.950
You could hair and the
children were delighted

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.490
and the parents were
often astounded.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.540
First that I would ask
that they spend this time

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.120
and they started ask, well,
how can I get that 15 minutes?

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.480
And we figured that out and
then when they would come back,

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.050
they were astounded because
what happened with that time was

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.840
that they remembered the
joy of being a parent.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.210
They remembered how fun
it was to engage to child.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:44.670
The children of course
were delighted

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.200
because it was never a child
I never met that didn't want

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.190
to spend more time
with their parent.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.010
And then-- So, I think that
this building resilience is not

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:55.310
rocket science.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.680
But it often feels like
rocket science to families

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.460
when they're trying to carve
out this time, time to read,

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:04.110
time to be with their children from
very busy, highly stressful life

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.700
and you add on those ACEs that
not only are occurring now

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.720
but the parents experience,
you can see that this is--

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.000
that we need to be absolutely
supportive of our families here.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.210
Increase sensitivity to the child's
needs and that relational time

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.730
that time with the child
increases that sensitivity.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:28.350 position:56%
And then when we spend the time to
address the problem in its immediacy

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:29.650
that the parents are having

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.540
so we can become solution
oriented for the parents.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.540
So this is a handout that
I would often give parents.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.450
And again, not rocket science
but often hard to imagine doing

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.590
when you're in a highly
stressful situation.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.710
Share your feelings, play,
set consistent expectations,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.210
protect the child from adult
concerns, encourage small goals,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.920
try something new, keep
healthy, try something relaxing,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.400
things we would all
sort of endorse and sort

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.490
of basic foundational elements
are often hard for parents

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.650
to do unless they're supported.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:02.980
So our literacy promotion
recommendation

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.890
for pediatricians were
to promote literacy

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.350
at health supervision visits.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.530
Really inform parents,
advice parents

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.900
that reading it loud can
enrich the relationships.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.310 position:56%
Counseling about what are
developmentally appropriate literacy

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:21.770 position:56%
activities and provide books and
you'll hear more about that as well.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.930
We also said make your
office literacy friendly.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.590
Use posters and inform parents
about the importance of literacy.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.510
Partner with advocates like we're
doing today to promote literacy.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.500
Incorporate literacy in
our training programs.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.840
Sports-- Support funding for
children's books and research.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.500
So we call out our profession

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.050
to really do a 360-degree
support of literacy.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.350
And we have some tools.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:55.390
So we have bright futures that
has literacy and woven into it.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.760
And also the ability
now the new addition

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.850
to detect these adverse childhood
experiences and build resiliency.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.980
Promote Reach Out and Read,
which you'll hear about.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.060
And many, many pediatricians
are doing this in their offices

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:11.050
and address these toxic experiences
that prevent the building

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.080
of resiliency, the building
of literacy in our families.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.160
And this is just an interesting map

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.500
of the book deserts
in the United States.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.850
And so you'll see that the
orange is percent of homes

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.150
with more than 100 books.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.450
And 100 books is a lot.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.040
For some of us, I don't think
100 books is a lot in my house

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.080
but it is a lot and
you'll see that they're--

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:38.200 position:56%
very map reproduces itself, overlays
many of our maps of chronic illness

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.300
and health disparities
in this country.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.700
So we have on our website
literacy building tools,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.380
books building connection toolkit.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.790 position:56%
This is for professionals and
families and just to highlight that.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.870
And then we talk about and
help pediatricians understand

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.030
and parents why books, what
a child can do with a book,

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.170
how parents can enjoy the
book, and when to share,

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.820
and how to weave literacy
into your house.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.860
And so supporting evidence for
professionals because our docs

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.840
like to know why they're
doing it and then what--

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.500
ask about and what to do.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.040
And then promoting the five
Rs; reading, rhyming, routines,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.340
rewards, and relationships.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.700
And you can see how integral
literacy and literacy promotion is

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.860
into building these really
foundational elements

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.120
of family relationships.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.080
So, all families need to understand
and hear the important message

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.930
that literacy is important.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.990 position:56%
So-- And we said that in our policy.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:39.320
But I was taking the red-eye to
Chicago and I jumped into a cab

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.410
and the driver and I were
chatting and he learned

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.980
that I was a pediatrician
and many of you

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.370
who are pediatricians
know this happens,

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.220
people find out you're
pediatrician and they really want

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.600
to tell you about their children.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.710
And so he began telling me
about a 6-month old daughter

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.710
and he's working two jobs and he's
not at home with her very often

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.630
and he wanted to give her
the best possible life.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.320
But he said, "I am working
to give her a better life

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.850
but I don't have a lot of time,"
and he was really lamenting that.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.150 position:56%
And he asked me, "What I should do?"

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.070
And I said, "Well, read to her."

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.540
And he looked puzzled.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.520
And he said, "But she's
only 6 months old

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.700
like what are you crazy,
read to her?"

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.090
And I told him how
reading builds brains,

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.630
vocabularies changes behaviors,
sets up children for success.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.760
And we wound up discussing early
child development, literacy

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.810
and learning, and the
cab ride from O'Hare

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.940
to our headquarters
at Elk Grove Village.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.160
And he was amazed.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.970
And he was grateful.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.830
And he was grateful that he
could do something for her even

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:41.460
in the little time he had.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.760
And we arrived at the hotel.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.900
He couldn't stop thanking
me and shaking my hand.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.320
He said, "I will read to her."

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.540
And he said, "There's
something I can do to help her

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.560
and help her have a better
future and I will do it."

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.850 position:56%
So, I think we can underestimate the
importance of this for our children,

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.840
the importance of this for our
parents, the importance of this

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.540 position:56%
for our families, and the importance
of this for building the foundations

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.330
of child health in our country.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.930
So, thank you very much.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.510
And I'm pleased to be here.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:30.270
[ Applause ]

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:34.080
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, thank you very
much for that wonderful beginning,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.840
followup to what we've
started last night.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.820
I'm pleased that we can approach
this subject from so many points

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.600
of view and there are many
points of view to come.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:49.410
I want to say just a word about
today's schedule and logistics.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:53.810
We-- Last night, those of you who
are not able to join us, I'm sorry,

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.320
did not have a chance
to see the Library

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.760
of Congress' historic building,

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.340
the Jefferson Building
which opened in 1897.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.720
Instead we're-- in
our newest building,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.510
which opened in 1980,
the Madison building.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:11.440
We're proud that all three of
our buildings across the street,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.040
the second building,
we're not visiting

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.330 position:56%
at all is called the Adams Building.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:18.570
But we were created in 1800.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:23.570
It was the first federal culture
institution and our three buildings

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:28.080
on this campus are named
for book loving presidents.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.690
And Jefferson had a special role
in founding the Library of Congress

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.730
by selling at his-- at
cost really his library,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:42.130
his comprehensive library to the
fledgling Library of Congress

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:47.160
in the Capitol after the
British had burned it in 1814.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.680
And from the comprehensiveness

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.480
of his collection came the
comprehensiveness of the approach

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.300
of the Library of Congress which
meant we collect in all subjects

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.070
and we try to share resources.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.320
We are in effect the
National Library even though

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.940
because we're legislative
branch and have congress

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.100
as our most important client,

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.130
we don't have the official
name National Library.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.660
But that gives us feeling
that we can reach

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.590
out through educational
outreach and other activities

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.460
that cover many different
subjects and are national place

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.870
to bring together groups that
normally would not come together

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.570
and it's in that spirit in which
the Center for the Book was formed

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.900
and also in which we
are needing today.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.280
Now down to the nitty-greedy.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.140
The restrooms are just outside.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.490
There is a lunch for the speakers
and their guests next door.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.930
But members of the
public who will be coming

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:54.590
and going all day our
cafeteria is just a step away.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.410
So it's close by.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:01.560
All of our talks are in this room.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.700
Is that-- That's right.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.160 position:56%
We are featuring panel
discussions that have been organized

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:14.530 position:56%
with experts on the various
aspects and approaches to our topic.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:21.110
We also will have a couple of
specialized sessions of one

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.310
with our Robie Harris
who will speak about--

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:29.390
an author who will speak about her
perspective, is a wonderful author

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.850
of books on our subjects.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.540
The second one is something
we talked about and are going

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:44.250 position:56%
to have a short presentation and the
general idea was the role of health

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:50.100
in a crisis in kind of a policy
crisis or a different kind

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.330
of national crisis and we are going

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:56.800
to have a short presentation
1:10 today by a specialist

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.860
from the World Bank about Ebola,
literacy in the Ebola crisis to try

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.430
to bring us up to date
on another way of looking

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.440
at what we're talking about.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.530
And in our keynote this morning,
it's interesting, you know,

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.950
that we really are talking not
only about research for specialist

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:25.230
but in fact real life for cab
drivers and for providing advice.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.900
And that was another point
that came out last night is

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.870
that first confrontation with an
adult about a very young child

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:36.510
and what time are you
spending together.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.820
And Dr. Bailey made the point at
least to me in another conversation

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.420
that sometimes he knows immediately
or maybe with someone else last

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:51.530
that if there's no reaction at all,
you know there's work to be done.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:55.070
And when someone thinks
about their youngest child

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.520
and that's an opening,
I think, for all of us.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:04.000 position:56%
Our second-- Let me see if I-- Now
when we-- We'll have a chance with--

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.050
We'll have a chance for
conversation depending on--

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.330
and I'm not going to
quiet anyone now.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.610
We have the time to speak.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.830
But at the very end of the
day, we'll see how it works

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:18.270
and we have some free time for
conversation and questions.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:24.920
But I will encourage the chairs
to use that time now to the best

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.590
of their judgment whether you
want to take questions or not.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.970
And we also will not spend
much time on biographies

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.460
because biographies are
in your handout along

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.960
with some general information
about our program about the Center

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.150
for the Book, but also about
the literacy awards program.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.830
And you'll see those handsome--

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.860
we've now had three years of
literacy awards and I urge you

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:58.100
to take a look at the handouts
because we have developed a plan

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.740
that goes beyond the cash
awards which Reach Out and Read,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:06.020
I should note was the first
winner of the Rubenstein award.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.320
So maybe this is prophetic
that we are all coming together

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.800
with this particular focus.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.300
It shows how we really are,
I believe, beginning to learn

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.650
from what we're doing and using
the literacy awards connections

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:25.640
with organizations as a way
for us and you if you're here

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:29.230
to see what how big
this world really is.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.660
But we developed something
called best practices obviously.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.470
And we-- it goes beyond
the three large cash awards

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.280
and these are recognitions
from the Library of Congress.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.670
So far, it's just with
the certificate.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:50.240 position:56%
But we're hoping that as our program
evolves we can do more in helping

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.450
out some of the smaller
organizations

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.550
that are getting best
practices awards.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:00.820 position:56%
And beginning with our second year,
we really expanded, figured out what

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.340
to do with best practices.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.280
And each time we've given
between 12 and 15 organizations

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:11.220 position:56%
from around the world best practices
acknowledgments and been able

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.510
to bring them here to the library
to talk about their programs

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:20.550
and we are filming our
programming in the process,

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:25.920
developing our website which
one of this days when we crash--

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.750
not crash, went-- wrong verb--

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:36.650
when we penetrate the Library of
Congress' web services to the point

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.660
that we can move our
results up a little faster.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:47.250 position:56%
We'll be showing you some of our--
the website films from some winners.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.510
And for us, it's a great
stimulation to have people

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.450
from other countries come and
just have their 10 or 15 minutes

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:59.510 position:56%
of recognition and we film it and
we also have a page for each of them

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:04.310
in our last two annual books which
they can use to promote themselves.

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:08.800
So, this is an ongoing process
and you are now part of it

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.780 position:56%
and we will move to our first panel.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:16.640
The panel is Child and Adolescent
Health and Literacy Issues.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:22.160
and the panel consist of Libby
Dogget who will be the chair.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.220
Laura who is part of it.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.860
Lindsay Carter and Dr. Needleman.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.590
And I would like them to come up

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.960
and I will introduce Libby
a little bit but not much.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.260
Come on up.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.660
Everybody come up.

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.050
Libby will have the panel
members say a little bit

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.370
about their own backgrounds.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.130
But Libby herself is with
the Department of Education.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.820
She's an assistant-- Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Policy

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.410
and Early Learning in the Office of
Elementary and Secondary Education.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.590
And we are all meeting-- some

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.610
of us are meeting each
other for the first time.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:47:59.910
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: That's
right, we are.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.210
&gt;&gt; Trying to figure
out who's sitting--

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.990
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: We actually met on
the phone because we are prepared.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:08.460
So I think what we'll
do is I'm going

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.890
to introduce the panel a
little bit or the frame

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:15.310
of the panel although
Sandy did an incredible job

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.890
of really introducing
the whole topic

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:19.800
and it was just a beautiful
presentation.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.700 position:56%
So, thank you for your presentation.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.590
But more importantly, thank you
for what the American Academy

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:26.770
of Pediatrics is doing
in this country.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.570
They are making a difference.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.810
[ Applause ]

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.270
&gt;&gt; Laura is going to help
with timekeeping for you.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.570
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: OK.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.040
So, one of our panelists
couldn't come but we promised

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.890
that we would make
sure that her message

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.740
on diversity in books
would be heard.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.810
So, Ellen Oh was not
able to join us today.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.870
I regret that because she would
have been incredible person.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:51.650
She is an author as well as the CEO

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.740
of a group called We
Need Diverse Books.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.230
And we do need more diverse book.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:01.400
So, we will try to work her
message into what we're saying.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.750
I'm delighted to be here.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.050
It's such an honor.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:08.200
I think the Library of Congress
is the most beautiful place

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.890
in the entire world and
the idea that we have

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:16.500
so many books available here
and electronically now and then

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.160
in libraries all across this
country is just pretty incredible.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.090 position:56%
We have a program at the
Department of Education called "Race

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.820
to the Top: Early Learning
Challenge."

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.410
And we have spent a billion
dollars funding 20 states.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:33.450
And one of the states, Maryland,
has worked really diligently

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:38.020
to get families engaged in
their children's education

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.020
and to just establish
stronger partnerships.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.060
And one of the things
they've done is

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.170
to actually introduce
families to the library.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.310
And I think we all take
libraries for granted.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.610
When I was a little
girl, my family--

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.800
my mother took us to
library every week

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.220
and beside her bed was always
a stock of books this high

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.650
and I don't know how she got
through them with four kids.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.490
But she somehow at least
got through a lot of them

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:07.450 position:56%
because she was always reading and
reading to us and so we all got used

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.730
to bringing home a stack of books.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.730
But in Maryland, some
of the newer families,

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:18.050
the new immigrant families didn't
know that the library was free.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.760
They hadn't used the library
because that they thought

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.230
that that incredible
resource was something

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:26.220
for others, people who could pay.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.280
And so they had event
at the library,

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.330 position:56%
made sure the families got a library
card and taught them how to use it

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.140
and I thought that
was such a great way

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.260
to make a difference
in families' lives.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.920
I remember very well when the
first time I learn to read,

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.770
I grew up in a family that I
had no excuse for not reading.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:50.010
Family that did very well.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.760
I was raised to Marywell,
which a little--

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.000
fortunately, I did but I did
more than that hopefully.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.620
But I didn't know how to read when
I get to first grade and I've gone

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.300
to kindergarten, I've
gone to preschool

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.970
at the church, Norton's Preschool.

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.750
But I had no idea how to
read and I remember sitting

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:11.740
in the reading group, have this
vision so clearly in my mind

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.390 position:56%
and the teacher put a book, a little
book in front about eight of us

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.900
and asked if anybody
knew what TIP meant.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:24.780
And there was of course a
beautiful cute picture of a dog

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:30.570
and my friend Mark Blumenthal who
is still a friend said, "Tip."

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.910
And I just looked at him like
he was the smartest person

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.990
in the world because I had no idea.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.260
No one had ever taken
the time to teach me

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.250 position:56%
to decode the letter and the sounds.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.020
And I was in first grade and,
of course, once I've learned,

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.530
it was very easy but
it was so interesting

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:52.170
because learning to
read is not easy.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.450
And some kids just
automatically get it.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:57.900
But most children do not
and it is very difficult.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:02.880 position:56%
So we're going to have a change with
Laura to go into depth about that.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.590
And then we've already heard about
how important it is to have books

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:11.430
and that that reading and the
relationship that develops

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.960 position:56%
between the parents and the child
sitting close, talking about things,

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.750
slowing down is so
very, very important.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.050
We know to do that.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.840
We still aren't doing it.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.950
It's just amazing to have--
we have Reach Out and Read.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:28.540
We have RIF still.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.280
We have all kinds of ways
to get children books.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.050
But we're not doing a very good job

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:35.870
of getting those books
into the home yet.

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:39.810
But we have one great way to do it
and I'm glad to see it's expanding.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.020
So Robert will tell us about that.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.860
And then, I think it's interesting

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.600
that other countries are
using our great research

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.710
and are doing all kinds
of wonderful thing.

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.080
And so we're very fortunate to
have Lindsay from the Department

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:57.330
of Agriculture to help
us frame this not just

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.130
in the United States but globally.

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.450
And so she'll talk a little bit

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.880
about what we're doing
here and abroad.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.830
Before I turn it over
to my incredible panel,

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:12.700 position:56%
I want to just give you a little bit
of background about what's happened

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.970
in the last seven years in
early childhood education,

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.490
because that's what I do.

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.140
We have been fortunate
to have a president

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.260
who really did focus on this.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.630
I can remember sitting
around the table in Austin,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:29.270
Texas where I actually live
with some of my friends thinking

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:33.230
"Who can we get to champion
early childhood education?"

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.990
We didn't-- You know, there
was no city council person,

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:37.290
certainly not the mayor.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:40.370
There was no member of
house or senate in Texas.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:43.310
There was certainly no one
in congress, no senator.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.770
We wouldn't have thought of the
president championing in this.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.740
We did find a business
leader or the wife

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.660
of business leader Ronya
Kozmetsky whose husband was present

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:54.480
at the Business School
of University of Texas.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.490
She was incredible advocate for us.

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:01.950
And we wouldn't have dreamed
of where we would be now.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.280
I was sitting just across the way

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.490
at the Capitol a few years ago
watching the state of the union.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:11.720
And I had been told that there was
going to be a special announcement

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.680
about early childhood education.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.450
Little did I dream that
the president would set

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:17.850
such an incredible goal.

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.140
But we have the goal
of providing pre-K

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.200
for every 4-year-old
in this country.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.500
We're not there yet.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.040 position:56%
But we keep-- the president keeps
coming back with it year after year.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.510
We know that's not a silver bullet.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.370
But we know that's doable
because Oklahoma is doing it,

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.270
because West Virginia is doing it.

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:39.800
Georgia, Vermont now is offering
pre-K for every 3 and 4-year-old.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.830
So we know how to do this.

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.280
States are getting in line.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.580
It's not a silver bullet.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:46.410
We need to do pre-K
for 3 and 4-year olds.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:50.330
We need to improve the whole
childcare system and make it

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.760
into an early learning
system where every setting

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.150
for children is a learning setting

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.910
and that's going to
take a lot of money.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.470
But there is a proposal on the
table also to improve the quality

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.500
of childcare across our country.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.350
And then, there's a wonderful
piece of the president's agenda

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:11.570
which talks to parents because
we know that every parent wants

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.430
to do the best possible
job for their children.

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.210
You never talk to a
parent who hasn't said,

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:17.510
"I want to do a better job."

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:22.500
I thought your story about the
taxi cab driver was so wonderful

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.020
because we all hear that
and every parent wants that.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.820
They just don't know how.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.370
And even our middle-income families

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.980
and upper-income families
are stressed now

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.570
because mothers are working
and fathers are working

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:36.490
and their lives are
so very complicated.

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.420
I have two young daughters
and I just marveled

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.950
at how they carve out
time for everything.

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:47.570
So, with the president's agenda,
we have money set or asked--

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:50.850
we're asking for a great increase
in the home visiting money.

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:53.750
It is come down through this
president where it's exciting

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.160
because we have home visiting now

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.690
which is really parent
coaching in every single state.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.710
But we know it's only
reaching a small portion

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.010
of the families that need it.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.430
It's all voluntary.

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:07.520
But you know what, every family's
asked, "Would you like some help?

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.330
Would you like coach or a mentor?"

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.780
They all-- Nearly always say yes.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.940
So there is an agenda on the table.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.820
We have people at the highest
levels now talking about it.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:24.020
We had more recently in the
New York, really a competition

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.380
between the governor and the mayor
of New York City about who is going

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.830
to pay for the pre-K program.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:33.860
We need more arguments
like that to raise this up.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:37.610
I do think the American Academy
of Pediatric is really made--

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.090
been a great advocate for this.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:42.160
Because it's not people
like me who are advocate

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.980
but it's really the business
leaders, the doctors, the--

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.960
actually, the flag officers,
generals, and the naval officers

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.720
who have come in and
have really made the case

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.640
that we need this not just for
the kids and for the parents.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.390
We need this for our country and
for the future of our workforce.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.700
So, it's been a great ride.

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.610
I hope we can continue the
momentum because there's--

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:10.960
we've just barely started.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.030
The growth is way too small.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.330
It's way too late.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.810
These first five years
disappear like that.

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:18.660
For us, five years is nothing.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:21.580
But five years, children are
already in kindergarten and then

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.780
in first grade and we've missed
an incredible opportunity.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.060
So now, we're going to go in depth.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.730
And we're going to
start off with Laura.

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.240
I mean with-- I'm sorry--
with Robert.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.380
And he's going to tell us about
a great Reach Out and Read

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.320
which Sandy mentioned and
he'll tell us more about it.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.890
And they're limited to three or
four minutes and they're going

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:45.660
to introduce the topic and
then we're going to just kind

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:50.790
of have a conversation among us but
we are reserving 20 minutes for you

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:52.090
to have a conversation with us.

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.910
So, write down your questions,
be thinking about this

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:57.440
because we really do want
to engage the audience.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.840 position:56%
And we have incredible experts here.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.140
So, Robert.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.440
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman:
Thank you very much.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:08.400
It's wonderful to be here seeing
old friends making new friends,

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.440
realizing that our vision is
shared and it's very powerful.

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.540 position:56%
Now, I-- my heart is thinking
though, Sandy while you were talking

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.470
because I'm thinking she's saying
everything I was going to say.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:24.400
And my only consolation
is as a pediatrician,

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:29.520
I know that learning is closely
connected with repetition.

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:33.780
So, this will give you an
opportunity to master some

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.460
of this material a little bit more.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.960
And I have written my comments down
because I didn't want to go over.

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.690
I could easily talk
for the hour myself.

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:44.080
But this is to keep me in line.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:51.090
So, Reach Out and Read is an
approach to pediatric primary care

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:53.020
that puts the connection
between health

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:55.550
and literacy, front and center.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.600
We do this in several ways.

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.830
First, we create literacy-rich
waiting rooms.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.890
In the best situation,
we have volunteers

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:05.710
who are reading with the children.

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:10.220
And more importantly, demonstrating
to the parents two things,

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.130
one that it's easy and two
that their children love it.

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.280
In the situation in which
Reach Out and Read developed

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.840
which was a large clinic serving a
low-income urban population Boston

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.450
City Hospital now Boston
Medical Center.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:28.370
Parents regrettably would often
wait for an hour for their visits.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:32.940 position:56%
So instead of that hour being filled
with the kind of control speech

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.450
that you talked about,
it was an hour now filled

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:40.970
with observing their children
responding to books and somebody

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:42.970
who could present them
in a happy way.

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:47.140
And we discovered a form of
waiting room contagion which was

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:51.210
that as parents were watching one
person interacting with children

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:53.720
about books, other
kids would come along

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.120
and then the parents would hang
in the back would start picking

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.350
up the books and looking at
them with their children.

00:59:58.350 --> 01:00:01.410
So pretty soon we created a milieu

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:03.820
in which literacy fused
the waiting room.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.680
And we also noticed
that things got quieter

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.330
because the kids weren't
running around

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:08.730
and the parents weren't
yelling at them.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.420
They were engaged.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:16.350
We have a new developmentally and
culturally appropriate picture book

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.850
at every visit to the pediatrician,

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:21.970
every Well-Child visits
starting at six months of age.

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.900
That's important for
a lot of reasons; one,

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.880
is because the books cost money
and so we have to raise money.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.620
Two, the more importantly, it's
not about giving books to families.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.550
It's not about getting
books into the home.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.740
There are many more efficient
ways to get books into home

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.680
than having a pediatrician
hand them about.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.180
It's about having the book
in the clinic to use together

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.890
with the parent and the child.

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.810
And I'll say a little
bit more about that.

01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:53.660
And specifically the most
important thing I think

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:59.590
that we do is we provide
individualized one-on-one guidance

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.000
to a parent with a child
about how that child

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.500
and parent are together using
literacy to creat connections,

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.280
to enrich their language,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.460
and to establish an optimistic
outlook for the child.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.430
So a great pediatrician told me
something at the very begging

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:20.130
of Reach Out and Read he said,
"You know, when I bring the book

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:23.280
into the room, we have
conversations with the parents

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.060
that we never had before.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:30.430
And the conversation is about my
child growing up to be a learner."

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:36.430 position:56%
And that was sort of a
world-changing perspective for us is

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:40.350
that we were tapping into a very,
very powerful strong current

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:45.650
within the parents of optimism
and hope and also fear.

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.710
Parents would not had good
experiences themselves

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:52.270
in the educational world,
those were our patients,

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:56.650
could see as your cab driver could
see there is something I can do

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.210
tremendously powerful.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:02.580
Reach Out and Read reaches 4.4
million mainly low-income children.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.580
It's about 25% of the low-income
children in the country.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.880
That's awful.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.160
I mean, it's wonderful, right, 25%.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.460
It's awful.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.420
What about the other
75% who receive care

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.720
at some 5500 clinics
around the country?

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.530
And we have affiliated programs now
in many other parts of the world.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:25.880
Italy and Germany are
on board and some places

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.560
where books are being
used specifically

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.810
to help the most stressed
kids like the Philippines

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.360
where we've been involved
with kids who are affected

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.970
by the storms there and Haiti.

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:42.310
We embrace a wholistic view of
health which includes physical,

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.700
social, and emotional well-being.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.650
And I won't go into more of that
because it's been talked about.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.150
And importantly physicians,
pediatricians,

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:55.020
family doctors have a special
opportunity because of our contact

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.420
with parent at 10 regularly
scheduled Well-Child visits

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.640
because they're in the
room with us one-on-one

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.400
and because parents we know come to
us not only for advice about health

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.710
but also for advice about
their children's development

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:09.010
and what they can do.

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:13.060
Reach Out and Read rests on
a strong base of evidence.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:17.670
We have 14 and now maybe
15 studies published

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.220
in the peer-reviewed literature

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:24.010
that demonstrates some
very important outcomes.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:27.420
Most importantly parental
attitudes towards reading aloud,

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.630
including the judgment when
you asked parents in a sly way

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:34.370
that doesn't sort of
prejudice their answers.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.630
The judgment that reading aloud
is one of the favorite things

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.280
that parents do with their child,
so a source of joy together.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.440
And correspondingly
increases in the frequency

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.280
with which parents read aloud and
in the number of books in the home.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.820
And then most importantly,
we've been able to document

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.700
through several studies,
five at last count,

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.120
improvements in children's
language development,

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.070
specifically vocabulary.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:02.780
And that's because vocabulary
is both a direct result

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.700
of reading aloud that we know

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.130
that as parents read aloud
children's vocabulary increases the

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.420
number of words that
they're exposed to increases.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.850
And it's also a very robust
predictor of later school success.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.620
So that when we can show
experimentally that institution

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:21.090
of a Reach Out and Read program
increases children's vocabulary,

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:24.250
which has been shown, then we know

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.170
that we're setting those
children up for later success.

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:30.340
A new evidence, including a
marvelous report published

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.220
in pediatrics awhile
ago increasingly shows

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:37.040
that literacy acquisition,
listening to stories,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.570
engaging with literature changes
the structure of the human brain,

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.270
specifically the parts of the brain

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.510
that are engaged in
listening to stories.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:49.570
So when we talk about literacy
in health, we're really talking

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:54.350
about the health of a very
important organ, the brain.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:58.110
And now increasingly
we're able to see

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:02.300
through technology how
literacy changes the brain.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.510
No mystery there.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:08.500
But it's quite clear that a healthy
brain is important if you're going

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.210
to become a literate and
successful member of society.

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.390 position:56%
So, our intervention is specifically
health-related in the sense

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:19.990
that we have a target organ,
the brain, that we're changing.

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:24.450
And also, as you mention, Sandy,
very importantly, shared enjoyment

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:28.550
of stories strengthens
attachment and emotional health.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:32.410
And I believe builds resilience.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:37.580
So, recognizing this into a
connection between literacy

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.000
and health, Reach Out
and Read is an answer

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.860
to one very specific question.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.630
What can doctors do?

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:50.470
What can doctors do concretely
everyday in their offices?

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:51.770
There are many things we can do.

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:53.070
We can advocate.

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:54.370
We can educate.

01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:55.890
But what can we do everyday
in our office day in and day

01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:02.050 position:56%
out to move children towards greater
literacy and thereby greater health?

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.290
I just want to end-- I
probably talked long--

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:08.750
saying one thing about the name
Reach Out and Read, all right.

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:11.470
I would say it in this context.

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:13.530
It's a little in-joke for me.

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:19.520 position:56%
The name was thought off by my
wife, who is a surgical pathologist.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.390
And is she sees children
in her professional life,

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:24.130
that's little, tiny
pieces of children.

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:28.700
And she thought off the name
because we wanted a cool acronym

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.060
so it was R-O-A-R,
Reach Out and Read.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.900
That only lasted until the
mayor of Boston informed us

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.510
that R-O-A-R also stood for
Restore Our Alienated Rights,

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.900 position:56%
which is anti-Boston group in south.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:48.330
So we became the first maybe only
literacy organization that's spells

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.530
its name wrong.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.180
But it also turned out to
be prophetic in the sense

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.750
that we're learning that
reaching out is not only reaching

01:06:57.750 --> 01:07:00.120
out to parents and connecting
with their aspirations

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.890
for their children, but
that this enterprise

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:08.050
for pediatricians requires us to
reach out to other professionals

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:11.360
who have other expertise
to business people,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.530
to educators, to policy people.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:19.060
The program really only works
when we cross boundaries.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.450
Pediatricians cannot
and do not do it alone.

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:26.750
And giving pediatricians,
family doctors a tool

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.830
that they can use everyday
also encourages them

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.730
to look beyond the walls of
their clinic, because they need

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:35.770
to make common cause with
others in the community.

01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:38.570
So in that sense, we're reaching
out as well and that's the reason

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:41.420
that I'm especially
delighted to be here

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.320
to have this discussion with you.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.980
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Thank you so much.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.670 position:56%
You know, we wouldn't have Reach Out
and Read if it weren't for Robert,

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:48.970
because he's one of the cofounder.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:52.530
So, the fact that your wife
got the name, obviously,

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:56.140
tells us how imminently you were
involved in the beginning of that.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.630
I think he's given us a challenge.

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:04.260
Only 75% of the kids don't have
this and we know how to do this.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.880
This is doable.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.540
I think the other challenge
that we all have is getting time

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.400
for pediatricians to do this.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.330
Because I know I have a
son-in-law who's a pediatrician

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.950
and he is challenged and
my daughter did family--

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:20.160
it has family practice and,
you know, that challenge

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.460
of having the time to do it.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.760
They both do it but
it's very difficult, so.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.060
Thank you.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.960
So, Laura is next and she's going
to take a little bit different tack

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.530
and talk a little bit
more about literacy

01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:31.340
but you'll see how it
all comes together.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.640
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Good morning.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.110
I'm Laura Bailet and I direct
the Nemours BrightStart program.

01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:38.850
Nemours is an integrated
children's health system

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:41.030
and Nemours is recognized
reading failure

01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:45.140
as a major child health
issue several years ago.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.640
Given a really significant
health educational

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.730
and truly life consequences of poor
reading ability, Nemours identified

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:57.670
that it couldn't just sit on
the sidelines of this issue.

01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:00.780
And this has been so
reinforced to me just

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.840
in the last 12 hours listening

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.680
to Dr. Bailey's wonderful
talk last night

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.690
and then Dr. Hassink this morning.

01:09:07.690 --> 01:09:11.700
And these are two of our
physician leaders at Nemours.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.410 position:56%
Dr. Bailey is our President and CEO.

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:18.580
And their pediatricians and to hear
them talk about literacy issues

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.330
with such in-depth knowledge
and emphasizing all the ways

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:25.460
and how much that's important

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.570
for pediatric health care is
just stunning to me still.

01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:34.210
And it just reminds me what an
honor and privilege it is to work

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:38.850 position:56%
at an organization like Nemours that
really does value the whole child

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:41.310
and helping every child
maximize their potential.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.000
So I just had to give that
commercial for Nemours.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.300
It's stunning.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.720
So, for the past 11 years,
Nemours BrightStart has developed

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:52.140
and researched new tools
for educators, parents,

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:56.980
and health care providers because
as we know all of those folks

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.140
in our community have
a big role to play.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.660
And we want to help each of these
folks understand what it takes

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.440
for every child to
become a strong reader.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.540
And Sandy did a great
job of reminding us.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:11.870
We need to talk more about
what all children need.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.370
And there's still is a
lot of misunderstanding

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:17.680
about what every child
needs to thrive.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.520
We also focus a lot on how to
identify those children who maybe

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.180 position:56%
at risk and what to do to catch them

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.400
up before they have
a chance to fail.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.220 position:56%
So we've developed educational tools

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:33.440 position:56%
that through our research have been
proven highly successful in reducing

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.850 position:56%
that reading readiness gap in these
vulnerable children before they even

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.350
get to kindergarten.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:43.020
I wan to talk a little bit
about one of our current project

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:46.400
which is a website for
parents of children from birth

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.750
through 5 called
readingbrightstart.org.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.900
On that website we've really taken
everything that we've learned

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.890
from our work with
thousands of children.

01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:56.970
We've worked with children
our selves.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:11:00.780
Parents and teachers direct
work with all of these people.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.430
And put all of that
content into a website

01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:07.940
with the goal empowering parents,
really putting them squarely

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:13.070 position:56%
in the driver seat in preparing
their own child for reading success.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:14.370
One of the best features

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.980
of our website is our
preschool reading screener

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.070
for 3 to 5-year-olds.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:22.530
This is a simple check list
that helps the parent find

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.940
out if their child is on track
in their reading readiness

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.540
or maybe needs more help.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.520
After the parent completes
the screener,

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.490
they receive a customized
action plan for there child.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.790
All aspects of the
website are currently free

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:41.620
and we've optimized the site for
smartphone to make it as accessible

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.090
as possible to people
across the income spectrum.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:50.130
So today, in this setting we're
releasing our very first national

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.240
reading readiness snapshot.

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.090
So through the website thousands
of parents from all 50 states

01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:59.520
and Washington, DC have
completed that screener.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.820
And thousands of them have
given us there permission

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:06.200
to use their child's data
for research purposes.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.410 position:56%
So we're sharing with you our very
first set of result as a springboard

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.260
to our goal ultimately of universal
reading readiness screening

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.740 position:56%
for every 4-year-old in the country.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:20.130
We have copies of our reading
readiness snapshot document

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:21.430
out on the table.

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:22.730
So, please grab one.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.320
We're happy to discuss the result

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.640
and answer any questions
you have about that.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.120
And we think this screener
as well as the website

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.880
as a whole can work really, really
well with programs like Reach Out

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.210
and Read and other
community initiatives

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:38.270
to strengthen early childhood
programs and resources.

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:39.570
Thank you.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:40.870
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Great.

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:42.170
Thank you.

01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:43.470
We want to hear more about that

01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:44.770
because I do want to
hear the results.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:46.070
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: OK.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.370
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So where--

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.840
as I mentioned in my intro Lindsay
Carter is here from the USDA,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.620
University-- US Department
of Agriculture.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.880
So we have education and we talked

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.890
about health and we
have agriculture.

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.890
And they're doing amazing stuff.

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.000
We were really excited
when we were talking

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.200
and just hearing all
what's going on abroad.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.140
So Lindsay, give us a little taste.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.850
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Carter:
Thank you very much.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:10.500
Yes, I'm here today from the
US Department of Agriculture.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.940
And many of you maybe aware of
the National School Meals Program

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:17.920
and School Breakfast Programs
that we implement here in the US.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.630
But over what-- that's with
the food and nutrition service.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.490
But coming over to
another part of USDA,

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:28.410
we have the Foreign Agricultural
Service which has a mission

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.000
to improve agricultural trade
and reduce world hunger.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.180
And one of the programs under
our agency is the McGovern-Dole,

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.070
full title, International
Food for Education

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:41.920
and Child Nutrition Program.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.350
Which I think even in the
title alone really ties

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:46.800
in the health and then nutrition.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.970
Our program began bin 2003

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.600
after being authorized
under the Farm Bill.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.580
And our mission is to help promote
education, child development,

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.920
and food and security in some of
the world's poorest countries.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.980
This is done through the use of US
agricultural commodities as well

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.890
as technical and financial
assistance to initiate, start,

01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:13.240
and continue with school
meals programs.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.190
And it's through this provision
of school meals that we look

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:19.430
for an initial increase
in school enrollment

01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:24.530
and school attendance rates, which
is very visible visiting programs

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:28.920
in Malawi you suddenly see a lot
more children being sent to school

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.950 position:56%
when their parents realize "Hey, our
kids are going to get a free meal."

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:39.120
And sometimes that is the only
meal that they receive in a day.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.430
And we-- through programs as
well, we're improving enrollment,

01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:46.570
increasing attendance rates,

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:49.680
and then also reducing
school dropout rates.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.960
Our program is implemented by our
private voluntary organizations

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.480 position:56%
and also international organizations
like the UN World Food Program.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.480
Our program is running
from three to five years,

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.000
sometimes potential
for continuations.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.620
And at present, we have 33
active agreements in 25 countries

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.120
across Latin America
and the Caribbean,

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.640
all parts of Africa
and Southeast Asia.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.440
And what we find through
our programs is, well,

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.400
we saw initial increases
enrollments,

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.840
our program is doing a great job
about getting children into school.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.230
It's when you got their
butts in the seats,

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.380
how do you start teaching
them to learn?

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.240
So in 2012, we developed
two results frameworks,

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.670
which include increase
literacy and increase the use

01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.850
of health and dietary practices.

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:51.070
And this is through how
sort of school feeding leads

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:56.090
to at more children being
well fed, being at active

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.280
and attentive, ready to learn.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.640
A hungry child is going--

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.840
is not going to have the
same learning capacity

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.040
as a child that is well fed.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.370
Improve nutrition that comes from
providing a daily nutritious meal.

01:16:11.370 --> 01:16:14.840
But we found that in order to
reach these goals we needed

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.610
to have complementary activities.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:21.570
So, what we have a lot under
our program is an addition

01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:23.420
to the providing a school meal.

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:28.470
We're bringing the parent-teacher
organizations together usually

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:31.630
to prepare the meal, to
serve the meal as well

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.620
as to support the school.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:36.600
We'll introduce school
gardens which include a--

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.910
the FAO has developed the
school gardens curriculum.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:44.860
This isn't for the children to be,
you know, out of the classroom,

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:49.650
but it's the opportunity for the
children to use the garden to be

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:53.640
out learning about
what's being grown.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.580
I've seen school gardens where
they create the planting beds

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.790
in different shapes, so the
children can learn shapes.

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:08.150
There's a whole way of developing
a constructive curriculum.

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:12.520
We then talked about in order for
the children to get the nutrition

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.250
and the meal, building
routines, teaching handwashing,

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.820
making sure there's
access to safe water,

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:23.300
so that the school meals
can be safely prepared

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.390
and the overall health of
child is going to be supported.

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:30.730
We're also doing teacher
training and we're making sure

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.080
that there are books
in the classrooms.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.940
For example, Room to
Learn is working in Laos

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.110
to make sure there
are school classrooms.

01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:44.780
And a lot of these communities
there's usually a generation

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:48.990
of parents where a large
proportion of them are illiterate.

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:50.290
So, how do you bring them in?

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.490
Our program in Mali has
developed report cards,

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:59.290
which is landmark report
cards for illiterate parents.

01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:02.240
That connects the parents
with the goal of the child

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.970
because we believe a parent doesn't
necessarily need to be literate

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:10.030 position:56%
to understand the value of education
and want their child to be literate.

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:13.980
So, we have brought
all of those together.

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.920
We encourage our organizations to
build capacity at the national,

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.030
regional, and local level,

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:26.950
which usually involves developing
a national school feeding policy

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:29.530
and understanding what
is the benefits.

01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:36.120
So we try a lot of-- there's a lack
data connecting really what is the

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:41.900
value of providing a school meal
to improve literacy and health

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.030
and nutrition of the
school age child

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.920
and how those two objectives
support one another.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.480
So, we have-- we have
baseline, midterm,

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.260
and final evaluations
building a base of data as well

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.930
as taking our own initiatives
within our office

01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:01.580
to develop systematic reviews
of what's already been studied

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.440
out there across the world.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.950
And then build upon that, by
building our own learning agenda.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:11.270
What do we need to know and what
pathways of attribution do we need

01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:14.470
to learn so we can provide
this data to foreign government

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:18.190
to further support their
school meals programs

01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:20.040
and there improve literacy.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.690
And I think this is important.

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:26.650
The final note that
I want touch upon is,

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:30.030
here in the US our school
meals program is housed

01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:32.890
within the Department
of Agriculture.

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:35.980
This isn't the case in many
of the countries that we work.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:39.340
The school feeding
unit is usually housed

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.270
within the Ministry of Education.

01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:44.100
So working on curriculum
development,

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.810
when we need to advocate for why

01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.920
that should be a national school
feeding policy we're talking

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.230
to the education ministry.

01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:57.050
So coordination with them and
recognizing the connection

01:19:57.050 --> 01:20:02.040 position:56%
of how school feeding can lead to
improvements in literacy and health.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.990
But that touched upon today
especially the pediatricians

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:10.060
between the connection of literacy
and health and health and literacy.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:15.660
And then my final thing is that--
my final point is the connections

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:21.270
that we need to making as far as
fought for coordination in order

01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:24.050
to supplement these impacts.

01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:27.840
Providing a school meal alone is
not going to improve literacy.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.750
There need to be complementary
activities

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:34.040
and our office has benefitted from
the memorandum of understanding

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:37.730
with US Aids Office of
Education who have a goal one

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:42.510
to have improve the
literacy, early grade reading

01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.930
of 100 million children worldwide.

01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:48.790
Working with them, the
literacy experts will able

01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:51.780
to improve the quality
of our program

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.160
and further providing
a school meal helps

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.840
to bring those children to school.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.390
So thank you very much.

01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.780
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Thank you
Lindsey that was amazing.

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.900
Yes clap. [Applause] I
think it's incredible for us

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:07.530
to be reminded again
how important food is.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.510
It is the very basic medicine.

01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:14.770
I mean it's so basic and we
don't worry as much about that

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:17.430
because of the great school meal
programs although I think we worry

01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:20.910
over the summer and over vacations
because some children even

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.530
in our country aren't getting
the nutrition they need.

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:24.960
That was incredible.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.180
So we're going to go a little
bit more in-depth to be thinking

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.830
of your question because
you all are next.

01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:34.920
But I want to go back to
you and talk a little bit

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.590
about intergenerational poverty.

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:40.960
I mean, you're working--
you're working with the parents

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.960
and the children and right
now there is a resurgence

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.350
on what we call two-gen programs.

01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:50.040
Programs that don't just focus
on the children don't just focus

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.900
on the adults but focus on both
because we know they are important.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:58.370
So, how does Reach Out
and Read fit into that?

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:01.450
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman: Many years
ago I had a study underway

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:03.990
through Maternal and
Child Health Bureau

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:08.100
in which we enrolled several
hundred mothers of children coming

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.200
for their five month
Well-Child visit.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:15.200 position:56%
And part of what we did in the study
was we gave the mother very simple

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.680
reading test, the Wide Range
Achievement Test, which is nothing

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:22.480
but a list of words that you
have to read you get a score.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:28.090
50% of our mothers in that
study were untestable.

01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:32.040
Their scores were below
the bottom of the test.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.280
So, the problem with
literacy is extreme.

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.000
Many of the graduates from
our public schools graduate

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.630
without the ability to read well.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:49.650
My own take on it is that
having low literacy skills

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:56.090
as a parent contributes to a sense
of despair in terms of your ability

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:59.290 position:56%
to help your child see a better way.

01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:08.650
And at the same time, every time
you pick up a book you're reminded

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:11.880
of your own history of frustration

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.090
and discouragement
growing up in school.

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:22.730 position:56%
So, one of the things that we try to
do in Reach Out and Read is be aware

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:25.560
of that and understand
that telling a parent

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.850
in that situation you should read

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:31.550
to your child is not
a benign thing to do.

01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:33.650
It's actually very bad thing to do.

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:41.420
And that the message needs to be,
you can help your child love books

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:44.500
by having fun with your
child with the book.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.740
Don't focus on words.

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.590
Make it fun and talk about the
pictures and enjoy it together.

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:52.950
So that-- we have a
problem in terminology.

01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:54.420
We call it reading aloud.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.480
But what we're really talking
about is not reading at all.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.460
What we're talking about
is a joyful interaction

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.990
between parents and
children and books.

01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:05.590
And to convey that to parents,

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:09.750
what we find is most
helpful is not really

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:13.550
to say very much at
all but to do it.

01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:18.550
So, our methodology at least
what I think is most effective is

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:21.710
to watch the parent
looking at the book of child

01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:23.210
for a very short period of time.

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:26.880
One can get a good sense of it
in a very quick interaction.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.060
To notice when it looks
beautiful and be a witness

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.150
to that this is beautiful.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:36.000
Or when it doesn't look
beautiful to be able

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.360
to right there demonstrate
how to do it.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.100
And it is as simple as stepping and
saying, "Why don't we try this?"

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.990
And then you do something.

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:47.350
And it may be just
looking at a picture

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:49.200
and saying, "Hey, where is the boy?

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.500
What's he doing?

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.800
Where is the dog?

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.100
Can you show me the," right.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:54.660 position:56%
And you play that game for a minute.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:58.630
And then when the child is
engaged and happy we say,

01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:02.740
"This is what we mean when we talk
about reading, now you do it."

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.930
And then giving another parent a
chance to mimic what we've done.

01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.750
So, that's a very concrete
approach to this question

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.130
of interrupting a transgenerational
transmission

01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:19.930
of not only literacy is an
inability to read but literacy

01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:24.070
as an unhappy relationship
with books.

01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:31.580
And I think we can do that because
of the power of the relationship

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.770
between the doctor and the parent
where the relationship is one

01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:41.370
of appreciation without
judgment and of collaboration.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.710
We are in this together
to help your child

01:25:44.710 --> 01:25:47.690
to be the most wonderful
person that can be.

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:52.720
So your quote from Dr.
Pasteur was exactly right.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.240
That's exactly what we're about.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.010
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So Laura,
talk us more about the reading.

01:25:58.010 --> 01:26:00.270
I mean it's difficult
to learn to read.

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:03.960
We know from Bob a lot of
families can't read and we have

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.780
to teach them how to read the
pictures and tell the stories

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.780
and use their words in other ways.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.350
But how hard is it to learn
to read and what is that--

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:14.480
what's going on in the brain and
what does the research tell us?

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.780
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Well, learning

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.750
to read is really a very
challenging task for the brain.

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:21.630 position:56%
And I think we're reminded of that
with the statistic that Sandy showed

01:26:21.630 --> 01:26:25.820
in one of her slides that by
the end of third grade 2/3

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.770
of American children-- we're
a very affluent country

01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:31.460
on an international scale.

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.180
Two-thirds of them are
not proficient in reading.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.480
That does that mean 2/3 of all
of our children are disabled

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.400
or that there's something
wrong with them.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.510
What's wrong is that
they're not getting the kind

01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:44.720
of instruction starting
early and you have

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.450
to help them become
proficient readers.

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:50.320
And one of things that the
basics that we have sort

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.290
of forgotten is how challenging
a task this is for the brain.

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:59.480
You know, reading occurs very late
in the course of human development

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.760
and you know I think a lot when
I'm at the Library of Congress

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.250
about Gothenburg and I once
heard a brilliant neuroscientist,

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:11.660
Dr. Gordon Sherman say, "You know
what really cause dyslexia was

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:15.500
Gothenburg because when he
invented the printing press all

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:19.710
of a sudden the masses are sort
of expected to be able to read,

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:22.550
whereas before it was only
the elite few that could read.

01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:26.320
But now that everybody has
the opportunity to read,

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.770
the expectation goes up, well,
then everybody should read

01:27:29.770 --> 01:27:32.690
and it's not a natural
easy thing for the brain."

01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.820
And so I think there's
a lot to that.

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:39.180
But we still have this prevailing
myth that children do learn

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.480
to read naturally if they just
sort of have books around them

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.420
and a reasonably supportive
environment.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:48.430
Now children do learn
to talk in this way

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.850
but most children don't
learn to read in this way.

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:55.200
For most children learning to
read in English takes about three

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.440 position:56%
to four years of intentional
systematic high quality instruction.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.170
If you're Italian it
only takes about one

01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:03.680
to two years to learn to read.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.370
If you're Chinese it
takes about 10 years.

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:10.420
So it definitely varies
depending on the complexity

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.720
of the written language system.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.650
And even many educators
don't fully understand this.

01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:20.290
Learning to read requires several
parts of the brain which are built

01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:24.720
to do something else to learn a
new skill and then synchronize

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.630
with these other brain areas.

01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.070
They're also learning
something new at the same time.

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:33.170
So it's pretty darn complicated and
we really shouldn't be surprised

01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.730
that so many children
struggle with it.

01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:39.290
Now I do want to emphasize
that success

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:43.090
with reading instruction is
really predicated on a lot

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:47.420
of high quality talking, reading,
singing and playing that parents

01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:51.490
and other caregivers will do with
young children starting from birth.

01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:54.580
So that is absolutely
necessary and lays

01:28:54.580 --> 01:29:00.110
down that solid brain foundation
so that the child is ready and able

01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:02.800
to benefit from that
high quality instruction.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.710
So it takes both sides of that and
the earlier that we start providing

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:11.650
that evidence-based developmentally
appropriate reading instruction the

01:29:11.650 --> 01:29:13.960
stronger the reading outcomes.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.430
I do want to go back to a point
that Libby actually mentioned.

01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:20.460
I can't believe she said it.

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.940
But another really important--

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.690
because we didn't talk
about it in advance

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:26.110
and I already had this
typed, you can look.

01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:29.260
Another really important point
about reading is that it tends

01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.020
to be viewed as a proxy
for intelligence.

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:37.910
So it works like this, if you're a
good reader you must be very smart.

01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.880
And that's exactly what
Libby said that kid

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.140
who know the word tip she
said he must be very smart!

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.840
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: He
was and he still is.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.140
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: That's--
And he still is.

01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:50.100
But you're no slack and you
weren't reading that word, so.

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.020
But if you're not a
good reader maybe it's

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.290
because you're just not very smart.

01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:59.480
And this is the message that
struggling readers receive over

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:02.770
and over and begin
telling themselves.

01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:06.320
And those of you who work with
adults with low literacy skills,

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.650
you know what I'm talking about.

01:30:07.650 --> 01:30:12.910
I can't tell you how often I have
heard from children, teenagers,

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:17.690
and adults that they think they
are not smart no matter what other

01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:22.380
evidence there is that they are
incredibly bright and talented.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.520
And once they start to think
that they're not smart,

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.830
it's like it become sort of
seared into their psyche.

01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:31.500
And they just can't
stop believing that.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:36.380
And it has so profound an
impact on their confidence,

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.930
on their willingness
to ask questions

01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:44.780
in institutional situations or with
authority figures like a doctor.

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.420
They are terrified to
read with their children

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.790
because they think they
can't do it well enough.

01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:51.780
And that if they don't know a word

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.200
or make a mistake that's the
worst thing that can happen.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.230
We spend a lot of time
and effort on our website

01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:00.180
and in our direct interaction

01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:03.670
with parents talking exactly
about what Robert said.

01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:06.450
It's not about reading
every word on the page.

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:10.520
It's about engaging around
that book, having fun,

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:14.330
having a loving supportive
conversation.

01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:18.270
That's what's important with the
babies not reading every word

01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:20.280
on the page.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.610
That's what really motivates us

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:23.870
at Nemours BrightStart
well stuff there.

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:28.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So Lindsay, we've
talked to all about the intersection

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:32.950
of health and literacy and
you added really nutrition

01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:36.730
because we know that's important
too and Hassink talked about it.

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:42.410
What if you learned from abroad
that we should know or heed?

01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:50.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Carter: It's-- Across
all programs depending on the other,

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:51.740
there's a lot of differences.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.420
But sometimes I'm struck
by when I'm in the field

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:57.460
when I hear very similarities,

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.390
a lot of sort of qualitative
discussions I have with a parents

01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:04.060
or a community member really
drives home and be like,

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.080
I'm pretty sure I could be
having this conversation

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.930
with the parent in the US.

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:11.940
A lot of it having to do with--

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:14.540
we taught a lot about early
childhood development.

01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:18.260
Hearing teachers Burkina
Faso where childcare

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:22.340
and early childhood development
is certainly not common feature.

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.130
But we do part of that.

01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:28.610
Our activities there is we do
support early childcare centers

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:30.850
and provide training to caregivers.

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:34.110
And hearing the parents there
and the teachers talking

01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:37.640
about these children they arrived
and they already know their letters

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.940
and they're ready to read.

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:42.370
In the community where many of
the households have notebooks,

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:47.660
whatsoever, but a well-supplied
early childcare center has the same

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.750
impact, very similar impact to
what it can have in Burkina Faso

01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:53.190
to what it has in Oklahoma.

01:32:53.190 --> 01:32:57.220
So there are lot of similarities
as well as some differences.

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:01.650
But what really strikes me
is the conversations today

01:33:01.650 --> 01:33:06.820
as far what I've seen is literacy
is not restricted to the classroom.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:09.580
It's what happens in a
pediatricians' offices,

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:14.890
what happens in a childcare,
what happens a lot in the home.

01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:20.070
And when we talk-- working in
very remote and isolated locations

01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:25.580
around the world, a school is
important because a school is

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:28.390
where a community can
come together in a place

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:30.610
where they may not
be a health clinic

01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:32.890
but there is usually
a primary school.

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:35.710
So I think it's important
to remember that a school

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:39.090
and education system is a
resource of the community

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:44.470
where it can be a location
but it's not those--

01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:47.860
the boundaries of the school
go beyond the school gate.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.680
So that's really how [inaudible]
of providing a school meal

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.890
and addressing nutrition
heath and literacy

01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:57.540
that sort of our entry point.

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.520
But we really try and
develop programs

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.930
that go beyond the school
gate and that engages with--

01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:09.180
engaging with parents and doing
nutrition trainings and working--

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:12.980
if there's a preschool
working with a preschool.

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.200
And developing that sort of
sustainability and really trying

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.010
to save a community which I
think is probably true in the US.

01:34:21.010 --> 01:34:24.000
And I'll just use this
as another places.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.210
We found that the school
is incredibly useful

01:34:26.210 --> 01:34:31.970
on these very remote and isolated
locations as also an entry point

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:34.210
for providing certain aspects

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:37.930
of health education
and health services.

01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:40.820
And I didn't get a chance to
mention during my introduction.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:44.990
But another part of the
ability of a child to take

01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:47.360
in the nutritional
quality is something

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.610 position:56%
like providing de-worming campaigns.

01:34:50.610 --> 01:34:55.680 position:56%
So that's actually a way that a
Ministry of Education may coordinate

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.300
with a Ministry of Health as far

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:02.290
as if there's a national de-worming
campaign having that entry point

01:35:02.290 --> 01:35:06.240
into a community not be through the
health center that doesn't exist

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:08.020
but being through to school.

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:13.910
And by providing nutrition and
education and health education

01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:19.870
to a child is kind of a twofold
effect because you both--

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:26.300
you reach the parents and also
you're reaching the future parents

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:27.600
through the children.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.900
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Great.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.200
Thank you.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.500
Laura?

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.800
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Can I share with
the audience a little bit of--

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.100
a conversation that
the three of us had

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:36.310
as we all met first thing
this morning and Lindsay

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:40.890
that was the point that you made
that sometimes inadvertently,

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:45.810
a literacy program or a
feeding program because of time

01:35:45.810 --> 01:35:49.530
and resource constraints end
up one supplants the other.

01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:54.160
And it may be inadvertent or you--
you know, organizations may know

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.450
that this is going to happen but
feel like, "Well, we can't do both,

01:35:57.450 --> 01:36:00.220
so we're going to have to
pick one over the other."

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:04.350
And I think in some ways that
happens a lot in this country, too,

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:07.420
where we sort to have
the "Tyranny of the OR."

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.380
We think we can do
this or we can do this.

01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.110
But there's no way we
can do both together.

01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:17.300
And I think that's where, you know,
some creative thinking and thinking

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:22.320
across traditional boundaries and
silos could really help us do both

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.890
in a very resource-efficient
and time-efficient.

01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:28.450
Well, I don't know if you--
either of you we all talked about.

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:29.770
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman: Well,

01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:35.420
I think that the key insight is you
can't be healthy if you can't read.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.990
And you probably can't
read if you're not healthy.

01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:42.710
So the OR proposition is
a nonstarter and we need

01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:44.600
to just be really clear about that.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.160
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: I think
it brings us back around,

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.270 position:56%
actually what Dr. Hassink was saying
which is zip code and community

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:54.870
and how important all the
services are in that community

01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:57.800
and how we need to really
work to bring it all together

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.780
and make sure that it's efficient.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.570
That there's not duplication

01:37:01.570 --> 01:37:04.350
but that we're reaching
all the families.

01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:07.060
So I have one more question then
we're going to throw out open

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.710
to the audience and
this for any of you.

01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:13.080
Given that, that we need
to breakdown these silos

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.140
and that we need to
do AND instead of OR.

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.960
What advice do you have?

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.380
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Carter: Research.

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.750
It's understanding
the school feeding.

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.900
It's the hardest thing as far as
we can collect to all the data

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:35.540
but especially even though there
have been few random control trials

01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:40.620 position:56%
when we work in schools, when you're
providing a school meal to a child,

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:45.180
having-- developing random control
trials that already helps us draw

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:52.240
that f attribution is difficult
at best and we need more data

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.670
and research in order
to tell our story

01:37:55.670 --> 01:38:00.120
of seeing not only the
intended impacts but some

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.190 position:56%
of the unintended impacts and making
sure we're designing the best set

01:38:04.190 --> 01:38:10.470
of-- the best package of
interventions to reach our goal.

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:12.230
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman: So,
if your answer is research.

01:38:12.230 --> 01:38:14.960
My answer is bookkeeping.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:21.660
In particular because our
focus is on very children,

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:24.990
very young children tend to be
served through the health system

01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:29.040 position:56%
and older children tend to be
served through the education system.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.150
And it makes very difficult
to do a cost-benefit analysis

01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:37.190
if the cost are being
born in one system

01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:39.640
and the benefits are
being realized in another.

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.400
So we need to do some creative
bookkeeping where we recognized

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:45.390
that investments that may flow

01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:49.310
through a doctor's
office might have payoffs

01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:52.340
that show up later in school.

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.680
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: I love it.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.980
Laura you want to come in?

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.280
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Sure.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.580
I think both of these
are so important

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:05.120
and I think also how we talk about
issues of literacy and health,

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.640 position:56%
just how we frame the issues and the
terms that we used have such impact

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:14.090
on the structures that we set
up, so it's really struck again

01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:16.740
by what Lindsay said, you
know, in the united States,

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.130 position:56%
the school nutrition program is
housed in Department of Agriculture.

01:39:20.130 --> 01:39:23.790
Whereas in many countries oversees,

01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:26.240
it's housed in the
Department of Education.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.510
And the very fact that
it's an agriculture ports--

01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:31.710
and I'm not saying that's
bad or that's wrong.

01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:35.420
But there's historical
precedence and decision making

01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:40.060 position:56%
that have implications down the road
that we may not have recognized.

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.750
And so by put-- by
having it in agriculture,

01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:47.740
in some people's mind we think of
that as strictly a food program

01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:51.080
and a farming issue and
not an educational issue.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:57.570
And so to be aware of how the
structural barriers prevent us

01:39:57.570 --> 01:40:02.090 position:56%
thinking differently, which then
prevents us from acting differently.

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:07.380
And I think blended funding streams
where, you know, or recognition

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:11.960
that dollar spent in one system may
have their greatest dollar savings

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.800
long term in a very
different system but that--

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:18.200
that that is good,
that that's not bad.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.330 position:56%
And how do we have that sort of
joint accounting monetarily and also

01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:27.070
in terms of the broader goals of
what we're trying to accomplish.

01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:28.900
And I keep coming back
to what Sandy said.

01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:33.340
We've sort of taken our
eyes off the fundamentals

01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:36.730
and what does every
child fundamentally need.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:40.750
And they need food and nutrition
and they need to learn to read.

01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:43.880
I mean those should
be fundamental things

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.520
that no matter what else
is happening nationwide,

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.520 position:56%
we don't take our eye off that ball.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.250
And I think that's happened a lot.

01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:54.490

see we have an excellent panel.

&gt;&gt; Laura: Bailet: Oh great.

01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:12.930
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: And
you're coming at it

01:41:12.930 --> 01:41:14.230
from the child literacy
point of view.

01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:15.840
We try to come out from
the health and literacy

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.580
for the adults who
are our employees.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.450
But I'm really fascinated by this
because I couldn't agree more

01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:27.100
with the whole the premise of
getting not only to the nutrition

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.770
but the literacy combined.

01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:34.580
And to that end, the responses to
that last question where we talked

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:38.370
about we need more
research and data.

01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:44.440
I would say you have enough of that
to try, start the collaboration

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:50.510
between the USDA programs and the
eduction programs and try to get

01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:53.950
that out there where people
are making the connection.

01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:58.010
So put what you already
have out into the community.

01:41:58.010 --> 01:42:01.650
I guess that sort of like
the practical application

01:42:01.650 --> 01:42:03.470
of the research that you've done.

01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:07.480 position:56%
So make it more out in the
community and I think that we will--

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.090
I'm sitting here thinking of all
kinds of possibilities in terms

01:42:12.090 --> 01:42:15.230 position:56%
of programs that people could start.

01:42:15.230 --> 01:42:19.540
And I actually have a
child, a daughter who's--

01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:24.840
she aspires to be where you're in
terms of pediatrics and dealing

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:31.950
with the childhood problems of
literacy and health and nutrition.

01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:36.850
And so I'm been hearing this for
sometime from her and I just think

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:41.440
that you have enough to start
making the collaborations

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.330
and implementing some
of the programs.

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:46.330

component that we could incorporate.

And commend Dr. Cole because
ever since I've been here,

01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:06.830

a long way and it is fundamental

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:20.250
My clinic because of funding
issues relays on donated books.

01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:24.390
And so the books that we
have for children 6, 7, 8,

01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:27.290
9 are whatever we can get.

01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:30.840
And very few of those books are
Afrocentric books and very many

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:33.900
of our patients are
African-American.

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:40.040
And so I'll ask parents when
their child is, you know,

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.230
holding that book and being
very excited about it,

01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:45.960
"Do you know about
Afrocentric books, do have any?"

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:48.790
And for most of the
parent they don't.

01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:55.490
And it really is a problem because
the message to a young child

01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:59.610
who has a beautiful book that has
people in it who are not identified

01:44:59.610 --> 01:45:03.040
with that kid is that these books
are written for somebody else

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.810
about a world that
is not your world.

01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:09.330
And the shame of it is is
that there are many, many,

01:45:09.330 --> 01:45:13.210
many wonderful Afrocentric
stories and books

01:45:13.210 --> 01:45:17.480
that our parents don't
know about them a lot.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:22.090
And so, you know, if I can wave
my magic wand and get a budget

01:45:22.090 --> 01:45:25.090
to do it, I'd be buying a
bunch of those of books.

01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:27.770
I would make sure that I have
[inaudible] beautiful daughters.

01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:31.500
I would make sure that I
have the people could fly.

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:36.320
I would make sure that I
have Ezra Jack Keats' books.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.250
You know, the "Snowy Day" in winter
and "Whistle for Willie" in summer

01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:46.110
in perfusion so that every kid
with darker skin in my clinic

01:45:46.110 --> 01:45:50.240
who identifies as African-American
could have some books like that.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.200
I make sure that I
have some biographies

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:57.530
of great African-American leaders
that the little kids who I see

01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:00.600
who filled, you know, sort
of disenfranchise can read

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:06.530
about Malcom X who was
sometimes angry, you know,

01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:08.350
just like they're sometimes angry.

01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:11.690
But he took and he made
it pretty powerful.

01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:15.300
So just to echo, we need
it and we need to be aware

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:19.840
of it we need to fund it.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.240
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Thank
you for reminding us that.

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.540
I think it's important.

01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:23.840
Do you want to mention something?

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.630
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Carter: I think
this is a wonderful question

01:46:25.630 --> 01:46:29.430 position:56%
because it's a challenge that we
face with the McGovern-Dole program.

01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:32.930
But we're trying very hard with our
implementing partners to address

01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:35.510
because not only are
we trying to make sure

01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:39.340
that we have appropriate books
in an international context.

01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:43.260
And this helped by our colleagues
at the USA Office of Eduction

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:45.680
and Laura alluded of how
difficult it is to learn

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.030
to read is we're trying with
a lot of these countries

01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:51.820
where there's usually
a colonial language.

01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.650
And then there's a mother tongue.

01:46:53.650 --> 01:46:56.120
So often children are being
asked to learn to read

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.790
in a language they
haven't even learned

01:46:58.790 --> 01:47:01.050
or spoken until the age of five.

01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:06.120
So trying to-- usually we're
having to actually seek

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:11.960
out to be very creative and being
able to produce both textbook

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:14.930
and fictional books
for the community

01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:16.910
in a language that is understood.

01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:21.150 position:56%
And there's some very creative ways
that our projects are doing the most

01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:27.230
as far as finding a
affordable and ego-resource.

01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:32.380
My favorite is in some West African
countries, Peace Corps volunteers

01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.770
who are working with a program
to help and produce books

01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:37.670
because they know the
local language.

01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:38.970
They've learned it.

01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:42.450
They can read and write it and
they're producing these books

01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:45.600
that can go out in communities
and then tying and in

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.830
with the health aspect
making sure that the message

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:50.590
of this book is not only
enticing to children

01:47:50.590 --> 01:47:55.330
but making sure it address
issues such as handwashing,

01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:59.310
improved nutrition, working
with others in the community.

01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:02.870
So I think there's the
language that we choose as well

01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:05.860
as how the books look, making
sure they're exciting its--

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.600
and accessibility issues.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.880
But there are lots of creative ways

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.730
that we can make these
resources available.

01:48:12.730 --> 01:48:15.540
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: And we want the
diverse books for all children

01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:19.150
because I don't want my
Anglo kids to not just see--

01:48:19.150 --> 01:48:20.450
&gt;&gt; Lindsay Carter: Right.

01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:21.750
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: -- themselves.

01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:23.050
I want them see others.

01:48:23.050 --> 01:48:24.350
Dr. Sullivan.

01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:25.650
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: And can I just
say one other thing though.

01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:26.950
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Sorry Laura.

01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:28.250
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: I
think it's important

01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:29.550
to remember diversity is there's
so many types of diversity.

01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:30.850
So there's diversity
of race and ethnicity.

01:48:30.850 --> 01:48:32.680
There's linguistic diversity.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:34.450
There's also health diversity.

01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:38.340
And Robie is going to do a talk
on her books where she writes

01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.680
about children with
different health issues.

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:46.540
But books are a fantastic way
for children teenagers and adults

01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:50.170
to see themselves if they
have a health condition

01:48:50.170 --> 01:48:53.580
or a learning challenge
through characters in a book

01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:56.360
and to broaden their
world perspective.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.100
See a world that-- without
limits instead of the limitations

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.830
and the helplessness
that they often feel

01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:06.150
when they have a health
or a learning condition.

01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:09.970
And stories just can
open a person's eyes

01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:14.050
to broader, a broader world view.

01:49:14.050 --> 01:49:18.190
And if nothing else books are a
great companion for sick days.

01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:21.210
And we don't want to forget
about the joy of reading

01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:24.400
and actually an author ambassador,
former one for the Library

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.500
of Congress, Kate DiCamillo

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.310
who wrote the story
"Because of Winn-Dixie".

01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:33.990
She talks about as a young
child, she was sick a lot

01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:36.370
and books are what
kept her saying it,

01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:38.030
open the world of possibilities
to her.

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:39.330
So I don't want to forget that.

01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:40.630
Sorry Dr. Sullivan.

01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:42.650
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So books are
windows and they're mirrors.

01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:44.180 position:56%
Way to see out, way to see yourself.

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:47.380
Dr. Sullivan, we're
so glad you're here.

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:48.680
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: Yes.

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:49.980
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: We're all honored.

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.280
&gt;&gt; Louis Sullivan: Thank you.

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.580
First of all this is
really an excellent panel

01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:54.350
and I'm very pleased to be here.

01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:57.460
And one of the reasons I'm here is

01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:02.700
because of the well-established
known relationship between level

01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.040
of education literacy and health.

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:09.090
And I maintain that
while we really have

01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:11.320
as a nation had tremendous
development

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:15.380
of our scientific knowledge
and new therapies et cetera.

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:18.370
We really haven't done as
much or as well as we should

01:50:18.370 --> 01:50:22.150
on improving health
literacy and health behavior.

01:50:22.150 --> 01:50:25.710
Well, I'm please that that's
getting some recognition.

01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:28.390
Having said that, I
have several questions

01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:29.690
or comment I'd like to make.

01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:32.810
First, I have specific
question for Dr. Hassink.

01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:35.780
I'm curious is to what
happen to that grandfather

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:39.370
who wanted his grandson held
back, because it sounded

01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:40.920
as if that didn't happen.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.370
And I meant the system was not
responsive here and it bothers me

01:50:45.370 --> 01:50:51.170 position:56%
because often we find that rules and
our regulations or bureaucracy get

01:50:51.170 --> 01:50:54.230
in the way of good decision
making and that really is one

01:50:54.230 --> 01:50:57.930
of the issues that I worry about.

01:50:57.930 --> 01:51:01.550
The other comment I
want to make is this

01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:05.000
with tremendous programs
that you have.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.670
I'm bothered by the fact
that we don't, as a country,

01:51:08.670 --> 01:51:12.370
support education strongly
as we should.

01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:15.690
Everyone knows that we
are really in a new era

01:51:15.690 --> 01:51:18.380
that we really are moving
towards an educate--

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:24.090
system where those who have good
education are going to do well,

01:51:24.090 --> 01:51:27.340
those who do not really
falling by the wayside,

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:30.450
part of the income gap
that we refer to now.

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:34.570
So, the question I have is
with the programs that we have,

01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:38.880
what's being done to really let the
public know and generate support

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.800
for them so that our legislators in
our states or in our school systems

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.660
or in the congress
really support them.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:50.720
Because the paradox is we have
these tremendous programs.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.070
But yet we have a real problem
really getting the kind of support

01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:56.370
for our education systems.

01:51:56.370 --> 01:52:00.630
So I'd be interested in knowing
what have your experiences has been

01:52:00.630 --> 01:52:02.060
or what are your thoughts,

01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:06.730
how can we really take these
tremendous programs that you have

01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:09.580
and generate the kind
of support that we need

01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:12.270
so that they will really
be promulgated

01:52:12.270 --> 01:52:15.000
around the country as they should?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.550
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So, Dr.
Hassink is going to help us.

01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:17.850
&gt;&gt; Sandra Hassink: Well, but--

01:52:17.850 --> 01:52:19.150
&gt;&gt; This was on?

01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:20.450
&gt;&gt; Sandra Hassink: I don't
know if I can help you.

01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:27.300
But the grandfather was not
able to get his son held back

01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:30.520
because his was not
a behavior problem.

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.690 position:56%
And did what-- you know, was a quiet
little boy who sort of was there

01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:40.460
in class and we tried and
didn't have any other feature

01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:44.060
that would have allowed
us to advocate except

01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.680
that he couldn't read
and we couldn't do it.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:50.630
We couldn't solve that problem
for the grandfather, so.

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:53.990
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So,
anyone who want to address

01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:57.430 position:56%
that complicated difficult question?

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:02.450
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman:
I am speechless.

01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:05.160
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: We need
everybody here to help us

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.430
because this is not
going to happen easily.

01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:10.480
I think in other countries
they do it because of--

01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.870
it's a moral obligation
to take care of your kids.

01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:15.850
But somehow in United
States we've got

01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:19.740
to proved that's it cost effective,
that we're going to save money

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:24.030
and even though know, even for
something as simple as preschool,

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:28.060
there are people that say
that the results fade,

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:31.240
it doesn't make a difference,
and we're trouble selling it.

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:34.680
So, it is an uphill battle
here in United States

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:38.150
and we need everybody here
to speak out repeatedly

01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:41.440
and your voice would be a
particularly helpful one.

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:44.870
&gt;&gt; Louis Sullivan: Well, thanks
I really would not hesitate to do

01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:46.170
that in every opportunity.

01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:53.240
And one other comment for Dr.
Needleman, with lack of diversity,

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:58.310
ethnic diversity of your books and
the need for them, I wonder you're

01:53:58.310 --> 01:54:04.480
in Cleveland, I'm sure you
know Reverend Otis Moss.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.900
And the Cleveland urbanely I
know for years has been one

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:11.130
of the strongest urbanely
chapters around the country.

01:54:11.130 --> 01:54:15.130
So, I guess my question is have
you raised this question with some

01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:19.280
of the black leadership in your
community because these are people

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.940
who really ought to
be responsive to that.

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:24.490
And you could tell
them that I sent you.

01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:29.560
Reverend Moss happens to be
a Morehouse college graduate.

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.860
So, I know him.

01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.220
He was two years behind
me in college.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.840
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So,
we have a quick answer

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.140 position:56%
and then actually we're out of time.

01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:38.890
So I'm going to let
the panel wrap but--

01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:40.270
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman: I will be glad

01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:42.420
to convey your message
to the reverend.

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:46.440
There is a very small health
center in the Fairfax neighborhood

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:50.920
of Cleveland called the Otis
Moss University Health Center

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.820
and they support us
fantastically by allowing

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.550
as to store our books
in their basement.

01:54:56.550 --> 01:55:02.430
Just to clarify the Reach Out
and Read program as organized

01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:04.310
through our national
center and is supported

01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:07.920
in our local chapters does
raise lots and lots of money

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:13.490 position:56%
to purchase culturally
appropriate ethnically diverse books

01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:15.840
for our target audience
which is children

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.560
from birth to age essentially six.

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.840 position:56%
That's the sweet spot for us because
that's when we see kids frequently.

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:25.790
And we think that's
when the foundations

01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:27.330
of literacy are laid down.

01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:31.380
So, on the good side, I would
say, that we do have a wealth

01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:36.750
of beautiful culturally appropriate
books, largely through generation--

01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:40.630
generosity too of Scholastic
which makes these available to us

01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:44.120
at great discounts and also
supports their generation.

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.680
So that's the good side.

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:50.620
And the bad side is we're
limited by our budgets to books

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:52.420
that are not terribly expensive.

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:56.930 position:56%
And so the books that we can provide
at every Well-Child visit retail

01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:59.570
for somewhere between
five and six bucks.

01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:03.570
And to our nonprofits
cost us somewhere

01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:05.640
between two and three bucks.

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.110
But that prices those
kids out of a lot

01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:12.460
of the very best literature
that's out there for children.

01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:17.420
So, when I was raising my
kid, I didn't only get books

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:19.420
that cost five and six bucks.

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:20.720
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Right.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:23.150
&gt;&gt; Robert Needleman: So, there's a
great disparity and injustice even

01:56:23.150 --> 01:56:24.920
as we try to do our best.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:27.750
We could do a whole lot
more to make the full range

01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:31.590
of beautiful literature available
to the full range of our kids.

01:56:31.590 --> 01:56:33.490
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: So, I told them
they could have one last word.

01:56:33.490 --> 01:56:35.550
Anyone want to last word?

01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:37.400
&gt;&gt; Laura Bailet: I just want to
thank everyone for being here.

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.200 position:56%
I think in response to your question

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.320
of how can this feed
better publicized.

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.830
I think by being here today and
then going out and messaging

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:51.220
and continuing to work together
will start plant some seeds

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:53.510
and funding is always an issue.

01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:56.830
But thank you all and
hopefully you learn a lot today

01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:58.620
that you can message about.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:56:59.920
&gt;&gt; Libby Dogget: Thank you panel.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.220
Thank you audience.

01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:03.260
Thank you all for being here.

01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:05.100
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you.

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.400
Thank you.

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:09.180
I'd like to thank you everyone
and just make one more--

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.180
before we take a little break,

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:15.000
very short break before
we hear from Robie.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.810
On the diverse books issue,
tomorrow here at the Library

01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:25.000
of Congress we will giving the--

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.720
hosting an event at which
the first diversity award

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.140
in children's books will
be given by an award

01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:34.750 position:56%
by the American Library Association.

01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:38.530
And this is moment of know, OK,
Karen is going to correct me.

01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:40.930
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: We
Need Diverse Books.

01:57:40.930 --> 01:57:44.010
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We Need Diverse
Books is the name of the group

01:57:44.010 --> 01:57:46.590
which is carrying on
in this whole area

01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:49.320
and the first awards will
be given and it's going

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.590
to be called the Walter Award
in honor of Walter Dean Myers

01:57:53.590 --> 01:57:57.640
who is our National Ambassador
for Young People's Literature.

01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.660
And Walter sadly passed away
soon after his two-year term.

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:08.300
Kate DiCamillo followed
Walter and our new of--

01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:11.990
our new Gene Yang is our
new National Ambassador.

01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:14.260
But tomorrow, it's a public event.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:17.180
It's at 10 o'clock in the
room where we were last night.

01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:21.560
It's in room 119 and you would all
be welcome to come and learn more

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.440
about we-- give me the phrase
again, We Need Diverse Books

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.990
which is the name of the group.

01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:31.190
So this is very a theme of
what we're doing and thank you

01:58:31.190 --> 01:58:35.260
for bringing it up indirectly
and directly to everyone here.

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:40.610
I thought Robie we're going to
take a five minute break and start

01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:44.880
with Robie and when you comeback
the restrooms are right next door.

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:48.640
Please be back in five minutes and
we'll continue with the program.

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:51.770
Thank you for the wonderful
morning and first panel.

01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:59.550
Well, we have special author's
perspective on our topics today.

01:58:59.550 --> 01:59:02.600
And from the beginning
we had the notion

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:07.070 position:56%
of having an author's perspective
and we have been exceptionally lucky

01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:12.300
to have Robie Harris here who
is known for, to many of you,

01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:16.210
as a very prolific and
thoughtful writer and author

01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:21.720
about books relating to
families, childbirth, sexuality.

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:25.620
She, in fact, has been
at this for so long.

01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:29.510
And some of her books are
having anniversary editions

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:33.660
and there is a brochure for both
"It's Perfectly Normal" and "It's

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:38.100
So Amazing" 20th anniversary
of "It's Perfectly Normal",

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:40.960
15th anniversary of
"It's So Amazing".

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:46.120
And those brochures plus a display
of a number of her books are

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:48.290
on the table in the back.

01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:52.750
When we spoke on the phone
which is the first time we met

01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:55.550
to talk a little bit
about her presentation,

01:59:55.550 --> 02:00:00.060
I was struck how she
emphasized that in the research

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:06.020
for her books she often started by
whatever the topic talking to kids

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:08.250
and talking to children
about the topic

02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:10.360
that she was about to write about.

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:14.590
And I thought, "Well, may
we call this a perspective

02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:15.990
from the childhood?"

02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:19.560
And she said, "No, it's going to
be my perspective, but I want you

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.930
to know that I do my
background research, you know,

02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:25.400
with the real thing
with the children."

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:29.550
And when I've seen the range
of the books that she's put out

02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:31.600
and heard her speak a little bit

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.040
about these I know
we're in for a treat.

02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.510
Let's welcome Robie Harris.

02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:39.620
[ Applause ]

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:41.440
&gt;&gt;John Cole: I'll take my notes.

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.210
Sorry.

02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:46.430
&gt;&gt; Robie Harris: So I'm
feeling a little speechless.

02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:49.400
And for those who know me
well I'm really not just

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:52.140
because so much has
been said already,

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.610
which has been so wonderful.

02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:58.560
So I want to join Dr. Needlman
in the repetition model here

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:00.810
and John you mentioned
that I might be able to go

02:01:00.810 --> 02:01:03.660
on just a little bit longer.

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:07.360
OK. So, I have permission
to do that.

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:12.640
So it's an absolute privilege to
be here, at the Center for the Book

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:14.510
at the Library of Congress.

02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:18.360
And to be able to thank you John
Cole and I've written at my words,

02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:21.020
too, so that I won't too, too long.

02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:23.450
The founding and current director
of the senate for the book

02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:26.730
for your critical support and the
center support for the work all

02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:29.930
of us do in the world of children's
books and children's health.

02:01:29.930 --> 02:01:34.160
I want to thank Dr. Bailey, for
last night, for your leadership

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:37.520
in the world of child health,
the BrightStar Program,

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.470
and your wonderful words,
"Everything we do must be

02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:42.720
for the child" and I quote here.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:45.790
"If it's not, then we need to
reconsider why we are doing it."

02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:49.280
And also Dr. Hassink for
your leadership in the field

02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.610
of pediatrics, for
mentioning the ACEs study

02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:56.040
and literacy this morning,
which I think is very important.

02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:59.230
Critical work on childhood
obesity and the link between health

02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:03.280
and literacy and it goes
on and on the toolkit.

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:07.180
And all of you in the audience,
you know, I'm behind my computer

02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:10.980
and then let me out every once
in awhile to do-- to speak.

02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:14.180
But you're on the front lines.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:17.720
And all of you for your leadership
in the field of pediatrics,

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:24.030
your critical work on childhood
and to all of you in the audience

02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:28.820
to care about or give care day-in
day-out to our nation's children

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:33.340
from infancy through adolescence,
and actually prenatally

02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:36.680
because that certainly is a
part of health, to help them

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:37.980
and their family to stay healthy.

02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:43.860
So I gave John Cole a
title which is up there

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:46.470
"Read Well, Be Well, Stay Well".

02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:49.320
And I'm going to continue
to look at the question

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.890
which I also sent to Dr. Cole.

02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:56.530
What real can children's books
play in helping kids of all ages

02:02:56.530 --> 02:03:02.450
and their families stay
physically and emotionally healthy?

02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:03.980
I'm a children's book author.

02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:07.980
I have a strong interest and
background in child development.

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:10.100
And I think children
are so wonderful.

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:13.950
I can't stop watching
them, listening to them,

02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:16.960
hearing their words,
watch their play,

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:20.640
watch them when they get angry,
watch them when they get upset,

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.610
get worried, concerned, and so on.

02:03:23.610 --> 02:03:27.400 position:56%
So-- But in order to creat the books
I write I still find it extremely

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:31.380
healthy-- helpful, not
only to talk with kids.

02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:33.370
And I have conversations
with the kids.

02:03:33.370 --> 02:03:36.580
I don't sit them down and I
don't have a tape recorder

02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:38.160
and interview, you know.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.490
We just sit and talk about a topic.

02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:44.370
But I also find it extremely
helpful to consult with librarians,

02:03:44.370 --> 02:03:47.030
teachers, scientist, health care,

02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:51.430 position:56%
mental health child development
professionals, and also with parents

02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:54.320
who often know their
children the best.

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.390
I do this to make sure that the
non-fictions books I write have the

02:03:58.390 --> 02:04:01.560
most up-to-date, age-appropriate,
medically

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:03.850
and scientifically
accurate information.

02:04:03.850 --> 02:04:06.860
And we do this every time
we go back to reprint

02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:09.770
on my non-fiction books every time.

02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:13.090 position:56%
And if some big change came through,
my publisher for those books,

02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:18.380 position:56%
Candlewick Press has said, "Yes, we
will go back to reprint right away,"

02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:21.350
because kids have the
right to have the latest

02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:23.910
and most accurate information.

02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:27.090
And I do this also so that the
picture books stories I write

02:04:27.090 --> 02:04:32.450 position:56%
reflect with honesty and that's
very important word for me, honesty.

02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:35.380
The powerful and yet
perfectly normal emotions,

02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:38.930
that most young children
experience day-in day-out

02:04:38.930 --> 02:04:41.580
because I think we all in this
room believe if we're not honest

02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:45.310
for there kids, then we
lose them in a conversation,

02:04:45.310 --> 02:04:50.180
of a book that just doesn't being
honest in what they know in life,

02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:52.210
they turn away from the book.

02:04:52.210 --> 02:04:55.560
The books I write, the
words I write are my way

02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:58.400
of having a conversation
with children.

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:01.060
And they include-- you know,
but what I chose to write

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:04.540
that includes the values
that I have.

02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.950
So they are my way of
having a conversation

02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:09.100 position:56%
with children about staying healthy.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.920
And as I said earlier that
includes their physical

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:16.280
and their emotional health which
everyone in this room we all know.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:18.220
We're so interconnected.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:21.950
I've been told that the books I
write and this is all anecdotal,

02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:24.520
spark many questions from children.

02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:27.220
And it's true for many
children's book authors.

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:31.820
So I'm really speaking for
all of us, as a gang together.

02:05:31.820 --> 02:05:33.610
So it's not just my books.

02:05:33.610 --> 02:05:37.020
So they often lead to conversations
between a child and a parent

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:41.240
or caregiver or another trusted
adult in that child's life.

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:45.020
And that these books that I'm
talking about this morning and--

02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:47.750
not only provide access to
information for a child,

02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:50.500
but also for that child's parents.

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:53.790
Information that kids
need and have are right,

02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:58.270
and I say that really loud,
"Have a right to have".

02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:00.880
So, that they're be
able to stay healthy

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.500
and eventually make healthy
decisions for them selves,

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:06.750
not only for them selves
but for there friends.

02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:10.270
Or the picture book story I
write sparks a responsive core

02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:13.350
that is what I hope for
in a child that might help

02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:16.990
that child stay emotionally
healthy and reaffirm

02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:19.790
that the strong feelings
they have and I write

02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:25.530
about in different books, all of
these feelings from love to anger

02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:33.000
to joy to fear, jealousy,
sadness, lost, yes, even hate.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.370
Our legitimate feelings
and more often

02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:37.790
than that emotionally
healthy feelings.

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:40.120
And the book about hate is
really a book about love,

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:42.320
when those words just
pop out of your mouth

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:45.750
and then this little child in this
book, what does he want to do?

02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:50.020 position:56%
He wishes that moment he can stuff
them all back in, but it's too late.

02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:57.250
Onward on to some of my books
as examples of some of the ways

02:06:57.250 --> 02:07:01.240
in which children's book can
contribute to literacy, hopefully,

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:05.460
and potentially the other
healthy or healthier outcomes.

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:10.200 position:56%
And just so have a chance as Dr.
Cole said there are books back there

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:13.790 position:56%
that if you fee like it, you may
have time today, you can take a look

02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:16.330
at and ask me any questions about.

02:07:16.330 --> 02:07:19.670
Let me first note that for
parents and for there kids,

02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:23.340
kids of all ages, and
especially for kids and parent

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.070
with low literacy skills,

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:30.280 position:56%
hen the words in the children's book
are married to the art in the book

02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:33.440
and I can't draw for
beans, I work with amazing,

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.540
brilliant, wonderful illustrators.

02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:36.840
I'm so lucky.

02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.240
And they bring a whole
new dimension,

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:40.020
but we work very closely together

02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:43.420
that doesn't always
happen for other authors.

02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:47.190
The art is another way to pass on
the information and could help kids

02:07:47.190 --> 02:07:50.530
and teens and parents become
visually literate as well.

02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:53.440
Since today so much
of the information,

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:55.830
they and we seek is a visual.

02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:59.410
And we get it through
the visual world.

02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:03.160
Together words and art in the book
often bring both kids and adults

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:08.760
like in-- engage both kids and
adults alike in multiple ways.

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:12.920
Now, I don't travel everywhere
with copies of my books, but I--

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:16.210
you can see an image on the screen.

02:08:16.210 --> 02:08:22.490
I had 200 5-year-olds in a gym
outside of Illinois a year ago.

02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:26.260
And I-- So that I think couldn't
see a book if I opened it.

02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:29.640
And I-- what I loved about it and
you'll see this a little bit later,

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.350
is that, I had-- they
had a huge screen.

02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:35.980
And so I had kids come up
and hold books and I said

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.460
"So what's the difference?"

02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:43.350
And this child said "You can't
hug that" looking at the screen,

02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:45.250
he said and he went like this.

02:08:45.250 --> 02:08:46.860
You can hug a book.

02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:50.000 position:56%
And that to me-- and it was before--

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.640
the last book that
I was going to show.

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:54.730
It was before I showed
them the whole story

02:08:54.730 --> 02:08:57.790
which is the last book
that you'll get to see.

02:08:57.790 --> 02:09:02.330
That-- I think that tells
us something about books.

02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:04.770
This book is-- that I'm
going to talk about.

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:09.590
It's perfectly normal and I have to
remember to do two things at once.

02:09:09.590 --> 02:09:13.080
This is just a range of the
different kinds of books I write,

02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:14.380
but here is the cover for it.

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:16.550
It's perfectly normal.

02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:18.720
It's illustrated by
the amazing friend

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.290 position:56%
and my dear friend Michael Emberley.

02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:23.800
We worked hand and hand
together on these books--

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.610
on this book and on
many other books.

02:09:26.610 --> 02:09:29.460
But this book is now, talking
about the international,

02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:35.000
in more than 35 languages and
pirated in some countries.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.630
A country now I can't remember.

02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:43.530
In Eastern Europe there's-- do you
know the photographs by Ann Geddes

02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:48.500
of a baby in an egg
shell, that's the cover

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:51.080
which is total not science.

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:52.430
He and I-- it's so crazy.

02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:53.730
I have a copy of it.

02:09:53.730 --> 02:09:55.030
Someone brought it back to me.

02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:58.040
So-- And the art and text in
every book as I said are vetted

02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.560
by kind specialist I've
mentioned a minute or so ago

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:04.680
and if need be are
updated every time one

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:07.590
of our books is reprinted,
which happens often.

02:10:07.590 --> 02:10:09.810
You know one such example,
but there are tons of them.

02:10:09.810 --> 02:10:14.020 position:56%
You know them in the pediatric world
or the medical world, you know,

02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:19.640
the HPV vaccine and now
was approved for boys then.

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:22.410
You know, we know not
enough kids are getting it,

02:10:22.410 --> 02:10:25.340
am I correct, the pediatric world?

02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:28.520
So that's in there
plus so much more.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.060
I began knowing that I wanted to
write a comprehensive book though

02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:36.740
but answer almost not every,
but almost every question kids

02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:39.540
and teens would have
about sexuality.

02:10:39.540 --> 02:10:43.440
I chose the title "It's Perfectly
Normal" because the truth is

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:48.440
that most, not all, things
about sexuality are normal.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.290
Except of course those aberrant
things such as abuse, infection,

02:10:52.290 --> 02:10:55.240
becoming pregnant, when one is
too young to take confident care

02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:57.180
of a child, the list goes on.

02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:01.180
But we all know this when the
topic engages kids they want

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.600
to know about the topic.

02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:06.440
And most often so do their parents.

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:09.630
So here we have a book that
is about sex and human biology

02:11:09.630 --> 02:11:11.890
for kids roughly 9, 10, and up.

02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:13.990
And I would pause at the following.

02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:18.150
When a preteen-- What preteen
or teen does not want to read

02:11:18.150 --> 02:11:21.510
about the perfect combo,
sex and science.

02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:24.540
In this case human
biology and, yes, health.

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:29.010
This is also a book about them
and what they are experiencing

02:11:29.010 --> 02:11:32.290
as they begin and then go
through puberty and adolescence.

02:11:32.290 --> 02:11:36.990
What pre teen or teenagers does not
want to read about one self, right?

02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:39.860
A little egocentrism here.

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:43.620 position:56%
I would also pause at the experience
for an adult who read such a book

02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.840
with or before their child reads.

02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:48.380
I always-- I give one
piece of advice.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.240
I also tell everybody who I'm not.

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:51.540
I'm not a pediatrician.

02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:53.450
I'm not health care provider.

02:11:53.450 --> 02:11:54.910
Child's book author.

02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:57.360
But I say one for-- to the
parents says what should I do,

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.750
what should I said?

02:11:58.750 --> 02:12:02.320
Read it through any book on
this topic, not just mine.

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.070
Read it through first on your own,

02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:07.750
you'll have a temporary leg
up on your child, right?

02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:12.030
That's the only piece
of advice I give.

02:12:12.030 --> 02:12:15.580
So a parent who reads a book with

02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:18.780
or before their child read
this can help build literacy.

02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:20.960
Not only for the kids
who are reading this book

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:24.470
but for their parents as well
who use a book such as this

02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:29.200
to get information they may
find too difficult to deal with.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.880
I understand that completely.

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:34.580
It's easier for me to talk
about other peoples children

02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:36.780
when one talks about
mine are grown up now.

02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:40.580 position:56%
But when my kids we're young it's
harder to talk to your own children.

02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:43.800
Very own children being a parent.

02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:49.040
So but for parents as well
who use a books such as this

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:52.930
to get information they may find
too difficult to deal with or hard

02:12:52.930 --> 02:12:55.780
to access and going back to trauma

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:59.120
or may have had a traumatic
experience in their own lives.

02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:02.110
We're talking about
health and sexuality.

02:13:02.110 --> 02:13:04.190
It's just-- It's too painful.

02:13:04.190 --> 02:13:05.960
It's too traumatic.

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:08.910
And then they can go
to the rest of--

02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:12.400
the health world to get
that information passed on.

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.990
We have told-- been told over
and over again that the words

02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:18.820 position:56%
in this book and other books I have
written and the art Michael created,

02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:22.330
gives parents permission
to talk about.

02:13:22.330 --> 02:13:26.370
And I hate these word
"tough" topics.

02:13:26.370 --> 02:13:28.860
I talked about-- was
writing about tough topics.

02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:33.030 position:56%
These are the normal everyday topics
that every family deals with and,

02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:35.410
yes, many of them are difficult.

02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:40.110
And in this case given the words
parents, a language they can use

02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:42.990
to talk with their kids
about sexual health.

02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:45.460
This means that parents
are reading, too,

02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:47.470
and modeling reading
for their kids as well.

02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:48.770
A road to literacy.

02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:50.470
I think I know what
this room would say.

02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:52.770
Would we call it family literacy?

02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:56.570
And it's also a way for parents
and kids to become or continue

02:13:56.570 --> 02:14:00.820
to be emotionally attached to one
another through a shared experience

02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:02.150
of reading the same book.

02:14:02.150 --> 02:14:06.780
And by the way often they're not
reading it together at that age.

02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:10.150
You know, child-- parent--
I say to parents--

02:14:10.150 --> 02:14:11.450
they say, "What do you do?"

02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:13.240
I can say that you have more
than one piece of advice.

02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:18.900
I say, "You know, it's OK if your
child reads it on their own."

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:21.270
You just can say, "You read it.

02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:22.570
You know, I care about you.

02:14:22.570 --> 02:14:23.870
I love you.

02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:25.170
I want you to stay healthy.

02:14:25.170 --> 02:14:26.470
You might find this interesting

02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:27.770
and of course the kids all they
say, "I know all this stuff.

02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:29.070
I don't have to do it."

02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:31.930
You know, parents leave them
back of the toilet or next

02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:34.270
to the computer and its gone.

02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:36.530
We've been told that.

02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:39.540
So through a shared experience of
reading the same book that can lead

02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:42.730
to talking together about so
many topics including parents

02:14:42.730 --> 02:14:44.370
on family values.

02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:48.780
Fostering this kind of
attachment between a parent

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:51.750
and one's child certainly
seems to me

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:54.970
to be an added positive
literacy outcome.

02:14:54.970 --> 02:14:58.940
Our children's book librarians
and teachers and daycare providers

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:01.460
and so many more I
probably not listed,

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:06.260
also provide this day-in day-out by
having my books, but not just mine

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:09.080
and others in their
classrooms as Bob said,

02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.930 position:56%
"If they can afford it [inaudible]."

02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:16.680
And their collections in an open
shelf, not in a hidden shelf

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:21.140
under lock and key that the
librarian keeps up up on top,

02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:24.840
so-- and accessible to kids.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.200
So here we go.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:35.240
Here are some images from the
recently completed 20th anniversary

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.800
edition and I chose these.

02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.790
I could have chosen a million.

02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:40.140
So let's see.

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:44.260
So this is from the first
chapter called "What is Sex", OK.

02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:46.520
Yes, these are cartoon characters.

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:49.950
I had a boy and a girl and
then I couldn't use a boy

02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:52.830
and a girl because-- I mean,
girls would think one thing

02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:57.140
and boys would think others and
not all the stuff about gender.

02:15:57.140 --> 02:15:59.590
I mean, it gets just
very complicated.

02:15:59.590 --> 02:16:02.140
So they might not know
the bird and bee are--

02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:04.230
bird, the kid who wants
to know everything,

02:16:04.230 --> 02:16:05.950
ask every question can't stop.

02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:07.250
The bee thinks it's all gross

02:16:07.250 --> 02:16:10.700
and disgusting except gets
fascinated by the science.

02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:13.080 position:56%
I was more of the bee than the bird.

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.840
So here is just a little
text from there.

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:17.840
This is the opening.

02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:22.160
Sex is about a lot of things bodies
growing up, families, babies, love,

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:24.520
caring, curiosity,
feelings, respect,

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:27.140
responsibility, biology and health.

02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:31.010
There are times when sickness and
danger can be from her sex, too.

02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:34.160
Most kids wonder about and have
lots of questions about sex.

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:37.690
It's also perfectly normal
to want to know about sex.

02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:40.860
You may wonder why it's a good idea
to learn some facts about bodies,

02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:43.850
about growing up, about sex
and about sexual health.

02:16:43.850 --> 02:16:46.930
It's important because these
facts can help you stay healthy,

02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:50.680
take good care of yourself, and
make good decisions about yourself

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:54.620
as you are growing up and for the
rest of your life, besides learning

02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:58.210
about these things can
be fascinating and fun.

02:16:58.210 --> 02:17:08.740
So on to-- this was a change
in the chapter on straight,

02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:12.120
gay, trans, bisexual, LBGT.

02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:14.580
And this is just newer
art that was done.

02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:17.730
And here are some texts.

02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:22.930 position:56%
Many people use the term LGBT, these
initials L for lesbian, G for gay,

02:17:22.930 --> 02:17:27.110
B for bisexual, and T for
transgender, our way of referring

02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:30.820
to people who are lesbian,
gay, bisexual, or transgender.

02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:33.390
And then I give a definition
of transgender

02:17:33.390 --> 02:17:35.250
which I'm not going
to go to now-- not.

02:17:35.250 --> 02:17:38.740
I mean I'm happy to,
but we need to move on.

02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:44.380
And then it goes on to the
end of the chapter to say

02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:47.550
if a person has any questions
thought or concerns about his

02:17:47.550 --> 02:17:50.880
or her sexual feeling or gender,
talking to someone you know

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:54.790
and trust, a parent, relative,
therapist, doctor, nurse, teacher,

02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:57.100
or clergy member can be helpful.

02:17:57.100 --> 02:17:59.850
No matter what some people may
think it's always important

02:17:59.850 --> 02:18:03.760
for every person to remember and
treat all people with respect.

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:08.490
And it's important to know that a
person's daily life, making a home,

02:18:08.490 --> 02:18:12.810
having friend and fun working
being in love, being single,

02:18:12.810 --> 02:18:14.430
being a partner, being married,

02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:18.900
raising children is mostly the same
whether he or she is straight, gay,

02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:21.920
bisexual, or transgender.

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:24.420
OK. Oops. OK.

02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:32.710
This, five years ago put it in
chapter, began about the internet.

02:18:32.710 --> 02:18:34.270
Absolutely critical.

02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:37.840
The chapter is "Become
Larger and Larger".

02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:41.880
And Michael and I worked out
what-- I can't draw as I said.

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.620
But we work out what
we want the image to be

02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:46.790 position:56%
and then he does his brilliant work.

02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:49.450
Once your words are on the
internet they're there forever

02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:51.630 position:56%
and you cannot get these words back.

02:18:51.630 --> 02:18:55.460
Others who we do not want to see
these words may end up seeing them.

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:59.540
There is no way to guarantee what
you will have sent will be private.

02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:01.800
And think about the
emotional implications.

02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:06.260
And if you say online that someone
is fat or skinny or sexy or ugly

02:19:06.260 --> 02:19:08.560
or beautiful or handsome.

02:19:09.960 --> 02:19:12.900
What you said is never really
private once those words are

02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:14.200
in the internet.

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:18.470
Saying-- And here we're talking
about the emotional health of kids.

02:19:18.470 --> 02:19:22.030
Saying something mean or bullying
someone, or spreading any kind

02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:26.000
of gossip, even sexy gossip or
about another person can make

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.830
that person feel really crummy
can hurt that person's feeling.

02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:33.470
When someone does this online by
texting, posting, or e-mailing,

02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:36.080
it called cyber bullying.

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.590
To cyber bully means to
mistreat another person.

02:19:39.590 --> 02:19:42.990
Cyber bullying means
mistreating another person online,

02:19:42.990 --> 02:19:44.900
to bully means to mistreat.

02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:48.720
Cyber bullying means
doing it online.

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:55.500
And then here's just another
way to get information across.

02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:58.190
And we certainly want to
pass these on the kids.

02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:00.960
These are things that
were in the book.

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:03.300
Miss that I'm told.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:06.890
Kids still think, right.

02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:14.820 position:56%
Here's a way to talk about that you
need a condom for protection, right?

02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:16.340
And it's a smart thing to do.

02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:18.420
So to call kids smart,
if you did this--

02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:22.820 position:56%
this is smart, something you can do.

02:20:22.820 --> 02:20:25.600
OK. This was where they fit.

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:32.650
I think boys, men, as well as
women and girls, need to know this.

02:20:32.650 --> 02:20:35.630
Sometimes people don't know it.

02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:39.740
And this is just one piece
of contraception here.

02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:45.470
And then this is what our look
like and I have a grandmother.

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.030
And this is the last chapter called

02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:51.150
"Staying Healthy Responsible
Choices".

02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:57.210
And I couldn't write this without
saying-- without ending like this.

02:20:57.210 --> 02:21:00.630
Everyone makes mistakes and has
bad judgment once in a while.

02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:04.810
I didn't want kids to think that,
you know, I am through the word

02:21:04.810 --> 02:21:08.110
that I write saying, you know,
you don't have to do this,

02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:09.690
and this, and this, and this.

02:21:09.690 --> 02:21:11.590
I don't want to ask the audience

02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:15.690
about what mistakes you may
have made during those years.

02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:17.370
We won't do that.

02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:20.150
And you probably will, too,
but most of the time you can

02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:23.400
and will make responsible choices,
ones that are good for you,

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:27.080
right for you, and healthy
for you and your friends.

02:21:27.080 --> 02:21:30.730
So that's-- it's perfectly normal.

02:21:30.730 --> 02:21:42.480
OK. On to some of my-- here's
a quote I just want to post it.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:47.320
And by the way, I've done
books that now go down to three

02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:48.970
to five year olds on this topic.

02:21:48.970 --> 02:21:52.280
One called "Who Has What?",
naming all the parts of the body.

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:55.320
Not just the wonderful song we
all love it, head, shoulders,

02:21:55.320 --> 02:21:58.990
knees and toes but seems to me
maybe some parts are left out.

02:21:58.990 --> 02:22:03.520
And the kids, too, they
know at a very young--

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:06.730
well, they don't immediately,
almost right, right, right,

02:22:06.730 --> 02:22:08.030
infants, that's [inaudible].

02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:11.950
So here's a quote from
Dr. Alicia Lieberman

02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:16.010
and a gifted clinical
psychology at UCSF for the book--

02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:18.310
for his quote I think it's the
emotional life of the toddler

02:22:18.310 --> 02:22:24.770
about words young children and
about young children and I quote

02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:28.120
"When a parent is able to
translate" and she says the infants

02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:30.720
and toddlers and I have the
privilege of knowing Alicia.

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:33.680
And I talked to her about this.

02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:38.060 position:56%
I said, "How about children of all
ages are able to translate the words

02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:39.780
of children of all--

02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:44.350
able to translate children
of all ages experiences

02:22:44.350 --> 02:22:45.970
in the words of understanding.

02:22:45.970 --> 02:22:48.860
This helps contain the
child's negative feelings

02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:51.280
and makes them bearable."

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:55.310
In this sense, this is her quote,
"Talking can represent relief

02:22:55.310 --> 02:22:59.530
from amorphus feelings because
it puts some order into chaos."

02:22:59.530 --> 02:23:03.740
I find these words "put order
into chaos" central to my writing

02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:06.230
for children and particular writing

02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:08.520
about the emotional
life of children.

02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:11.240
I feel that children's books
can provide those words,

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:14.200
words that can help to
meliorate the perfectly normal

02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:17.460
and terrifying feelings
that children often have.

02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:22.550
And for most children can help make
fearful feelings bearable including

02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:24.440
the traumas that we talked about.

02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:29.010
And here, what I want to ask
you, it's OK to use R-O-A-R

02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:34.770
and would Mayor Tom Menino of--
the late wonderful mayor of Boston.

02:23:34.770 --> 02:23:39.170
So here's a little bit from
the incredible illustrator.

02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:44.070
If you don't know his work, Chris
Raschka, he's a joy to work with.

02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:45.660
So here we go.

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:50.090
OK. When lions roar
and monkeys screech,

02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:52.560
when daddies yell,
when mommies holler.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:57.200
There's a lot left out of here
of the pages of the [inaudible].

02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:00.540
Chris understood that these
parents were not yelling

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:02.940
at the child as parents who yell.

02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:06.630
And it's scary to hear a
child-- a parent out of control.

02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:08.360
When daddies yell,
when mommies holler,

02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.190
the scary is near,
the scary is here.

02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:13.970
So I sit right down,
shut my eyes tight.

02:24:13.970 --> 02:24:17.650
Go away I say, scary go away.

02:24:17.650 --> 02:24:23.630
And then the quiet is back.

02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:27.740
A flower blooms, an ant crawls by.

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:31.310
A mommy sings, a daddy dances.

02:24:31.310 --> 02:24:35.500
The scary is gone,
and I go on my way.

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:38.220
Chris is brilliant [inaudible]
Nadine Bernard Wescott.

02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:43.890
So I wanted to do a book on
healthy eating and nutrition.

02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:46.130
And this is [inaudible]
Gus and Nelly

02:24:46.130 --> 02:24:49.180
and their parents I
hope are in here.

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:51.690
This fall, here's another
initiative, somebody you may

02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:55.140
or may not know about maybe you do.

02:24:55.140 --> 02:25:00.300
First book and the Mario Batali
Foundation, he's the famous,

02:25:00.300 --> 02:25:01.710
you know, New York City chef.

02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:05.840
But I think in [inaudible] launched
their healthy kids collection.

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.140
And "What's So Yummy?"

02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:10.640
was one of eight wonderful
books for young children

02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.800
on healthy eating and exercise.

02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:17.310
And it's perfectly [inaudible]
I'm proud to say was one of them.

02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:19.610
And they did that as
their way of ensuring

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:23.180
that all children are well-read,
well-fed, and well-cared for

02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:25.960
and to show kids the importance
of healthy eating and nutrition.

02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:28.460
I'm just going to show
you a little bit on sugar.

02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:33.290
I got a lot of help,
our wonderful people

02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:36.400
over in the congress senator--

02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:41.200
Congressman Rosa DeLauro on
the Agriculture Committee

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:47.750
which was chair, now I forget
when you're not ranking member now

02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:51.650
of the Agriculture Committee,
put me together with a--

02:25:51.650 --> 02:25:55.460
consulted on this book we talked
about sugar but also so many other.

02:25:55.460 --> 02:25:57.700
It's fun to eat a sweet
like ice cream or a cookie

02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:59.610
or a piece of cake, pie or candy.

02:25:59.610 --> 02:26:01.740
Most sweets have a
lot of sugar in them.

02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:05.150 position:56%
But too much sugar is not good for
your teeth or the rest of your body.

02:26:05.150 --> 02:26:07.680
So it's OK to eat some
sweet sometimes

02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:09.270
but not too many and not too often.

02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:12.160
And eating a sweet is almost
always a special treat

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:13.460
on birthdays and holidays.

02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.990
Again, I don't want to put
the shame and guilt there.

02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:19.490
And there's Gus, these cookies
are done, let's try one.

02:26:19.490 --> 02:26:23.730
There's Nelly, these chocolate
chip cookies are so yummy it's time

02:26:23.730 --> 02:26:25.340
to pack them all for our picnic.

02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:27.880
And [inaudible] something, OK.

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:31.070
And there they are
and on their picnic.

02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:34.120
And it's so it's fruits and
juices also have sugar in them.

02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.740
A lot of fruit drinks and soda
even have more sugar added.

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:39.050
They have too much sugar in them.

02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:42.530
So it's better for your body to eat
a piece of fruit and drink water

02:26:42.530 --> 02:26:43.920
than have a drink of soda.

02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.870
And there's a whole range of every
issue, water, you know, everything,

02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:54.060
allergies, you got it in this book.

02:26:54.060 --> 02:27:00.010
And here is my latest book which
is coming out again [inaudible],

02:27:00.010 --> 02:27:07.210
which is coming out
two week-- a week.

02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:09.650
And I wanted to thank
Ellen Oh again,

02:27:09.650 --> 02:27:13.560
creator of "We Need Diverse Books"
for opening out the critical dialog

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:16.840
about children's book and diversity
and also the publishing world--

02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:19.020
the children's publishing world.

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.600
They are doing a really fine job.

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:25.570
But we're working on all of
those of getting more people

02:27:25.570 --> 02:27:28.900
in the publishing industry
who are people of color

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:34.560
and therefore more sensitivity of
the need for books that shows all

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:37.320
of us and what America
really looks like.

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.700
Michael Emberley and I am proud to
say did that and people stand up

02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:44.910
and say thank you and we
don't know what to say.

02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:48.390
We say, you know, it's just
what America looks like.

02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:49.700
It's who we are.

02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:51.300
Here we are with the title.

02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:59.810 position:56%
So this is Gus and Nelly again and
I actually sold this book way before

02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:01.400
"We Need Diverse Books" began.

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:03.520
People say it and that
was fine, you know.

02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:06.440
We just did it because of
"We Need Diverse Books".

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:11.200
But I applaud so much what they
are doing because children need

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.140
to find themselves not just
in the words but in the images

02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:19.740
and it's kids of color
and as Libby said,

02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:23.560
all of our kids need to find them.

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:29.780
So because it has to do with our
kids' emotional health, big time,

02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:34.320 position:56%
to find themselves, to validate
them and that you count, you matter.

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:40.180 position:56%
And here's-- and I take on what
some people would call tough issues.

02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:45.630
I talk about how you
talk to each other.

02:28:45.630 --> 02:28:48.690
How a person walks or talks or
the clothes the person wears

02:28:48.690 --> 02:28:50.660
or the color or shade
of their skin, hair,

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:53.730
or eyes can't tell you what
a person's really like.

02:28:53.730 --> 02:28:58.220
These books are for 3s, 4s, 5s,
6s, and 7s, it's a big range.

02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:01.650
The holidays a person celebrates
or the people in a person's family

02:29:01.650 --> 02:29:04.160
or the food the person eats
can't tell you what a person's

02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.460
really like.

02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:07.710
That person may be a lot
like you in some ways

02:29:07.710 --> 02:29:09.970
and different from
you in other ways.

02:29:09.970 --> 02:29:12.830
You may have freckles,
another person may not.

02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:15.780
That person may speak
Spanish, you may not.

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:19.390
You may use crutches wheelchair,
another person may not.

02:29:19.390 --> 02:29:22.840
That person may like to sing, you
may like to tell jokes or both

02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.470
of you may wear orange sneakers.

02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:27.790
See if you can find two sets
of orange sneakers here,

02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:30.750
or have the same backpacks--
see if you can find that--

02:29:30.750 --> 02:29:33.220
or brown eyes or curly hair.

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:38.100
And then we spend weeks on end.

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:43.910
This is published by Candlewick
Press as with the books

02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:47.310
in essential health
and "What's So Yummy?"

02:29:47.310 --> 02:29:54.090
We spent ages just looking at the
diversity in this art which we did

02:29:54.090 --> 02:29:56.160
with "It's Perfectly Normal".

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:59.870
And we have people of
everywhere looking at it and say,

02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:03.300
you know, do we leave anybody out?

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:06.190
When you meet another kid for the
first time, you may want to play

02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:09.210
with that person right away, or
you may not want to because he

02:30:09.210 --> 02:30:12.150
or she is someone you have
never met or seen before.

02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:15.250
You may feel furious or even
shy or nervous or surprise,

02:30:15.250 --> 02:30:17.860
they're a little afraid of
someone you don't know yet

02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:19.730
or who looks different from you.

02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:21.360
Hey guys-- Hey, I'm Gus.

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.220
This jogger is so cool.

02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:25.040
This juggler is so cool.

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:29.480
And if I go back just to
this one, now, he's saying,

02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:33.110
"All I know about someone
new is what they look like."

02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:36.280
And Gus says, "You may not even
know strawberry ice cream is their

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:38.310
favorite ice cream or chocolate."

02:30:38.310 --> 02:30:43.660
If you do play with each other, you
might find out that something he

02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:46.530
or she thinks is scarier
something you think is scarier.

02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:49.730
You might find out that's something
you think is silly is something he

02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:51.750
or she thinks is easily.

02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:54.540
And before now-- know what
you're talking laughing

02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:57.120
and having fun with each other.

02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:59.890
It's possible, often happens.

02:30:59.890 --> 02:31:05.510
Let's-- Bob you were talking
about the positive outcomes,

02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:08.420
the resilience, but
the-- how kids see it.

02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:12.550
So I really-- I did
a movie years ago.

02:31:12.550 --> 02:31:15.620
Something with the
first Head Start--

02:31:15.620 --> 02:31:20.910
one of the first Head Start
programs in the Nation of Filmes.

02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:25.340
And we certainly talked
about these issues back then

02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:28.160
and here we are still
needing to talk

02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:30.090
about them today in this nation.

02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:36.700 position:56%
And I think particularly with what's
going on in our nation right now,

02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:41.970
issues of race and diversity, our
young children feel it greatly.

02:31:41.970 --> 02:31:46.860
And so if this is a way to talk,
maybe it'll help some families.

02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:48.210
That's my hope.

02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:52.260
So last book, published
by Scholastic.

02:31:52.260 --> 02:32:00.440
Karen, you're from the
Scholastic, shout out to Scholastic

02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:03.310
and [inaudible] was also
published at Scholastic

02:32:03.310 --> 02:32:06.360
with my wonderful editor Ken Geist.

02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:10.960
So, here's a story
about a pediatrician.

02:32:10.960 --> 02:32:14.540
Many of you may know as the medical
director of Reach Out and Read is

02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:17.230
that still Perri Klass's directly--

02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:21.140
Perri Klass and the breakfast we
had together several years ago.

02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:26.250
I have consulted with Perri
on many, many of my books.

02:32:26.250 --> 02:32:30.340
And she would have been here today
but she's out of the country.

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:33.340
If she could have been
so she sends her best.

02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:38.480
And Bob we want to give a shout
out to Reach Out and Read as one

02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:40.290 position:56%
of the founders in keeping it going.

02:32:40.290 --> 02:32:43.330
And Brian Gallagher who's
here from Reach Out and Read.

02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:46.370
At that breakfast Perri
asked me of Michael Emberley

02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:49.650
and I would be willing to create a
new poster for Reach Out and Read

02:32:49.650 --> 02:32:52.170
and we can go right to it.

02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:57.220
Just sticking with this slide
it really take on all the issues

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:02.550
about diversity and I like
books that are a challenge,

02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:07.730
but I think they're books that
I would have conversations.

02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:10.380 position:56%
My kids are grown up with now-- now.

02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:14.480
But I would have had-- I did have
conversations with my kids about.

02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:19.550
And as a grandparent I can
know what's happening today.

02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:26.120
So, here we go, if we would do a
poster for Reach Out and Read--

02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:28.580 position:56%
so Perri and I were having breakfast

02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:31.090
which was the way we mostly
meet talk about nutrition,

02:33:31.090 --> 02:33:34.330
she also help with
"What's So Yummy?"

02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:41.590
And I said, "Well, wait a
minute, why-- let's do a book.

02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:42.890
Let me do a book."

02:33:42.890 --> 02:33:44.660
And then I said, "I don't
want to do a book by comedia,

02:33:44.660 --> 02:33:46.420
I want to do an actually
trade book,"

02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:49.110
meaning that it would be a
book that I would do anyway

02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:51.200
that will go into a bookstore.

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:54.260
But I will consult
with people on this

02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:59.530
and this is a different
kind of take.

02:33:59.530 --> 02:34:04.490
So I said,-- and I came up
with an idea at the table.

02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:07.140
I have often come up with
an idea but then, oh my God,

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:10.330
you signed a contract and you have
to write it, none of this really.

02:34:10.330 --> 02:34:13.830
So I-- so my immediate
response is why not a book?

02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:16.600
It could be about a young child
who loses its favorite book

02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:19.540
at the moment and can't
go to sleep without it.

02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:20.840
I'd have that happened.

02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:22.140
My kids have that happened.

02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:26.090 position:56%
And since this book came out I would
say 9 or 10 librarians have said

02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:31.820
to me-- had librarians
at library say, you know,

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:34.870
I get to work at whatever time
I get to work, we open the door

02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:38.760
and there are three or four people
maybe once a month, you know,

02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:43.910
adults come in and say, I was just
reading x and I can't find the book

02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:46.510 position:56%
and do it and they're totally panic.

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:49.540
So it's not just kids.

02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:53.400
OK. And so the book you love,
love, love, love the most it,

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:54.700
just to that moment, right,

02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:56.900
because the next what you
love is coming up soon.

02:34:56.900 --> 02:34:59.650
Before sleeping into bed
and you have to have is gone

02:34:59.650 --> 02:35:02.220
and panic sets in,
"Maybe A Bear Ate It".

02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:06.110
You know, maybe that's
what it happened.

02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:09.480
I knew that Michael Emberley would
draw the most marvelous bear,

02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:11.250
and he would say yes.

02:35:11.250 --> 02:35:14.220 position:56%
And luckily Scholastic published it.

02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:16.910
Perri and I spoke the other day
about this book and we talked

02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:21.130
about how picture book cannot
only help kids become literate

02:35:21.130 --> 02:35:22.910
but as we talked about contributed

02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:25.710
to even more kinds
of healthy outcomes.

02:35:25.710 --> 02:35:29.060
Just for starters and "Maybe A
Bear Ate It", feeling that's OK

02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:31.440
to be very upset over a loss.

02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:33.740
And then I read a book
called "Goodbye Mousie"

02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:37.280
which is a different loss
about a book about that--

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:41.270
a child who discovers
his mouse is dead.

02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:42.570
He doesn't know it.

02:35:42.570 --> 02:35:43.870
He thinks it's just sleeping.

02:35:43.870 --> 02:35:45.170
But it's about death.

02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:47.380
It's not about dying,
it's about death.

02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:50.560
It's a picture for young
children over there.

02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:54.790
Learning the bedtime routine such
as getting into bed with a book

02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:59.210
and other bedtime routines is a
good thing and a sleep matters.

02:35:59.210 --> 02:36:02.540
Giving a child a book
into a sense of agency,

02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:08.260
the child in this book whose
character right here is--

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:13.200
you know, the child in this
book really does something

02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.500
about finding his book.

02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:15.800
So I can do that, too.

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:20.180
[Inaudible] I answer to such
questions as who did it?

02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:21.480
Do you think a bear ate it?

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:23.850
Which can provide the
[inaudible] back and forth

02:36:23.850 --> 02:36:25.990
between a bear and child?

02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:29.080
Giving the chi-- giving the
children new vocabulary in the way

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:33.390
to understand the story, drift on
the story, you just read to them

02:36:33.390 --> 02:36:36.690
and then make up their own
stories, or go onto another book

02:36:36.690 --> 02:36:38.650
to ask questions to fantasize.

02:36:38.650 --> 02:36:42.590
And as all of you to
spoken about so eloquently

02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:47.790
to help parents have access
to information and kids.

02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:49.430
So in the end books matter--

02:36:49.430 --> 02:36:53.220
we're finishing up here to children
even more than we ever imagine

02:36:53.220 --> 02:36:56.180
because they can be part of many
healthy outcomes for children

02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:59.570
and children's families
and sharing a book

02:36:59.570 --> 02:37:01.760
with a child can help
them become literate.

02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:06.180
And I just wanted to say
thank you Sandra Hassink

02:37:06.180 --> 02:37:09.940
for your [inaudible]
article, Literacy and Health.

02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:11.240
It's a must read.

02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:14.740
Sandra Hassink and Perri
are two of the co-authors.

02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:17.170
It was really important
if you haven't read it.

02:37:17.170 --> 02:37:19.950
I'm going to end by asking
you to pretend the right now,

02:37:19.950 --> 02:37:23.660
you're about to hop on the bed and
maybe my talk is making you sleepy.

02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:26.610
And if you can't find your
favorite book at the moment,

02:37:26.610 --> 02:37:28.480
the book you love so much.

02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:31.520 position:56%
Well, here's a story about that that
I would love to read to you now.

02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:33.510
This will take about one minute.

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:35.970
"Maybe A Bear Ate It".

02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:46.700
Is it moving?

02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:53.890
OK. So there we go.

02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:56.190
You can read it.

02:38:18.380 --> 02:38:24.270
Michael calls me up and he said,
"How could we do that this whale?"

02:38:24.270 --> 02:38:29.600
And I said, "Well, that's the
way I'll, you know, swallowed."

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:38.870
But he could draw a shark and
terrible things really awful.

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:47.930
All these ridiculous
places there about be.

02:38:58.050 --> 02:38:59.350
That's it.

02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:00.650
&gt;&gt; John Cole: All right.

02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:01.950
Robie thank you so much.

02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:03.250
&gt;&gt; Robie Harris: Thank you.

02:39:03.250 --> 02:39:04.550
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Good
afternoon everyone.

02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:10.010
Time to stretch it again to try
to stay close to our schedule.

02:39:10.010 --> 02:39:14.550
We're very pleased to have
some visitors this afternoon,

02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:16.570
some students who are
interested in our--

02:39:16.570 --> 02:39:20.220
the topic and we also have part

02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:22.480
of the panels are still
meeting getting ready

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:24.190
for this afternoon's performance.

02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:28.660 position:56%
But we're going to start and this
was the special brief presentation I

02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:32.830
told about where we are taking
a look at our overall topic

02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:37.230
which is literacy and health and
how they relate or should relate

02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:44.640 position:56%
and taking another look at literacy,
health public policy project

02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:50.480
of immediate concern and that is
the literacy in the Ebola crisis.

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.310
And we're fortunate to have a
speaker from the World Bank.

02:39:53.310 --> 02:39:58.070
One of our board members Mike
Trucano is from the World Bank.

02:39:58.070 --> 02:40:01.920
But Mike having a World
Bank member as a panel,

02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.220
as a member of our advisory
board has great advantages.

02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:09.230
But a disadvantage is he's
traveling a good deal of the time.

02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:14.370
And he has asked and
Kaliope Azzi-Huck

02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:16.670
who is a Senior Educations
Specialist

02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:20.780
at the World Bank has agreed to
come and talk to us a little bit

02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:23.740
and about literacy
in the Ebola crisis.

02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:25.770
So let's give her a
little encouragement.

02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:27.570
Thank you.

02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:31.040
[ Applause ]

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:33.090
You're all set.

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:34.390
&gt;&gt; Kaliope Azzi-Huck:
All right, great.

02:40:34.390 --> 02:40:36.020
Thank you very much.

02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:37.320
Hi everyone.

02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.350
I promise I'd only talk
first about 10 minutes.

02:40:40.350 --> 02:40:44.070
So I'm just going to
set myself a timer.

02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:49.030
I'm Kali and I cover the education
portfolio for the World Bank.

02:40:49.030 --> 02:40:53.180
I work on a number of countries
mostly slay throughout west

02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:54.480
and central Africa

02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:58.110
but I specifically cover
Sierra Leone portfolio

02:40:58.110 --> 02:41:00.960
which is the one in question here.

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:03.250
So to delve right into it,

02:41:03.250 --> 02:41:05.670
I just wanted to give you some
background on Sierra Leone.

02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:07.820
It's nothing that you don't
know because it's been

02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:10.530
in the news quite often
at the past year or so.

02:41:10.530 --> 02:41:13.820
Small country, population
of 6 million

02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.180
about 42% of people are literate.

02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:24.220 position:56%
So-- And that number-- sorry-- I
meant as high as 75 are not literate

02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:26.570
in rural areas mostly women.

02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:32.240
So they're out of school rate which
means kids who are still growing

02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:37.570
up not literate is about
25% of school age children.

02:41:37.570 --> 02:41:42.390
And their infant mortality
rate which given the subject

02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:45.900
if today is relevant
it's about 117 in 1000.

02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:51.590 position:56%
In terms of human development impact
Sierra Leone has immense challenges.

02:41:51.590 --> 02:41:58.110
It's ranked to 181st out
of a 188 countries in terms

02:41:58.110 --> 02:42:01.700
of human development which means
social services, health education,

02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:06.580
social protection are very, very
weak they don't have the systems

02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:10.730
for it and they don't have
the infrastructure for it.

02:42:10.730 --> 02:42:17.860
So when the Ebola hit in-- I think
it arrived in Sierra Leone in April

02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:21.630
of 2014 and steadily climbed up.

02:42:21.630 --> 02:42:27.330
Initially it covered the districts,
if you that bordered with Guinea

02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:28.810
and Liberia and then it's spread.

02:42:28.810 --> 02:42:32.510
And once it spread to the capital
Freetown then it just became an

02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:37.010
immense problem and it just
climbed up and up as you know.

02:42:37.010 --> 02:42:40.770
So the havoc that it unleashed is

02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:46.060
on the population 14,000 people
were infected and about 4000 death.

02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:48.290
I think just under that.

02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:51.230
It faired a little better
than Guinea where, you know,

02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:54.990
the death rate was much higher,
Guinea compared to the infection.

02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:58.420
On the health I just wanted you
to give this fact it's a country

02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:01.740
that already had weak
systems of 6 million people,

02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:06.470
a 188 specialized doctors
and Ebola took 12 of them.

02:43:06.470 --> 02:43:12.830
To give you an anecdote with
that did for the medical school,

02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:16.480
the only one medical school in
Freetown is basically stopped it.

02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:21.550
The doctors were also lecturers so
not only did you lose practitioners

02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:25.810
but now you're losing a
generation of future practitioners.

02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:30.760
So on the economy, the
GDP growth was cut by 50%.

02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:33.210
I won't bore you with that
because it was obvious.

02:43:33.210 --> 02:43:35.430
Everything came to a halt.

02:43:35.430 --> 02:43:39.600
They were embarking on a
huge economic strategy,

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:41.260
iron ore was doing wells.

02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:43.310
So they had invested
a lot in mining.

02:43:43.310 --> 02:43:49.340
They had already had diamond mining
and the sector basically collapsed.

02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:52.460
Two of the three major
companies packed up and went home

02:43:52.460 --> 02:43:57.500
so people were left without jobs
and without any prospect for work.

02:43:57.500 --> 02:44:01.480
On school children, for health
reasons schools were suppose

02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.050
to start in September of
2014 and they did not.

02:44:05.050 --> 02:44:09.750
And they remained closed
for eight months.

02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:16.340
So children were left idle
and as a sort of aside element

02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:19.320
of that teenage pregnancy
skyrocketed.

02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.990
And this is something that we
as partners didn't know either

02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:27.200
that a lot of young girls
actually are in school

02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:30.910
and are de facto protected
from all these social issues.

02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:35.990
It became an issue for these young
women who were at home, no income,

02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:38.620
no sort of prospect of anything

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:41.890
and things became really,
really challenging.

02:44:41.890 --> 02:44:45.480
So I'll talk about why
that became an issue

02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:47.970
after school reopened
at the end of this.

02:44:47.970 --> 02:44:51.430
And then on physical infrastructure
there just aren't roads.

02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:56.470
So it's really difficult to get out
to people and to get the messages

02:44:56.470 --> 02:44:58.940
out to people about what
needs to be done in order

02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:05.070
to sort of combat the EVD.

02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:07.540
So how the government responded?

02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:10.880
There was a national curfew
that lasted for four months.

02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:13.750
You basically would not
suppose to be out after 7

02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:16.650
or 8 p.m. Restaurants
were not supposed

02:45:16.650 --> 02:45:18.850
to be open unless you were a hotel

02:45:18.850 --> 02:45:22.080
and therefore you needed
to feed your guest.

02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:26.240
Traditional burial practices
were eventually outlawed

02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:30.220 position:56%
and initially there were discouraged
and then they basically said, "No,

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:33.230
so anyone passed away
you couldn't touch them.

02:45:33.230 --> 02:45:34.820
You had to call."

02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:37.670
And ambulances would come and
they would just take the body.

02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:41.800
And it was regardless of how they
passed away they fell of the roof.

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:43.990
They-- You know, it didn't matter.

02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:46.750
And you would then wait
for a call from someone

02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:50.280
to say this body is cleared
and you can now bury it.

02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:53.500
Or oftentimes they would just
bury it and give you a name

02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.140
and said we'll deal with it later.

02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:57.870
And that's what we're
dealing with now is a lot

02:45:57.870 --> 02:46:04.290
of tribes have very unique
burial traditions and they have

02:46:04.290 --> 02:46:09.230
to get the bodies back in order
to rebury them essentially.

02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:12.800
So it's a matter or figuring
out what needs to be done there.

02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:16.200
There was intense collaboration
among partners and government.

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:19.880
I think unique to the situation was
that there weren't a lot of people

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:21.630
in Sierra Leone to begin with.

02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:25.830
So there were only four
of five donor partners

02:46:25.830 --> 02:46:27.570
that were already engaged.

02:46:27.570 --> 02:46:30.290
So we all kind of worked together.

02:46:30.290 --> 02:46:36.650
The funds that were provided funded
medical supplies, that's obvious,

02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:40.160
food to quarantined
communities, medical staff,

02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:42.430
and local health workers' salaries.

02:46:42.430 --> 02:46:46.130
Because UNICEF was on the
ground, UNICEF took the lead

02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:49.680
in the implementation and the
coordination and the World Bank

02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:51.340
and [inaudible] and
others basically we work

02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:54.840
through them and with
the government.

02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:59.980
So overcoming the crisis
given the lack of literacy

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:02.420
in the country, we used radios.

02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:08.340
We procured radios, used radio
messages, used television messages.

02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:09.980
We hosted talk shows.

02:47:09.980 --> 02:47:14.110
Produced jingles anything that
would get the message out.

02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:15.630
This-- Some of you may know this.

02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:18.610
But your cellphones
in other countries,

02:47:18.610 --> 02:47:23.660
actually all other countries except
the US has a radio transmitter.

02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:26.680
So we were able to get out
to people with radio messages

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:28.590
as long they had a cellphone.

02:47:28.590 --> 02:47:34.850
We also bought as donor partners
about 80,000 radios for household

02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:37.870
that mostly for the rural areas.

02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:40.080
We also brought CAST lessons.

02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:44.130
And in those lessons it was
the core subjects as well

02:47:44.130 --> 02:47:49.030
as psychosocial messages about
Ebola, about five times a week.

02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:51.880
And these lessons ran
sort of on the hour

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:55.080
because the government wanted
the kids to get as much education

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:56.660
as they could during the closure.

02:47:56.660 --> 02:48:00.620
So they initially had said,
"You will still be required

02:48:00.620 --> 02:48:05.010
for to complete the academic year."

02:48:05.010 --> 02:48:07.350
We also use image-based
media campaigns.

02:48:07.350 --> 02:48:09.120
I think you've seen
these on the internet.

02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:13.440
So instead of saying if you have
symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea,

02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:18.000
we actually had cartoon images of
someone vomiting and the diarrhea.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.210
And that was the most effective way
to get the message out especially

02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:25.390
to those who couldn't read.

02:48:25.390 --> 02:48:29.040
We used the communities.

02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.990
There's a lot of social
mobilizations.

02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:33.710
So basically it was the
trickle down effect.

02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:35.820
We used the paramount chiefs.

02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:39.050
It's a country of 149 chiefdoms.

02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:42.150
So all of them came to town and
these are the elected official

02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:44.520
so to speak but also
traditional leaders.

02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:46.680
So they can read and write.

02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:50.210
They came to Freetown and there
were workshops that they attended

02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:55.040
and then they would go back and
carry up community mobilization.

02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:00.550 position:56%
And so that when that seem to be
only some what successful and it was

02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:05.230
in December I believe and the
numbers were still climbing.

02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:06.960
The government took
a drastic measure

02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:08.260
of doing this [foreign language].

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:14.470
It's basically House-to-House
Ebola Talk.

02:49:14.470 --> 02:49:18.860
And there was a national quarantine
where everyone was to stay home

02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:23.970
for three days unless you were one
of the volunteers that were moving.

02:49:23.970 --> 02:49:28.580 position:56%
We used a lot of youth and they went
house-to-house with two objectives.

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:32.370
One was to identify if you
had sick people in the house

02:49:32.370 --> 02:49:34.840 position:56%
and bring them to treatment centers.

02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:38.660
And two was to communicate
the message about Ebola.

02:49:38.660 --> 02:49:41.860
And this I think was the
most affective way to do it.

02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:45.130
It was a lot of manpower
and it was drastic.

02:49:45.130 --> 02:49:46.830
But it seemed to then work

02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:50.030
because the numbers began
to go down after that.

02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:52.630
There was diligent contact tracing.

02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:57.050
So as soon as someone was
discovered to be ill a team

02:49:57.050 --> 02:50:00.050
of contact tracers would
go out into the community.

02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:02.130
The community would
have to be quarantine,

02:50:02.130 --> 02:50:04.700
so one of the major investments

02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:07.850
that the donor partners did
was food for these communities.

02:50:07.850 --> 02:50:09.660
I think you heard a lot of--

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:12.190
and at least we heard a
lot of anecdotal stories

02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:16.240 position:56%
about people trying to escape simply
because they had run out of food

02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:19.280
and they needed to get out.

02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:21.960
So, with these contact
tracers, there's also a lot

02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:23.850
of messaging that was involved.

02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:26.920
And then there was a dedicated
hotline that was involved.

02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.510
If you suspect someone of
having Ebola or being sick

02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:34.250
or if someone dies
there were hotlines.

02:50:34.250 --> 02:50:37.050
And the hotlines were
well-funded and well sort

02:50:37.050 --> 02:50:39.470
of oiled to move very fast.

02:50:39.470 --> 02:50:41.410
So coming-- sorry.

02:50:41.410 --> 02:50:49.190
So coming out of the Ebola crisis
because education is my background

02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:52.550
so I could speak to you about
what we did to reopen schools.

02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:56.380
One of the major concerns
was the safety of children.

02:50:56.380 --> 02:51:00.200
Given the infrastructure and the
fact that children share everything

02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:03.670
in the classroom including seats
and you have four to five seating

02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:08.670
to a seat and Ebola is transmitted
by touch, all you needed was

02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:12.450
for one kid to transmit it to
potentially an entire classroom.

02:51:12.450 --> 02:51:15.050
So, there were working
groups established

02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:16.860
that focused on everything.

02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:19.270
There were protocols
that were developed

02:51:19.270 --> 02:51:22.120 position:56%
and received certification from WHO.

02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:26.940
And then we implemented a system
of distributing wash buckets.

02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:30.350
I don't know if I have-- somewhere
in here I have the photo of it.

02:51:30.350 --> 02:51:33.720
It's basically a plastic
bucket with a little spigot

02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:36.280
at the bottom that's
fused into another bucket

02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:39.230
and you put a little
bleach and soap in it.

02:51:39.230 --> 02:51:42.690
And every child have to wash
their hands coming into school.

02:51:42.690 --> 02:51:46.400
We also procured tons
and tons of thermometers.

02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:50.350
Every school received at least two
thermometers for 50 kid and then

02:51:50.350 --> 02:51:54.190
for every other 50 kids I think
an addition of thermometer.

02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:58.040
And kids had to be
tested every morning.

02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:01.230
Communities, not the schools,
were tasked with recording

02:52:01.230 --> 02:52:03.180 position:56%
that a school is ready to be opened.

02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:05.150
So we used social mobilization.

02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:08.760
And if a community felt that school
was not cleaned it was not open,

02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:11.070
they would report it
back to the ministry

02:52:11.070 --> 02:52:16.870
and then we would engage the-- so
the Ministry of Health to make sure

02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:18.800
that it gets cleaned
because the Ministry

02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:22.390
of Health took care of
cleaning the schools.

02:52:22.390 --> 02:52:26.670
We also used the radio to inform
parents that schools are safe

02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:30.830
to reopen that they are
being sanitized the--

02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:34.270
their children will
be ensured safety

02:52:34.270 --> 02:52:35.850
that there are measures in place.

02:52:35.850 --> 02:52:38.770
And then we trained at
least one teacher per school

02:52:38.770 --> 02:52:44.090
to understand how to
deal with Ebola.

02:52:44.090 --> 02:52:48.410
The reason I wanted to put to
say that we covered psychosocial

02:52:48.410 --> 02:52:52.970
and technical areas is we wanted to
make sure that if a child is found

02:52:52.970 --> 02:52:57.070 position:56%
to just have a fever that they are
not stigmatize it's very likely they

02:52:57.070 --> 02:53:00.560
have just put out in the field in
the sun until their parents came.

02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:04.460
So, we wanted to make it understood
that there is a lot of compassion

02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:08.970
that was necessary
given what was going on.

02:53:08.970 --> 02:53:11.760
OK. What we did not do.

02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:14.240
We did not evacuate
our international staff

02:53:14.240 --> 02:53:18.440
and that helped significantly
because we still have the manpower.

02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:22.290
On the bank side we did not
require the staff travel there

02:53:22.290 --> 02:53:24.610
if they did not feel comfortable.

02:53:24.610 --> 02:53:29.820
But if they were able to, everyone
was coming and going regularly.

02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:32.930
We did not establish
isolation rooms in schools.

02:53:32.930 --> 02:53:36.200
And this was important
because as we went

02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:40.010
to reopen schools the government
received 4000 mattresses

02:53:40.010 --> 02:53:45.110
that they wanted to put in schools
and the decision in the end was

02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:51.090
that you can't build mini
treatment centers in these schools

02:53:51.090 --> 02:53:53.500
and you can't give the impression

02:53:53.500 --> 02:53:56.060
that this can be taken care
of at the school levels.

02:53:56.060 --> 02:53:59.610
Someone who is expected
of having Ebola needs

02:53:59.610 --> 02:54:02.990
to come off the premises
as quickly as possible.

02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:08.090
We didn't open schools that have
been used as holding centers prior

02:54:08.090 --> 02:54:11.320
to WHO certified sanitation
this was obvious.

02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:13.890
So we need the Ministry of Health
to clean it and then someone

02:54:13.890 --> 02:54:16.680
to say this is OK because
there was a lot of--

02:54:16.680 --> 02:54:21.950
there was a lot more diligence than
just cleaning up of that school.

02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:25.570
We didn't taking unisexual approach
and this is often what happens.

02:54:25.570 --> 02:54:28.340 position:56%
So I can only think about education.

02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:34.160
In this case, we figured out
that health needs to step in.

02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:38.990
Social protection, the Ministry of
Youth needs to provide the manpower

02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:44.350
and education needs to come up with
the plan and deliver information.

02:54:44.350 --> 02:54:48.480
We did not address the issue
pregnant girls from the start.

02:54:48.480 --> 02:54:54.090
We knew that the pregnancies were
rising and as schools were announce

02:54:54.090 --> 02:54:57.350
to be reopened on April
14th, the ministry announced

02:54:57.350 --> 02:55:00.510
that pregnant girls could
not return to school

02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:02.910
and they could not take the exams.

02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:07.470
And the reasoning was that they
would give the wrong lesson

02:55:07.470 --> 02:55:13.180
or there would be wrong role models
for the other girls in schools.

02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:16.110
The donor partners and many felt

02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:20.420
that this was punishing the girls
twice once for getting pregnant

02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:24.070
and once for now losing out
on potentially education.

02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:27.480
There was a lot of back and forth

02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:32.760
and in the end what we now have is
a program for the pregnant girls

02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:35.140
and those who gave birth
in the last eight month

02:55:35.140 --> 02:55:37.530
to do alternative education.

02:55:37.530 --> 02:55:42.460
And once they have their child and
they can catch up they can return

02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:46.950
to school assuming that they have
not following too far behind.

02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:50.580
It's a reasonable kind
of catch up effort.

02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:53.360
But I think if we had
dealt with it early

02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:59.580 position:56%
on this wouldn't have been a bigger
issue now nine months down the road.

02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:03.320
And that's the extent
of my presentation.

02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:07.730
I put in some pictures that
you can see of the students

02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:09.510
and the wash buckets that were--

02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:15.390
students having their temperature
taken and the wash buckets.

02:56:15.390 --> 02:56:19.510
OK. So that was 15 minutes.

02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:28.360
[ Applause ]

02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:29.840
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Kali
thank you very much.

02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:34.200
This is insightful and
interesting and brings us kind

02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.720
of into a different part of the
subjects and we appreciate it.

02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:42.810
We have to move on to try to keep
up on our schedules so I'm going

02:56:42.810 --> 02:56:49.740
to have Jeff come up and bring
his panel and we will get started.

02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:54.970
And give Mike our best as well.

02:57:06.570 --> 02:57:11.650
And our chair is Jeff Carter
whom many of you know.

02:57:11.650 --> 02:57:16.200
Jeff is been deeply involve
in all aspects of literacy

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:20.600
but especially adult literacy
and he is the Executive Director

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:25.610
of the National Adult Education
Professional Development Consortium

02:57:25.610 --> 02:57:28.370
and the National Council of State
Directors of Adult Education.

02:57:28.370 --> 02:57:31.270
I know him best and he
had another role of his

02:57:31.270 --> 02:57:34.340
and that is he is currently
president of the National Coalition

02:57:34.340 --> 02:57:38.050
for Literacy, which is one of
the Center for the Books' reading

02:57:38.050 --> 02:57:40.070
and literacy promotion partners.

02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:47.160
So we've come full circle and
I'm turning it over to Jeff.

02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:48.910
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Thank you John.

02:57:48.910 --> 02:57:50.210
Thank you John.

02:57:50.210 --> 02:57:51.700
And thank you everyone
for coming out today.

02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:55.300
This has been an incredibly
stimulating half-day so far.

02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:56.860
I'm looking forward to
second half of the day.

02:57:56.860 --> 02:57:59.500
As John mentioned I
have several titles.

02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:01.210
If you work-- I said this
is to someone earlier.

02:58:01.210 --> 02:58:04.670 position:56%
If you work in adult literacy you
have usually have two or three jobs.

02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:06.220
You know maybe a couple to pay you

02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:08.270
and several volunteer
jobs at the same time.

02:58:08.270 --> 02:58:11.680
I just want to sort
of set this panel up.

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:14.050
We're going to be talking
about adult literacy

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:16.060
and health during this panel.

02:58:16.060 --> 02:58:20.200
And I thought it might be helpful
to just give you very briefly of--

02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:22.540
some review of the
landscape of adult literacy

02:58:22.540 --> 02:58:25.050
in this country right now.

02:58:25.050 --> 02:58:30.360 position:56%
Many of you I hope everyone actually
would find it shocking to know

02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:33.100
that according to the
latest data that we have

02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:37.710
from an international survey
conducted by OECD a few years ago,

02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:40.750
they estimate that
approximately 36 million adults

02:58:40.750 --> 02:58:44.780
in the United States have
low literacy or math skills.

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:49.440
Our federal system of adult
education talk a little bit what

02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:54.250
that looks like serves
about 1.5 million people.

02:58:54.250 --> 02:59:00.300
And in that survey that OECD
conducted, they ask people,

02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:03.160
"Would you like to attend
an adult education class?"

02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:08.240
And they estimated as much as
3 million people would love

02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:11.070
to attend an adult education
but cannot access one.

02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:13.670
There isn't one where they are.

02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:16.340
And that probably is just--
that's probably a very undercount

02:59:16.340 --> 02:59:19.420
of the actual demand
for these services.

02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:22.230
So, that's the landscape
that we work in.

02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:26.350
Let me tell you a little bit about
the kinds of programs that work

02:59:26.350 --> 02:59:27.700
with adults and adult literacy.

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:30.570
They range from community-based
organizations,

02:59:30.570 --> 02:59:34.920
volunteer-based organizations,
faith-based organizations,

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:40.760
schools including charter
schools and community colleges.

02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:44.360
So it's a system that a lot
of people are not as familiar

02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:48.270
with just compared to K through 12
or higher education because it is

02:59:48.270 --> 02:59:52.990
so diverse and many of our
students of course are--

02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:54.910 position:56%
they come for all kinds of different
backgrounds and they're not

02:59:54.910 --> 03:00:00.130 position:56%
as easily identifiable or as visible
as in our other educational sectors.

03:00:00.130 --> 03:00:04.580
I want to talk briefly about
why I think a discussion

03:00:04.580 --> 03:00:07.200
around adult literacy and
health is so important in this--

03:00:07.200 --> 03:00:09.250
in the context of our day-to-day.

03:00:09.250 --> 03:00:12.540
And I was thinking about
this as I was listening

03:00:12.540 --> 03:00:14.410
to the speakers this morning.

03:00:14.410 --> 03:00:16.070
And one of the first statistics

03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:20.370
that was mentioned earlier
was this issue that--

03:00:20.370 --> 03:00:24.680
and, again, talking about
another staggering number that 48%

03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:27.310
of our children are growing
up in low-income households.

03:00:27.310 --> 03:00:29.660
So why are adults critical there?

03:00:29.660 --> 03:00:33.240
Well, educational attainment
is directly correlated

03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:34.860
with earnings power.

03:00:34.860 --> 03:00:39.420
So when we educate our adults we
effectively can address the issue

03:00:39.420 --> 03:00:41.990
of children growing in
low-income situations

03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:46.670
because we empower those adults to
earn more and raise their incomes.

03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:47.970
So that's one factor.

03:00:47.970 --> 03:00:50.780
Of course, the other one,
parents are a critical influence

03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:52.980
on a child literacy development.

03:00:52.980 --> 03:01:00.710
And frankly, if we are going to
make a significant impact in terms

03:01:00.710 --> 03:01:06.160
of health outcomes as we look at
the connection between literacy

03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:07.590
and health, we can't ignore those.

03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:10.410
There're too many of them, as
I mentioned 36 million adults.

03:01:10.410 --> 03:01:14.050
If we put all our energy just in
the children we would disappointed

03:01:14.050 --> 03:01:17.290
by the outcomes because we would
not be addressing the needs

03:01:17.290 --> 03:01:19.300
of those 36 million adults.

03:01:19.300 --> 03:01:23.360
And then lastly, and this has
been touched on a little bit,

03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:25.350
I'm really glad to hear it.

03:01:25.350 --> 03:01:29.450
I think we have moral
responsibility.

03:01:29.450 --> 03:01:32.810
One thing that's really important
to remember about a lot of adults

03:01:32.810 --> 03:01:36.690 position:56%
who find themselves in the situation
is that that's related to factors

03:01:36.690 --> 03:01:40.890
that have-- that are related
to issues about inequality

03:01:40.890 --> 03:01:45.610
and historical vestiges
of discrimination.

03:01:45.610 --> 03:01:48.630
Robert Needleman mentioned this.

03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:51.880
This is a very strange
coincidence I hadn't thought about.

03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:55.550
You mentioned how Reach Out and
Read had to change their acronym

03:01:55.550 --> 03:02:00.070
because it was being used by an
organization that was protesting

03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:02.410
in Boston during the
Boston crisis, ROAR.

03:02:02.410 --> 03:02:05.290
I didn't thought about that
in years, I grew up in Boston.

03:02:05.290 --> 03:02:10.060
And it mainly reflect the
first time I got involve

03:02:10.060 --> 03:02:11.650
with adult literacy,
I was this tutor.

03:02:11.650 --> 03:02:16.620
And I tutored a guy who was
every bit as smart as I was.

03:02:16.620 --> 03:02:20.820
Everybody is engage and
curious and hard working--

03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:22.730
probably more hardworking
than I was.

03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:27.110
The difference between me and
him is that he grew in the city

03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:31.810
that was practicing systematic
discrimination for people of color

03:02:31.810 --> 03:02:34.980
and he did not receive
an adequate education.

03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:36.470
And that's why he ended
up where he was.

03:02:36.470 --> 03:02:42.920
So I've mention because I think
social justice and in equalities

03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:45.050
and important part of this
discussion and I was glad

03:02:45.050 --> 03:02:48.620
to hear some people touch on it
today and I think that's something

03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:51.040
to think about as we
continue the discussion.

03:02:51.040 --> 03:02:54.590
That said, I like to introduce
my panel, my esteemed panel.

03:02:54.590 --> 03:03:01.170
To my left Robert Logan is
a member of the senior staff

03:03:01.170 --> 03:03:05.220
of the US National Library of
Medicine and a professor emeritus

03:03:05.220 --> 03:03:08.380
at the University of Missouri
Columbia School of Journalism.

03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:12.460
I'm always worried but-- when
seniors staff I think that's--

03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:14.380
I was weary of those title

03:03:14.380 --> 03:03:20.130
because it makes you sound
old but you're not old, see.

03:03:20.130 --> 03:03:21.430
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: I
agree [inaudible].

03:03:21.430 --> 03:03:22.730
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Well.

03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:24.050
To Steve's left-- I'm sorry.

03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:27.480
To Robert's left is Steven Rush,

03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:30.000
the Director of the
United Health Group--

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.990
Health Literacy Innovations
Program an enterprise-wide program

03:03:32.990 --> 03:03:36.870 position:56%
to help consumers understand and use
health and wellness communications,

03:03:36.870 --> 03:03:39.470
and the former Director
of Physician Engagement

03:03:39.470 --> 03:03:41.790
at UnitedHealthcare Health Service.

03:03:41.790 --> 03:03:44.970
To his left, Michele Erikson,
is the Executive Director

03:03:44.970 --> 03:03:47.710
of Wisconsin Literacy
which supports, develops,

03:03:47.710 --> 03:03:49.700
and advocate for literacy
organizations

03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:52.090
across the state of Wisconsin.

03:03:52.090 --> 03:03:55.280 position:56%
Her work with Wisconsin Literacy has
focused on health literacy and ways

03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.770
to improve health outcome
and reduce health care cause

03:03:58.770 --> 03:04:00.700
by educating both providers
and patients

03:04:00.700 --> 03:04:03.110
on more effective ways
to communicate.

03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:07.720
And we're going to
start with Robert Logan.

03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:09.870
And we're sort of organized this is

03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:13.790
that Robert is going give us the
10,000 foot, look at this issue.

03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:17.820
And then we're going to have Steve
give us the 1000 foot issue--

03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:19.130
foot perspective.

03:04:19.130 --> 03:04:20.940
And then when we get to Michele,

03:04:20.940 --> 03:04:23.230
she's going to give us the
perspective from the ground.

03:04:23.230 --> 03:04:25.830
So with that said take
it away Robert.

03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:28.560
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: Thank you Jeff.

03:04:29.770 --> 03:04:31.730
Thank you Jeff.

03:04:31.730 --> 03:04:34.690
And I appreciate the
opportunity to be here.

03:04:34.690 --> 03:04:37.650
Our lawyers say we
have to say in public.

03:04:37.650 --> 03:04:39.210
We speak for ourselves.

03:04:39.210 --> 03:04:41.650
We don't speak for the
National Institute of Health.

03:04:41.650 --> 03:04:44.230
We don't speak for the
National Library of Medicine.

03:04:44.230 --> 03:04:46.630
And I don't speak for the
US Department of Health

03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:48.440
in Human Services either.

03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:51.380
Or I also don't speak
for the National Academy

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:53.510
in Medicine Health Literacy
Roundtable that Steve

03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:54.860
and I are very active in.

03:04:54.860 --> 03:04:58.130
Steve I guess you could speak
for it if you wanted to.

03:04:58.130 --> 03:05:01.780
I'm also the editor
of the first book

03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:05.110
on comprehensive health
literacy international research

03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:07.710
that I hope will be
publish in about 18 months.

03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:11.670
And before I go on, thank you
Dr. Sullivan for your leadership.

03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:15.630
The National Library of Medicine
would not be what its today had you

03:05:15.630 --> 03:05:18.940
not been at the US Department
of Health and Human Services

03:05:18.940 --> 03:05:21.090
at the time you were there.

03:05:21.090 --> 03:05:23.350
Very nice to see you as always.

03:05:23.350 --> 03:05:29.770 position:56%
Let's-- This is the front entrance
of the National Library of Medicine.

03:05:29.770 --> 03:05:32.860
Walk 9 miles that way
and you'll get there.

03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:35.800
OK. It's part of the NIH campus.

03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:38.980
Look at our unambitious mission.

03:05:38.980 --> 03:05:43.010
That's a joke at the
bottom in the page.

03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:44.340
NLM is PubMed.

03:05:44.340 --> 03:05:47.810
OK. It's all I have to say.

03:05:47.810 --> 03:05:51.760
I mean that's what we--
need more-- more I have to.

03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:55.640
If you don't need-- If you
don't know what PubMed,

03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:58.240
quietly don't let Dr.
Sullivan know that, OK.

03:05:58.240 --> 03:06:03.470
And that we're also the
publisher of MedlinePlus.

03:06:03.470 --> 03:06:07.070
Something that Dr. Sullivan
has been a long advocate of.

03:06:07.070 --> 03:06:10.830
MedlinePlus is it trying to
provide health information

03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:12.130
down to the level of consumer.

03:06:12.130 --> 03:06:13.780
I'm not going to show that today.

03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:15.290
But nevertheless, that is--

03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:17.640
if you're not familiar with
that website all of you

03:06:17.640 --> 03:06:20.330
who are interested
in those go there.

03:06:20.330 --> 03:06:23.270
Please don't tell me that there
are not efforts to explain health

03:06:23.270 --> 03:06:25.610
and medicine in a broad
comprehensive scale

03:06:25.610 --> 03:06:26.910
in American public.

03:06:26.910 --> 03:06:29.780
There are and they've been
there for about 20 years.

03:06:29.780 --> 03:06:32.550
By the way, if you to MedlinePlus,

03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:34.750
you'll see a lots of
links to Nemours.

03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:40.250
In many of MedlinePlus sites
we link on various issues

03:06:40.250 --> 03:06:43.170
to websites that Nemours has.

03:06:43.170 --> 03:06:48.390
I'm going to talk briefly about
one topic how health literacy--

03:06:48.390 --> 03:06:50.890
adult health literacy
differs from adult literacy

03:06:50.890 --> 03:06:52.320
and educational attainment.

03:06:52.320 --> 03:06:56.010
The second topic I would-- I've
decided, for the purpose of time

03:06:56.010 --> 03:07:00.440 position:56%
to discuss during the Q&amp;A assuming
that Jeff ask me the right question.

03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:01.740
On--

03:07:01.740 --> 03:07:03.040
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: I might
surprise you.

03:07:03.040 --> 03:07:04.340
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: Who knows?

03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:05.640
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: They
trusted me way too much.

03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:09.960
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: On the screen
is the Calgary charter definition

03:07:09.960 --> 03:07:11.260
of health literacy.

03:07:11.260 --> 03:07:13.660
As you read and I'm not
going to read for you.

03:07:13.660 --> 03:07:15.320
As you read it, remember this,

03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:19.710
that every single word you see
is the most expensive real estate

03:07:19.710 --> 03:07:21.310
imaginable, OK.

03:07:21.310 --> 03:07:23.640
People fought over
every syllable on this

03:07:23.640 --> 03:07:28.130
for months before it was
actually published in 2012.

03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:31.010
There are more than 50
definitions of health literacy.

03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:32.310
This is just one.

03:07:32.310 --> 03:07:34.000
But this is the only
one I know that was done

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:37.430
by interdisciplinary consensus
of people from around the world,

03:07:37.430 --> 03:07:40.100
which is why I have
it up in the screen.

03:07:42.520 --> 03:07:44.440 position:56%
Here's my wonderful friend Ceci Doak

03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:46.980
who was the pioneer
of health literacy.

03:07:46.980 --> 03:07:49.420
This was taken several months ago.

03:07:49.420 --> 03:07:55.020 position:56%
Ceci and Len Doaks were health--
adult health educators in the 1970s.

03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:58.620
And they discovered there was
surprisingly little research

03:07:58.620 --> 03:08:01.600
about how to best explain
health and medicine to patients.

03:08:01.600 --> 03:08:04.010
So they decided to
dedicate their career

03:08:04.010 --> 03:08:07.850 position:56%
to professionalizing adult health
literacy health education, research,

03:08:07.850 --> 03:08:10.900
and practice which they later
named "health literacy."

03:08:10.900 --> 03:08:12.410
They coined the term.

03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:16.070
Here's some of the Doaks'
discoveries in the 1970s.

03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:19.220
First, person with
below 8th grade reading

03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:22.210
and other literacy skills
rarely understood health

03:08:22.210 --> 03:08:24.780
and medical information.

03:08:24.780 --> 03:08:29.740
So low adult education attainment
they believe was associated

03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:32.310
with low adult literacy.

03:08:32.310 --> 03:08:37.320
Low educational attainment and low
adult literacy also were associated

03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:40.210
with less understanding
of health materials

03:08:40.210 --> 03:08:44.300 position:56%
and also health information
seeking, which is just as important.

03:08:44.300 --> 03:08:48.870
The Doaks' other discoveries
in the 1970s that medical

03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:51.190
and health information
were not presented.

03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:53.580
So they could be read
by low literate person.

03:08:53.580 --> 03:08:56.070
For example, the term
"avoid" the term

03:08:56.070 --> 03:08:58.740
"prevention" alone were
meaningless to most

03:08:58.740 --> 03:09:00.520
of the people that they used.

03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:02.070
If you'd put the word "PRE"

03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:05.620
that [inaudible] any word
immediately they said they argued

03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:08.520
about two-thirds in the American
republic have no idea what you're

03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:11.070
talking about.

03:09:11.070 --> 03:09:16.620
To stop-- just think about
that right there, OK.

03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:19.920
Medical jargon was an
obvious, very understanding.

03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:21.360
Here's just three examples.

03:09:21.360 --> 03:09:24.430
I'm sure we can come up with
several hundred among us, OK.

03:09:24.430 --> 03:09:27.910
Routine medical jargon which was
well-intended was significant

03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:29.610
barrier to understanding.

03:09:29.610 --> 03:09:32.580
And they argue that clinical
materials need to better-matched

03:09:32.580 --> 03:09:36.930
to patient's skills, something
that we still very much believe.

03:09:36.930 --> 03:09:38.230
And they began--

03:09:38.230 --> 03:09:42.490
planned intervention to
match materials with skills.

03:09:42.490 --> 03:09:45.670
In the 1980s after
several years of many years

03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:49.680
of practice the Doaks hit
an interesting confound

03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:54.190 position:56%
that well-educated literate adults,
I said well-educated literate adults

03:09:54.190 --> 03:09:57.190
and young person, often
did not understand health

03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:59.290
and medical term either.

03:09:59.290 --> 03:10:03.600
Often they had as little interest
in learning or discovering how

03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:07.650
to seek health information
as low literate persons.

03:10:07.650 --> 03:10:11.750
They conclude the association among
educational attainment literacy

03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:15.840
and understanding of an interest
in health maybe one directional,

03:10:15.840 --> 03:10:19.290
which was the first time
that was even postulated.

03:10:19.290 --> 03:10:25.000
Yes, low educational attainment was
associated with low adult literacy

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.500
and less understanding
of health and interest

03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:29.710
in health information seeking.

03:10:29.710 --> 03:10:32.730
Yes, higher health education--

03:10:32.730 --> 03:10:35.620
educational attainment was
associated with higher literacy.

03:10:35.620 --> 03:10:39.780
However, and here's the key point,
higher educational attainment

03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:43.810
and higher adult literacy were
not consistently associated

03:10:43.810 --> 03:10:46.490
with more understanding in
health and more interest

03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:48.150
in health informations seeking.

03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:53.740
And that was jarring to
this day, OK, hypothesis.

03:10:53.740 --> 03:10:55.470
The confound.

03:10:55.470 --> 03:10:58.710
Why are the associations
not bidirectional.

03:10:58.710 --> 03:11:00.570
This troubled the Doaks at first.

03:11:00.570 --> 03:11:02.370
For years they try to explain it.

03:11:02.370 --> 03:11:05.510
And then they began to
notice that it helped explain

03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:07.780
that this information
and this information

03:11:07.780 --> 03:11:09.870
about vaccines, for example.

03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:13.220
This is one example among
very well-educated Americans.

03:11:13.220 --> 03:11:17.230
That's the only way you
could possibly explain.

03:11:17.230 --> 03:11:20.880
Then they begin to-- say, the
confound also provided insights

03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:24.610
such as why English is second
language adult learners often are

03:11:24.610 --> 03:11:27.130
helped by using health materials.

03:11:27.130 --> 03:11:28.940
While other adult learners,

03:11:28.940 --> 03:11:31.470
people who speak English
well are not helped

03:11:31.470 --> 03:11:34.230
by using health materials.

03:11:34.230 --> 03:11:38.050
Again, they couldn't explain
that until they begin to realize

03:11:38.050 --> 03:11:41.730
that the-- what they assumed
all along wasn't not necessarily

03:11:41.730 --> 03:11:43.860
the case.

03:11:43.860 --> 03:11:47.240
Soon, OK, the Doaks started to
use the term health literacy

03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:51.410
to describe the underlying
dynamics they were experiencing.

03:11:51.410 --> 03:11:56.480
In the 1990s, the Doaks argued
as a dynamic of personal learning

03:11:56.480 --> 03:11:58.070
and constructive interventions.

03:11:58.070 --> 03:12:03.230
Adult health literacy might be
independent of adult literacy.

03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:05.800
They began to argue for
the first time that we need

03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:09.330
to assess health literacy on
its own merits on its own terms

03:12:09.330 --> 03:12:11.560
as an independent research
construct.

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:15.180
And intervene with strategies
to impact literacy as well

03:12:15.180 --> 03:12:17.630
as strategies to impact
health literacy.

03:12:17.630 --> 03:12:21.410 position:56%
Not to one or the other but to both.

03:12:21.410 --> 03:12:26.050 position:56%
Twenty-first century research, which
is now abundant, suggests strongly

03:12:26.050 --> 03:12:28.990
that the Doaks' observations
are correct.

03:12:28.990 --> 03:12:32.090
Health literacy is apparently
an independent dynamic,

03:12:32.090 --> 03:12:34.500
at least the evidence
strongly suggests it,

03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:35.910
that should be assessed separately

03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:39.900
from educational attainment
in adult literacy.

03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:43.480
Health literacy is an independent
research construct that's separate

03:12:43.480 --> 03:12:47.360
from adult literacy and
educational attainment.

03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:50.020
While health literacy
and literacy are similar

03:12:50.020 --> 03:12:53.680
and are highly complementary,
there are times when they diverged

03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:56.410
from each other and
they can be different.

03:12:56.410 --> 03:12:58.180
The National Assessment
of Adult Literacy

03:12:58.180 --> 03:13:02.560
and other findings
confirmed about in 2003.

03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:05.610
It is important to respect
some inconsistencies and think

03:13:05.610 --> 03:13:07.550
in terms of dual strategies.

03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:12.700
Work on both literacy and
health literacy simultaneously.

03:13:12.700 --> 03:13:15.820
Here are some current health
literacy research issues.

03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:17.930
There less about acknowledging
the differences

03:13:17.930 --> 03:13:19.400
between literacy and
health literacy.

03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:21.960
I think that era is
basically over now.

03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:26.200 position:56%
And most people instead focus on
health literacy and health outcomes.

03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:29.950
Health literacy and the utilization
of the health care delivery system.

03:13:29.950 --> 03:13:33.960
And briefly, here a few findings
some of clinical benefits

03:13:33.960 --> 03:13:38.390
that have been link to health
literacy interventions include

03:13:38.390 --> 03:13:42.820
reduce mortality, improved patient
adherence to medical instruction

03:13:42.820 --> 03:13:45.490
and overall patient safety.

03:13:45.490 --> 03:13:49.550
The health literacy interventions
can therapeutically assist patients

03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:52.240
with cancer, diabetes,
asthma, and hypertension

03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:55.630
and at least 11 other diseases.

03:13:55.630 --> 03:13:59.770
The specific health
administrative benefits link

03:13:59.770 --> 03:14:02.330
to health literacy interventions,
again, these were all--

03:14:02.330 --> 03:14:04.640
I'm just making it trying to--

03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:08.240
a lot of research more than
60 papers in a few moments.

03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:12.620
Some of the health
administrative benefits link

03:14:12.620 --> 03:14:14.590
to health literacy
interventions include;

03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:17.550
improved diabetes patient
self-management skills,

03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:19.630
much more use of preventive
services,

03:14:19.630 --> 03:14:23.180
as well as a significant
reduction in hospitalization

03:14:23.180 --> 03:14:25.130
and rehospitalization rates.

03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:28.570
As Dr. Sullivan knows well,
the letter has a direct impact

03:14:28.570 --> 03:14:32.200
on the cost of health care.

03:14:34.430 --> 03:14:38.040
Here's a glimpse of why it is an
absolutely fastening time to be

03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:40.740
in health literacy
research or practice.

03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:43.480
Health literacy interests
cover the waterfront.

03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:48.660
They include all the various
stakeholders you've seen

03:14:48.660 --> 03:14:49.960
on the screen.

03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:52.520
The interests is well
outside the United States.

03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:55.070
There's very active health
literacy research now

03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:58.280
and several other countries here,
four prominent ones on the screen.

03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:00.860
Michele and I will be on a
conference call, I think,

03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:03.320
it's a week from Tuesday,
where there'd be at least six

03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:06.850
or seven other people from around
the world on and it's normal.

03:15:06.850 --> 03:15:10.220
Health literacy-- The roundtable

03:15:10.220 --> 03:15:14.300 position:56%
of the National Academies actively
takes a leadership role in this area

03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:17.380
and has for now for 11 years.

03:15:17.380 --> 03:15:19.340
Here is their website.

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:20.760
Sorry. It's long.

03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:26.160 position:56%
And I'm afraid-- I'm embarrass to
tell you they're about to change it.

03:15:26.160 --> 03:15:27.990
&gt;&gt; Steven Rush: They
changed it yesterday.

03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:29.510
&gt;&gt; Roger Logan: Thank you Steve.

03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:31.510
You can follow the field's
progress, of course,

03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:33.980
in PubMed or medlineplus.gov.

03:15:33.980 --> 03:15:36.640
Here are three resources
to cover the field.

03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:40.210 position:56%
The first is how you cover the
PubMed with the special curated area

03:15:40.210 --> 03:15:43.410
that does nothing but
provide articles-- excuse me--

03:15:43.410 --> 03:15:46.410
referee journal publications
about health literacy.

03:15:46.410 --> 03:15:49.590
Here's MedlinePlus' health literacy
page, which for those of you

03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:52.910 position:56%
who are not a health care
practitioner, I encourage you to go.

03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:54.880 position:56%
They'll make much more sense to you.

03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:57.780 position:56%
And finally, there's an excellent
resource which we have nothing to do

03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:00.500
with in Harvard University
about resources.

03:16:00.500 --> 03:16:03.910
And the reason I put that one on
the screen among many is that--

03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:08.550 position:56%
this particular one specializes in
health literacy and adult education.

03:16:08.550 --> 03:16:11.340
I went through my references
really fast, but that in--

03:16:11.340 --> 03:16:15.510
that I certainly have them and
I thank you for your touch.

03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:28.040
[ Applause ]

03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:32.500
Thank you.

03:16:32.500 --> 03:16:34.330
&gt;&gt; Steven Rush: Thanks.

03:16:34.330 --> 03:16:35.770
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: Yup.

03:16:35.770 --> 03:16:38.920
&gt;&gt; Steven Rush: So, I'm Steve
Rush and I'm the Director

03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:42.860
of the Health Literacy Innovations
Program at UnitedHealth Group

03:16:42.860 --> 03:16:48.130
and you'd said, "Why is a
health insurer interested

03:16:48.130 --> 03:16:49.430
in health literacy?"

03:16:49.430 --> 03:16:52.580
And in the next few
minutes I'll let you know.

03:16:52.580 --> 03:16:56.620
I don't want to-- out of the bed.

03:16:56.620 --> 03:16:58.730
Let me just to ask a question.

03:16:58.730 --> 03:17:02.350
How many of you have
been faced with decisions

03:17:02.350 --> 03:17:07.700
about buying insurance
or using health care?

03:17:07.700 --> 03:17:12.960
How many of you know what your
certificate of coverage says

03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:19.660
about getting a ride to the
hospital in an ambulance.

03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:27.500 position:56%
Nope. How many of you truly
understand everything your physician

03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:29.610
has told you?

03:17:29.610 --> 03:17:30.910
Guess what?

03:17:30.910 --> 03:17:34.350
We all have low health literacy.

03:17:34.350 --> 03:17:37.030
Low health literacy
we've talked about it

03:17:37.030 --> 03:17:41.100
and it is really interesting.

03:17:41.100 --> 03:17:44.460
People have talked about
health literacy last night.

03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:46.000
Dr. Bailey talked about it.

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.020
This morning we've talked about it.

03:17:48.020 --> 03:17:54.380
And I wanted to share with you that
health literacy is not a trait.

03:17:54.380 --> 03:17:55.680
It's a state.

03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:56.980
It changes.

03:17:56.980 --> 03:18:01.260
And I'd like to thank the
Library of Congress and Nemours

03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:06.000
for inviting me here today
to talk a little about that.

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:10.780
This morning Dr. Needleman
talked about bookkeeping

03:18:10.780 --> 03:18:14.380
and basically talked
about downstream costs.

03:18:14.380 --> 03:18:16.950
And I'll be addressing
that in a minute.

03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:20.680
But what I wanted to tell
you was that Health Literacy

03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:25.140
at UnitedHealth Group really
began about seven years ago.

03:18:25.140 --> 03:18:30.960
And Dr. Migliori who's shown here
is really a very big proponent

03:18:30.960 --> 03:18:33.090
of that at UnitedHealth Group.

03:18:33.090 --> 03:18:37.320
We have the "Just Plain
Clear Communications" program

03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:41.190
where we're attempting to
create health communications

03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:46.930
that are simple, accessible,
understandable, and actionable.

03:18:46.930 --> 03:18:49.730
So, why is health literacy
important?

03:18:49.730 --> 03:18:52.270
We've talked about it a little bit.

03:18:52.270 --> 03:18:57.260
We all know that health
literacy is transient

03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:02.130 position:56%
and people have difficulty
understanding and using health care.

03:19:02.130 --> 03:19:04.830
And in today's health
care environment more

03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:07.450
and more responsibility
for utilization

03:19:07.450 --> 03:19:11.980
of health care is being put
on the consumer, the patient.

03:19:11.980 --> 03:19:13.880
And it's difficult.

03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:18.580
It's really difficult to
understand all the intricacies.

03:19:18.580 --> 03:19:20.380
We've talked a little
bit about people

03:19:20.380 --> 03:19:24.370
with low health literacy having a
greater risk of hospitalization.

03:19:24.370 --> 03:19:30.580
At the cost of the health
care system using 2005,

03:19:30.580 --> 03:19:38.810
2004 data was up to
$238 billion a year.

03:19:38.810 --> 03:19:44.300
I think it's more upwards
of $240 billion a year.

03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:47.630
And we do know and Rob
just talked about it

03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:52.530
that health literacy is related
to medication and treatment errors

03:19:52.530 --> 03:20:00.150 position:56%
and medication adherence and ability
to follow treatment recommendations.

03:20:00.150 --> 03:20:04.140
Health literacy by the numbers.

03:20:04.140 --> 03:20:11.860
It's a minimum of 77 million
adults in the United States have--

03:20:11.860 --> 03:20:16.100
don't have basic literacy skills.

03:20:16.100 --> 03:20:22.410
From a payer standpoint the average
medical cost per year of a person

03:20:22.410 --> 03:20:26.500
with higher health
literacy is about $3000,

03:20:26.500 --> 03:20:29.450
while the average cost
per year of a person

03:20:29.450 --> 03:20:34.120
with lower health literacy
is $13,000.

03:20:34.120 --> 03:20:38.870
That's a different of about 433%.

03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:42.700
We did some research and we
found that taking the look

03:20:42.700 --> 03:20:48.520
at people utilizing health care
within a low literacy community

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:51.690
versus the higher health
literacy community,

03:20:51.690 --> 03:20:56.850
the difference was amazing in
terms of unavoidable admissions

03:20:56.850 --> 03:21:03.200
to the hospital, utilization
of the emergency room,

03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:06.150 position:56%
following treatment recommendations.

03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:12.460
The average reading level for a lot
of health insurance documents is--

03:21:12.460 --> 03:21:18.570
was at about 10th grade,
10th grade wow.

03:21:18.570 --> 03:21:23.600
We have states that are requiring
health information to be written

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.880
at the third grade level.

03:21:25.880 --> 03:21:30.790
Most state require people to
have written communications

03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:33.650
about the sixth grade level.

03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:38.370
And realistically not choosing

03:21:38.370 --> 03:21:41.830
and using health care is
really very difficult.

03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:46.770
The Patient Protection Affordable
Care Act defined health literacy

03:21:46.770 --> 03:21:50.650
in the law and it's
been talked about here.

03:21:50.650 --> 03:21:54.130
But people in the health
literacy community talked

03:21:54.130 --> 03:21:58.850
about that definition is not
being quite enough because--

03:21:58.850 --> 03:22:02.920
just because you make a decision
doesn't mean you're actually able

03:22:02.920 --> 03:22:06.790
to take that decision
and then actually use it,

03:22:06.790 --> 03:22:09.220
take put it into action.

03:22:10.380 --> 03:22:15.800
I like the definition that Rima
Rudd, one of our colleagues talks

03:22:15.800 --> 03:22:19.870
about and she says that "Health
literacy happens when anyone

03:22:19.870 --> 03:22:25.230
on the receiving end of health
communications and anyone

03:22:25.230 --> 03:22:30.000
on the giving end of health
communications truly understand

03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:32.370
one another."

03:22:32.370 --> 03:22:34.710
There's no blame here.

03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:39.140
Early health literacy
were blamed the person.

03:22:39.140 --> 03:22:42.830
You have low health
literacy, you're dumb,

03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:44.480
you don't know what's you're doing.

03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:49.900
No; it's an equal bidirectional
responsibility.

03:22:49.900 --> 03:22:52.470
So we-- and I did help fill

03:22:52.470 --> 03:22:56.160
that health communication
should be simple, accessible,

03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:59.020
understandable, and actionable.

03:22:59.020 --> 03:23:04.020
So why is there a health
focus on health literacy other

03:23:04.020 --> 03:23:09.990
than all the cost while the Patient
Protection Affordable Care Act 2010

03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:13.390
defined health literacy in
the law for the 1st time.

03:23:13.390 --> 03:23:17.080
And then they're followed
federal rules and guidelines

03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:22.440 position:56%
and now accrediting organization and
quality organization are demanding

03:23:22.440 --> 03:23:28.100
that health literacy be a
component of the way people

03:23:28.100 --> 03:23:30.220 position:56%
in the health community do business.

03:23:30.220 --> 03:23:37.680
State agencies are mandating that
literacy level to be put into play.

03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:43.260
Customers, people who are paying
for health insurance, CMS,

03:23:43.260 --> 03:23:46.850
and larger corporations
even the employer--

03:23:46.850 --> 03:23:53.280 position:56%
other employers are saying you got--
give information to our employees

03:23:53.280 --> 03:23:57.780
that are simple, accessible,
understandable, and actionable.

03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:01.600
And consumers remember
this, say it too.

03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:05.590
And there's that gentleman in
the lower right hand corner.

03:24:05.590 --> 03:24:11.740
And most of all providing
information that's simple,

03:24:11.740 --> 03:24:17.320 position:56%
accessible, understandable and
actionable is the right thing to do.

03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:21.870 position:56%
So why is there-- what's the linkage

03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:24.430
from health literacy
to health outcomes?

03:24:24.430 --> 03:24:26.400
You'll notice that
reading isn't there.

03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:33.020
But that's something that is--
that I point out because reading is

03:24:33.020 --> 03:24:38.010 position:56%
in fact a very important segments
but so as race and ethnicity, again,

03:24:38.010 --> 03:24:41.250
language, and age, vision, hearing,

03:24:41.250 --> 03:24:43.860
verbal ability, memory
and reasoning.

03:24:43.860 --> 03:24:47.080
And one of the things that I
did when I was talking to one

03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:50.170
of our leaders was to say,
"Hey, look at this over here."

03:24:50.170 --> 03:24:54.250
And he said, "I didn't know
that vision and hearing

03:24:54.250 --> 03:24:57.440
and verbal ability,
reasoning was in there."

03:24:57.440 --> 03:24:59.240
"Oh, yeah, it is."

03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:03.580 position:56%
But take a look at how health
literacy impacts how people choosing

03:25:03.580 --> 03:25:08.270
to use health care, take a look at
how health literacy is important

03:25:08.270 --> 03:25:13.100
for that provider, health care
provider and patient interaction.

03:25:13.100 --> 03:25:17.500
And if people can't understand
how is it that they're supposed

03:25:17.500 --> 03:25:20.520
to be able to take
care of themselves?

03:25:20.520 --> 03:25:25.270
The many, many-- Today's health
care environment really focuses

03:25:25.270 --> 03:25:31.110
to a greater extent than in the
past on chronic care conditions,

03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:35.340
diabetes, heart, asthma,
other pulmonary problems.

03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:42.190
The day-to-day care that needs to
be done for that person is provide

03:25:42.190 --> 03:25:50.260
by that person or their personal
caregivers, 95% of all chronic care

03:25:50.260 --> 03:25:54.160
on a daily basis is
provided by that person

03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:57.590
or their personal caregiver, 95%.

03:25:57.590 --> 03:26:02.320
So Kathleen Sebelius at one point
said, "If people can't understand,

03:26:02.320 --> 03:26:04.800
they can't decide,
and they can't do."

03:26:04.800 --> 03:26:08.340 position:56%
And that's-- that's what shown here.

03:26:08.340 --> 03:26:11.130
There are number of factors
affecting health literacy,

03:26:11.130 --> 03:26:14.050
one is the general literacy
level of the people,

03:26:14.050 --> 03:26:16.800
experience with the health
care system, physical

03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:21.730
and psychological factors,
culture and language, aging,

03:26:21.730 --> 03:26:23.310
complexity in information.

03:26:23.310 --> 03:26:28.350
And my God, I can tell you that
health insurance information

03:26:28.350 --> 03:26:32.050
and health care information
is so complex.

03:26:32.050 --> 03:26:34.120
I wish I could say
that I had a full head

03:26:34.120 --> 03:26:38.630
of brown hair before I started
working in the insurance company.

03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:40.380
But I can't do that.

03:26:40.380 --> 03:26:47.290 position:56%
Learning style is really important
and how information is communicated.

03:26:47.290 --> 03:26:51.800
So reading is really important
so as listening and math,

03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:57.420
math is really becoming a very
important factor, speaking,

03:26:57.420 --> 03:27:01.320
writhing, thinking, health care
problem solving, health literacy,

03:27:01.320 --> 03:27:04.640
think health care problem
solving and remembering.

03:27:04.640 --> 03:27:09.940
And if these skills doesn't need to
be put into consideration to think

03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:12.950
about what member does,
or a patient does

03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:17.040
and then the health care system.

03:27:17.040 --> 03:27:19.900
So here's some startling facts.

03:27:19.900 --> 03:27:25.050
$240 billion a year in
medical cost are associated

03:27:25.050 --> 03:27:27.300
with low health literacy.

03:27:27.300 --> 03:27:29.750
Recent research showed that 4

03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:35.360
in 10 uninsured don't know
basic health insurance terms.

03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:42.360 position:56%
Wow. Yet these people are going to
be responsible for the medical spend

03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:48.370
and fewer than 4 in 10 understand
complex coverage concepts.

03:27:48.370 --> 03:27:50.310
This is an amazing fact.

03:27:50.310 --> 03:27:53.470
Millennial may have--
maybe the best educated.

03:27:53.470 --> 03:27:57.580
But they have huge
gaps in their care.

03:27:58.740 --> 03:28:03.820
And choosing and using health
insurance creates cognitive burden.

03:28:03.820 --> 03:28:10.560
But the other piece
to that is many people

03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:14.310
over estimate their
knowledge of health insurance.

03:28:14.310 --> 03:28:18.610
Three out four people
say, "Hey, I can do this.

03:28:18.610 --> 03:28:20.330
I know this stuff."

03:28:20.330 --> 03:28:22.440
But when push came to shove,

03:28:22.440 --> 03:28:26.130
only one in five really
demonstrated the capability.

03:28:26.130 --> 03:28:29.960
So what does that mean
in terms of literacy?

03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:39.130
So Jeff talked about PIAA that
was the International Program the

03:28:39.130 --> 03:28:41.500
Assessment of Adult Literacy.

03:28:41.500 --> 03:28:45.310 position:56%
Three components to it,
understanding written communication,

03:28:45.310 --> 03:28:48.590
working with numbers,
and then using computers

03:28:48.590 --> 03:28:51.470
for health problem solving.

03:28:51.470 --> 03:28:59.140
Take a look at where the US is
relative to 24 or 20 countries.

03:28:59.140 --> 03:29:02.190
What does that mean for literacy?

03:29:02.190 --> 03:29:07.970
US is tied for 7th
lowest of 24 countries.

03:29:07.970 --> 03:29:16.300 position:56%
We're 3rd from the bottom in math
skills and we're 3rd from the bottom

03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:19.610
in 20 countries when it
come to using computers

03:29:19.610 --> 03:29:24.230
for problem solving,
very interesting stuff.

03:29:24.230 --> 03:29:26.020
What's the implication?

03:29:26.020 --> 03:29:30.380
Health communications
and learning style.

03:29:30.380 --> 03:29:38.040
We did some research and we found
that in a general population of 18

03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:47.230
to 49-- to 64 years old,
60% were visual learners--

03:29:47.230 --> 03:29:55.070
60% were visual learners, 15% were
auditory learners, and 25% mixed.

03:29:55.070 --> 03:29:58.370
Take a look at what
happens when people aged.

03:29:58.370 --> 03:30:00.580
It's really different.

03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:04.470
So that's-- I'd like you
think about cognitive burden.

03:30:04.470 --> 03:30:07.320
Cognitive burden has two parts.

03:30:07.320 --> 03:30:10.420
One is the burden of illness.

03:30:10.420 --> 03:30:12.210
Boy there's a lot stuff
that you have

03:30:12.210 --> 03:30:14.390
to remember when you're a diabetic.

03:30:14.390 --> 03:30:20.400
And it changes the way
you live your life.

03:30:20.400 --> 03:30:22.320
And then there is the
burden of treatment.

03:30:22.320 --> 03:30:28.190
When I wok with our telephonic
pharmacist training them

03:30:28.190 --> 03:30:32.690
to communicate in simple
understandable and actionable ways.

03:30:32.690 --> 03:30:36.560
I say, "To what extent are you
adding to the burden of treatment

03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:42.300
when you use terms like"--
you-- there's a medic--

03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:43.750
we have a medical class

03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:47.620
or a medication class
called angio tension,

03:30:47.620 --> 03:30:49.570
beta blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:30:49.570 --> 03:30:52.690
And they go.

03:30:52.690 --> 03:30:57.430
I was just put on the medication
and than I could barely say it.

03:30:57.430 --> 03:31:01.810
So health literacy another look,

03:31:01.810 --> 03:31:06.600
I really like this cognitive
burden piece on the left hand side.

03:31:06.600 --> 03:31:10.350
Basically it says, "When you load
my brain up with confusing choices,

03:31:10.350 --> 03:31:13.730
ambiguous phrases,
unparasable sentences,

03:31:13.730 --> 03:31:16.270
you impose a cognitive burden.

03:31:16.270 --> 03:31:19.800
You make me think, and
not about your subject.

03:31:19.800 --> 03:31:24.760
You are making me translate,
transform, interpret what you say.

03:31:24.760 --> 03:31:28.180
And this distracts
me from your point."

03:31:29.250 --> 03:31:35.280
And then there's always George
Bernard Shaw with his statement

03:31:35.280 --> 03:31:39.700
about the illusion that
communication has taken place.

03:31:39.700 --> 03:31:43.910
I want to share with you a
resource that we've created.

03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:45.670
It's free.

03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:49.280 position:56%
It's done as a social responsibility

03:31:49.280 --> 03:31:54.470
and that's the just plain
clear English-Spanish glossary.

03:31:54.470 --> 03:31:58.590
No one will call up and say,
"Hey, you use our glossary.

03:31:58.590 --> 03:32:00.130
You want to buy our insurance?"

03:32:00.130 --> 03:32:02.580
No-- That's not what it is.

03:32:02.580 --> 03:32:09.240
What we've done is taken over
3400 complex health insurance,

03:32:09.240 --> 03:32:15.520
healthcare terms and other
terms, and put them more simpler,

03:32:15.520 --> 03:32:20.920
understandable language and we
cross walk that with complex banish

03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:25.590
and complex and more
understandable Spanish.

03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:30.860
And we're going through a redesign
right now where we're going to hook

03:32:30.860 --> 03:32:38.060
up into images and
to movies and PDFs.

03:32:38.060 --> 03:32:43.580
The just plain clear
www.justplainclear.com,

03:32:43.580 --> 03:32:47.870
we've use this with
English as a second language

03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:50.920
with adult basic education
programs and because it's

03:32:50.920 --> 03:32:54.270
on our responsive platform
you can open it up.

03:32:54.270 --> 03:32:57.520
And when you're seeing the patient
and you can't remember the English

03:32:57.520 --> 03:33:02.200
or Spanish term you can look
it up and it really does work.

03:33:02.200 --> 03:33:03.500
Thank you.

03:33:03.500 --> 03:33:05.300
I appreciate your time.

03:33:05.300 --> 03:33:18.560
[ Applause ]

03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:20.860
&gt;&gt;Michele Erikson: So--

03:33:24.990 --> 03:33:26.290
Good afternoon.

03:33:26.290 --> 03:33:27.590
My name is Michele Erikson.

03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:32.090
I have been involved in adult
literacy for quite a while,

03:33:32.090 --> 03:33:33.390
longer than I'd like to admit.

03:33:33.390 --> 03:33:35.360
But about 30 years now.

03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:39.090
I started in adult literacy
just of out of college.

03:33:39.090 --> 03:33:42.150
I got a call from the Boyd Public
Library asking me for money.

03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:43.530 position:56%
And I said I have two college loans.

03:33:43.530 --> 03:33:44.940
I have no money.

03:33:44.940 --> 03:33:46.870
But I probably could help someone.

03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:49.200
I've been in the library
and saw advertisement

03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:51.500
to become a literacy tutor.

03:33:51.500 --> 03:33:55.090
I thought I might be
able to do that.

03:33:55.090 --> 03:34:00.440
And so I went to the training
and met my first student, Bill.

03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:07.350
Bill was a 39-year-old
father of a 9-year-old.

03:34:07.350 --> 03:34:09.670
And Bill did not know
that names of the letters

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:11.240
or the sounds that they made.

03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:15.680
And he just got-- he just been
laid off from his job as a welder.

03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:20.370
And we started-- We are going
to meet at the public library

03:34:20.370 --> 03:34:23.670
and he told me we could
sit outside in the bench

03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:25.170
but he would not go in the library.

03:34:25.170 --> 03:34:29.050 position:56%
There are far too many books for him
to feel comfortable in a library.

03:34:29.050 --> 03:34:32.990
So we sit outside in the bench
and we talked awhile and started

03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:35.090
to meet at his kitchen table.

03:34:35.090 --> 03:34:40.390
Not long after we were meeting
and some trust was built he shared

03:34:40.390 --> 03:34:45.010 position:56%
with me a letter that he had in a
drawer for about two and half years.

03:34:45.010 --> 03:34:49.610
It was from the DMV and the letter
told him what he needed to do

03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:51.210
to get his drivers license back.

03:34:51.210 --> 03:34:52.570
It had been revoked.

03:34:52.570 --> 03:34:58.260
And neither he nor his wife could
read the letter nor did they want

03:34:58.260 --> 03:35:00.250
anyone else to know they
couldn't read the letters.

03:35:00.250 --> 03:35:01.550
So there it sat.

03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:02.850
I was thinking about that.

03:35:02.850 --> 03:35:04.150
I'm really glad it wasn't a letter

03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:07.230
from a doctor telling him what
he needed to do to take care

03:35:07.230 --> 03:35:10.460
of his health or his
family's health.

03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:14.830
So we started working toward
getting Bill his driver's license

03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:16.690
and moved on from there.

03:35:16.690 --> 03:35:19.070
But that's how I got
involved in this.

03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:20.590
And it just stuck with
me ever since.

03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:23.230
I did not realize as a college
student there were adults

03:35:23.230 --> 03:35:24.530
that didn't read and write.

03:35:24.530 --> 03:35:26.710
It just never ever occurred to me.

03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:31.100
So I find myself at
Wisconsin Literacy.

03:35:31.100 --> 03:35:37.820
I started there in 2005 and been
working a lot and health literacy.

03:35:37.820 --> 03:35:42.720
We're a coalition, a statewide
coalition of 78 agencies

03:35:42.720 --> 03:35:47.060
that provide direct
support for adult learners.

03:35:47.060 --> 03:35:54.390
And we-- what we do is provide
the capacity building and training

03:35:54.390 --> 03:35:58.620
for those agencies, to help them
train more volunteer tutors.

03:35:58.620 --> 03:36:00.770
We work also as an advocacy agency.

03:36:00.770 --> 03:36:03.070
We worked around workforce
development.

03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:06.450
So we're helping our agencies
prepare their adult learners

03:36:06.450 --> 03:36:09.450
for the workforce and
job readiness skills.

03:36:09.450 --> 03:36:13.120
And then our biggest division is--

03:36:13.120 --> 03:36:15.750
area we're working is called
Wisconsin Health Literacy.

03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:19.680
It's a division of itself under
our Wisconsin Literacy, Inc.

03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:25.430
umbrella and it has its own
website and has really been working

03:36:25.430 --> 03:36:28.810
in this field since about 2003.

03:36:28.810 --> 03:36:32.800
A lot of growth since 2003.

03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:36.080
We have services that we provide.

03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:38.490
We do a summit every other year.

03:36:38.490 --> 03:36:40.590
We have one coming up in April 17.

03:36:40.590 --> 03:36:44.600
And these have become larger
and more comprehensive.

03:36:44.600 --> 03:36:46.170
Now, there are national summits

03:36:46.170 --> 03:36:49.530
and we've had international
guests as well.

03:36:49.530 --> 03:36:53.490
And it's a wonderful opportunity to
bring health and education together

03:36:53.490 --> 03:36:55.930
under one roof and we spend
about two and a half days

03:36:55.930 --> 03:36:59.500
and we learned a lot about
the things that are going

03:36:59.500 --> 03:37:02.340
on in our country and
in other countries

03:37:02.340 --> 03:37:04.650
as well around health literacy.

03:37:04.650 --> 03:37:06.140
We do a lot of awareness building.

03:37:06.140 --> 03:37:09.750 position:56%
We started out just educating our
state about what health literacy was

03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:12.480
and it's impacts and implications,

03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:14.930
we do a lot of community
health projects

03:37:14.930 --> 03:37:16.770 position:56%
where we go into community agencies.

03:37:16.770 --> 03:37:19.360
Primarily, we started with
our literacy agencies.

03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:22.940 position:56%
But now we've now we've branched out
to a lot of social service agencies

03:37:22.940 --> 03:37:25.490
that are serving vulnerable
populations

03:37:25.490 --> 03:37:27.610
and do community health projects.

03:37:27.610 --> 03:37:32.960
And then on the other side of this,
we worked with providers and a lot

03:37:32.960 --> 03:37:36.250
of education and training,
how to speak plain language.

03:37:36.250 --> 03:37:40.390 position:56%
As you-- the definition that Rob
provide in the Calgary charter talks

03:37:40.390 --> 03:37:42.980
about the communication
piece of health literacy

03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:44.790
and it really is a two-way street.

03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:48.180
It's really important that when
providers are communicating

03:37:48.180 --> 03:37:52.130 position:56%
that they understand how to
communicate in health literate ways.

03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:56.480
And so we work on training
along those lines.

03:37:56.480 --> 03:38:00.360
So, again, you get to learn
this over and over when--

03:38:00.360 --> 03:38:02.890
it's a repetition this
morning is one way to.

03:38:02.890 --> 03:38:07.730
So you've seen this but 90 million
Americans trouble understanding

03:38:07.730 --> 03:38:10.960
and I think that is really
important to remember.

03:38:10.960 --> 03:38:14.880
There's just so many areas in this
field from insurance to, you know,

03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:19.730
taking your medicine at home that
are impacted by health literacy.

03:38:19.730 --> 03:38:23.730
So I wanted to focus, just
on one of our projects.

03:38:23.730 --> 03:38:25.610
We do many different
projects out in the community.

03:38:25.610 --> 03:38:27.350
But the one I'm going to
talk about today is called

03:38:27.350 --> 03:38:28.950
"Let's Talk about Medicines."

03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:31.340
It's actually-- We had one--

03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:34.010
Before this we worked on called
"Let's Talk about the Flu."

03:38:34.010 --> 03:38:38.610
So these are community projects
that are funded by, this one,

03:38:38.610 --> 03:38:40.820
by Security Health Plan
and Insurance Company

03:38:40.820 --> 03:38:42.990
in our northern part of the state.

03:38:42.990 --> 03:38:50.180
And we looked to agencies where we
can go out and provide information

03:38:50.180 --> 03:38:53.650
in a health literate manner at a
level that everyone can understand.

03:38:53.650 --> 03:38:56.980
These call-- or this project we
started out working with seniors

03:38:56.980 --> 03:39:03.100
because seniors are utmost at
risk for health literate behaviors

03:39:03.100 --> 03:39:05.340
that can have great consequences.

03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:09.300
They take more medicines and
other things that are happening

03:39:09.300 --> 03:39:10.600
at that time affect this.

03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:15.150
So we've gone from seniors and
I'll talk a little bit later.

03:39:15.150 --> 03:39:19.260
We're now working with refugees
with the same project on medic--

03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:21.050
Let's Talk about Medicine.

03:39:21.050 --> 03:39:22.350
So these are the goals

03:39:22.350 --> 03:39:28.580
of the project really understanding
what a medication label looks like,

03:39:28.580 --> 03:39:32.230
the dosage, special instructions,
feeling comfortable talking

03:39:32.230 --> 03:39:35.280
to your pharmacist, remembering how

03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:39.130
to take your medicine
and where to store them.

03:39:39.130 --> 03:39:41.960
We usually do this in
open hour workshops

03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:43.260
in different community settings.

03:39:43.260 --> 03:39:46.990
So we've been everywhere from,
as I said, senior centers.

03:39:46.990 --> 03:39:50.250
We've-- We're in Salvation Army.

03:39:50.250 --> 03:39:52.550
We're in our literacy agencies.

03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:56.040
We're in neighborhood centers
and providing this information.

03:39:56.040 --> 03:40:01.520
This particular project
has a pill box incentives

03:40:01.520 --> 03:40:07.080
and this is a workbook that
we developed for this project.

03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:08.380
There are some on back.

03:40:08.380 --> 03:40:10.910
There was the Let's Talk about Flu
and Let's Talk about Medicines.

03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:13.600
But basically we developed this.

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:17.450
It's written about a 4th grade
reading level and it goes

03:40:17.450 --> 03:40:21.310
through the many project goals that
I had just talked about previously,

03:40:21.310 --> 03:40:25.770
lots of pictures, easy
to understand,

03:40:25.770 --> 03:40:28.660
writing, lots of white space.

03:40:28.660 --> 03:40:33.060
So this is the tool that we
use similar one with the flu.

03:40:33.060 --> 03:40:38.840
But we started in 50 workshop
locations across the state

03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:42.660
and deliver the workshop.

03:40:42.660 --> 03:40:47.880
We've had-- Every time we go they
ask us when we can come back.

03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:53.250
We are on working developing
other things with the workbook.

03:40:53.250 --> 03:40:58.600
So examples of what that looks
like inside, types of medicines,

03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:03.200
prescription medicine and labels,
and the medicine reminders.

03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:06.780
Each participant is-- gets
incentivized with the pill box

03:41:06.780 --> 03:41:10.100
that they get to take home
as well as we do other things

03:41:10.100 --> 03:41:13.290
like we do a preimposed test.

03:41:13.290 --> 03:41:18.310
So each participant comes in
with a very simple pre-test

03:41:18.310 --> 03:41:20.430
and then this post-tested.

03:41:20.430 --> 03:41:23.320
So we can get some
measurement on understanding

03:41:23.320 --> 03:41:25.620
and knowledge gain
during the workshop.

03:41:25.620 --> 03:41:28.840
We develop some card games that
they do during the workshop as well

03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:35.030
that give situations about
medication use and safety.

03:41:36.270 --> 03:41:40.910
We've also worked on some videos
that are posted on our website now.

03:41:40.910 --> 03:41:42.210
There's three of them.

03:41:42.210 --> 03:41:44.060
These two here, "When
to Take Your Medicine"

03:41:44.060 --> 03:41:45.360
and "How to Store Your Medicine."

03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.570
They're just about
a minute and a half,

03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:49.910
really short easy to
understand videos.

03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:53.190
There's also one about
talking with your pharmacist.

03:41:53.190 --> 03:41:56.750
And we promote these
videos during the workshop.

03:41:56.750 --> 03:42:00.500
We've done online as
well as a printed quiz,

03:42:00.500 --> 03:42:04.310
so that participants can take that
home and use it with their family.

03:42:04.310 --> 03:42:10.660
And we're also now training the
trainer on these workshops so that

03:42:10.660 --> 03:42:14.780
when the funding runs out that
organizations are equipped to care

03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:18.760
on the workshops on their
own with as many resources

03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:24.890
that we can make available for
them with very limited cost.

03:42:24.890 --> 03:42:26.890
So here are some of
the things we learned

03:42:26.890 --> 03:42:28.290
that there's a really big gap.

03:42:28.290 --> 03:42:32.230
And in this particular project
with seniors what they really know

03:42:32.230 --> 03:42:36.120
and what they think they
know as you had pointed out,

03:42:36.120 --> 03:42:37.720
everyone can thought,
"Yeah, I can do this."

03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:40.430
And then all of a sudden when
you're asked to demonstrate it,

03:42:40.430 --> 03:42:42.920
it becomes a little different.

03:42:42.920 --> 03:42:45.240
Medication storage is an issue.

03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:48.060
There was just something on
Good Morning America Today

03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:54.760
about children accessing pill boxes
and medications and how easy it is

03:42:54.760 --> 03:43:00.460
to had all this little kids opening
up a child proof pill boxes and,

03:43:00.460 --> 03:43:04.060
you know, very easily like one kid
had it done in nine seconds and--

03:43:04.060 --> 03:43:05.620
&gt;&gt; Steven Rush: And
these were child proof?

03:43:05.620 --> 03:43:07.380
&gt;&gt; Michele Erikson: These
are child proof, yeah.

03:43:07.380 --> 03:43:10.330
So, yeah it was very
really interesting story.

03:43:10.330 --> 03:43:14.990
So medication storage
is a really big issue.

03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:18.330
The label instructions have
often caused confusion.

03:43:18.330 --> 03:43:19.670
Those are the ones on the side

03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:22.210
to the special labels
are often a source

03:43:22.210 --> 03:43:26.030
of confusions for many people.

03:43:26.030 --> 03:43:30.340
And remembering when to take them
and how to take them and reluctance

03:43:30.340 --> 03:43:34.950
to ask pharmacist,
we show a lot of--

03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:39.300
we show this video a lot from
the AMA where people talked

03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:42.160
about their own health literacy
experience and, you know,

03:43:42.160 --> 03:43:45.110
knowing when to take your medicine
is not something that's easily

03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:46.410
understood on the label.

03:43:46.410 --> 03:43:49.670
So take two tablets twice a day.

03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:54.860 position:56%
That doesn't register with everybody
and there's a little video clip

03:43:54.860 --> 03:43:58.290
of a woman saying I take, you know,
I have 16 pills a day that I have

03:43:58.290 --> 03:44:01.730
to take and I don't want to
forget and I'm not sure exactly

03:44:01.730 --> 03:44:04.320
when to take them, so I just
take them all in the morning,

03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:06.590
so I make I've got them all in.

03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:13.890
And so, you know, this
happens and it's very real.

03:44:13.890 --> 03:44:16.580
So these are the results
where again trying to--

03:44:16.580 --> 03:44:20.870
measuring health behavior outcomes

03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:23.900
and changing health behaviors,
a very difficult thing.

03:44:23.900 --> 03:44:29.660
This is just the results from
preimposed test, understanding

03:44:29.660 --> 03:44:32.820 position:56%
or identifying the number of pills,
like I said people think they get it

03:44:32.820 --> 03:44:36.230
but when they ask it like put
the number of pills correctly--

03:44:36.230 --> 03:44:37.800
the correct number of
pills in their hand

03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:39.880
and it becomes a little
bit different.

03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:47.760
So 72 were OK in the
pre-test, 85% on the post test.

03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:52.770
I should also say that this
similar study done in 2006

03:44:52.770 --> 03:44:57.320
with intermediate both
limited literacy intermediate

03:44:57.320 --> 03:44:59.600
and proficient literacy
adults was done.

03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:03.370
And even the proficient
literacy folks

03:45:03.370 --> 03:45:09.870
that were asked two tablets twice
a day, there is consistently one

03:45:09.870 --> 03:45:12.760
or two mistakes out
of that group that--

03:45:12.760 --> 03:45:15.310
whereas the high literacy group.

03:45:15.310 --> 03:45:17.280
So people make mistakes as well.

03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:19.810
And then again as I mentioned the

03:45:19.810 --> 03:45:22.560
when to take medicine
is a huge issue

03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:25.220
with understanding
medication labels.

03:45:25.220 --> 03:45:30.170
So these are just a
comment that some

03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:33.220
of the difference the
program has made.

03:45:33.220 --> 03:45:35.170
Lot of people didn't understand

03:45:35.170 --> 03:45:37.270
about not storing your
medication in the bath room.

03:45:37.270 --> 03:45:39.600
That's a really convenient
place for most of us to store it

03:45:39.600 --> 03:45:42.630
but really not a good place
at all for so many reasons.

03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:48.570
We had another story of participant
who just happened to be going

03:45:48.570 --> 03:45:52.400
to the-- her doctor and
the pharmacist the next day

03:45:52.400 --> 03:45:56.340
after her workshop and felt very
empowered be able to ask questions

03:45:56.340 --> 03:45:59.030
and felt in a much
better place in terms

03:45:59.030 --> 03:46:03.090
of understanding what she
needed to know in order

03:46:03.090 --> 03:46:06.500
to correctly take her medicine.

03:46:06.500 --> 03:46:11.280
And then lastly one
of the things about--

03:46:11.280 --> 03:46:14.880
as I mentioned we spent a lot of
time on just raising the awareness

03:46:14.880 --> 03:46:16.710
in our state about health literacy.

03:46:16.710 --> 03:46:21.520
A lot of small implementation
projects like this.

03:46:21.520 --> 03:46:28.470
And these projects, have
allowed us to expand.

03:46:28.470 --> 03:46:30.400
So we start out with
these pilot projects.

03:46:30.400 --> 03:46:34.070
And this medication
one in particular was--

03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:38.890
we applied to Wisconsin Medical
Society Foundation and they end

03:46:38.890 --> 03:46:41.400
up funding all the counties
that the insurance company

03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:44.110
that funded the original
project wasn't able to fund.

03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:46.740
They were outside of their
service area and so we're able

03:46:46.740 --> 03:46:49.190
to do this project and
get statewide coverage.

03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:52.790
The same medical society
asks to apply again

03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:55.290
for more funding this
year to continue it

03:46:55.290 --> 03:46:58.760
because they were very
happy with the project

03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:01.270
and the impact that
they were seeing.

03:47:01.270 --> 03:47:05.300
We got funding from our
Department of Health Services then

03:47:05.300 --> 03:47:08.600
to expand this medication
workshop to refugee populations,

03:47:08.600 --> 03:47:12.440
which is we're learning was
just a whole another challenge

03:47:12.440 --> 03:47:15.140
in a different audience in
terms of the language barrier,

03:47:15.140 --> 03:47:18.840
in terms of the cultural
barriers and being so new

03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:20.570
in understanding our
health care system.

03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:25.120
So we're-- in that project right
now, it's a two-year project

03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:27.390
and we're about halfway
through our first year

03:47:27.390 --> 03:47:30.950
and learning a lot with
the refugee groups.

03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:35.220
And then Wisconsin Health Literacy
is also, starting a second phase

03:47:35.220 --> 03:47:38.310
of a project where
all this information

03:47:38.310 --> 03:47:41.900
on these medication workshops has
helped us to develop a white paper.

03:47:41.900 --> 03:47:43.320
And I have some at
the back of the room.

03:47:43.320 --> 03:47:45.670
I have another one here,
if you haven't seen it.

03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:49.960
But we are trying to adapt an
easy-to-read medication label

03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:51.390
in the State of Wisconsin.

03:47:51.390 --> 03:47:55.510
And the US Pharmacopeia in
2013 put out new standards

03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:58.080
for what a medication
label should look like.

03:47:58.080 --> 03:47:59.510
Right now the biggest thing

03:47:59.510 --> 03:48:04.060
on that small little piece are
real estate is the pharmacist logo.

03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:08.490
And so that's a bit of our
problem as well how the wording

03:48:08.490 --> 03:48:11.370
for the label and for the
direction is mentioned.

03:48:11.370 --> 03:48:15.090
So we're working on
this project right now.

03:48:15.090 --> 03:48:17.730
And the second phase we
have three pharmacy networks

03:48:17.730 --> 03:48:21.780
that are actually implementing a
new prototype label we're designing

03:48:21.780 --> 03:48:24.230
and we're going to be
able to measure how

03:48:24.230 --> 03:48:28.260
through health insurance network,

03:48:28.260 --> 03:48:30.270
how these patients do
with the new label.

03:48:30.270 --> 03:48:32.760
So exciting work.

03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:37.230
I wanted to thank Nemours for
having us here and for the Center

03:48:37.230 --> 03:48:39.820
for the Book, for John and Julian
[assumed spelling] all your work,

03:48:39.820 --> 03:48:42.730
as well as pro-literacy
for inviting me to speak.

03:48:42.730 --> 03:48:44.530
So thank you very much.

03:48:44.530 --> 03:48:48.260
[ Applause ]

03:48:48.260 --> 03:48:49.560
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Thank you.

03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:50.860
That's a great panel.

03:48:50.860 --> 03:48:54.380 position:56%
And I want to-- you know, John asked
me to trying to keep us on time.

03:48:54.380 --> 03:48:56.420
We're little behind starting.

03:48:56.420 --> 03:48:59.960
I do want to give you all an
opportunity to ask your question.

03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:01.570
I have a few I could ask.

03:49:01.570 --> 03:49:04.610
But I feel like this opportunity
for you to get your question.

03:49:04.610 --> 03:49:07.180
And so in the few minutes
that we have left,

03:49:07.180 --> 03:49:08.700
I throw it up into the floor,

03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:11.520
any questions for any
member of our panel?

03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:12.820
Yes?

03:49:12.820 --> 03:49:17.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm [inaudible] with pediatrician
and medical editor at [inaudible].

03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:22.170 position:56%
And we produce thousands of articles
[inaudible] instructions and,

03:49:22.170 --> 03:49:25.680
obviously, literacy, they need
to focus for us because all

03:49:25.680 --> 03:49:29.490
over [inaudible] the adults.

03:49:29.490 --> 03:49:34.580
So I'm wondering how across
the board of a large library

03:49:34.580 --> 03:49:37.840 position:56%
to ensure consistency with literacy.

03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:42.200
A lot of the tools [inaudible]
different literacy tools are not

03:49:42.200 --> 03:49:48.990
applicable to medical terminology
and have some of the patient.

03:49:48.990 --> 03:49:52.220
So I was wondering
how you manage that.

03:49:52.220 --> 03:49:55.530
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: Not
as well as it'd like.

03:49:55.530 --> 03:49:59.740
The-- By the way her
question is very good one.

03:49:59.740 --> 03:50:05.750
The question was the
diagnostics, OK, that you can use

03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:14.630
to help you assess, OK, the
grade level, OK, of various types

03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:19.290
of efforts to try to explain
health and medicine to the public.

03:50:19.290 --> 03:50:22.850
Most of the diagnostic
tools are not designed

03:50:22.850 --> 03:50:25.160
with health and medicine in mind.

03:50:25.160 --> 03:50:28.380
So as soon as you have the
word in there like pediatrics.

03:50:28.380 --> 03:50:33.310
Immediately-- you're at the college
level, OK, and it completely skews

03:50:33.310 --> 03:50:37.080
of all those diagnostic
tools as you know, OK.

03:50:37.080 --> 03:50:40.910
And we have never come
up, OK, with a--

03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:43.480
what I consider to be
a good substitute, OK.

03:50:43.480 --> 03:50:45.530 position:56%
There is a private firm in this area

03:50:45.530 --> 03:50:49.370
that does sell software
that they allege, OK.

03:50:49.370 --> 03:50:52.520 position:56%
It enables you to get a good reading

03:50:52.520 --> 03:50:55.650
that is not thrown
off by medical terms.

03:50:55.650 --> 03:50:59.570
So I'm giving you technical
answer because unfortunately we--

03:50:59.570 --> 03:51:02.860
I don't have a good solution for
you other than the private firm

03:51:02.860 --> 03:51:05.250
that sells software, the name
of the company is called,

03:51:05.250 --> 03:51:07.250
Health Literacy Innovations.

03:51:07.250 --> 03:51:11.940
No, we do not use that in our
own work for variety of reasons.

03:51:11.940 --> 03:51:13.240
On the other hand though--

03:51:13.240 --> 03:51:16.560
and I'm going to give
you a direct answer, OK.

03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:19.350
I distribute Strunk &amp; White,
"The Elements of Style"

03:51:19.350 --> 03:51:21.750
that everyone I worked with, OK.

03:51:21.750 --> 03:51:27.230
And I make sure that whenever I
edit or whenever anybody else is

03:51:27.230 --> 03:51:31.000
in a senior editorial position,
I make absolutely sure that

03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:32.860
"The Elements of Style"
is foundational

03:51:32.860 --> 03:51:34.970
to what everybody does, OK.

03:51:34.970 --> 03:51:36.270
And I'm not going to go in detail.

03:51:36.270 --> 03:51:38.390
Those of you who never
seen that book,

03:51:38.390 --> 03:51:42.740
that's still the best thing
ever written about how

03:51:42.740 --> 03:51:44.210
to write in plain English.

03:51:44.210 --> 03:51:49.190
But still we got ways
to go and I think--

03:51:49.190 --> 03:51:51.770
I wish we had better
diagnostic tools.

03:51:51.770 --> 03:51:53.390
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Yeah Steve.

03:51:53.390 --> 03:51:56.460
&gt;&gt; Steve Rush: Yeah, that's really
great question and it's something

03:51:56.460 --> 03:52:00.190
that we need to do for
lots of reasons not only

03:52:00.190 --> 03:52:04.780 position:56%
for patient education but there was
a federal district court stipulation

03:52:04.780 --> 03:52:09.540
that came out of Louisiana that
said, "If you're going to deny care

03:52:09.540 --> 03:52:11.840
to somebody, you have
to do it in ways

03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:15.860
that people could understand
it," which is really very good.

03:52:15.860 --> 03:52:19.720 position:56%
One of the things that we have to do
and we've been training our people

03:52:19.720 --> 03:52:24.260
to do is that if you're going
to use a term like pediatrician.

03:52:24.260 --> 03:52:28.530
Maybe you put in parenthesis
a doctor for children.

03:52:28.530 --> 03:52:32.890
And then you could use the
term pediatrician again.

03:52:32.890 --> 03:52:37.390
And part of it is to in the
communication is not only

03:52:37.390 --> 03:52:44.530
to make people aware of certain
terms because they're going to have

03:52:44.530 --> 03:52:47.400
to become aware of it
because it's common usage

03:52:47.400 --> 03:52:50.510
within the health care environment.

03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:56.500
So with taking pains to not only
use the term or terms and define it

03:52:56.500 --> 03:53:01.820
but also to make sure that there's
correct flow of information.

03:53:01.820 --> 03:53:09.660
And I'm seeing the, your kids
and teen information website

03:53:09.660 --> 03:53:15.500
which I think is absolutely
tremendous and gives the term,

03:53:15.500 --> 03:53:18.500
the definition and the usage of it.

03:53:18.500 --> 03:53:22.360 position:56%
But it's very difficult particularly
when states are saying you got

03:53:22.360 --> 03:53:24.310
to have a certain reading
grade level

03:53:24.310 --> 03:53:27.610
but it doesn't do anything
for comprehension.

03:53:27.610 --> 03:53:29.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: It just occurred to
me that there's a part of and answer

03:53:29.890 --> 03:53:33.340
that I didn't give that
we should acknowledge, OK.

03:53:33.340 --> 03:53:38.890
I'm so impressed by how improved
natural language processing is, OK.

03:53:38.890 --> 03:53:42.720
I mean we may be talking about a
none issue in several years, OK.

03:53:42.720 --> 03:53:44.020
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Interesting.

03:53:44.020 --> 03:53:45.440
&gt;&gt; Robert Logan: Because
natural language processing is--

03:53:45.440 --> 03:53:48.200
becomes so sophisticated that
it may very well take care

03:53:48.200 --> 03:53:50.250
of this issue by itself, OK.

03:53:50.250 --> 03:53:52.630
I certainly hope so that
would be a nice solution

03:53:52.630 --> 03:53:56.040
but I can't guarantee that.

03:53:56.040 --> 03:53:57.560
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Let's
have one more question

03:53:57.560 --> 03:53:59.710
or two really fast questions.

03:53:59.710 --> 03:54:01.410
Who else has a question?

03:54:01.410 --> 03:54:09.080
Don't be intimidated because
I said the two fast questions.

03:54:09.080 --> 03:54:12.170
Just anybody, any other questions?

03:54:12.170 --> 03:54:14.770
Yes.

03:54:14.770 --> 03:54:20.280
&gt;&gt; Here at library we are
tackling health and literacy here.

03:54:20.280 --> 03:54:27.030
Because Dr. Charles's office heath
services, we started a forum here

03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:29.380
that is on health and wellness.

03:54:29.380 --> 03:54:32.610
And so we've been doing this
for about a year and a half

03:54:32.610 --> 03:54:36.990
and the surprising amount of
staff that actually doesn't know

03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:41.470
but now knows much more
of because of the programs

03:54:41.470 --> 03:54:44.620
that we've been having
here to actually to conquer

03:54:44.620 --> 03:54:47.770
that situation about
health literacy.

03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:50.380
&gt;&gt; Jeff Carter: Well,
I want to close.

03:54:50.380 --> 03:54:52.720
I'm going to just take the
moderator's privilege here to close

03:54:52.720 --> 03:54:54.930
with this one thought, which
is that I'm really glad

03:54:54.930 --> 03:54:57.390
that we have this panel talking
about both health literacy

03:54:57.390 --> 03:54:59.590
and how adult literacy
impacts health.

03:54:59.590 --> 03:55:01.240
The reason I think that's
important because it's a--

03:55:01.240 --> 03:55:05.540
I think it's a good reminder
that, you know, we're all learners

03:55:05.540 --> 03:55:08.880
to one level or another and I think
to the extent that we can identify

03:55:08.880 --> 03:55:13.270
with each other as we learn
about our own health care.

03:55:13.270 --> 03:55:16.200
You know instead of start
of thinking about our--

03:55:16.200 --> 03:55:17.930 position:56%
the folks we serve in adult literacy

03:55:17.930 --> 03:55:19.930
as being these other
group over there.

03:55:19.930 --> 03:55:22.340
I think it kind of brings
us all together as learners

03:55:22.340 --> 03:55:24.700
so I think that's kind
of how the spirit I'd

03:55:24.700 --> 03:55:26.100
like to close out this panel with.

03:55:26.100 --> 03:55:28.100
And I'd like to thank the panel.

03:55:28.100 --> 03:55:30.690
And I'd like to thank you for your
attention and Center for the Book

03:55:30.690 --> 03:55:32.690
and everyone who organize
this thing.

03:55:32.690 --> 03:55:34.400
Thank you very much for having me.

03:55:34.400 --> 03:55:39.460
It's been a great privilege to be
able to work with this group here

03:55:39.460 --> 03:55:41.510
and I look forward to
the rest of discussion.

03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:50.910
[ Applause ]

03:55:50.910 --> 03:55:52.980
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, I'd like to
thank, thank the panel tonight.

03:55:52.980 --> 03:55:57.890
We're going to move right into
the next panel discussion of that

03:55:57.890 --> 03:56:00.800 position:56%
as I said the restrooms are outside.

03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:02.100
You can come in.

03:56:02.100 --> 03:56:03.400
But we're going to keep moving

03:56:03.400 --> 03:56:07.130
because our panel members are here
just for limited period of time.

03:56:07.130 --> 03:56:09.250
I must say I'm very
pleased that the Library

03:56:09.250 --> 03:56:14.640
of Congress health services has
come into this and is joining us.

03:56:14.640 --> 03:56:15.940
It's terrific.

03:56:15.940 --> 03:56:18.600
And I had with one thing
that I've kind of hope

03:56:18.600 --> 03:56:20.670
for but had followed up on.

03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:22.530
It was great to see you.

03:56:22.530 --> 03:56:27.880
Our next panel is going to be on--
we call it after some discussion,

03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:32.010
Business Perspectives
on Literacy and Health.

03:56:32.010 --> 03:56:35.620
And our moderator Nancy Fishman
is going to bring her panel

03:56:35.620 --> 03:56:38.220
up right now and introduce them.

03:56:38.220 --> 03:56:45.060
This is a unique panel
with some people

03:56:45.060 --> 03:56:48.470
that we are very pleased have
taken the time to join us.

03:56:48.470 --> 03:56:53.420 position:56%
I'm going to let Nancy Fishman
introduced them or get them started.

03:56:53.420 --> 03:56:56.610
Nancy is the deputy
director of ReadyNation.

03:56:56.610 --> 03:56:59.900
And I'm also going to have
Nancy tell you about ReadyNation

03:56:59.900 --> 03:57:03.190
and it's importance to
what we are doing here.

03:57:03.190 --> 03:57:06.510
Let's give Nancy a hand
to get everything started.

03:57:06.510 --> 03:57:09.790
[ Applause ]

03:57:09.790 --> 03:57:11.090
There you go.

03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:12.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank
you very much

03:57:12.390 --> 03:57:14.950 position:56%

And yes, I said across
the world earlier.

03:57:37.930 --> 03:57:40.650
We are doing some work
internationally.

03:57:40.650 --> 03:57:44.760
And ReadyNation is very honored
to have had an opportunity

03:57:44.760 --> 03:57:48.120

We are thrilled to be here.

03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:37.510
ReadyNation is part of
Council for Strong America.

03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:40.900
That's our umbrella
organization that in addition

03:58:40.900 --> 03:58:44.660
to bringing the business
perspective to this issue,

03:58:44.660 --> 03:58:48.330
we have a sibling organization
Fight Crime: Invest in Kids

03:58:48.330 --> 03:58:50.970
that brings a law enforcement
perspective.

03:58:50.970 --> 03:58:56.020 position:56%
Their members are district attorneys
and sheriffs and police chiefs.

03:58:56.020 --> 03:58:57.500

A group of 600 retired
admirals and generals

03:59:01.160 --> 03:59:06.780
who find this issue important in
military readiness perspective.

03:59:06.780 --> 03:59:10.670
Shepherding the Next Generation,
group of the Angelical pastors

03:59:10.670 --> 03:59:14.120
who bring families together

03:59:14.120 --> 03:59:18.760
And we have champs, elite athletes,
and coaches to talk about nutrition

03:59:18.760 --> 03:59:23.440
and physical activity and
teamwork as part of these efforts.

03:59:23.440 --> 03:59:26.960
We know that high quality early
childhood programs can lead

03:59:26.960 --> 03:59:30.780 position:56%
to a host of better health outcomes.

03:59:30.780 --> 03:59:33.320
It's for that reason
that we're here today

03:59:33.320 --> 03:59:35.620
to share with you some examples.

03:59:35.620 --> 03:59:38.890
Since we know that reading
proficiency is a predictor

03:59:38.890 --> 03:59:40.330
of overall health.

03:59:40.330 --> 03:59:44.120
We'd like to talk to you how the
business community has gotten

03:59:44.120 --> 03:59:46.730
involved in this subject area.

03:59:46.730 --> 03:59:49.500
We're going to make ours a
little bit more of a panel.

03:59:49.500 --> 03:59:52.830
We're going to address certain
questions to certain panelist,

03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:54.130
give them an opportunity.

03:59:54.130 --> 03:59:57.490
Since we're crowded up here
they may choose to stay seated

03:59:57.490 --> 04:00:01.330
to answer the questions and
we'll leave a few minutes at end

04:00:01.330 --> 04:00:03.530
for some questions from all of you.

04:00:03.530 --> 04:00:06.600
So we're going to start
at the very beginning.

04:00:06.600 --> 04:00:10.840
Mr. Connors, when we spoke earlier,
you mentioned that you had an

04:00:10.840 --> 04:00:13.550
"aha moment" that came
when you first learned

04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:15.840
about early brain development.

04:00:15.840 --> 04:00:17.180
We know that the foundation

04:00:17.180 --> 04:00:21.640 position:56%
of many critical workplace skills
is established in the earliest years

04:00:21.640 --> 04:00:24.290
but what's really happening
then and how does

04:00:24.290 --> 04:00:26.350
that relate to success in school?

04:00:26.350 --> 04:00:27.770
&gt;&gt; Dana Connors: You're
asking me to explain that?

04:00:27.770 --> 04:00:29.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: I am.

04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:30.630
I'm asking you as a
Chamber of President to--

04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:34.530
how about why it matters to
you in your role at a Chamber.

04:00:34.530 --> 04:00:35.970
&gt;&gt; Dana Connors: I didn't tell
you I have to leave the airport

04:00:35.970 --> 04:00:39.380
about five minutes ago just
before you ask that question.

04:00:39.380 --> 04:00:44.420
My "aha moment" was not around
explaining brain to you.

04:00:44.420 --> 04:00:46.150
But I can tell you
exactly what it was.

04:00:46.150 --> 04:00:49.120
It was 2007.

04:00:49.120 --> 04:00:55.810
It was a September day it was
about this time in the afternoon

04:00:55.810 --> 04:00:58.710
and the-- oh, that would help huh?

04:00:58.710 --> 04:01:01.900
And the speaker was a professor

04:01:01.900 --> 04:01:06.860
from Harvard who's
name was Dr. Yoshikawa.

04:01:06.860 --> 04:01:11.450
And I had-- Well, first of all
let me go back to set it up.

04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:14.440
The governor at that time,
Governor Baldacci, asked me to come

04:01:14.440 --> 04:01:19.070
to the Blaine House with probably
a dozen other people to talk

04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:22.690 position:56%
about a conference that he was going
to hold at one of our prime location

04:01:22.690 --> 04:01:24.500
in the state along the coast.

04:01:24.500 --> 04:01:26.920
So I tended because I had
great respect for him,

04:01:26.920 --> 04:01:29.320
we had a great relationship
so I went.

04:01:29.320 --> 04:01:34.200
The subject was early
childhood development.

04:01:34.200 --> 04:01:36.880
And I confess.

04:01:37.970 --> 04:01:41.400
You've heard these words and it's
happened to me more than once,

04:01:41.400 --> 04:01:44.500
you don't know what you don't know.

04:01:44.500 --> 04:01:48.210
Well, I really didn't know what
early childhood development was

04:01:48.210 --> 04:01:51.040
and I probably should not admit
that in front of this group,

04:01:51.040 --> 04:01:55.620
but in truth before that moment
in 2007 I really didn't know.

04:01:55.620 --> 04:01:57.430
I thought it was more like daycare

04:01:57.430 --> 04:02:00.490
and medley there's an aspect
to that but it was much.

04:02:00.490 --> 04:02:04.000
My understanding was
far, far immature

04:02:04.000 --> 04:02:07.080
and not really aware of its value.

04:02:07.080 --> 04:02:08.750
So he asked me.

04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:10.510 position:56%
I went there I listed to discussion.

04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:15.400
I really could reasonably follow
it but wasn't too tuned in.

04:02:15.400 --> 04:02:19.630
Until he said to me, "Dana, I want
you to be the final wrap up speaker

04:02:19.630 --> 04:02:23.770
on Friday," to which
my million thought was,

04:02:23.770 --> 04:02:25.110
"What the devil am I going to say,"

04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:26.540
because I really don't
know the subject matter

04:02:26.540 --> 04:02:29.330
but I respect to the
governor I went.

04:02:29.330 --> 04:02:31.600
I'll make the story short
because I could move--

04:02:31.600 --> 04:02:33.750
I could make it last forever.

04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:36.640
So I go and it's not my
habit to attend conferences

04:02:36.640 --> 04:02:37.940
that last three or four days.

04:02:37.940 --> 04:02:40.640
But in this one I figured I better
go to learn the subject matter

04:02:40.640 --> 04:02:42.880
so I can wrap up the session.

04:02:42.880 --> 04:02:46.040
So this Thursday afternoon it
started Tuesday night I'm speaking

04:02:46.040 --> 04:02:48.500
at Friday noon so far
it hadn't click.

04:02:48.500 --> 04:02:50.740
My "aha moment" hadn't
come and I wasn't so sure

04:02:50.740 --> 04:02:53.650
that it was going to
come, but it did.

04:02:53.650 --> 04:02:56.230
It happened I was sitting
in the conference room,

04:02:56.230 --> 04:03:01.240
the professor was speaking and
when he approach the subject

04:03:01.240 --> 04:03:06.080 position:56%
of the early childhood development
and spoke in terms of the formation,

04:03:06.080 --> 04:03:08.650
the architecture, the
brain development,

04:03:08.650 --> 04:03:14.520
85% occurs in the first three
years, 90% by the fifth year.

04:03:14.520 --> 04:03:21.480
And then he went on both in science
in terms of the number of neurons

04:03:21.480 --> 04:03:25.920
that a young person at
birth has a hundred million,

04:03:25.920 --> 04:03:28.030
a Milky Way as many
stars in the Milky Way,

04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:29.330
I can't remember that term.

04:03:29.330 --> 04:03:33.170 position:56%
And then he went on to explain the
synopsis and how important that was,

04:03:33.170 --> 04:03:37.040
those connectivities and you
reach the peak of those synopsis

04:03:37.040 --> 04:03:41.010
about time of your
85% brain is formed.

04:03:41.010 --> 04:03:43.100
He went into more detail because
he knew a heck of a lot more

04:03:43.100 --> 04:03:45.470
about the issue than I
just expressed to you

04:03:45.470 --> 04:03:47.280
as you could obviously tell.

04:03:47.280 --> 04:03:51.860
But I was so struck by it
because he went on to explain

04:03:51.860 --> 04:03:56.040
that those three years much
like a house when you build is

04:03:56.040 --> 04:03:59.730
that you start with the
foundation, you frame in the house,

04:03:59.730 --> 04:04:01.580
you do your electrical system,

04:04:01.580 --> 04:04:04.510
the circuit is really
what he was talking about.

04:04:04.510 --> 04:04:08.270 position:56%
He went on to explain it becomes the
foundation for your intellectual,

04:04:08.270 --> 04:04:11.870
your moral, your emotional,
your physical,

04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:15.660
your health, your psychological.

04:04:15.660 --> 04:04:18.550
And I remember saying, out
loud, to the person next

04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:21.300
to me heard, oh my God, I get it.

04:04:21.300 --> 04:04:23.550 position:56%
I know exactly what I needed to say.

04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:28.910
And the guy next to who was a
Maine senator, not a US senator

04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:33.000
but represent us the ledger said
to me, "What'd you say that for?"

04:04:33.000 --> 04:04:35.860
So I explained his name was
Richard, "I said Richard,

04:04:35.860 --> 04:04:37.410
didn't you just get that?"

04:04:37.410 --> 04:04:39.220
And I went on explaining
why I felt that way

04:04:39.220 --> 04:04:42.390 position:56%
and he said, "Dana, you're so wrong.

04:04:42.390 --> 04:04:44.610
That's parent's responsibility."

04:04:44.610 --> 04:04:50.410
At that moment I realize part of
the debate and as time has gone

04:04:50.410 --> 04:04:53.360
on it's-- I've come
to really realize

04:04:53.360 --> 04:04:57.210 position:56%
as I've heard the speaker sand may
I say, very inspirational day today.

04:04:57.210 --> 04:05:00.530
I'm grateful that I had the
opportunity to get here early

04:05:00.530 --> 04:05:04.740
because it was very heart
warming but also informative.

04:05:04.740 --> 04:05:08.020
I've come to know that it's
not about one or the other.

04:05:08.020 --> 04:05:09.790
It's clearly about both of us.

04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:13.500
It's a community concept
but we ignore it.

04:05:13.500 --> 04:05:17.890
We have ignored it for so long
that we start with K to 12

04:05:17.890 --> 04:05:19.810
and then expect by the fourth
grade we're going to be

04:05:19.810 --> 04:05:21.780
at the national standard
on reading and Math

04:05:21.780 --> 04:05:24.930
and you really investing too
little at the early stages

04:05:24.930 --> 04:05:28.750
and expecting too much
in such a short time.

04:05:28.750 --> 04:05:32.170
So to me it became almost
everything that I do and work

04:05:32.170 --> 04:05:36.330 position:56%
for whether it's growing the economy
whether it's dealing with skill

04:05:36.330 --> 04:05:38.930
in the workplace, whether
it's productivity,

04:05:38.930 --> 04:05:43.700
whether it's helping a kid, a young
person achieve through aspirations,

04:05:43.700 --> 04:05:46.070
through educational
attainment that lowers crime,

04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:51.450
it lowers remedial
education, special ed.

04:05:51.450 --> 04:05:54.100
Productivity is up, oh my God.

04:05:54.100 --> 04:05:56.860
That became the "Aha moment".

04:05:56.860 --> 04:05:59.120
And to me it was so significant.

04:05:59.120 --> 04:06:02.180
I can-- and later on if I'm
asked the question and even

04:06:02.180 --> 04:06:06.850
if I'm not I may go there just as
I did on this one is that to share

04:06:06.850 --> 04:06:08.330
with you what happened since.

04:06:08.330 --> 04:06:12.080
Because I'm really-- it's a
race that has no finish line

04:06:12.080 --> 04:06:16.610
but I'm very encouraged
by what the state is doing

04:06:16.610 --> 04:06:22.260
and what the business community
has stepped up to do since 2007.

04:06:22.260 --> 04:06:24.530
My final comment in this,
that afternoon when I stood

04:06:24.530 --> 04:06:25.840
up I didn't tell you this

04:06:25.840 --> 04:06:28.360
or it wasn't mentioned,
there's no reason to.

04:06:28.360 --> 04:06:31.220
But previous in the President
State Chamber which I've been

04:06:31.220 --> 04:06:33.510
for 20 years I was
Commissioner of Transportation.

04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:35.080
Yeah I know I'm only 30 but I--

04:06:35.080 --> 04:06:40.670
I was Commissioner for 11
years of Transportation.

04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:44.830
And I used to always say,
you know, the foundation

04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:48.850 position:56%
of our economy is our transportation
system moving products,

04:06:48.850 --> 04:06:50.370
people safely and efficiently.

04:06:50.370 --> 04:06:53.580
And it cost a lot to build and
maintain a good transportation

04:06:53.580 --> 04:06:55.350
but it cost a lot more not to.

04:06:55.350 --> 04:06:58.430
You've got to maintain it, you've
got to invest in it or it's going

04:06:58.430 --> 04:07:01.130
to cost you more when
you try to fix it.

04:07:01.130 --> 04:07:02.930
Well that afternoon
that was my message

04:07:02.930 --> 04:07:04.300
but it wasn't transportation,

04:07:04.300 --> 04:07:08.410
it was early childhood
quality care and education.

04:07:08.410 --> 04:07:12.070
It does cost money to do it,
but it cost you a lot more

04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:14.100
if you don't invest in it.

04:07:14.100 --> 04:07:18.090
That was my message then,
that's my message now.

04:07:18.090 --> 04:07:19.390
That's my "aha moment".

04:07:19.390 --> 04:07:20.690
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank you.

04:07:20.690 --> 04:07:24.650
Mr. Robinson, you've just heard
about how the community can benefit

04:07:24.650 --> 04:07:27.110
when we get kids off to
a good start in life.

04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:30.200
We know that your work involves
community and economic development.

04:07:30.200 --> 04:07:34.240
Can you tell us how you think
businesses can get more involved?

04:07:34.240 --> 04:07:35.570
For example, are you just--

04:07:35.570 --> 04:07:38.470
are we just talking about
businesses making donations

04:07:38.470 --> 04:07:40.680
to worthy programs or is it more?

04:07:40.680 --> 04:07:41.980
&gt;&gt; Dominic Robinson: Sure.

04:07:41.980 --> 04:07:44.590
Well thank you for the
opportunity to speak here today.

04:07:44.590 --> 04:07:48.920
Just a little bit of context
for my position up here,

04:07:48.920 --> 04:07:53.010 position:56%
I'm a Vice President for a
Regional Economic Development Agency

04:07:53.010 --> 04:07:57.710
and Chamber of Commerce in Central
Upstate New York based at SYRACUSE.

04:07:57.710 --> 04:08:02.200
And for many years the organization
I represent has operated

04:08:02.200 --> 04:08:05.120
like a traditional chamber of
commerce representing the interest

04:08:05.120 --> 04:08:10.730
of its members and promoting what
was kind of conventionally thought

04:08:10.730 --> 04:08:15.400
to be what was in the best
interest of the regional economy.

04:08:15.400 --> 04:08:18.430
We have kind of headed
evolution and leadership overtime

04:08:18.430 --> 04:08:22.350
which is also included my coming
on board which is really been

04:08:22.350 --> 04:08:27.440
about thinking more broadly around
what economic development means.

04:08:27.440 --> 04:08:31.010
And in the case of my role,
very specifically trying

04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:33.590
to connect the dots
between economic development

04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:35.950
and community development
and community investment,

04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:39.140
and what I really think about our
work is that we're actually trying

04:08:39.140 --> 04:08:44.060
to break apart of a false dichotomy
in our public narrative which is

04:08:44.060 --> 04:08:47.840
that the interest of business
or economic interest are at odds

04:08:47.840 --> 04:08:49.140
with the community interest.

04:08:49.140 --> 04:08:52.230
And I think, you know, much
like what Dana was saying

04:08:52.230 --> 04:08:56.810
that there's profound business
case to be made for investing

04:08:56.810 --> 04:09:00.040
in communities, investing in
children, investing in education.

04:09:00.040 --> 04:09:02.590
And I think that we
need to do a better job

04:09:02.590 --> 04:09:04.860
as a business community
of articulating that.

04:09:04.860 --> 04:09:10.610
And so it's the work we do is
both kind of advocacy-based

04:09:10.610 --> 04:09:13.190
and programming-based
but ultimately is

04:09:13.190 --> 04:09:17.480
about leveraging the self-interest
of our businesses and our region

04:09:17.480 --> 04:09:20.240 position:56%
and is also interest of those we're
trying to drive the regional economy

04:09:20.240 --> 04:09:22.390
in order to make smarter,

04:09:22.390 --> 04:09:24.960
more effective investments
in our community.

04:09:24.960 --> 04:09:26.620
The work we do ranges

04:09:26.620 --> 04:09:29.910
from programmatically we
do workforce development,

04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:32.410 position:56%
we put together workforce
development programs and initiatives

04:09:32.410 --> 04:09:34.370
that connect the needs of
our employers to the un-

04:09:34.370 --> 04:09:37.660 position:56%
and under employed and distant
franchise, members of our community.

04:09:37.660 --> 04:09:41.980
We foster entrepreneurship
in low income neighborhoods,

04:09:41.980 --> 04:09:45.460
we help spur neighborhood
revitalization

04:09:45.460 --> 04:09:51.140
and we ultimately are looking for
ways to advocate and echo policies

04:09:51.140 --> 04:09:54.670
that we think align our
community's business

04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:58.150
and economic interest
with community impact.

04:09:58.150 --> 04:10:01.080
And so, when we think about
the role of business in all

04:10:01.080 --> 04:10:07.140 position:56%
of that there's really a lot of
different ways that that can happen.

04:10:07.140 --> 04:10:10.830
But I think what we're ultimately
talking about is a shift away

04:10:10.830 --> 04:10:14.510
from what many of us might be all
too familiar with which is kind

04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:16.780
of the corporate sponsorship model.

04:10:16.780 --> 04:10:21.320
You carve out a little piece of
your budget and you send some

04:10:21.320 --> 04:10:23.930
of your employees every
year to some, you know,

04:10:23.930 --> 04:10:27.220 position:56%
really bad convention center dinner.

04:10:27.220 --> 04:10:31.130
You get, you know, your
company's name in a program

04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:34.720
and you may be even go and send
some of your employees to go clean

04:10:34.720 --> 04:10:37.050
up a neighborhood for a day.

04:10:37.050 --> 04:10:40.180
I think what we can all
believe in this room is

04:10:40.180 --> 04:10:43.210
that those things are
fundamentally paternalistic.

04:10:43.210 --> 04:10:49.060
They actually disassociate the
business owner and the workers

04:10:49.060 --> 04:10:52.240
and the business with the
community and with the problem.

04:10:52.240 --> 04:10:53.690
It creates an otherness.

04:10:53.690 --> 04:10:57.550
And I think what we're really
trying to do is create a space

04:10:57.550 --> 04:11:00.070
where business owners and
business leaders can come together

04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:02.760
and own some of the
challenges in our community.

04:11:02.760 --> 04:11:04.420
So that really ranges.

04:11:04.420 --> 04:11:06.310
One of the things we're doing

04:11:06.310 --> 04:11:11.120
around workforce development is
simply saying to our employer

04:11:11.120 --> 04:11:12.980
in our region, you
have hiring challenges.

04:11:12.980 --> 04:11:15.280
You have high rates of turnover.

04:11:15.280 --> 04:11:18.860
We have the 23rd poor
city in America and some

04:11:18.860 --> 04:11:20.310
of the highest concentrations

04:11:20.310 --> 04:11:25.250
of poverty among minority
populations in the United States.

04:11:25.250 --> 04:11:27.900
There's a supply and
demand challenge here

04:11:27.900 --> 04:11:29.210
that we can knit together.

04:11:29.210 --> 04:11:34.570
Let's figure out how we meet your
workforce needs and better prepare

04:11:34.570 --> 04:11:37.740
and equip a pipeline
of workers who need it.

04:11:37.740 --> 04:11:41.190
And, you know, we've had great
success piloting programs

04:11:41.190 --> 04:11:44.200
with this philosophy in mind
for the last several years

04:11:44.200 --> 04:11:49.730 position:56%
and I think fundamentally what we're
able to do is get our businesses

04:11:49.730 --> 04:11:53.580
to understand that they can
act in their self-interest and

04:11:53.580 --> 04:11:56.810
yet contribute to solving
the community's challenges.

04:11:56.810 --> 04:12:02.020
So, you know, when we think
about things like early childhood

04:12:02.020 --> 04:12:05.110
or we think about literacy
in general,

04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:08.910
we are doing all kinds of stuff.

04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:13.260
One big effort on behalf of my
organization was contributing

04:12:13.260 --> 04:12:16.690
to a campaign among our
local businesses to invest

04:12:16.690 --> 04:12:20.590
in something called the SYRACUSE
College Promise which is a program

04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:25.630
that allows for any city of
SYRACUSE school district student

04:12:25.630 --> 04:12:28.890
who graduates whose parents
make less than $75,000 a year

04:12:28.890 --> 04:12:30.190
to attend college for free.

04:12:30.190 --> 04:12:33.730
So we've been able to help raise
that money, it's not been--

04:12:33.730 --> 04:12:35.950
it's not our program it's not
our effort we have been able

04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:39.240
to be an organizing force
for our local businesses

04:12:39.240 --> 04:12:42.440
to get them to invest in that.

04:12:42.440 --> 04:12:47.940
We also are starting to jump
on board to advocacy efforts

04:12:47.940 --> 04:12:52.000 position:56%
around early childhood education
investment expanding the facilitated

04:12:52.000 --> 04:12:56.750 position:56%
enrollment program in New York State
for middle and low income workers.

04:12:56.750 --> 04:13:01.030
And what's really powerful about
that is when we get our businesses

04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:06.310
to stand up for that and we get--
and we use our voice for that.

04:13:06.310 --> 04:13:07.940
It's a voice that people
aren't expecting.

04:13:07.940 --> 04:13:11.020
So our, you know, our Republican
State politicians suddenly

04:13:11.020 --> 04:13:12.900
pay attention.

04:13:12.900 --> 04:13:16.540
We're also thinking about how
do we get our employers to think

04:13:16.540 --> 04:13:20.420
about their workforce and
some of the challenges

04:13:20.420 --> 04:13:22.920
that they're facing
at a family level.

04:13:22.920 --> 04:13:26.680
So right now we're actually
just yesterday we partnered

04:13:26.680 --> 04:13:29.340
on a grant application to the
federal Department of Labor

04:13:29.340 --> 04:13:31.610
with out local workforce
development board

04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:35.200
for something called the
Strengthening Working Families

04:13:35.200 --> 04:13:39.400
Initiative in which we would,
you know, be able to have access

04:13:39.400 --> 04:13:41.270
to underwrite workforce
development efforts here

04:13:41.270 --> 04:13:45.830
in our community the kind of
building I said we already did

04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:49.100
but specifically to underwrite
the workforce training efforts

04:13:49.100 --> 04:13:53.020
for parents and children under
the age of 13 who are low income.

04:13:53.020 --> 04:13:56.060
And specifically to address
some of the child care

04:13:56.060 --> 04:13:59.710
and early childhood education
needs of those individuals.

04:13:59.710 --> 04:14:02.360
One thing that we have
written into the grant would be

04:14:02.360 --> 04:14:05.190
that we would actually be able
to place and ombudsman of sorts

04:14:05.190 --> 04:14:09.020 position:56%
or navigator in some of our major
employers, you know, who could go in

04:14:09.020 --> 04:14:12.170
and actually consult
with lower wage workers

04:14:12.170 --> 04:14:15.180
about their child care
options and opportunities

04:14:15.180 --> 04:14:18.190
to better facilitate child
care enrollment or utilization

04:14:18.190 --> 04:14:19.940
of the child care system
especially if they are trying

04:14:19.940 --> 04:14:22.410
to embark upon ongoing
training and education in order

04:14:22.410 --> 04:14:23.810 position:56%
to move their way up a clear ladder.

04:14:23.810 --> 04:14:27.270
So, you know, to do that thought
it requires willing participation

04:14:27.270 --> 04:14:29.650
from our employer partners, we were
talking to our employers asking

04:14:29.650 --> 04:14:32.060
if this is something
that we could do as part

04:14:32.060 --> 04:14:35.070 position:56%
of our an incumbent worker
advancement strategy that, you know,

04:14:35.070 --> 04:14:36.370
we've been working out with them

04:14:36.370 --> 04:14:40.080
and they were open to
it, receptive to it.

04:14:40.080 --> 04:14:44.060
And so I think it's really getting
employers at the end of the day

04:14:44.060 --> 04:14:47.910
to become part of the conversation
and see themselves as part

04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:51.630
of the solution beyond the
obligatory check writing

04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:55.540
and the superficial, you
know kind of engagement.

04:14:55.540 --> 04:14:57.460
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank
you very much.

04:14:57.460 --> 04:15:01.510
Mr. Edwards, you have an amazing
history with the banking community

04:15:01.510 --> 04:15:03.880
so would you talk to
us about some numbers.

04:15:03.880 --> 04:15:07.890 position:56%
What can you tell us about return on
investments made in young children

04:15:07.890 --> 04:15:11.410
and how that might
impact our economy?

04:15:11.410 --> 04:15:12.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards: Thank you Nancy.

04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:16.330
The amazing history
is out there you read

04:15:16.330 --> 04:15:18.980
about it everyday in
the banking world.

04:15:18.980 --> 04:15:24.320
I retired me for most of that
came around, I'll have you know.

04:15:24.320 --> 04:15:30.380
I am one the-- In fact, I am
the only legally declared,

04:15:30.380 --> 04:15:36.810
governor declared, SOB in
the United States today.

04:15:36.810 --> 04:15:42.020
Each state has one, but in my state
it was a supervisor of banking.

04:15:42.020 --> 04:15:44.440
Everywhere else it's bank
commissioner or whatever

04:15:44.440 --> 04:15:46.240
and I was appointed
by two governors,

04:15:46.240 --> 04:15:48.520
two of the said I was an SOB.

04:15:48.520 --> 04:15:53.660
I also found out today
that I'm also learned

04:15:53.660 --> 04:15:56.390 position:56%
that I'm a health care practitioner.

04:15:56.390 --> 04:15:59.740
I didn't fully realize
that but listening

04:15:59.740 --> 04:16:02.650
to the speakers this morning
on the earlier panel I find

04:16:02.650 --> 04:16:06.880
with having six grand
kids I find that I'm--

04:16:06.880 --> 04:16:11.010
you know, often in a health
care provider position.

04:16:11.010 --> 04:16:15.970
It also gives me the perspective
on what these growing kids need.

04:16:15.970 --> 04:16:19.850
The youngest I have is
3 and the oldest is 13,

04:16:19.850 --> 04:16:23.190
adorable children of course.

04:16:23.190 --> 04:16:27.240
But I find too that in the course
of working with them and caring

04:16:27.240 --> 04:16:31.440
with them I find that I'm also--

04:16:31.440 --> 04:16:35.960
well, I'm having some literacy
problems because in the course

04:16:35.960 --> 04:16:41.090
of things my little 5 year old at
breakfast one morning was just--

04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:43.530
we were just finishing
up and I said--

04:16:43.530 --> 04:16:49.670
she said, "Well Papa I'll savor
you-- save this for later."

04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:53.240
And I said, "Well, you don't
have to save it honey."

04:16:53.240 --> 04:16:55.150
I said, you know, "There's
plenty there.

04:16:55.150 --> 04:16:57.250
I'll have more for dinner tonight."

04:16:57.250 --> 04:17:02.390
And she says, "No Papa
I am savoring my food."

04:17:02.390 --> 04:17:05.160
That's a 5 year old.

04:17:05.160 --> 04:17:09.340
They're in preschools and I
now watch them very carefully

04:17:09.340 --> 04:17:13.410
but it is amazing what
they have, you know,

04:17:13.410 --> 04:17:16.820
versus the banking
industry that I came out of.

04:17:16.820 --> 04:17:21.630
The literacy there is, my gosh, you
have to be a Philadelphia lawyer

04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:23.950
to have open a checking
account nowadays.

04:17:23.950 --> 04:17:26.580 position:56%
And then it doesn't do too much good

04:17:26.580 --> 04:17:29.500
and usually it come
out on the short end.

04:17:29.500 --> 04:17:31.280
But anyway, I will
share a few things.

04:17:31.280 --> 04:17:33.680
I was drafted a couple
times in my life.

04:17:33.680 --> 04:17:35.520
Well, I avoided the first draft,

04:17:35.520 --> 04:17:39.960
I signed up for the military
rather than getting drafted.

04:17:39.960 --> 04:17:45.420
But this program here I was
drafted into after I had--

04:17:45.420 --> 04:17:48.510
mostly I had actively retired.

04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:52.790
And it was for the advocacy
of these younger kids

04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:54.560
that we're talking about.

04:17:54.560 --> 04:17:58.370
Anyway, I was brought in by
the law enforcement people.

04:17:58.370 --> 04:18:02.520
My brother was the elected
chair for 20 years in our county

04:18:02.520 --> 04:18:08.190 position:56%
and through the fight crime
program for the law and justice folk

04:18:08.190 --> 04:18:13.860
that have gone out with early
learning messages they-- we--

04:18:13.860 --> 04:18:18.270 position:56%
in our state we evolve in a
business community having sprung off

04:18:18.270 --> 04:18:19.570
of that same concept.

04:18:19.570 --> 04:18:22.640
So we now have three-pronged
approach,

04:18:22.640 --> 04:18:28.140
we have the retired military
that Nancy talked about earlier,

04:18:28.140 --> 04:18:30.090
and we have the business community

04:18:30.090 --> 04:18:34.720 position:56%
and then we have the law enforcement
including the prosecuting attorneys.

04:18:34.720 --> 04:18:38.990 position:56%
All three have already taken off and
done extremely well and the messages

04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:43.660
that are able to deliver have been
very well received everywhere we go

04:18:43.660 --> 04:18:45.250
as you can imagine.

04:18:45.250 --> 04:18:49.350
The problem is most of our-- well,
a lot of our parents aren't aware

04:18:49.350 --> 04:18:56.820 position:56%
of the fact that they need the pre-K
education quality and they have--

04:18:56.820 --> 04:18:58.120
that's the first problem.

04:18:58.120 --> 04:19:01.480
So we have a message to
deliver to the parents as well

04:19:01.480 --> 04:19:04.180
as elsewhere in the legislators.

04:19:04.180 --> 04:19:11.580
And it's often the case that our
investments go to the way say side

04:19:11.580 --> 04:19:14.920
because we're not in
early enough on our own.

04:19:14.920 --> 04:19:16.940
If you don't get these kids early

04:19:16.940 --> 04:19:19.840
into the program you're
missing a terrific opportunity

04:19:19.840 --> 04:19:22.640
because of that, as
I learned as well

04:19:22.640 --> 04:19:27.400
about early brain growth is
something you can't reverse

04:19:27.400 --> 04:19:29.000
and come back on.

04:19:29.000 --> 04:19:30.900
So it's really important
to get them.

04:19:30.900 --> 04:19:34.870
When I'm in the legislative
body asking for some funding

04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:39.740
for our state programs we have a
state program called e-cap program,

04:19:39.740 --> 04:19:43.770
early education and
assistance program.

04:19:43.770 --> 04:19:47.380
And until last year where
it was not very well funded,

04:19:47.380 --> 04:19:51.020
our state is having a difficulty
as you can imagine as a lot

04:19:51.020 --> 04:19:54.650
of states are on the
K through 12 programs.

04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:58.110
In fact, we just had a State
Supreme Court Decisions come

04:19:58.110 --> 04:20:02.320
down that said there was an
inequality and funding in our state

04:20:02.320 --> 04:20:05.990
because the state was not
meeting its basic obligation

04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:08.780
across the board and a
lot of the dependency

04:20:08.780 --> 04:20:12.730
for education was following
on local levies.

04:20:12.730 --> 04:20:15.610
And so that would take
disadvantaged communities,

04:20:15.610 --> 04:20:20.000 position:56%
lower income communities they were--
they can't just spring forward and,

04:20:20.000 --> 04:20:22.790
you know, do the levy action
to bring it up to speed.

04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:27.370
So, a long story short we're still
in the legislative sessions trying

04:20:27.370 --> 04:20:34.870 position:56%
to resolve that issue which is about
a $1.2 billion additional burden

04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:37.300
for that education
program to bring it

04:20:37.300 --> 04:20:39.720
up correctly where it needs to be.

04:20:39.720 --> 04:20:43.160
So you can well imagine
is a business community I

04:20:43.160 --> 04:20:45.300
and others we brought
in to the program

04:20:45.300 --> 04:20:47.610
as we go before the legislator.

04:20:47.610 --> 04:20:49.140
You know, we're very well received.

04:20:49.140 --> 04:20:52.220
I've been in the legislative
bodies for a long time

04:20:52.220 --> 04:20:56.250
and not always well received and
I was an SOB for a good reason

04:20:56.250 --> 04:20:58.230
on many of those occasions.

04:20:58.230 --> 04:21:01.360
But when I appear up there with
a message for the legislators

04:21:01.360 --> 04:21:05.770
on the need to fund this
pre-K and the state program,

04:21:05.770 --> 04:21:09.670
I can tell you I'm--
It's a fun thing to do.

04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:13.750 position:56%
You get up there and the legislators
are actually anxious to hear

04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:15.460
from you, they're anxious
to hear the message.

04:21:15.460 --> 04:21:19.030
It's a bipartisan acceptance and--

04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:24.250
not this year's session but the
years before for biannual period.

04:21:24.250 --> 04:21:29.240
We were actually in our state able
to get $160 million to the program

04:21:29.240 --> 04:21:31.280
that we hadn't really had before.

04:21:31.280 --> 04:21:35.000
So that was a major step up
on the part of the legislator.

04:21:35.000 --> 04:21:37.570
I'm having a hard time this
year getting them to follow

04:21:37.570 --> 04:21:39.810
with that good record
but sooner or later

04:21:39.810 --> 04:21:42.090
if we don't get it this
year we'll get it next.

04:21:42.090 --> 04:21:44.820
And that's one of the things
that we find too is you have

04:21:44.820 --> 04:21:46.380
to be steady in your course.

04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:48.680
You have to be steady
in your message

04:21:48.680 --> 04:21:54.580 position:56%
and now fortunately we have some 130
business people throughout our state

04:21:54.580 --> 04:21:58.340
that are carrying forth the
message not only in the communities

04:21:58.340 --> 04:22:02.830
that they're in but into the
legislature when we call on them.

04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:05.930
So it's me and these other
folks, community leaders

04:22:05.930 --> 04:22:08.220
that are going before the
legislator and face it.

04:22:08.220 --> 04:22:11.990
You know, their business,
their known, they get there,

04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:13.330
these people are in office

04:22:13.330 --> 04:22:16.860
because somebody supported them
usually it's the ones that we have

04:22:16.860 --> 04:22:19.410
in the cavalry of our group.

04:22:19.410 --> 04:22:23.860
And so we do get a real good
hearing and get a good reaction.

04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:27.430
But I can tell you that it's
very severe and I know it is

04:22:27.430 --> 04:22:31.320
in other states as well is to get
the funding for these programs.

04:22:31.320 --> 04:22:33.320
And it's just desperate.

04:22:33.320 --> 04:22:40.050
But early learning as you've heard
earlier starts at a very early age.

04:22:40.050 --> 04:22:43.260
We get a return on investment
when we start them off and that

04:22:43.260 --> 04:22:48.760
in our state we've got a pretty
well plan down to 4 to 1 ratio

04:22:48.760 --> 04:22:53.120
that we get $4 back for every
dollar that we've invested.

04:22:53.120 --> 04:22:59.400
And it keeps from repetitive
needs for going

04:22:59.400 --> 04:23:03.140
into additional years of education.

04:23:03.140 --> 04:23:09.660
We actually had about 2000 people--
2000 of our little people that had

04:23:09.660 --> 04:23:13.620
to go back and to remediation
back in from the kindergarten.

04:23:13.620 --> 04:23:19.210
So the kindergarten program is
impacted in our state to have tune

04:23:19.210 --> 04:23:27.190 position:56%
of about 5700 student-- per
student or 10 million in reeducating

04:23:27.190 --> 04:23:29.850
and retaking those
people through the--

04:23:29.850 --> 04:23:34.920 position:56%
young people through the course for
another year is a $10 million issue.

04:23:34.920 --> 04:23:38.010
So we use that kind of example.

04:23:38.010 --> 04:23:42.120
You know, it pay us now, or it
pay us greater amount later.

04:23:42.120 --> 04:23:45.700
And so really when I was in
asking for $10 million, you know,

04:23:45.700 --> 04:23:49.040
the message I was giving to
the legislators was, you know,

04:23:49.040 --> 04:23:51.250
this really isn't new money.

04:23:51.250 --> 04:23:54.640 position:56%
I mean, if we don't come up with the
10 million you're going to spend it

04:23:54.640 --> 04:23:57.330
on remediation the next year.

04:23:57.330 --> 04:24:01.000
And we know that about 44%
of our little youngsters come

04:24:01.000 --> 04:24:05.720
in that haven't had the advantage
of early education aren't really

04:24:05.720 --> 04:24:11.360
up to speed by any means to
go on into the K through 12

04:24:11.360 --> 04:24:14.680
and they fall behind
and the result are poor.

04:24:14.680 --> 04:24:17.480
And I guess we could go on
with the stats for that forever

04:24:17.480 --> 04:24:20.270
but we've only got a short
time today but I will tell you

04:24:20.270 --> 04:24:24.420
that it's known through studies
so it's valid, it's there

04:24:24.420 --> 04:24:27.880
and we bring the message,
the legislators listen.

04:24:27.880 --> 04:24:30.550
So we get-- when I come in and ask

04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:33.140
for the $10 million even though
I didn't get it this year,

04:24:33.140 --> 04:24:35.250
we'll get it next year.

04:24:35.250 --> 04:24:38.160
It's really money that it's
going to be spent anyway

04:24:38.160 --> 04:24:41.860
and it's a lot smarter
way to spend the money.

04:24:41.860 --> 04:24:44.930
And it's just been fun.

04:24:44.930 --> 04:24:50.730
It's been a neat experience now as
I've retired from my banking career

04:24:50.730 --> 04:24:54.310
to come into this endeavor
especially being the grandfather

04:24:54.310 --> 04:24:57.280
of six growing smart kids.

04:24:57.280 --> 04:24:59.300
Thank you.

04:24:59.300 --> 04:25:01.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank
you very much.

04:25:01.270 --> 04:25:03.430
Ms. Baicker, Scholastic
is interested

04:25:03.430 --> 04:25:06.630
in innovative educational
partnerships with the focus

04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:09.480
on corporate social responsibility.

04:25:09.480 --> 04:25:13.270
Can you explain how your community
partnerships promote literacy

04:25:13.270 --> 04:25:14.710
and health?

04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:17.750
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: Yes,
thank you Nancy.

04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:22.060
It's a pleasure to be here today at
this symposium and on this panel,

04:25:22.060 --> 04:25:25.780
so I want to thank the Library of
Congress, the Center for the Book

04:25:25.780 --> 04:25:30.230
and ReadyNation for bringing
together this group of partners.

04:25:30.230 --> 04:25:35.980
I arrived yesterday and I didn't
know anybody and thanks to the,

04:25:35.980 --> 04:25:40.890 position:56%
you know, good will and relationship
of Scholastic with great partners

04:25:40.890 --> 04:25:44.540
like Reach Out and Read and
ReadyNation I piggybacked

04:25:44.540 --> 04:25:46.130
on that god will and I've met a lot

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:48.890
of great people and
I've learned a lot.

04:25:48.890 --> 04:25:54.980
And a lot of what I've learned in
the past day and a bit is stuff

04:25:54.980 --> 04:25:59.060
that I think most of us already
had a pretty good idea about--

04:25:59.060 --> 04:26:03.020
I think that very few of us
in the room who didn't know

04:26:03.020 --> 04:26:09.590
that literacy has a great impact on
outcomes on health, on economics,

04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:13.100
and we could-- we might
argue and research

04:26:13.100 --> 04:26:18.000
about whether it's a direct causal
relationship or a marker or,

04:26:18.000 --> 04:26:21.480
you know, how those
relationships work.

04:26:21.480 --> 04:26:26.140
But what seems new in what I'm
hearing today one I'm excited

04:26:26.140 --> 04:26:31.910
about is the increased urgency
across a wide range of specters--

04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:36.600
sectors in collaborating
and integrating our efforts

04:26:36.600 --> 04:26:40.150
and approaching it in
new and innovative ways.

04:26:40.150 --> 04:26:42.870
So that's what I'm
excited about and what I'd

04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:46.070
like to tell you a little bit
about is a little bit of background

04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:51.360
about Scholastic and our business
model what we're looking to do

04:26:51.360 --> 04:26:54.380
and how we're looking to
try to break this cycle

04:26:54.380 --> 04:26:56.220
that we've all been describing.

04:26:56.220 --> 04:27:02.130
Some of the shifts in our model and
then also a couple promising pilots

04:27:02.130 --> 04:27:05.260 position:56%
that we've been doing, so thank you.

04:27:05.260 --> 04:27:10.240
It's interesting and unusual
for me to be on a business panel

04:27:10.240 --> 04:27:16.000 position:56%
because I don't associate Scholastic
very closely with the business.

04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:19.650
And-- Yes.

04:27:19.650 --> 04:27:21.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards:
Probably a good decision.

04:27:21.210 --> 04:27:22.510
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: Yes, well I think

04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:27.010
that we get reminded
that it is at work.

04:27:27.010 --> 04:27:30.360
But the fact is we are very,
very mission driven business

04:27:30.360 --> 04:27:32.390
and that mission is literacy.

04:27:32.390 --> 04:27:36.720
So there is a high correlation
between the work that we all want

04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:39.150
to do here and our business model.

04:27:39.150 --> 04:27:44.250
So, you'd like to ask me at lunch
whether we were for profit or not

04:27:44.250 --> 04:27:50.410
for profit and I-- it's sort
of a nonprofit and I have been

04:27:50.410 --> 04:27:54.830
to be the Director of Community
Affairs which has like privilege

04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:58.230
of corporate social
responsibility without the burden

04:27:58.230 --> 04:28:01.190
of directly like revenue bearing.

04:28:01.190 --> 04:28:03.190
But-- So that's-- I'll
get a little bit more

04:28:03.190 --> 04:28:05.080
into my role in community affairs.

04:28:05.080 --> 04:28:08.920 position:56%
But we are business and a successful
business and this is a great time

04:28:08.920 --> 04:28:13.270
to be in the literacy business
because of the imperative

04:28:13.270 --> 04:28:15.080
that I've just been describing.

04:28:15.080 --> 04:28:21.440
Because we have new tools through
data, new research neuroscience,

04:28:21.440 --> 04:28:24.270
we have all sorts of new
mechanisms to look at

04:28:24.270 --> 04:28:28.430
and education itself
is right for a change

04:28:28.430 --> 04:28:31.160
and the educational
publishing business again needs

04:28:31.160 --> 04:28:32.520
to be part of it.

04:28:32.520 --> 04:28:36.670
So I'm glad to be here
on some business panel.

04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:39.590
A little bit of background
about Scholastic,

04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:42.160
is everyone here pretty
familiar with Scholastic?

04:28:42.160 --> 04:28:45.210
OK. So I won't say much
but, you know, Clifford,

04:28:45.210 --> 04:28:46.830
The Magic School Bus, Harry Potter

04:28:46.830 --> 04:28:53.520
and we also create
educational curriculum material,

04:28:53.520 --> 04:28:56.860
professional training and
other forms of outreach.

04:28:56.860 --> 04:28:59.730
But we're the largest
children's book publisher

04:28:59.730 --> 04:29:02.350
which Robie spoke to earlier.

04:29:02.350 --> 04:29:06.380
So, the mission of
Scholastic-- Scholastic has had,

04:29:06.380 --> 04:29:10.160
I don't know if you know this,
they've had only two owners,

04:29:10.160 --> 04:29:14.540
Maurice Robinson and his son Dick
Robinson have been the only two

04:29:14.540 --> 04:29:19.400
owners in the 90, 95 year
history of Scholastic.

04:29:19.400 --> 04:29:23.740
So, that's unusual sort of family
business perspective right there.

04:29:23.740 --> 04:29:28.010
And it's been the entire
time based on emission

04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:31.640
of teaching all children based
on equity teaching all children

04:29:31.640 --> 04:29:34.190
to learn to read and
to love to read.

04:29:34.190 --> 04:29:38.940
It's heavily focused
on independent reading,

04:29:38.940 --> 04:29:42.290
the joy of reading,
the choice in reading.

04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:44.190
So we are not so much

04:29:44.190 --> 04:29:46.880
in the educational
publishing space the same

04:29:46.880 --> 04:29:50.280
that a BASO program is, but.

04:29:50.280 --> 04:29:55.450
We are in schools and in fact we
have an enormous reach wherein 95%

04:29:55.450 --> 04:29:58.710
of the schools nationwide
in one form or another.

04:29:58.710 --> 04:30:01.080
So that might be our book
fairs that everyone has

04:30:01.080 --> 04:30:07.300
and certainly nostalgic memories
of, or the magazines or books.

04:30:07.300 --> 04:30:12.300
So having that kind of reach
into the school is also

04:30:12.300 --> 04:30:17.110
as I see it an opportunity and
obligation to do something.

04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:23.570
You know, we're there in the ground
in a lot of struggling regions.

04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:26.950
And we have the opportunity to
try to do something more than just

04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:28.980
for books in the hands of kids.

04:30:28.980 --> 04:30:31.120
So that's the other
thing I want to speak

04:30:31.120 --> 04:30:36.180
about briefly Scholastics reach
in terms of access to books.

04:30:36.180 --> 04:30:39.860
So we've long known that this is
critical there're sort of studies

04:30:39.860 --> 04:30:43.570 position:56%
about the number of books in the
home and the correlation to literacy

04:30:43.570 --> 04:30:46.120
and we've done an amazing
job at that

04:30:46.120 --> 04:30:47.860
from the corporate
social responsibility.

04:30:47.860 --> 04:30:51.720
Point of view we've donated more
than 40 million books since 2000

04:30:51.720 --> 04:30:55.170
and we have a family and community
engagement department just focused

04:30:55.170 --> 04:30:59.560 position:56%
on getting books into homes and our
partnership with Reach Out and Read.

04:30:59.560 --> 04:31:02.040
So that something for Scholastic

04:31:02.040 --> 04:31:05.850
and me [inaudible] pretty
feel really good about.

04:31:05.850 --> 04:31:09.640
We have a lot of knowledge about
how children best learn to read

04:31:09.640 --> 04:31:13.060
and that changes a lot and
we've swung with the pendulum

04:31:13.060 --> 04:31:16.390
from whole language to
phonics to, you know,

04:31:16.390 --> 04:31:19.450
and just we keep amassing
a body of knowledge

04:31:19.450 --> 04:31:21.740
and communicating it
better and better.

04:31:21.740 --> 04:31:25.530
And I think we do a pretty good
job in the schools of teaching kids

04:31:25.530 --> 04:31:29.730
to read and helping
teachers teach kids to read.

04:31:29.730 --> 04:31:33.150
Nonetheless we still have
this interacted problem

04:31:33.150 --> 04:31:34.920
that we've all been describing.

04:31:34.920 --> 04:31:38.370
We have not seen reading
scores improved.

04:31:38.370 --> 04:31:43.620
We haven't seen the achievement gap
close, despite not just Scholastic

04:31:43.620 --> 04:31:44.940
but the whole world of education

04:31:44.940 --> 04:31:47.690
and education publishing
and all the efforts.

04:31:47.690 --> 04:31:49.790
We haven't moved the needle much.

04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:55.240
And so the question is with like
the power of our trusted brand

04:31:55.240 --> 04:31:59.350
of Scholastic and Clifford and
the platform that we have and all

04:31:59.350 --> 04:32:01.650
of the schools whether
we're going to do about it,

04:32:01.650 --> 04:32:04.780
you know what's our contribution,
that's part of what I seeing.

04:32:04.780 --> 04:32:08.070
You talked a little bit about not
just writing a check and I feel

04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:09.770
that way also about donating books,

04:32:09.770 --> 04:32:12.350
like I'm very pleased
that we donate books.

04:32:12.350 --> 04:32:19.320
I want us to continue to do that
but it's has to be beyond that.

04:32:19.320 --> 04:32:22.130 position:56%
So in a minute that's going to bring
me to role in community affairs

04:32:22.130 --> 04:32:25.510
and how I'm hoping to
help drive that to be.

04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:30.590
But, first, I just want to
mention a few of the shifts.

04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:32.040
Am I OK, 10 min?

04:32:32.040 --> 04:32:36.540
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: You
can have 30 more seconds.

04:32:36.540 --> 04:32:37.840
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: OK.

04:32:37.840 --> 04:32:39.140
OK. All right.

04:32:39.140 --> 04:32:43.330
Well, the shifts I'm seeing in
the education space at Scholastic

04:32:43.330 --> 04:32:46.440
and in publishing are towards
more towards early childhood

04:32:46.440 --> 04:32:51.620
and by early we mean, early, we
mean from birth and the importance

04:32:51.620 --> 04:32:55.830 position:56%
of talking too and singing too and
playing with your child [inaudible].

04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:59.450
The importance of out to
reach outside the school kids.

04:32:59.450 --> 04:33:05.220
A school age kid is only in
school 20% of the hours that he

04:33:05.220 --> 04:33:07.510
or she is awake over
the course of the year.

04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:11.290
And so what are we doing
in these other channels

04:33:11.290 --> 04:33:19.190
and times toward personalized
towards personalized instruction

04:33:19.190 --> 04:33:22.120
instead of, you know,
someone made the analogy

04:33:22.120 --> 04:33:28.830
that if we treated kids-- or we're
treating kids if someone came

04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:32.970
to the hospital or a doctor and
we treated all of those patients

04:33:32.970 --> 04:33:35.700 position:56%
by saying, "OK, you're all getting
this treatment and you're going to--

04:33:35.700 --> 04:33:37.160
it's going to go on
for this amount of time

04:33:37.160 --> 04:33:38.590
and then we're going
to discharge you.

04:33:38.590 --> 04:33:40.890
That's kind of what we're
doing in the education system.

04:33:40.890 --> 04:33:42.190
We're giving everybody the same.

04:33:42.190 --> 04:33:45.690 position:56%
So there needs to be a trend towards
customization of individuals.

04:33:45.690 --> 04:33:47.780
So I'll stop with the--

04:33:47.780 --> 04:33:49.080
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Sorry.

04:33:49.080 --> 04:33:50.380
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: I'll
stop with the trends.

04:33:50.380 --> 04:33:51.880
You can ask me more about
translator if you'd like to.

04:33:51.880 --> 04:33:55.050
And I'll just really quickly
just describe the pilots

04:33:55.050 --> 04:33:56.760
and that we have going.

04:33:56.760 --> 04:34:01.620
So I guess I'll just talk about
our most exciting pilot to me

04:34:01.620 --> 04:34:03.680
which is called Discover Together.

04:34:03.680 --> 04:34:10.170
And it's a partnership we started
in conjunction with Linda Mayes,

04:34:10.170 --> 04:34:15.720
Dr. Linda Mayes of the Yale Child
Study Center to test the hypothesis

04:34:15.720 --> 04:34:21.080
that we can use literature and
literacy to build resilience

04:34:21.080 --> 04:34:24.510
in struggling communities.

04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:28.720
So we joined forces in rural
Appalachia and piloted a program

04:34:28.720 --> 04:34:30.680
that we've been doing for
the last several years

04:34:30.680 --> 04:34:33.820
that I think has very
exciting potential.

04:34:33.820 --> 04:34:38.680
And what we are doing there
is we're pairing literature

04:34:38.680 --> 04:34:42.370
with very place-based experiences.

04:34:42.370 --> 04:34:46.890
Field trips to sources of local
pride like a worm farm or bakery

04:34:46.890 --> 04:34:49.240
or the railroad or a nature trail.

04:34:49.240 --> 04:34:52.550
Pairing those with literature
and field trips and activities

04:34:52.550 --> 04:34:54.220
and helping the community
come together

04:34:54.220 --> 04:34:58.650
to celebrate their own stories
around the idea of literacy

04:34:58.650 --> 04:35:05.510
and the power of narrative and
what we notice in Grande County is

04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:07.970
that that wasn't the only
thing that they wanted.

04:35:07.970 --> 04:35:09.270
It was helpful.

04:35:09.270 --> 04:35:12.440
But we just began a long process
of listening to the community.

04:35:12.440 --> 04:35:17.810
And so now that program consist of
a family coop, early childhood coop

04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:22.470 position:56%
from zero to five where we bring
pants and use the same of curriculum

04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:26.210
in model reading and work with
the multigenerational approach

04:35:26.210 --> 04:35:27.750
and it just keeps expanding.

04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:32.020
And so that's the other trend I
would highlight is customizing

04:35:32.020 --> 04:35:34.250
to the communities we're serving.

04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:35.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank you.

04:35:35.550 --> 04:35:36.850
I apologies for rushing you.

04:35:36.850 --> 04:35:39.520
I wish we had about
three more hours up here.

04:35:39.520 --> 04:35:43.200
Now I'm going to address
one question to all of you.

04:35:43.200 --> 04:35:47.610
Particularly just tell us how
businesses, business leaders,

04:35:47.610 --> 04:35:50.670
and business groups can
more actively collaborate

04:35:50.670 --> 04:35:53.700
to help more young people
have access to the programs

04:35:53.700 --> 04:35:55.110
that we're talking about.

04:35:55.110 --> 04:35:59.120
And Dana, I know your flight
is first this afternoon.

04:35:59.120 --> 04:36:00.420
So why don't you start?

04:36:00.420 --> 04:36:01.720
You each have about two minutes

04:36:01.720 --> 04:36:04.380
and we'll just work our
way down the line here.

04:36:04.380 --> 04:36:06.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dana Connors: Just about it gives
me time to get to the plane at 4:30.

04:36:06.800 --> 04:36:08.100
So I appreciate.

04:36:08.100 --> 04:36:09.880
I'm very grateful and
please forgive for having

04:36:09.880 --> 04:36:11.830
to rush of the platform here.

04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:14.460
That's why they put me to the side.

04:36:14.460 --> 04:36:16.750
Hopefully I just push me off here.

04:36:16.750 --> 04:36:19.970
The business communities
like I mentioned it earlier,

04:36:19.970 --> 04:36:21.810
I mean I have found in my 20 years

04:36:21.810 --> 04:36:25.670
to get the business community
involved particularly in something

04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:29.640
that begins as a social issue
which most business see this as.

04:36:29.640 --> 04:36:34.000
Is you build awareness
as to what it does

04:36:34.000 --> 04:36:36.620
or why it relates then
in the economy.

04:36:36.620 --> 04:36:38.110
You got to give them some action.

04:36:38.110 --> 04:36:39.510
We can't just talk it to death,

04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:42.140
which is characteristic
of a lot of issues.

04:36:42.140 --> 04:36:44.040
And thirdly, there has
to be accountability.

04:36:44.040 --> 04:36:46.940
And when I can put those
three things together,

04:36:46.940 --> 04:36:50.280
I've got a secret formula.

04:36:50.280 --> 04:36:54.790
And once they started to become
aware and how we became aware is

04:36:54.790 --> 04:36:57.520
that we're very involve
in ReadyNation.

04:36:57.520 --> 04:37:00.160
ReadyNation is a tremendous
resource.

04:37:00.160 --> 04:37:04.390
A lot of our business signed up,
our law enforcement investing kids,

04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:07.940
fight crime, mission readiness
for our military people,

04:37:07.940 --> 04:37:09.240
they're all very engaged.

04:37:09.240 --> 04:37:12.960
That in itself is a community
because there are so many of them

04:37:12.960 --> 04:37:17.190 position:56%
and we have a very passionate person
that represents all three in Maine.

04:37:17.190 --> 04:37:19.540
So she's fantastic.

04:37:19.540 --> 04:37:24.950
We have a group of business
leaders that took upon themselves--

04:37:24.950 --> 04:37:26.900
we did this research
project right here.

04:37:26.900 --> 04:37:29.210
It's called Make a Name Work:

04:37:29.210 --> 04:37:31.440
Critical Investments
for the Main Economy.

04:37:31.440 --> 04:37:34.680
A partnership to the research
empathy very well respected

04:37:34.680 --> 04:37:35.980
research entity.

04:37:35.980 --> 04:37:39.370 position:56%
We put this together it tells-- it's
all about early childhood the facts,

04:37:39.370 --> 04:37:42.220
the facts drive the
solution in instance

04:37:42.220 --> 04:37:44.310
because it's more than emotion.

04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:46.560
It's more than feel
good as much as it is.

04:37:46.560 --> 04:37:49.840
The facts help drive this success.

04:37:49.840 --> 04:37:53.230
That helped bring the
awareness to the forefront.

04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:58.260
This group a business leaders call
themselves main early learning

04:37:58.260 --> 04:38:02.340
investment group mainly
have raise over $10 million.

04:38:02.340 --> 04:38:04.860
That's the check book
that's putting money there.

04:38:04.860 --> 04:38:06.160
But it's not sponsorships.

04:38:06.160 --> 04:38:09.050
They take that and they've
worked with EduCare which most

04:38:09.050 --> 04:38:10.350
of you are familiar with.

04:38:10.350 --> 04:38:11.650
We have one in our state.

04:38:11.650 --> 04:38:13.000
They designate a community.

04:38:13.000 --> 04:38:17.360
They are committing, I think, it's
$4 million to address a number

04:38:17.360 --> 04:38:19.990
of kids with the community
with family.

04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:21.540
The boots are on the ground.

04:38:21.540 --> 04:38:23.000
They're very involved.

04:38:23.000 --> 04:38:25.700
I can't ask for more
than that on any issue.

04:38:25.700 --> 04:38:29.050
And here's an issue that
at first blush they saw

04:38:29.050 --> 04:38:30.610
as social and not economic.

04:38:30.610 --> 04:38:34.100
Now they see as economic
more than social.

04:38:34.100 --> 04:38:37.860
Our challenge is what Mike said
is that we don't have enough money

04:38:37.860 --> 04:38:43.330 position:56%
for K to 12 and higher ed, and we've
got some to the state government

04:38:43.330 --> 04:38:45.140
but it's a race that
has on finish line.

04:38:45.140 --> 04:38:46.440
It is sunk.

04:38:46.440 --> 04:38:48.730
You got to be constantly
persistent about

04:38:48.730 --> 04:38:51.440
and you got to stay on message.

04:38:51.440 --> 04:38:53.810
That's my story and I'm sticking
to it and I appreciate it.

04:38:53.810 --> 04:38:56.740 position:56%
And if sneak out it's only because I
have to make a plane because I have

04:38:56.740 --> 04:38:58.080
to speak at a funeral
tomorrow morning

04:38:58.080 --> 04:38:59.380
and I can't afford to miss it.

04:38:59.380 --> 04:39:01.620
So thank you very much
and thank you.

04:39:01.620 --> 04:39:03.060
&gt;&gt; Dominic Robinson: Thank you.

04:39:03.060 --> 04:39:05.190
[ Applause ]

04:39:05.190 --> 04:39:06.490
&gt;&gt; Karen Baiker: It's OK.

04:39:06.490 --> 04:39:12.080
&gt;&gt; Dominic Robinson: Well, I
think my job got a little easier

04:39:12.080 --> 04:39:15.830
because he stole half the things
I'm about to say, which is great.

04:39:15.830 --> 04:39:18.900
So I guess I would
echo a lot of that.

04:39:18.900 --> 04:39:22.890
I think that one thing I like
to reinforce, repetition,

04:39:22.890 --> 04:39:27.820
is I think for business owners
in particular business leaders,

04:39:27.820 --> 04:39:32.300
engagement in a partnership
that kind of takes them outside

04:39:32.300 --> 04:39:36.780
of their kind of core
mission or core focus.

04:39:36.780 --> 04:39:40.920
In an ideal scenario you
ground that in some form

04:39:40.920 --> 04:39:42.300
of self-interest for them.

04:39:42.300 --> 04:39:44.780
But I don't think that that
is ultimately critical.

04:39:44.780 --> 04:39:47.520
What I do think is critical
is that whatever it is

04:39:47.520 --> 04:39:51.790
that they are being asked to do
is able to result in an outcome.

04:39:51.790 --> 04:39:56.000 position:56%
I think business leaders are much
more prone to be thinking about kind

04:39:56.000 --> 04:39:57.800
of I do this and this happens.

04:39:57.800 --> 04:40:00.410
They want to see you know
kind of cause and effect.

04:40:00.410 --> 04:40:05.320
And I think that too often in
the world of nonprofit in policy

04:40:05.320 --> 04:40:08.610
and in the worlds that most
of us probably operate in,

04:40:08.610 --> 04:40:10.660
we do perhaps get a
little bit too comfortable

04:40:10.660 --> 04:40:13.170
in the conceptual, in the ethereal.

04:40:13.170 --> 04:40:17.020
And I think business leaders
they want to see something.

04:40:17.020 --> 04:40:21.130
There's an instant
gratification that they're seeking.

04:40:21.130 --> 04:40:24.670
The other thing that I
would just kind of bring up

04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:27.700
and I think it's really important
and it certainly speaks to the work

04:40:27.700 --> 04:40:31.990
that I'm doing with my team
is playing the role of broker.

04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:35.320
I think that you-- in order to
build unconventional partnerships

04:40:35.320 --> 04:40:42.270 position:56%
that are advancing mission around
outcomes relative to early childhood

04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:45.470
or health or literacy
and you're trying

04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:48.900
to bring these desperate
partners together.

04:40:48.900 --> 04:40:51.660
You have to recognize the
very different languages

04:40:51.660 --> 04:40:55.470
that a community college will speak
compared to a business compared

04:40:55.470 --> 04:40:59.180
to a social service agency compared
to a governmental organization.

04:40:59.180 --> 04:41:00.480
They have different outcomes.

04:41:00.480 --> 04:41:03.560
They have, in some cases,
very different motivations.

04:41:03.560 --> 04:41:05.740
And they by all means use
different terminology.

04:41:05.740 --> 04:41:08.600
And it's very difficult to put
them in a room and expect them

04:41:08.600 --> 04:41:10.430
to kind of make magic happen.

04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:14.970
So whether that's through some
form of formal facilitation

04:41:14.970 --> 04:41:18.640
or it's just identifying people
in coalition who have that kind

04:41:18.640 --> 04:41:20.970
of translator capacity
or capability.

04:41:20.970 --> 04:41:24.590
I think it's really
insuring that there is kind

04:41:24.590 --> 04:41:29.200
of that brokerage rule embedded
in those types of partnership.

04:41:29.200 --> 04:41:31.250
So I think that that's
really important

04:41:31.250 --> 04:41:36.680
because too often you bring
those different types of partners

04:41:36.680 --> 04:41:40.040
in a room and they're
conceptually on board

04:41:40.040 --> 04:41:44.040
but they really don't have any
way of finding a common language

04:41:44.040 --> 04:41:46.930
or create in commons base.

04:41:46.930 --> 04:41:48.230
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: OK.

04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:49.530
Go ahead.

04:41:49.530 --> 04:41:50.830
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: OK.

04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:52.390
I think in terms of getting
businesses more involved

04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:56.730
in the issues of literacy and
health, one of the first things

04:41:56.730 --> 04:41:59.310
that we need to do
is listen to needs

04:41:59.310 --> 04:42:02.430
of a particular community,
look at the data.

04:42:02.430 --> 04:42:04.800
And before we ask a
business to get involve

04:42:04.800 --> 04:42:08.390
to know exactly what will be most
helpful because they agree with you

04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:11.820
that they are not necessarily
looking

04:42:11.820 --> 04:42:13.930
at ROI in the traditional way.

04:42:13.930 --> 04:42:17.130
They do want to be helpful
and we need to use--

04:42:17.130 --> 04:42:20.520
show them that we're going to use
their resources most effectively.

04:42:20.520 --> 04:42:24.560
I've found in the work that
I'm doing for the research

04:42:24.560 --> 04:42:26.990
and development lab
that the combination

04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:32.050
of having a research institution
like and academic or university,

04:42:32.050 --> 04:42:38.240
a business, and schools, and CBOs
all involve together is the most

04:42:38.240 --> 04:42:43.040
powerful way to have a common
purpose and affect change.

04:42:43.040 --> 04:42:45.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards:
I just add to that.

04:42:45.340 --> 04:42:46.640
Thank you.

04:42:46.640 --> 04:42:50.490
That, you know, really we're in-- I
know this is an energy in the room

04:42:50.490 --> 04:42:56.550 position:56%
because you brought me into more
literacy, hopefully, in your program

04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:58.780
and in your talks earlier today.

04:42:58.780 --> 04:43:02.520
But, you know, health is an
important thing and we view

04:43:02.520 --> 04:43:06.740
at ReadyNation with our
activities of how important it is.

04:43:06.740 --> 04:43:08.480 position:56%
And we include that in our programs,

04:43:08.480 --> 04:43:12.700
we make sure the kids get the
meals the parents understand the

04:43:12.700 --> 04:43:17.790
importance of, and they can't learn
if they're hungry and they can't

04:43:17.790 --> 04:43:19.620
if they don't get that
early development.

04:43:19.620 --> 04:43:21.960
You'll lose them in
the succeeding years

04:43:21.960 --> 04:43:25.810
as they into their K through 12.

04:43:25.810 --> 04:43:32.000 position:56%
So health is a definite play in this
and I think you could be and I'd

04:43:32.000 --> 04:43:35.540
like to solicit your support
going forward and keeping

04:43:35.540 --> 04:43:39.590
in your mind the benefits of
what we hopefully help shed

04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:42.610
on with light the for
you today is the benefits

04:43:42.610 --> 04:43:47.570
of bringing those kids early on,
getting the parents to understand.

04:43:47.570 --> 04:43:50.000
If you think-- If-- You know, if
they're in your office and they're

04:43:50.000 --> 04:43:52.910
in for a medical reason
and they're in discussing--

04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:57.160
just if you can get any kind of
direct or indirect message to them.

04:43:57.160 --> 04:44:01.700 position:56%
The importance of those kids getting
in to an early education program,

04:44:01.700 --> 04:44:04.420
I'll bet you many of our
states I haven't research

04:44:04.420 --> 04:44:07.260
that have an early
education program.

04:44:07.260 --> 04:44:09.650
And if they don't you have
many community members

04:44:09.650 --> 04:44:12.030
that do have an education program.

04:44:12.030 --> 04:44:16.350
And often the church or
a paternal organization

04:44:16.350 --> 04:44:18.790
or somebody that's recognized
it in your community.

04:44:18.790 --> 04:44:23.370
If you can get together with them
and cause us an energy between you

04:44:23.370 --> 04:44:27.440
to go forward for better
health and for early education.

04:44:27.440 --> 04:44:29.810
You know, our research
shows that this is going

04:44:29.810 --> 04:44:32.320
to be one of the-- [inaudible].

04:44:32.320 --> 04:44:37.990
One on the first generations lived
shorter lives than their parent.

04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:39.570
Well, these ones are coming up.

04:44:39.570 --> 04:44:43.430
And a lot of it has to do with
health and a lot of the ability

04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:47.170
to reach good health care
which is very expensive depends

04:44:47.170 --> 04:44:50.460
on good business and early
education of these kids

04:44:50.460 --> 04:44:52.450
and putting them in the workforce.

04:44:52.450 --> 04:44:57.610
We in the business side are looking
for growing our future employees.

04:44:57.610 --> 04:44:58.910
We have a lot of problems.

04:44:58.910 --> 04:45:01.710
I've noticed this in the
industry we have people

04:45:01.710 --> 04:45:04.710
that can't basically
count back cash.

04:45:04.710 --> 04:45:11.480 position:56%
They can't convey in a comprehensive
way their ideas bringing forward.

04:45:11.480 --> 04:45:14.160
You may have people that are
quite bright and do what they do

04:45:14.160 --> 04:45:18.030
but they can't convey their ideas
and their smartness, if you will,

04:45:18.030 --> 04:45:21.360
on because they can't
converse and they're not--

04:45:21.360 --> 04:45:22.800
they're literacy is lacking.

04:45:22.800 --> 04:45:26.070
Starts with education
and good health.

04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:30.070
So being Nancy is up here going
to be evil eye on me pretty soon.

04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:31.940
I'm going to seal it off at that.

04:45:31.940 --> 04:45:35.240
But I would like to recruit each
of you in your own communities,

04:45:35.240 --> 04:45:38.270
in your own way to
impose on the parents

04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:43.380 position:56%
and your community how early this
early education program business is.

04:45:43.380 --> 04:45:44.780
Thanks pretty much.

04:45:44.780 --> 04:45:46.080
&gt;&gt;Nancy Fishman: Thank you.

04:45:46.080 --> 04:45:47.380
I love being the bouncer.

04:45:47.380 --> 04:45:51.660
So a couple ways that you
can get involved and get some

04:45:51.660 --> 04:45:55.590
of these information go to
our website, Readynation.org.

04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:58.870
Sign up to get our
resources and information.

04:45:58.870 --> 04:46:00.870
There's no cost, we
won't sell your name.

04:46:00.870 --> 04:46:02.500
We're not going to have
you come to meetings.

04:46:02.500 --> 04:46:03.930
There's no obligation.

04:46:03.930 --> 04:46:08.020
One of the resources that we have
available on our website is a brief

04:46:08.020 --> 04:46:12.530
that we did for businesses talking
to them about how they can talk

04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:16.320
to their employees and
support their employees

04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:20.350
in high quality really
education opportunities.

04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:22.790
That brief along with
lots of other information

04:46:22.790 --> 04:46:29.510 position:56%
and resources are available there or
just seek Kali-- Kali are yo here?

04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:34.340
Kali or I after the event
today and we can connect you

04:46:34.340 --> 04:46:37.070
with this valuable resources.

04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:41.440
We wanted to leave a minute
and half for questions.

04:46:41.440 --> 04:46:46.240
So if a couple of you have a
quick question about the rules?

04:46:46.240 --> 04:46:50.280
Two fast questions I
believe are allowed.

04:46:50.280 --> 04:46:51.580
&gt;&gt; It's a challenge.

04:46:51.580 --> 04:46:52.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: It is a challenge.

04:46:52.880 --> 04:46:54.180
In the back.

04:46:54.180 --> 04:47:00.960
&gt;&gt; For the first time you just
mentioned quality and I think

04:47:00.960 --> 04:47:02.970
that was missing from
the discussion earlier.

04:47:02.970 --> 04:47:10.290
And I would argue or want you to
give thought to how it's not--

04:47:10.290 --> 04:47:16.050
you talk about how parents want
what best for their children,

04:47:16.050 --> 04:47:21.110 position:56%
but the data shows that parents want
accessible, affordable quality--

04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:25.120
not quality-- accessible and
affordable care for their children

04:47:25.120 --> 04:47:28.150
and so then it's, I think, our
job to bring in the quality

04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:29.450
and make sure that that's a part

04:47:29.450 --> 04:47:31.830
of everything that's
available [inaudible].

04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:33.130
&gt;&gt;Nancy Fishman: And you're right.

04:47:33.130 --> 04:47:35.700
And much of our research
does cite the quality.

04:47:35.700 --> 04:47:38.900
They are familiar with the
quality aspect of what has to be.

04:47:38.900 --> 04:47:40.520 position:56%
And we did not highlight that today.

04:47:40.520 --> 04:47:42.360
It's an important distinction.

04:47:42.360 --> 04:47:45.050
Different states define
quality different ways.

04:47:45.050 --> 04:47:47.820
Some states don't even
define quality.

04:47:47.820 --> 04:47:51.650
All the research shows that the
benefits are greatest for those

04:47:51.650 --> 04:47:55.060
who participate in equality
or high quality program.

04:47:55.060 --> 04:47:56.700 position:56%
And it's those high quality programs

04:47:56.700 --> 04:48:01.270
where parent engagement is an
inherent part of the program

04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:05.000
that we also have an opportunity to
affect two different generations.

04:48:05.000 --> 04:48:06.300
Thank you so much.

04:48:06.300 --> 04:48:07.600
We should have called that earlier.

04:48:07.600 --> 04:48:08.900
I appreciate bringing
that to our attention.

04:48:08.900 --> 04:48:11.470
And do you have a quick
question, sir?

04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:13.620
&gt;&gt; Well, I try to make it quick.

04:48:13.620 --> 04:48:16.760
First of all, excellent
panel, I agree.

04:48:16.760 --> 04:48:19.300 position:56%
I appreciate this every encouraging.

04:48:19.300 --> 04:48:23.580
One of the things that I
found in trying to work

04:48:23.580 --> 04:48:26.970
to support various educational
programs at least dealing

04:48:26.970 --> 04:48:28.950
with governmental bodies.

04:48:28.950 --> 04:48:34.820
The state legislators are concerned
that if they invest in education.

04:48:34.820 --> 04:48:36.940
They say that we don't know

04:48:36.940 --> 04:48:39.640
that these young people will
be here 10 years from now.

04:48:39.640 --> 04:48:43.970 position:56%
Why should we be training young
people who will end up in California

04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:46.100
or in New Jersey et cetera?

04:48:46.100 --> 04:48:51.790
So my question is have you come in
contact with that kind of sentiment

04:48:51.790 --> 04:48:55.550
and how do you counter it and
part of my question also is

04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:58.990
with the Chamber of Commerce do you
interact with the National Chamber

04:48:58.990 --> 04:49:01.360
of Commerce so they could
really help get that message

04:49:01.360 --> 04:49:02.910
to our members of congress as well?

04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:05.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards: Now let me just
share with you quickly the message

04:49:05.590 --> 04:49:07.970
that I try to give
to our legislators.

04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:11.860
If we don't educate the kids
and start them off early,

04:49:11.860 --> 04:49:14.100
we're going to be lacking
in our workforce.

04:49:14.100 --> 04:49:16.640
And we're already lacking
in our workforce.

04:49:16.640 --> 04:49:18.950
Seattle as you know is
a high tech community.

04:49:18.950 --> 04:49:26.030
We got Microsoft, Amazon,
Expedia, you name it.

04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:30.650
But the fastest answer to that
question when I get to ask is

04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:34.990
if we don't educate them and give
them an early opportunity we will

04:49:34.990 --> 04:49:38.240
continue to import people from
outside of the United States

04:49:38.240 --> 04:49:40.450
to fill those critical positions.

04:49:40.450 --> 04:49:43.410
And it isn't only the
real high tech community.

04:49:43.410 --> 04:49:45.840
It's other things of
manufacturing just

04:49:45.840 --> 04:49:50.520
like we had the solar power became
an issue in our state where--

04:49:50.520 --> 04:49:53.030
in our nation where we
need to have an increased.

04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:56.550
And a lot of our linemen, and
power people that are out there

04:49:56.550 --> 04:49:59.690
in our infrastructure
getting the retirement age,

04:49:59.690 --> 04:50:03.540
we can't even find people
that are trained well enough,

04:50:03.540 --> 04:50:06.670
for school well enough coming
out of our school system

04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:10.430
to put those people into those
programs to make it happen.

04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:13.430
So, if you want to retain
your intellectual power

04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:17.630
and your brain powers and your
resources start them early.

04:50:17.630 --> 04:50:19.060
It's like growing a garden.

04:50:19.060 --> 04:50:21.290
You put the seed in the
ground and you culture it

04:50:21.290 --> 04:50:22.680
and take care of it all the way.

04:50:22.680 --> 04:50:24.510
And if you don't some-- yeah,

04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:27.800
in some ways it's a long range
program that you're looking at.

04:50:27.800 --> 04:50:30.370
But if you don't do
it, you'll end up short

04:50:30.370 --> 04:50:32.190
and you'll have to import them.

04:50:32.190 --> 04:50:33.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: You want
to close us out here Dominic?

04:50:33.630 --> 04:50:35.920
&gt;&gt; Dominic Robinson: Sure
just one quick into that

04:50:35.920 --> 04:50:37.930
and then I also put the chamber.

04:50:37.930 --> 04:50:42.270
I would say that the other
argument relative to, you know,

04:50:42.270 --> 04:50:43.610
why would we invest in these folks

04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:45.290
when we don't know we're
going to able retain them.

04:50:45.290 --> 04:50:50.510
Statistically speaking, you
know, yes, there's always kind

04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:51.900
of churn in the population.

04:50:51.900 --> 04:50:55.590
But the majority of the
population is raised

04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:57.600
in a geography does
in fact stay there.

04:50:57.600 --> 04:50:59.660
So I think you can also
just point to the statistics

04:50:59.660 --> 04:51:03.560
that in fact more often
than not that's a good bet.

04:51:03.560 --> 04:51:05.130
And I would agree with
everything you else--

04:51:05.130 --> 04:51:08.580
you said that, I think that your
question around, for example,

04:51:08.580 --> 04:51:10.220
our relationship to the
US Chamber of Commerce

04:51:10.220 --> 04:51:12.510
or other national chamber
type organizations.

04:51:12.510 --> 04:51:16.750
It's an important question because
we often associate chamber voice,

04:51:16.750 --> 04:51:19.810
especially nationally, with a
voice that isn't always hospitable

04:51:19.810 --> 04:51:21.810
to these types of conversations.

04:51:21.810 --> 04:51:26.720
I think that it's a
slowly changing dynamic.

04:51:26.720 --> 04:51:29.220
But I do think that there's
at least a greater awareness

04:51:29.220 --> 04:51:32.390
that these things cannot
be disconnected forever.

04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:39.780
I was invited to, but was not able
to attend an event here in DC.

04:51:39.780 --> 04:51:45.130
I think in the fall that
was a co-sponsored event

04:51:45.130 --> 04:51:50.460
between the US chamber and NAACP,
I believed, kind of talking

04:51:50.460 --> 04:51:53.070
about where their organizational
interest might align.

04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:56.290
And I thought that was a
really encouraging sign.

04:51:56.290 --> 04:52:01.480
So I think that the reality is
that we often feel like outliers

04:52:01.480 --> 04:52:03.310
within a broader kind
of chamber conversation

04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:06.490
that only underscores our need
to kind of continue to kind

04:52:06.490 --> 04:52:08.800
of use our platform as best we can.

04:52:08.800 --> 04:52:10.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fishman: Thank you
all so much for having us.

04:52:10.340 --> 04:52:11.640
We appreciate your interest.

04:52:11.640 --> 04:52:12.940
&gt;&gt; Karen Baicker: Thank you.

04:52:12.940 --> 04:52:14.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Edwards: Thank you.

04:52:14.240 --> 04:52:16.240
[ Applause ]

04:52:16.240 --> 04:52:19.670
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, that was
a wonderful different kind

04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:21.390
of insight for all of us.

04:52:21.390 --> 04:52:25.760
And I want to thank ReadyNation
and thank our panel so much.

04:52:25.760 --> 04:52:29.600
Our final panel is also going
to be different and interesting,

04:52:29.600 --> 04:52:32.480
Technology and Other
Innovative Solutions.

04:52:32.480 --> 04:52:36.250
As Tony brings his panel members
up, let's take a brief three

04:52:36.250 --> 04:52:41.520 position:56%
or four minute break as they get
settled up here and we will conclude

04:52:41.520 --> 04:52:44.780
with Technology and Other
Innovative Solutions.

04:52:44.780 --> 04:52:48.400
Thank you again.

04:52:48.400 --> 04:52:52.690
It's my pleasure to-- one of the
ways that we put this together is

04:52:52.690 --> 04:52:56.790
through partnerships that already
exist and through new partnerships

04:52:56.790 --> 04:52:59.940
and I want to thank Laura Nemours

04:52:59.940 --> 04:53:04.370
for getting the last
panel helping us so much

04:53:04.370 --> 04:53:06.340
which I think will
be a new partnership

04:53:06.340 --> 04:53:08.240
for the Center for the Book.

04:53:08.240 --> 04:53:11.210
But we also are making use of
some of our own board members,

04:53:11.210 --> 04:53:16.330
Laura is one and Tony Bloome who is
chairing this panel on technology

04:53:16.330 --> 04:53:20.030
and literacy is also part of
our literacy advisory board.

04:53:20.030 --> 04:53:23.700
He works for aids and has a
wonderful project that is going

04:53:23.700 --> 04:53:27.060
to be described as
part of the program.

04:53:27.060 --> 04:53:28.360
I'll turn it over to Tony.

04:53:28.360 --> 04:53:31.800
Tony? Let's give him a little
applause to get him going.

04:53:31.800 --> 04:53:33.990
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: All right.

04:53:33.990 --> 04:53:37.980
I haven't really done anything
yet but I appreciate it, so.

04:53:37.980 --> 04:53:39.280
All right.

04:53:39.280 --> 04:53:42.350
So it's the last panel of the day
and so you guys have been faithful

04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:44.530
to sit through a bunch of
interesting conversations.

04:53:44.530 --> 04:53:48.260
But there's probably somebody
in the room that you don't know.

04:53:48.260 --> 04:53:51.200
So I'd like to use five minute
of our presentation time for you

04:53:51.200 --> 04:53:54.120
to introduce you somebody in
the room that you don't know

04:53:54.120 --> 04:53:57.010
and tell them about a favorite
book that read recently.

04:53:57.010 --> 04:54:03.310
You have five minutes please begin.

04:54:03.310 --> 04:54:07.030
So great. I wanted to start with
that because obviously being able

04:54:07.030 --> 04:54:09.720
to meet somebody new be able
to share your experiences

04:54:09.720 --> 04:54:13.010
about the book that you've read and
how important obviously the theme

04:54:13.010 --> 04:54:16.780
of today is about literacy
and how important it is

04:54:16.780 --> 04:54:21.220 position:56%
that we can extend the opportunities
for individuals around the world

04:54:21.220 --> 04:54:23.880
to have acces to literacy.

04:54:23.880 --> 04:54:27.030 position:56%
I'm excited to have the three
representatives of the organizations

04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:30.240
that will be speaking with us
today to talk about various uses

04:54:30.240 --> 04:54:34.020
of technology that we
can make access to health

04:54:34.020 --> 04:54:38.760
and the general literacy
available to a variety of learners

04:54:38.760 --> 04:54:41.990
and using some creative
technology options as well.

04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:45.160
So typical with the other format.

04:54:45.160 --> 04:54:50.230
We'll start with a few comments
from our individual panelists.

04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:52.840
But then I would really like
to open it up into a dialogue

04:54:52.840 --> 04:54:56.190
for organizations here to be able
to share their own experiences

04:54:56.190 --> 04:55:00.310 position:56%
around a specific concept of how
can we use technology cost effective

04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:02.730
and sustainably to
reach this audience

04:55:02.730 --> 04:55:05.410
to promote and accelerate literacy.

04:55:05.410 --> 04:55:07.150
And so can learn as much from you

04:55:07.150 --> 04:55:10.220
about the work you're
doing as you can from us.

04:55:10.220 --> 04:55:14.630
So I'm delighted to welcome
to my immediate left,

04:55:14.630 --> 04:55:19.070
Judy Dixon who's a Consumer
Relations Officer right here

04:55:19.070 --> 04:55:20.660
at the Library of Congress.

04:55:20.660 --> 04:55:24.210
Judith did I see you that you've
been working here for 35 years?

04:55:24.210 --> 04:55:26.140
That's enormously exciting.

04:55:26.140 --> 04:55:31.070
Who you can't see is her
friend Potter who's I guess

04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:37.380 position:56%
on the other-- oh, you can see that.

04:55:37.380 --> 04:55:40.090
So we're going to have
you invent a story

04:55:40.090 --> 04:55:44.750
about what the tale came
from, but you can-- so.

04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:47.100
And Judith will be talking
to us about the services

04:55:47.100 --> 04:55:51.500
that her office provides including
for braille and talking books.

04:55:51.500 --> 04:55:54.940 position:56%
And then has brought some toys, some
devices that she'll show us as well.

04:55:54.940 --> 04:55:58.710
So Judith in just a moment welcome
you to walk us through that.

04:55:58.710 --> 04:56:02.230
And then next to Judith is
Linda Harris who's Director

04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:04.810
of Health Communications
and eHealth,

04:56:04.810 --> 04:56:07.250
the Office of Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion

04:56:07.250 --> 04:56:09.980
at the US Department of
Health and Human Services.

04:56:09.980 --> 04:56:13.020
And Linda I know you'll be
talking about designing access

04:56:13.020 --> 04:56:16.180
to information for individuals
with limited literacy,

04:56:16.180 --> 04:56:17.800
in particular in terms
of health literacy.

04:56:17.800 --> 04:56:23.570 position:56%
And then finally to my far left is
a good friend and colleague of mine,

04:56:23.570 --> 04:56:26.090
Rebecca Leege who's
the project director

04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:28.570
of an initiative called the All
Children Reading Grand Challenge

04:56:28.570 --> 04:56:32.610 position:56%
for development4, which specifically
is looking at the use of technology

04:56:32.610 --> 04:56:34.310
to advance early grade reading

04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:37.220
in developing countries
around the world.

04:56:37.220 --> 04:56:40.350
And Rebecca I know you've been at
organizations like World Vision

04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:43.090
but also World Relief in
a variety of capacities,

04:56:43.090 --> 04:56:44.800
exploring how to bring education

04:56:44.800 --> 04:56:47.100
to marginalized populations
around the world.

04:56:47.100 --> 04:56:50.510
So without further ado, Judith
can I turn it over to you just

04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:53.180
to walkthrough, tell us about
some of the toys that you have.

04:56:53.180 --> 04:56:54.480
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: Down here?

04:56:54.480 --> 04:56:56.070
&gt;&gt; Linda Harris: It's-- you
got it on the front-- yes.

04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:57.500
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: Oh, there, OK.

04:56:57.500 --> 04:56:58.960
Thank you very much.

04:56:58.960 --> 04:57:00.830
Good afternoon everyone.

04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:04.810
I am from the National Library
Service as Tony indicated,

04:57:04.810 --> 04:57:07.690
at a National Service for the
Blind and Physically Handicapped.

04:57:07.690 --> 04:57:09.790
We're part of the Library
of Congress.

04:57:09.790 --> 04:57:13.290
We've been in existence since 1931.

04:57:13.290 --> 04:57:17.890
And our role is to create
talking books and braille books.

04:57:17.890 --> 04:57:21.480
What we do is select them and
produce them and then we give them

04:57:21.480 --> 04:57:23.860
out to libraries around the country

04:57:23.860 --> 04:57:27.490
who actually circulate
them to individuals.

04:57:27.490 --> 04:57:32.480
So the idea here is people
who don't read print either

04:57:32.480 --> 04:57:41.040
because of a visual or a physical
disability are literate, yes, no.

04:57:41.040 --> 04:57:43.470
We have this debate all
the time in my office.

04:57:43.470 --> 04:57:47.610
If somebody doesn't read print
but they access information

04:57:47.610 --> 04:57:49.820
by listening, are they literate?

04:57:49.820 --> 04:57:51.810
I would say yes.

04:57:51.810 --> 04:57:54.970
There are people who
actually would say no.

04:57:54.970 --> 04:57:58.010
But literacy is a challenge

04:57:58.010 --> 04:58:02.170
because the world is
designed for print readers.

04:58:02.170 --> 04:58:05.880
So this is health literacy
in a different way.

04:58:05.880 --> 04:58:08.540
It's not just people
who can't communicate,

04:58:08.540 --> 04:58:12.100
most blind people can
communicate just fine.

04:58:12.100 --> 04:58:16.020
It's a matter of not being
access-- able to access print.

04:58:16.020 --> 04:58:19.040
So we do braille and talking books.

04:58:19.040 --> 04:58:21.970
And we do have books about health.

04:58:21.970 --> 04:58:24.290
As a matter of fact, I
did a search this morning.

04:58:24.290 --> 04:58:29.380
And in our national collection
we have 1168 audio books

04:58:29.380 --> 04:58:35.530
and 381 braille books
specifically the topic of health.

04:58:35.530 --> 04:58:38.760
We have player, our
talking books are--

04:58:38.760 --> 04:58:47.460
I'm going to hold this up and
they are recorded on a cartridge

04:58:47.460 --> 04:58:50.880
which that actually is
just a USB flash drive.

04:58:50.880 --> 04:58:52.240
Most of them have labels.

04:58:52.240 --> 04:58:58.450
This one isn't because I
created it this morning.

04:58:58.450 --> 04:59:00.440
&gt;&gt; Player on.

04:59:00.440 --> 04:59:03.400
Health and Nutrition Newsletters.

04:59:03.400 --> 04:59:05.730
February 2016.

04:59:05.730 --> 04:59:10.570
Current position, jogging and
health, easier than you may think.

04:59:10.570 --> 04:59:14.550
Jogging and health,
easier than you may think.

04:59:14.550 --> 04:59:15.850
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: Now,
we can actually--

04:59:15.850 --> 04:59:18.010
&gt;&gt; Reading time six minutes.

04:59:18.010 --> 04:59:19.310
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: We
can skip through.

04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:22.120
&gt;&gt; Second opinion.

04:59:22.120 --> 04:59:26.600

Scientific American health after 50.

04:59:44.140 --> 04:59:47.240
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: So what this
is is a monthly compilation

04:59:47.240 --> 04:59:49.540
of health newsletters.

04:59:49.540 --> 04:59:53.310
One of the reasons we don't have
more health books than we do is

04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:56.310
because health topics come and go.

04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:58.590
And our library and
they're very concerned

04:59:58.590 --> 05:00:04.490
about the books being up-to-date
and accurate and current.

05:00:04.490 --> 05:00:10.700 position:56%
So magazines and current health
newsletter type items are a good way

05:00:10.700 --> 05:00:15.250
to do that to give people
up to date information.

05:00:15.250 --> 05:00:20.820
So that's one way that a
blind person can access print.

05:00:20.820 --> 05:00:23.260
Another way-- There
are many other ways.

05:00:23.260 --> 05:00:25.050
There are actually lots of ways.

05:00:25.050 --> 05:00:30.210
And it's a matter of what is
this information available in.

05:00:30.210 --> 05:00:37.470
So people can use computers to
access material that's online.

05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:41.520 position:56%
Smartphones, we actually have an app

05:00:41.520 --> 05:00:44.340
for our talking books
called BARD mobile.

05:00:44.340 --> 05:00:49.490
And people can download our books
also through a service called BARD.

05:00:49.490 --> 05:00:52.320
And I normally make this
presentation in about two hours.

05:00:52.320 --> 05:00:56.570
So I'm trying to summarize that
I can tell you so much more

05:00:56.570 --> 05:00:58.340
about anyone of these things.

05:00:58.340 --> 05:01:00.160
But I did bring some handouts.

05:01:00.160 --> 05:01:03.590
There are fact sheets about our
program, application for service

05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:05.930
and things like that back
on your handout table.

05:01:05.930 --> 05:01:10.160 position:56%
So the program, there's lots of ways

05:01:10.160 --> 05:01:12.420
that have blind person
can access information.

05:01:12.420 --> 05:01:16.950
Now, what you may not know is this
is an iPhone, a regular old iPhone

05:01:16.950 --> 05:01:18.760
that you get at the Apple store.

05:01:18.760 --> 05:01:23.960
And every single iPhone has on it
a screen reader called VoiceOver.

05:01:23.960 --> 05:01:29.280
And every iPhone can talk.

05:01:29.280 --> 05:01:31.540
&gt;&gt; Messages, contacts.

05:01:31.540 --> 05:01:33.000

05:01:46.410 --> 05:01:47.710

&gt;&gt; Medicine button,
WebMD, icon nav, button.

05:01:50.370 --> 05:01:51.780

you can't see the screen

05:01:51.780 --> 05:01:53.650
of this iPhone so you
can just listen.

05:01:53.650 --> 05:01:55.240
This is probably a little fast.

05:01:55.240 --> 05:01:56.540
Actually let me--

05:01:56.540 --> 05:01:57.840

&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: I was
reading this this morning

05:02:47.850 --> 05:02:51.090
and said amputation,
accidental, oh my.

05:02:51.090 --> 05:02:53.850
That's sounds rather
major, you know.

&gt;&gt; ETN back arrow.

05:02:55.170 --> 05:02:56.470
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: I'm
going to go to my iPhone

if I'm accidentally
amputated something.

05:02:58.720 --> 05:03:00.770
You know. So--

05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:05.090

injured person lie down.

05:03:05.090 --> 05:03:09.950

05:03:12.610 --> 05:03:13.910
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: If I
haven't fallen down.

05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:18.490
Yes. So-- But that's
an incredible tool

05:03:18.490 --> 05:03:20.870
for accessibility of information.

05:03:20.870 --> 05:03:25.220
Finding-- It can do tons
of other things, too.

05:03:25.220 --> 05:03:31.830 position:56%
But just a mainstream app like WebMD
that has good health information.

05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:35.280
Hush now, you're done.

05:03:35.280 --> 05:03:37.890
So that's another.

05:03:37.890 --> 05:03:43.150
Accessing printed material
is one thing.

05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:48.360
But another major issue for people
who don't see is identification

05:03:48.360 --> 05:03:51.780
of things, labels all
this print, its--

05:03:51.780 --> 05:03:53.100
everything is labeled in print.

05:03:53.100 --> 05:03:58.030
One way to identify kind
of mainstream items.

05:03:59.210 --> 05:04:01.010
This--

05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:08.390
[ Music and Machine Talking ]

05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:11.080
This is a barcode reader.

05:04:11.080 --> 05:04:14.480
But it's special barcode reader.

05:04:14.480 --> 05:04:17.650
So I have this box.

05:04:17.650 --> 05:04:18.950
What is this box?

05:04:18.950 --> 05:04:20.250
Who knows?

05:04:20.250 --> 05:04:22.390 position:56%
I just damn no idea it's just a box.

05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:27.010

05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:31.510

[ Machine Talking ]

05:04:38.640 --> 05:04:42.170
Now that speech might be
slightly off putting for people

05:04:42.170 --> 05:04:45.120
who don't listen to
synthetic speech all the time.

05:04:45.120 --> 05:04:49.570
But for someone who does it's
actually pretty understandable.

05:04:49.570 --> 05:04:52.510
There's a lot of information
in a barcode.

how often all the things about it.

And this-- you're done, too.

05:05:21.890 --> 05:05:26.080
These things don't
know when to shut up.

05:05:26.080 --> 05:05:28.020
There are barcodes
on tons of things.

05:05:28.020 --> 05:05:32.030
I mean, I actually take this a
little device to the grocery store

05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:38.150
and use it on items and just
regular items in the grocery store.

05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:42.690
And there's also apps on my
iPhone that can do the same thing.

05:05:42.690 --> 05:05:44.970
They're a little bit
more difficult to use

05:05:44.970 --> 05:05:47.670
because they're little bit more
difficult to find the barcode.

05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:51.620
But the process is the same.

05:05:54.230 --> 05:06:01.570
So now we have-- this is
device called the ScriptTalk.

05:06:01.570 --> 05:06:03.530
Coincidentally made
by the same company

05:06:03.530 --> 05:06:07.290
that the barcode reader was
made by En-Vision America

05:06:07.290 --> 05:06:15.290
but this is a device for reading
the labels on prescription bottles.

05:06:15.290 --> 05:06:22.660
It has to be created
every Rite Aid Pharmacy

05:06:22.660 --> 05:06:25.880
in the United States
can now provide this

05:06:25.880 --> 05:06:29.460
to their subscribers or customers.

05:06:29.460 --> 05:06:35.160
And the way this works
is with RFID tags.

05:06:35.160 --> 05:06:38.210
&gt;&gt; ScripTalk Station ready.

05:06:38.210 --> 05:06:40.660
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: Right.

05:06:40.660 --> 05:06:46.830
So all I have to do is put
the bottle on the device.

05:06:46.830 --> 05:06:52.250
&gt;&gt; Patient, John Jay
Smith medication.

05:06:52.250 --> 05:06:56.880
Amoxicillin 250 milligram capsule.

05:06:56.880 --> 05:07:01.990
Instructions; take one
capsule three times daily--

05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:04.290
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: And again
you can skip through.

05:07:04.290 --> 05:07:06.290
&gt;&gt; Prescription date.

05:07:06.290 --> 05:07:10.380
Use by March first 2017.

05:07:10.380 --> 05:07:16.360
Refills remaining, prescriber,
ScriptAbility pharmacy.

05:07:16.360 --> 05:07:22.490
To reorder this prescription,
prescription number, warning,

05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:27.420
important, finish of
this medication.

05:07:27.420 --> 05:07:33.210
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: So they
also have other kinds

05:07:33.210 --> 05:07:36.570
of pill bottles with large print.

05:07:36.570 --> 05:07:41.060
This bottle has a large
print and a brand label.

05:07:41.060 --> 05:07:43.390
Brand label only says
the name of the person.

05:07:43.390 --> 05:07:45.560
I hope they actually
put more on it than that

05:07:45.560 --> 05:07:48.170
because the person
probably knows who they are.

05:07:48.170 --> 05:07:52.640
It's the name of the
medication that would be useful.

05:07:52.640 --> 05:08:00.360
But these Rite Aids now can do
either large print brand labels

05:08:00.360 --> 05:08:05.690
or use-- provide the
person with a ScriptTalk.

05:08:05.690 --> 05:08:12.500
And the last items-- there are
lots of talking devices these days.

05:08:12.500 --> 05:08:15.370
There are talking glucose monitors.

05:08:15.370 --> 05:08:19.450
There are talking thermometers,
talking scales,

05:08:19.450 --> 05:08:21.750
talking everything under the sun.

05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:23.410
This happens to be--

05:08:23.410 --> 05:08:24.710
&gt;&gt; Low.

05:08:24.710 --> 05:08:27.010
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: -- talking.

05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:42.790
&gt;&gt; Your body temperature
is 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:08:42.790 --> 05:08:44.090
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: It's close enough.

05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:48.270
Again, the speech-- where the
speaker in this foolish thing.

05:08:48.270 --> 05:08:51.880 position:56%
Looks like I'm going to do it again.

05:08:51.880 --> 05:08:57.240
Come on you can do it.

05:08:57.240 --> 05:09:00.740
&gt;&gt; Your body temperature
is 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

05:09:00.740 --> 05:09:05.830
But if you use it right
it probably will work.

05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:10.820
So this is just-- again there is
talking blood pressure monitors

05:09:10.820 --> 05:09:14.790
and talking, you name it,
there's talking almost everything.

05:09:14.790 --> 05:09:18.760
A lot of this stuff-- one of
the challenges is for people

05:09:18.760 --> 05:09:23.010
who are deaf-blind because there
is a bazillion things that talk.

05:09:23.010 --> 05:09:26.360
But it's a lot harder for
people who also don't hear.

05:09:26.360 --> 05:09:35.420
So there are devices like
that have-- that are--

05:09:35.420 --> 05:09:38.650 position:56%
this is refreshable braille display.

05:09:38.650 --> 05:09:49.990
And the pins raise and lower
depending on what's on the screen.

05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:59.290
And the downside of these
they are very, very expensive.

05:09:59.290 --> 05:10:02.410
But it is device that's
really useful

05:10:02.410 --> 05:10:06.960
and can be paired via
Bluetooth with a smartphone

05:10:06.960 --> 05:10:09.720 position:56%
or with some of these other devices.

05:10:09.720 --> 05:10:13.220
Not our talking book
machine the best example

05:10:13.220 --> 05:10:16.130
of the things I have here is that
it can be paired with smartphone

05:10:16.130 --> 05:10:18.440
and anything that's
displayed on the smart phone

05:10:18.440 --> 05:10:19.800
or anything that's displayed

05:10:19.800 --> 05:10:22.880
on a computer screen can
also be read in braille.

05:10:22.880 --> 05:10:26.030
So this is a way that people
who are deaf-blind have

05:10:26.030 --> 05:10:30.700
of accessing information
that's typically in print.

05:10:30.700 --> 05:10:32.000
OK.

05:10:32.000 --> 05:10:33.300
&gt;&gt; Anthony Boome: Great.

05:10:33.300 --> 05:10:35.510
Well, thank you so much Judith
for brining a bunch of toys

05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:37.310
to share with us important.

05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:38.610
And I wonder if you ever

05:10:38.610 --> 05:10:40.820
in your office do they start
having an exchange with each other?

05:10:40.820 --> 05:10:43.910
&gt;&gt; Judith Dixon: No
but they do at home.

05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:46.950
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: You have
to tell them to all be quite.

05:10:46.950 --> 05:10:49.640
And so we will have an opportunity

05:10:49.640 --> 05:10:51.500
for questions and answers
afterwards.

05:10:51.500 --> 05:10:54.570
So with a hope that you
would have some specific

05:10:54.570 --> 05:10:56.940
for Judy I know I have
several as well.

05:10:56.940 --> 05:10:59.970
Judy thanks for kicking us off
with really important discussion

05:10:59.970 --> 05:11:03.790
about range of technologies that
can make a literacy materials more

05:11:03.790 --> 05:11:06.450
accessible by variety of learners.

05:11:06.450 --> 05:11:07.750
Linda, can I turn it over to you?

05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:11.250
I know you have some slides as
well to talk to us about access

05:11:11.250 --> 05:11:13.710
to health literacy
and other resources.

05:11:13.710 --> 05:11:15.410
&gt;&gt; Linda Harris: Yeah,
I think I can--

05:11:15.410 --> 05:11:18.030
I will see if I can see the screen.

05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:20.240
Is that the title of
my presentation?

05:11:20.240 --> 05:11:24.050
OK, good. I'm going to talk about
what we can learn from people

05:11:24.050 --> 05:11:28.230
with limited literacy about
designing the interface

05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:33.850
for the technologies that we use
to access health information.

05:11:33.850 --> 05:11:36.900 position:56%
And it turns out we can learn a lot.

05:11:38.050 --> 05:11:42.500
I'm the Office of Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion.

05:11:42.500 --> 05:11:47.430
And so the consumer is really
an important part of being able

05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:50.710
to prevent disease and
promote their own health.

05:11:50.710 --> 05:11:54.750
So that's why we pay a lot
of attention to the consumer.

05:11:54.750 --> 05:12:00.700
And so what I'm going to talk with
you about real quickly is that some

05:12:00.700 --> 05:12:05.230
of the research that we've done
on people with limited literacy

05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:06.540
and limited health literacy,

05:12:06.540 --> 05:12:09.190
so the first thing I thought
I would just kind of share

05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:13.030
with you is the difference.

05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:14.990
You'll see that-- You've
probably heard

05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:20.550
that half the population
struggle with reading.

05:12:20.550 --> 05:12:23.300
But-- oops.

05:12:23.300 --> 05:12:28.010
I'm sorry I can't see
what I'm showing you.

05:12:28.010 --> 05:12:29.650
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

05:12:29.650 --> 05:12:33.360
Can you -- hold on.

05:12:33.360 --> 05:12:38.460
OK. So this is the slide--
oh, great thank you.

05:12:38.460 --> 05:12:42.790
Yeah. So this is half the
population struggles with reading.

05:12:42.790 --> 05:12:48.790
But 90% of the population struggles
with health literacy that is

05:12:48.790 --> 05:12:52.760
that only about 90% of us.

05:12:52.760 --> 05:12:58.030
90% of us struggle
at sometime, 10%--

05:12:58.030 --> 05:13:00.970
about 10 to 12% of us
are always proficient

05:13:00.970 --> 05:13:05.020
and understanding the
complexity of health information.

05:13:05.020 --> 05:13:10.250
And so we have a lot to work
with because of this challenge

05:13:10.250 --> 05:13:12.320
that almost all of us have.

05:13:12.320 --> 05:13:15.610
Health information is a little
bit different from other kinds

05:13:15.610 --> 05:13:18.360
of information is that
it's inherently complex.

05:13:18.360 --> 05:13:21.630
It comes from the medical
kind of language.

05:13:21.630 --> 05:13:24.490
And it's also inherently stressful.

05:13:24.490 --> 05:13:27.900
So when we're trying to
understand health information we--

05:13:27.900 --> 05:13:31.410
even if we have-- those of us who
have advance degrees and we think

05:13:31.410 --> 05:13:35.580 position:56%
that we're really very literate when
the time comes to get that diagnosis

05:13:35.580 --> 05:13:41.860
and it's really personal and
eventful for us then our ability

05:13:41.860 --> 05:13:45.060
to process information
kind of goes up the window.

05:13:45.060 --> 05:13:48.340
So we designed for everybody
and what I'm going to talk

05:13:48.340 --> 05:13:49.910
about with you about is how we--

05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:53.700
how our understanding of
people with limited literacy

05:13:53.700 --> 05:13:57.300
and limited health literacy
is helping us create that sort

05:13:57.300 --> 05:14:02.210
of that cyber curve
cut for all of us.

05:14:04.930 --> 05:14:07.230
I'm going to show just a
couple of screen shots.

05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:09.870
This is in our research,
our usability research.

05:14:09.870 --> 05:14:13.540
And this is a picture,
a graph of what it looks

05:14:13.540 --> 05:14:15.860
like when you're tracking--

05:14:15.860 --> 05:14:20.100 position:56%
doing eye tracking of just a
regular person who's fully literate.

05:14:20.100 --> 05:14:24.140
So you can see how they're
moving their eyes along the page.

05:14:24.140 --> 05:14:28.220
And now I'm going to show
you eye tracking of somebody

05:14:28.220 --> 05:14:31.850
who is challenged with reading.

05:14:31.850 --> 05:14:36.280
So you see how inefficient they
are, how they're struggling

05:14:36.280 --> 05:14:38.740
to try to find the point.

05:14:38.740 --> 05:14:44.190
And so this is accompanied with
usually with limited memory.

05:14:44.190 --> 05:14:51.060
And so what am I reading and how
am I to understand this information

05:14:51.060 --> 05:14:54.920
and then once I think I've got it
how do I remember what I've read.

05:14:54.920 --> 05:14:57.920
This is a question that lots
of people with limited literacy

05:14:57.920 --> 05:15:02.470
and limited health literacy are
asking themselves all the time.

05:15:07.360 --> 05:15:11.400 position:56%
So, we know that we have an enormous
challenge to work with people

05:15:11.400 --> 05:15:14.810
with limited to provide
meaningful access

05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:20.540
to health information among those
who are limited in their reading

05:15:20.540 --> 05:15:22.860
and limited in their
health literacy.

05:15:22.860 --> 05:15:25.600 position:56%
But we've learned some really
interesting things about those folks

05:15:25.600 --> 05:15:28.530
because we've really started
paying a lot of attention to them.

05:15:28.530 --> 05:15:31.840
We have been interviewing
and working one to one

05:15:31.840 --> 05:15:34.010
with over 800 folks most

05:15:34.010 --> 05:15:37.580
of them have either limited health
literacy or limited literacy.

05:15:37.580 --> 05:15:40.880
And so here are some a few
things that we've learned.

05:15:40.880 --> 05:15:44.610
People with limited literacy
are willing to use the web

05:15:44.610 --> 05:15:49.640
and it's important to them to use
the web for health information.

05:15:49.640 --> 05:15:52.290
They're able to accomplished tasks

05:15:52.290 --> 05:15:56.300
when the websites are design
well and this is really key.

05:15:56.300 --> 05:16:00.760 position:56%
We can make this accessible to
people if we really make the effort.

05:16:00.760 --> 05:16:05.760
And then the third thing that
I'm drill down on a little bit is

05:16:05.760 --> 05:16:10.960
that people with literacy
seem to prefer mobile.

05:16:10.960 --> 05:16:13.730
So I'm going to just go
into that a little bit more

05:16:13.730 --> 05:16:16.910
and I tell little bit
why we think that's true.

05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:22.170
People with limited literacy
usually prefer mobile.

05:16:22.170 --> 05:16:25.140
It seems that the reading
is easier for them.

05:16:25.140 --> 05:16:28.770
We think that may be because
the sentences are short.

05:16:28.770 --> 05:16:33.530
And there is some evidence that
the tactile experience also helps

05:16:33.530 --> 05:16:40.140 position:56%
process that information when you're
using a mobile app or a phone.

05:16:40.140 --> 05:16:47.470
So I'm going to quickly share with
you what we think is the definition

05:16:47.470 --> 05:16:49.750
of health literacy
once-- now that I've kind

05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:53.280
of told you what we are learning
about people with limited literacy

05:16:53.280 --> 05:16:56.130
and limited health literacy.

05:16:56.130 --> 05:17:02.000
We do not think that it is all that
useful to defined health literacy

05:17:02.000 --> 05:17:07.090
as a deficit that those of us who
are struggling have with reading

05:17:07.090 --> 05:17:08.690
or with health information.

05:17:08.690 --> 05:17:13.180
We prefer, we at HHSS, and that
includes Rob and Logan and those

05:17:13.180 --> 05:17:16.850
of us who are in the Department
of Health and Human Services.

05:17:16.850 --> 05:17:21.860
We prefer to think of health
literacy as defined as that match

05:17:21.860 --> 05:17:26.050
between what the health
organization or the publisher,

05:17:26.050 --> 05:17:30.060 position:56%
or the source of health information
provides and the way they provide it

05:17:30.060 --> 05:17:33.570 position:56%
and our ability to find, understand,
and use that information.

05:17:33.570 --> 05:17:39.280 position:56%
So, what's that means for us is that
the responsibly is really on those

05:17:39.280 --> 05:17:43.170
of us who published
information to design it well.

05:17:43.170 --> 05:17:47.200
And that's why we have started
with people with limited literacy

05:17:47.200 --> 05:17:49.630
and limited health
literacy to define--

05:17:49.630 --> 05:17:53.170
to develop a guide we call
it Health Literacy Online:

05:17:53.170 --> 05:17:55.740
A Guide for Simplifying
the User Experience.

05:17:55.740 --> 05:17:58.560
And that's where we brought these
800 folks together-- not together--

05:17:58.560 --> 05:18:00.890
but individually these
are not surveys.

05:18:00.890 --> 05:18:02.190
These are actually working

05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:05.780
with people watching
them use the technology

05:18:05.780 --> 05:18:08.440
and the interfaces for websites.

05:18:08.440 --> 05:18:12.330
And this guide is--
was just published

05:18:12.330 --> 05:18:15.430 position:56%
in October the second version of it.

05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:16.840
And it offers those folks

05:18:16.840 --> 05:18:21.590
who are developing any
interface whether it's a web

05:18:21.590 --> 05:18:32.410
or a mobile app ways that we can
design that interface in ways

05:18:32.410 --> 05:18:37.400
that almost everybody who
can read, who can understand,

05:18:37.400 --> 05:18:38.860
who can process information

05:18:38.860 --> 05:18:42.710
at a simple level can
find meaningful access

05:18:42.710 --> 05:18:46.260
to the information
on that technology.

05:18:46.260 --> 05:18:49.900
So, it we-- it comes with
a checklist that I have--

05:18:49.900 --> 05:18:53.480
I brought the checklist with
so want to take a look at it.

05:18:53.480 --> 05:18:55.410
I'm not going to go
into that right now.

05:18:55.410 --> 05:18:56.710
But you'll see that's it's base--

05:18:56.710 --> 05:19:01.340
it's an evidence-based guide
based not only on the folks

05:19:01.340 --> 05:19:04.500
that we've been telling you--
that I've been telling about.

05:19:04.500 --> 05:19:09.090
But also on the literature that
we've been referred to people

05:19:09.090 --> 05:19:12.100
with limited literacy,
people with disabilities,

05:19:12.100 --> 05:19:13.690
and people with limited
health literacy.

05:19:13.690 --> 05:19:17.390
So I'm going to just finally
close with giving you an example

05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:22.190
of the kind of interface that we're
working and Judy we should talk

05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:26.510
because we'd love to have this
at the Library of Congress.

05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:28.420
Our-- As I mentioned to
you we're in the Office

05:19:28.420 --> 05:19:30.770
of Disease Prevention
Health Promotion.

05:19:30.770 --> 05:19:35.330
One of the websites we have for the
public is called healthfinder.gov.

05:19:35.330 --> 05:19:39.060
And so we've used these
guides, these criteria

05:19:39.060 --> 05:19:42.200
to develop health literacy
of healthfinder.gov.

05:19:42.200 --> 05:19:45.870
That website is really the
department faced to the public

05:19:45.870 --> 05:19:49.710
for the preventive services that
we all need are covered by ACA.

05:19:49.710 --> 05:19:52.590
So, it's really important
that we get that right and so

05:19:52.590 --> 05:19:55.550
that everybody needs to
have the preventive services

05:19:55.550 --> 05:19:57.040
and because they're free.

05:19:57.040 --> 05:20:02.090
It's really important for us to
make it so easy to use that anyone

05:20:02.090 --> 05:20:07.590
who can use the web or can use
an app will find this very easy

05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:09.040
to access.

05:20:09.040 --> 05:20:12.940
So as I will close by saying,
there's a lot more work to do,

05:20:12.940 --> 05:20:16.400
we would love to work with the
disability community as well,

05:20:16.400 --> 05:20:17.700
work with the children

05:20:17.700 --> 05:20:21.810
who are actually helping
us understand about design.

05:20:21.810 --> 05:20:26.420
Because what we really believe
is that if you design with--

05:20:26.420 --> 05:20:34.110 position:56%
forget about grade level, you really
design by engaging people who have--

05:20:34.110 --> 05:20:38.320
who are challenged with reading
and with health literacy,

05:20:38.320 --> 05:20:42.130
ask them to help you
design the interface.

05:20:42.130 --> 05:20:45.080
That's really the most
important thing you can do.

05:20:45.080 --> 05:20:47.920
So all of those of you who
are working with people

05:20:47.920 --> 05:20:50.170
with limited literacy, with
limited health literacy,

05:20:50.170 --> 05:20:55.680
and with disabilities, we hope that
you'll encourage them to be a part

05:20:55.680 --> 05:20:58.220
of the design process
and the information

05:20:58.220 --> 05:21:04.440
or health information
that's important to them.

05:21:04.440 --> 05:21:06.110
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Thank you Linda.

05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:09.460
And then a really nice segue
from talking about devices

05:21:09.460 --> 05:21:12.990 position:56%
that can make information accessible
that Judy was talking about to those

05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:15.090 position:56%
who are creating the content, Linda,

05:21:15.090 --> 05:21:16.950
to make sure that it's
also accessible.

05:21:16.950 --> 05:21:19.850
So obviously the connection
as you've mentioned in terms

05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:22.200
of the types of audiences.

05:21:22.200 --> 05:21:26.060 position:56%
So Rebecca, let's just-- let's go
overseas and talk about sort of some

05:21:26.060 --> 05:21:27.420
of the challenges we face as part

05:21:27.420 --> 05:21:30.960
of the All Children Reading Grand
Challenge and our literacy efforts

05:21:30.960 --> 05:21:33.360
that are involving technology
for all the grade learners.

05:21:33.360 --> 05:21:34.660
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler Leege: Great.

05:21:34.660 --> 05:21:35.960
I'm going to take a pulse
check, who has worked

05:21:35.960 --> 05:21:39.570
in an office overseas in the room?

05:21:39.570 --> 05:21:40.870
One person?

05:21:40.870 --> 05:21:43.500
Great. Have anybody
visited programs overseas

05:21:43.500 --> 05:21:46.090
that work on literacy projects?

05:21:46.090 --> 05:21:47.390
OK. Thank you.

05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:50.970
So as Tony mentioned, I'm Rebecca
Leege, worked with World Vision.

05:21:50.970 --> 05:21:53.350
For those that may not be
familiar with World Vision,

05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:57.360 position:56%
we are an international relief and
development organization and focused

05:21:57.360 --> 05:22:01.510
on multi-sectors, education
being a key component of ours.

05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:04.610
We join the All Children Reading
Grand Challenge five years ago

05:22:04.610 --> 05:22:07.110
at the partnership
between USAID, World Vision

05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:08.770
and the Australian government.

05:22:08.770 --> 05:22:12.290
And it was really premised on
the notion of, can we use science

05:22:12.290 --> 05:22:14.930
and technology to offer
and breakthrough

05:22:14.930 --> 05:22:19.070
for early grade reading
in developing countries?

05:22:19.070 --> 05:22:24.100
We as three agencies with very
similar strategies weren't cracking

05:22:24.100 --> 05:22:25.480
the code.

05:22:25.480 --> 05:22:29.330 position:56%
There were still 250 million
children as we know without reading.

05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:34.140
There are one in-- or 80% of
children with disabilities are

05:22:34.140 --> 05:22:38.820
in developing countries, 3% of
those have access to school.

05:22:38.820 --> 05:22:42.380
So many opportunities
for trying to make break

05:22:42.380 --> 05:22:46.120
through advancements in that space.

05:22:46.120 --> 05:22:49.300
So as I just mentioned, we've
been around for five years

05:22:49.300 --> 05:22:54.260
and we have started to see some
very interesting application

05:22:54.260 --> 05:22:57.200
of technologies in various sectors

05:22:57.200 --> 05:23:01.030
and I just though I
highlight three of those.

05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:04.540
The three areas that we wanted
to focus on to help improve

05:23:04.540 --> 05:23:07.840
because we know as listening even
to the business panel and apologize

05:23:07.840 --> 05:23:09.320
that I cannot be here all day.

05:23:09.320 --> 05:23:12.270
But it is about parent
and community engagement.

05:23:12.270 --> 05:23:15.640
It's about having the right quality
materials and it's also ensuring

05:23:15.640 --> 05:23:18.130
that we have inclusion
of all children

05:23:18.130 --> 05:23:20.350
in that process that
no one is excluded.

05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:22.810
And we all know it's our
human right to have literacy.

05:23:22.810 --> 05:23:25.620
We also know it unlocks
our potential.

05:23:25.620 --> 05:23:28.220
And listening to the business,
we're constantly trained to make

05:23:28.220 --> 05:23:33.690
that case overseas as well to those
companies in developing countries

05:23:33.690 --> 05:23:37.120 position:56%
that say we don't have the workforce
talent and we say to ministries

05:23:37.120 --> 05:23:40.130
but you're also not investing
in the education system

05:23:40.130 --> 05:23:42.330
to build that next generation.

05:23:42.330 --> 05:23:44.130
So these are three focus areas.

05:23:44.130 --> 05:23:49.940
For those of you who have grown up
in the states, we've quite familiar

05:23:49.940 --> 05:23:51.490
with Sesame Street, right?

05:23:51.490 --> 05:23:53.380
And they have done a great job

05:23:53.380 --> 05:23:56.330
in helping educate many
children in this country.

05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:59.510
They have taken their model in many
countries but primarily in India

05:23:59.510 --> 05:24:02.660
where they have developed
recognizing one their population

05:24:02.660 --> 05:24:07.650
need to improve reading in
that country, they have taken

05:24:07.650 --> 05:24:11.120 position:56%
and developed and contextualized the
whole Sesame Street messaging called

05:24:11.120 --> 05:24:12.550
Galli Galli Sim Sim.

05:24:12.550 --> 05:24:14.330
It rolls off the tongue
very nicely, too.

05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:18.490
They have done everything
from creating e-reader,

05:24:18.490 --> 05:24:23.250
I mean e-publish books for
e-readers to just simple games.

05:24:23.250 --> 05:24:27.440
We had asked for their high
tech version of a phone,

05:24:27.440 --> 05:24:31.440
one of those [inaudible]
and they sent us PVC piping.

05:24:31.440 --> 05:24:35.180
And I thought, oh, this was not
what I was expecting to see.

05:24:35.180 --> 05:24:37.760
But how clever, something
that is very low tech,

05:24:37.760 --> 05:24:40.080
affordable that can be
sourced in the community

05:24:40.080 --> 05:24:43.660
so that children can start to hear
themselves, practice their reading.

05:24:43.660 --> 05:24:47.670
They're currently working on
a mobile app which is designed

05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:51.290
to be utilized at the home,

05:24:51.290 --> 05:24:54.170
they're working self-help groups
primarily women that are focused

05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:56.870
on health issues or
livelihood issues

05:24:56.870 --> 05:25:00.310
and introducing it their
engagement in the reading process

05:25:00.310 --> 05:25:04.100
with their child and then giving
them tools through an application

05:25:04.100 --> 05:25:07.930
on a very low-end smart phone
to begin practice their reading.

05:25:07.930 --> 05:25:11.690
We're really excited to
see how that will roll out.

05:25:11.690 --> 05:25:15.120
With any of these projects, one
thing that is lacking at least

05:25:15.120 --> 05:25:17.370
in the developing countries
is research.

05:25:17.370 --> 05:25:20.960
Research to say, does this
app really make any difference

05:25:20.960 --> 05:25:23.910
or is it-- I mean we know it's
great, the kids like to play

05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:26.260
on games and that has value.

05:25:26.260 --> 05:25:29.090
But can it demonstrate
any improvement

05:25:29.090 --> 05:25:30.390
in their reading outcomes.

05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:33.780
And so we are tagging all
of our grant programing

05:25:33.780 --> 05:25:36.730
to some robust research on that.

05:25:36.730 --> 05:25:38.970
And we hope the findings
are positive.

05:25:38.970 --> 05:25:43.060
But, you know, it's a good thing
to at least start to define what

05:25:43.060 --> 05:25:45.900
that process is, the
contextualization

05:25:45.900 --> 05:25:49.890
of the assessment process,
and so forth.

05:25:49.890 --> 05:25:52.390
The second one I wanted
to highlight is related

05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:53.930
to our children with disabilities.

05:25:53.930 --> 05:25:58.170
This is a group IDRT, Institute for
Disabilities Research and Training.

05:25:58.170 --> 05:25:59.640
They're based out of
in Wheaton, Maryland.

05:25:59.640 --> 05:26:02.540
It's women owned business
that has worked

05:26:02.540 --> 05:26:06.350
with the National Science
Foundation and others.

05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:08.560
But they have partnered
with a group in Morocco.

05:26:08.560 --> 05:26:12.540
And they feel very passionate
that there's software application

05:26:12.540 --> 05:26:17.730 position:56%
that was really trying to articulate
a way to document sign language

05:26:17.730 --> 05:26:23.250
of a language to be utilized
to create materials for deaf

05:26:23.250 --> 05:26:25.900
and low hearing in
various countries.

05:26:25.900 --> 05:26:28.450
So they're partnering with
the Institute of Morocco.

05:26:28.450 --> 05:26:30.870
The next slide kind of
shows you what it will be.

05:26:30.870 --> 05:26:36.180
So you get an idea of just defining
what it is, how it can be used

05:26:36.180 --> 05:26:39.330
in the market place and then
they actually have a video

05:26:39.330 --> 05:26:41.070
of someone signing it.

05:26:41.070 --> 05:26:46.110
And then their training teachers
and the deaf associations on how

05:26:46.110 --> 05:26:53.220
to create their own stories and
began to allow material for deaf.

05:26:53.220 --> 05:26:59.520
It's also a way for them to
teach many parents sign language

05:26:59.520 --> 05:27:02.050
because many of them don't
actually know sign and even how

05:27:02.050 --> 05:27:03.610
to teach their children, right.

05:27:03.610 --> 05:27:06.660
So it serves multiple purposes.

05:27:06.660 --> 05:27:09.710
USAID Morocco is highly
engaged in this in funding

05:27:09.710 --> 05:27:13.050
and it's been really supported by
the Ministry of Education there

05:27:13.050 --> 05:27:15.330
as they're seeing it as
a potential model to roll

05:27:15.330 --> 05:27:16.950
out throughout the whole country.

05:27:16.950 --> 05:27:20.000
We also see it as an
opportunity to replicate

05:27:20.000 --> 05:27:23.900
because it's also based off
of modern standard Arabic

05:27:23.900 --> 05:27:27.480
which is used throughout the whole
North Africa and Middle East World.

05:27:27.480 --> 05:27:31.390
My last example is really on how
to use source a new technology

05:27:31.390 --> 05:27:35.310
and I really appreciate
Linda's focus and attention

05:27:35.310 --> 05:27:40.890
on user experience and
simplifying tools for those

05:27:40.890 --> 05:27:42.890
that have low literacy levels.

05:27:42.890 --> 05:27:47.420
We put a challenge out 18 months
ago, almost two years ago to say,

05:27:47.420 --> 05:27:51.070
can someone source an authoring
tool that could be used

05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:54.150
in developing countries by
individuals with 20 hours

05:27:54.150 --> 05:27:59.160
of training but embedded in
that technology is the decoding

05:27:59.160 --> 05:28:02.970
and leveling framework of books.

05:28:02.970 --> 05:28:06.880
There are lot of authoring tools
out there, some are very fancy,

05:28:06.880 --> 05:28:10.320
but when you're in the
middle of South Sudan working

05:28:10.320 --> 05:28:13.660
with an elementary school teacher,
it's unlikely that she's going

05:28:13.660 --> 05:28:20.370
to navigate a device that requires
connectivity as well as something

05:28:20.370 --> 05:28:24.870
that is highly-- I'm going to say
fancy, right, it has all the bells

05:28:24.870 --> 05:28:27.850
and whistles and it's
almost overwhelming.

05:28:27.850 --> 05:28:29.550
So we put this challenge out.

05:28:29.550 --> 05:28:33.460
We had nine different teams
around the globe that competed.

05:28:33.460 --> 05:28:37.180
And we ended up-- we have
a demonstration to hand.

05:28:37.180 --> 05:28:38.480
Thank you.

05:28:38.480 --> 05:28:39.780
We'll do that in a second.

05:28:39.780 --> 05:28:42.860
We awarded it to a
group called SILV.

05:28:42.860 --> 05:28:44.160
For those that may be familiar

05:28:44.160 --> 05:28:47.040
with SILV are a linguist
organization that's been

05:28:47.040 --> 05:28:49.150
around over 60 years.

05:28:49.150 --> 05:28:54.380
They're probably are the ones that
have documented the most languages.

05:28:54.380 --> 05:28:57.730
They have also worked at
that very grassroots level

05:28:57.730 --> 05:29:02.390
to know what could be
achievable in a software system.

05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:05.550
And so what we do like about it,
though it looks kind of low tech

05:29:05.550 --> 05:29:10.520
in some ways is that it is easy to
adopt-- I mean it's easy to learn.

05:29:10.520 --> 05:29:16.630
We run our first training on it
in Ethiopia at the end of January

05:29:16.630 --> 05:29:21.510
and we did a usability study
and assessment process.

05:29:21.510 --> 05:29:23.730
And it scored quite high
because they said it's simple,

05:29:23.730 --> 05:29:26.310
we can master it, we understand
what we're supposed to do

05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:30.170
and it already identifies
the decoding

05:29:30.170 --> 05:29:31.870
and leveled elements for us.

05:29:31.870 --> 05:29:35.140
So we're not questioning, is this
book appropriate for grade one

05:29:35.140 --> 05:29:38.290
or grade three, it's
defined in that space.

05:29:38.290 --> 05:29:40.620
So we're very excited
about this tool

05:29:40.620 --> 05:29:42.250
for beginning to roll out process.

05:29:42.250 --> 05:29:46.730
We think it has multiple
usages, one even here in DC.

05:29:46.730 --> 05:29:48.030
We know that there's like--

05:29:48.030 --> 05:29:51.630
if we look at Diaspora here
in DC we can envision engaged

05:29:51.630 --> 05:29:56.800
in the Ethiopian community to
contribute back reading materials.

05:29:56.800 --> 05:30:00.690
Basically, as we look
at the vast materials

05:30:00.690 --> 05:30:04.420 position:56%
and I don't Scholastic still in the
room but great to hear it from Nancy

05:30:04.420 --> 05:30:06.540
that I know they do a lot
of work overseas and partner

05:30:06.540 --> 05:30:08.820
with many of us as organizations.

05:30:08.820 --> 05:30:14.300
But even with large publishing
firms, there are no resources

05:30:14.300 --> 05:30:18.050
and enough or little resources
in local languages are we need

05:30:18.050 --> 05:30:21.860
to ensure that children actually
have something that they can hold

05:30:21.860 --> 05:30:25.330
and read and practice in a
language that they understand.

05:30:25.330 --> 05:30:29.140
I think that's it.

05:30:29.140 --> 05:30:32.070
Tony has a thumb drive here and
we've been passing these out

05:30:32.070 --> 05:30:34.770
and I didn't think to bring,
so if anybody wants it.

05:30:34.770 --> 05:30:36.070
The software is free.

05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:40.860
If anybody wants to-- online
let me see if I put it in here.

05:30:40.860 --> 05:30:43.710
I didn't put it in
here, sorry, bloom--

05:30:43.710 --> 05:30:47.140
I can give it to you but it's,
you know, if you're interested

05:30:47.140 --> 05:30:50.070
in downloading it it's
very simple to open

05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:51.870
and start to create your own book.

05:30:51.870 --> 05:30:54.810
It might be kind of fun to do with
any children that you might have

05:30:54.810 --> 05:30:57.070
or some youth that you
want to give them a task

05:30:57.070 --> 05:30:59.180
to write a book for a child.

05:30:59.180 --> 05:31:00.480
Thank you.

05:31:00.480 --> 05:31:03.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Thank you Rebecca
and maybe just a round of applause

05:31:03.040 --> 05:31:04.840
for the three presenters.

05:31:04.840 --> 05:31:08.210
[ Applause ]

05:31:08.210 --> 05:31:09.950
So I'm going to put
the honors on you guys.

05:31:09.950 --> 05:31:12.470
We've heard about some
really interesting examples

05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:16.050
of assistive technologies,
designing content

05:31:16.050 --> 05:31:17.700
that it could be accessible
particularly

05:31:17.700 --> 05:31:20.900
for a low literacy audiences
and international projects

05:31:20.900 --> 05:31:22.570
that are looking at
the use of technology

05:31:22.570 --> 05:31:24.200
to accelerate early grade reading.

05:31:24.200 --> 05:31:27.250
Do you have any questions
for our panelist in regards

05:31:27.250 --> 05:31:28.550
to what you've just heard?

05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:29.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

05:31:29.850 --> 05:31:32.630
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: And if you
could please introduce yourself

05:31:32.630 --> 05:31:36.620
and your organization again for
our benefit that'd be terrific.

05:31:40.900 --> 05:31:43.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you those were all really,
really informative and great.

05:31:43.840 --> 05:31:47.340
I'm Laura Bailey I direct in
a Morse BrightStar program.

05:31:47.340 --> 05:31:52.760
I'm also on the Literacy
Awards with Tony and, you know,

05:31:52.760 --> 05:31:58.800 position:56%
the winner of the Rubinstein Prize
in our second year was Room to Read.

05:31:58.800 --> 05:32:01.810 position:56%
And I don't know if your
organization works with Room to Read

05:32:01.810 --> 05:32:06.600
and all that I know one component
of their program is they train--

05:32:06.600 --> 05:32:11.190
they work in Third World Countries,
mainly Southeast Asia I think,

05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:15.400
and they train local people
to write children's books

05:32:15.400 --> 05:32:18.200
in the mother tongue, it
seems like there might--

05:32:18.200 --> 05:32:22.640
and they're pretty tech
shabby too, so I didn't--

05:32:22.640 --> 05:32:25.590
that's just a connection
point so I don't know

05:32:25.590 --> 05:32:26.890
if you guys are working together--

05:32:26.890 --> 05:32:28.190
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler Leege:
We do connect with them

05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:30.010
and we do greatly value
their expertise

05:32:30.010 --> 05:32:31.650
in what they're producing, yes.

05:32:31.650 --> 05:32:32.950
&gt;&gt; Oh, good.

05:32:32.950 --> 05:32:34.250
That's great to hear.

05:32:34.250 --> 05:32:35.550
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler Leege:
They'll be working with us

05:32:35.550 --> 05:32:37.760
on a writer's workshop
this summer in Cambodia.

05:32:37.760 --> 05:32:42.230
&gt;&gt; And then I just had a question
that it's kind of been percolating

05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:46.570
through several of the sessions the
woman who spoke about the response

05:32:46.570 --> 05:32:49.710
to the Ebola crisis
earlier today and maybe some

05:32:49.710 --> 05:32:52.480
of you may not have been
here for that, but she talked

05:32:52.480 --> 05:32:56.100
about the importance of public
messaging through radio.

05:32:56.100 --> 05:32:58.010 position:56%
And, you know, that audio for people

05:32:58.010 --> 05:33:01.080
with visual impairment
or low literacy.

05:33:01.080 --> 05:33:05.680
Audio I think is such a great and
readily available way to message

05:33:05.680 --> 05:33:08.930
to large numbers of people but
I don't know that we're using

05:33:08.930 --> 05:33:11.960
that in the US very much anymore,
it seems like everything has gone

05:33:11.960 --> 05:33:16.300
to texting and visual on
devices so I don't know if anyone

05:33:16.300 --> 05:33:20.810
in the audience has a
perspective on the value of audio

05:33:20.810 --> 05:33:22.620
for public health kinds of things

05:33:22.620 --> 05:33:26.300
or other international
examples of that.

05:33:26.300 --> 05:33:29.010
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Boy that's
terrific and just noting relations

05:33:29.010 --> 05:33:32.610
and partners the importance and
then maybe Judy a question for you

05:33:32.610 --> 05:33:35.510
in regards to audio as well
as others in the audience.

05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:38.500
Let's take a few questions and
then ask the panelist it looked

05:33:38.500 --> 05:33:40.060
like there is somebody
else who had--

05:33:40.060 --> 05:33:41.960
if you could introduce
yourself that'd be terrific.

05:33:41.960 --> 05:33:45.910
&gt;&gt; Sure. Actually it was
a comment and invitation.

05:33:45.910 --> 05:33:48.780
I'm Dr. Sandra Charles,
physician here at the Library

05:33:48.780 --> 05:33:53.010
of Congress running the occupation
and health services office

05:33:53.010 --> 05:33:58.720 position:56%
and that we each may have a wellness
fair in which we invite a number

05:33:58.720 --> 05:34:04.260
of different organizations,
vendors to partner with us

05:34:04.260 --> 05:34:08.640
and have an exposition where
they off-show their services.

05:34:08.640 --> 05:34:13.540
And I'm thinking also disease
prevention would be an excellent

05:34:13.540 --> 05:34:16.920
partner in helping people
and spreading the word

05:34:16.920 --> 05:34:21.660
about what's available for people
to use in terms of literacy

05:34:21.660 --> 05:34:24.850
and health literacy in particular
because that's one of our main

05:34:24.850 --> 05:34:27.340 position:56%
for us wellness and health promotion

05:34:27.340 --> 05:34:31.540
and we are constantly
promoting health literacy.

05:34:31.540 --> 05:34:34.560
And in fact in addition to
that wellness fair in August

05:34:34.560 --> 05:34:38.970 position:56%
with your family health and wellness
day where we ask employees to bring

05:34:38.970 --> 05:34:41.650
in their family members
to also be exposed

05:34:41.650 --> 05:34:45.520
to the different things available
in terms of health and I think both

05:34:45.520 --> 05:34:49.190
of those would be excellent
for expounding

05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:51.600 position:56%
in health literacy and improving it.

05:34:51.600 --> 05:34:55.690
And we certainly would like to
have Judy bring over so the rest

05:34:55.690 --> 05:34:58.260
of the Library because
we know she exist.

05:34:58.260 --> 05:35:02.170
We go out there to the National
Library but I really think the rest

05:35:02.170 --> 05:35:06.010
of the Library ought to be aware
of those things too, so thank you.

05:35:06.010 --> 05:35:08.140
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome:
Thank you Dr. Charles.

05:35:08.140 --> 05:35:09.440
Great.

05:35:09.440 --> 05:35:11.400
&gt;&gt; Rob Logan, National
Library of Medicine.

05:35:11.400 --> 05:35:15.730
I think this one is more for
Linda but anybody can answer it.

05:35:15.730 --> 05:35:20.770
One of the challenges that I think
that we have when we do MedlinePlus

05:35:20.770 --> 05:35:22.830
and I think it's similar
to what challenge you have

05:35:22.830 --> 05:35:26.260
in Healthfinder is it would
be a much better website

05:35:26.260 --> 05:35:32.210
if we knew the role in which
people were using it were in.

05:35:32.210 --> 05:35:35.900
Are you here as a caregiver
for example, OK?

05:35:35.900 --> 05:35:38.680
Are you here as a patient, OK?

05:35:38.680 --> 05:35:41.240
Are you here as a parent, OK?

05:35:41.240 --> 05:35:45.120
And I believe if we could provide
a totally different website

05:35:45.120 --> 05:35:48.100
with different orientation
based on the role

05:35:48.100 --> 05:35:51.260
and the reason why people were
there in the first place, OK?

05:35:51.260 --> 05:35:54.300
I believe our materials
would even be better utilized

05:35:54.300 --> 05:35:55.600
than they are now.

05:35:55.600 --> 05:36:00.170
I think that's beyond our techno
capacity at the time but it occurs

05:36:00.170 --> 05:36:04.250
to me that I still haven't seen
anyone, you know, take advantage

05:36:04.250 --> 05:36:07.220
of the fact that our needs
with health information

05:36:07.220 --> 05:36:09.400
or requirements differed
depending on the role

05:36:09.400 --> 05:36:12.900
that we're in when we're seeking.

05:36:12.900 --> 05:36:15.260
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Thank you Rob.

05:36:15.260 --> 05:36:16.850
OK, so I heard a few-- first

05:36:16.850 --> 05:36:19.510
of all a great recommendations
in and suggestions.

05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:20.810
Thank you.

05:36:20.810 --> 05:36:22.110
So I heard three questions
maybe I'll address

05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:23.410
to each of the panelist.

05:36:23.410 --> 05:36:26.450
Linda, clearly in terms of the
role of the audience that's coming

05:36:26.450 --> 05:36:29.360
to the websites, Judy if
you wanted to elaborate

05:36:29.360 --> 05:36:34.180
on perhaps some other radio or
audio laced related technologies.

05:36:34.180 --> 05:36:37.200
I heard you mentioned
was it BARD Mobile,

05:36:37.200 --> 05:36:39.490
so that'd be interesting maybe to
mention a little bit more about.

05:36:39.490 --> 05:36:43.780 position:56%
And then Rebecca just on the subject
of partnerships, we heard an example

05:36:43.780 --> 05:36:46.440
of a partner but what role
partnerships have in regards

05:36:46.440 --> 05:36:48.530
to the activity of
all children reading.

05:36:48.530 --> 05:36:50.830
So maybe let's start with Judy.

05:36:50.830 --> 05:36:52.400
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: Yes thank you.

05:36:52.400 --> 05:36:55.390
Audio is certainly an
important way to communicate

05:36:55.390 --> 05:36:59.180
to everyone including people
with visual impairment.

05:36:59.180 --> 05:37:02.780
You're right in that
radio as certainly

05:37:02.780 --> 05:37:07.080
in commercial radio is not
used as much as it once was.

05:37:07.080 --> 05:37:10.740
I don't think people listen to
radio as much as they once did.

05:37:10.740 --> 05:37:15.330 position:56%
But there is also a network of radio
reading services throughout the

05:37:15.330 --> 05:37:19.860
United States that is used
to communicate various things

05:37:19.860 --> 05:37:24.000
to the visual impaired audience
but these are primarily people

05:37:24.000 --> 05:37:30.220
who are long time well-established
visually impaired people not

05:37:30.220 --> 05:37:34.510
so much reaching people who just
have a little difficulty seeing.

05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:37.240
That's the population that's
very difficult to reach

05:37:37.240 --> 05:37:41.960
and that's a population that really
needs that kind of information.

05:37:41.960 --> 05:37:44.420
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: I
would also give you--

05:37:44.420 --> 05:37:45.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: Oh, BARD Mobile, yes.

05:37:45.720 --> 05:37:49.640
It's a mobile app and I'm
wondering I had a question

05:37:49.640 --> 05:37:52.470
for Linda as far as mobile apps.

05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:57.250
There are mobile apps that are not
possible for me to use on my iPhone

05:37:57.250 --> 05:38:00.880
so I'm hoping that
when you provide advice

05:38:00.880 --> 05:38:04.520
about developing mobile apps
you also make sure to point

05:38:04.520 --> 05:38:07.890
out that they need to be made
accessible with voiceover

05:38:07.890 --> 05:38:09.980
because not all apps are.

05:38:09.980 --> 05:38:11.400
So that's an important thing.

05:38:11.400 --> 05:38:15.720
But we have an app for playing
our talking books and real books

05:38:15.720 --> 05:38:21.510
on smartphones and all of our audio
books and real books can be played

05:38:21.510 --> 05:38:23.180
on that so that's possible.

05:38:23.180 --> 05:38:29.330
We have the iOS version of that
it's been out for about two years

05:38:29.330 --> 05:38:31.610
and we just released
an Android version.

05:38:31.610 --> 05:38:33.790
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Thank you Judy.

05:38:33.790 --> 05:38:35.090
Linda?

05:38:35.090 --> 05:38:37.040
&gt;&gt; Linda M. Harris: Yeah I would
just-- to Judy's point, you know,

05:38:37.040 --> 05:38:44.920 position:56%
we are really committed to complying
with the 508 kind of regulations

05:38:44.920 --> 05:38:48.180
and rules and so that
is a part of everything

05:38:48.180 --> 05:38:50.550
that we design and recommend.

05:38:50.550 --> 05:38:56.880
And I only wish that
everybody was willing to step

05:38:56.880 --> 05:39:01.400
up to those kinds of standards.

05:39:01.400 --> 05:39:05.000
To Rob, to your question,
actually Rob

05:39:05.000 --> 05:39:12.150
and I together I guess represent
two of the library sources,

05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:14.910
sources of information
to the public.

05:39:14.910 --> 05:39:16.970
Our Healthfinder is
really about prevention

05:39:16.970 --> 05:39:21.790
and of course the MedlinePlus at
the Library of Medicine is for kind

05:39:21.790 --> 05:39:24.060
of managing chronic conditions

05:39:24.060 --> 05:39:30.020
and understanding how the
rest of the health span.

05:39:30.020 --> 05:39:33.250
So, we are often in conversations
about how do we do better

05:39:33.250 --> 05:39:35.340
at understanding our audience.

05:39:35.340 --> 05:39:39.930
And I think what we've kind of come
to the conclusion we and our part

05:39:39.930 --> 05:39:45.230
of the department is that
that is you really want

05:39:45.230 --> 05:39:49.870 position:56%
to have a trusting relationship
between the source and the audience.

05:39:49.870 --> 05:39:52.830
And that's probably
not the best role

05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:55.090
for the government
to try to fulfill.

05:39:55.090 --> 05:39:59.220
And so as a result we have really
been focusing on partnering

05:39:59.220 --> 05:40:02.340
with others who have
websites and we have content--

05:40:02.340 --> 05:40:04.600
we've indicated our content

05:40:04.600 --> 05:40:09.140
so that other websites can
take it into their websites.

05:40:09.140 --> 05:40:11.270
They are the ones who
are on the ground.

05:40:11.270 --> 05:40:13.490
They are the ones who
have customers,

05:40:13.490 --> 05:40:15.860 position:56%
constituents who already trust them.

05:40:15.860 --> 05:40:19.410
And so I'm, you know, we're
kind of thinking If you can--

05:40:19.410 --> 05:40:24.900
we, the government with the, you
know, the NIH of the department

05:40:24.900 --> 05:40:29.400
who have the science backing that
information can make it available

05:40:29.400 --> 05:40:33.460
and it's indicated to those folks
who have the personal relationship

05:40:33.460 --> 05:40:37.790
with those folks then that smart
interface could really be useful

05:40:37.790 --> 05:40:41.130
so that you get to know the
people that you're talking with.

05:40:41.130 --> 05:40:44.610
We do that in partnership
with CVS for example if you go

05:40:44.610 --> 05:40:47.140
to the MinuteClinic
you'll see my Healthfinder

05:40:47.140 --> 05:40:49.830
on the MinuteClinic
you will, you know,

05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:52.400
it'll be easy to use
there as it is here.

05:40:52.400 --> 05:40:57.790 position:56%
So I appreciate your question Rob,
I think it's a really important path

05:40:57.790 --> 05:41:02.080
to go down but we've chosen to
take that partnership path rather

05:41:02.080 --> 05:41:08.030
than trying to do the whole--
create those trusting relationships

05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:11.190
between the federal
government and the individual.

05:41:11.190 --> 05:41:15.550
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler Leege: And
partnership, partnership is key

05:41:15.550 --> 05:41:18.310
and it's kind of the premise
of a grand challenge is

05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:22.240
that we much work together
collaboratively we must seek new

05:41:22.240 --> 05:41:24.200
problem solvers.

05:41:24.200 --> 05:41:26.090 position:56%
We've used prize competitions really

05:41:26.090 --> 05:41:29.580
because it attracts the private
sector, attracts entrepreneurs,

05:41:29.580 --> 05:41:35.470
attracts those not typically in the
space to help us create a solution

05:41:35.470 --> 05:41:39.000
and I really appreciate
recommendations that's part

05:41:39.000 --> 05:41:42.710
of our goal as an entity as
an initiative is really just

05:41:42.710 --> 05:41:46.280
to start creating the voice
and starting to understand

05:41:46.280 --> 05:41:50.060
where we can be at a catalyst for
new partnerships in collaboration

05:41:50.060 --> 05:41:54.360
as well as start to replicate and
adopt promising practices here

05:41:54.360 --> 05:41:55.830
in the US or in other places

05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:59.400
that can be replicated
in developing countries.

05:41:59.400 --> 05:42:00.700
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome:
Thank you Rebecca.

05:42:00.700 --> 05:42:03.960
So I wanted to ask a question
of each of the panelist as well.

05:42:03.960 --> 05:42:06.860
We're in this center of
knowledge, the Library of Congress.

05:42:06.860 --> 05:42:10.290
We've just created a Library of
Congress Magic Wand, right, John,

05:42:10.290 --> 05:42:12.280
just being a question
of another prize.

05:42:12.280 --> 05:42:16.580
So what would you like to see as a
breakthrough activity or innovation

05:42:16.580 --> 05:42:20.360
in your respective areas that
could help you accelerate your

05:42:20.360 --> 05:42:21.660
own initiatives?

05:42:21.660 --> 05:42:23.980
I know I had asked
them this every time

05:42:23.980 --> 05:42:26.000
and it'd be interesting
what they come up with.

05:42:26.000 --> 05:42:28.250
But what would you like
to see just as something--

05:42:28.250 --> 05:42:29.550
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler
Leege: If I do let's start.

05:42:29.550 --> 05:42:30.850
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: --

05:42:30.850 --> 05:42:32.150
yeah, something transformative
maybe it's a technology,

05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:34.180
maybe it's a user Linda or--

05:42:34.180 --> 05:42:37.490
and Rebecca maybe it's a new
partner just what is an example

05:42:37.490 --> 05:42:41.140
of something you'd like to see
once we've made wave the Magic Wand

05:42:41.140 --> 05:42:43.600
for Library of Congress.

05:42:44.940 --> 05:42:46.640
Linda you got something?

05:42:46.640 --> 05:42:47.940
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: I'll go first.

05:42:47.940 --> 05:42:49.240
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Judy.

05:42:49.240 --> 05:42:50.540
&gt;&gt; Judy Dixon: I think--

05:42:50.540 --> 05:42:52.590
Just we were just talking about
accessibility and Linda mentions

05:42:52.590 --> 05:42:56.030
that they use 508 but the current
508 guidelines were developed

05:42:56.030 --> 05:43:02.710
in 1998 and they have been working
on a refresh for the last 18 years

05:43:02.710 --> 05:43:06.440
and they're supposedly
close but who knows.

05:43:06.440 --> 05:43:12.000
Accessibility is a very complex is
very complex and very thorny issue

05:43:12.000 --> 05:43:14.050
and extremely frustrating.

05:43:14.050 --> 05:43:17.500
It's frequent that I can go
to websites that I can't use.

05:43:17.500 --> 05:43:21.710
It's frequent that I can download
a mobile app that I can't use.

05:43:21.710 --> 05:43:24.890
So, if I was going to wave a
Magic Wand I would just get rid

05:43:24.890 --> 05:43:31.540 position:56%
of all the accessibility barriers,
get rid of Flash and get rid of Java

05:43:31.540 --> 05:43:36.120 position:56%
and all these other
technological barriers that are used

05:43:36.120 --> 05:43:39.940
to make websites always banging,
pretty and exciting and fun

05:43:39.940 --> 05:43:44.570
and our-- for the most part
barriers to blind people.

05:43:44.570 --> 05:43:47.370
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome:
Great, thank you Judy.

05:43:48.430 --> 05:43:49.730
Linda?

05:43:49.730 --> 05:43:52.600
&gt;&gt; Linda M. Harris: Well I think
that the reach of the Library

05:43:52.600 --> 05:43:56.240
of Congress is just remarkable
and I've been trying to think

05:43:56.240 --> 05:44:02.580
about how could we better
make our information available

05:44:02.580 --> 05:44:04.530
through the Library of Congress?

05:44:04.530 --> 05:44:10.610
I mean, we have the websites and
the sources of health information

05:44:10.610 --> 05:44:14.970
in the department, is
really precious I think.

05:44:14.970 --> 05:44:16.960
It's updated constantly.

05:44:16.960 --> 05:44:21.060
It's the best of the science
that we have translating

05:44:21.060 --> 05:44:23.590
that into understandable

05:44:23.590 --> 05:44:27.040
and actionable information
is what we try to do.

05:44:27.040 --> 05:44:31.280
But our real limitation is
really reaching people who are,

05:44:31.280 --> 05:44:33.130
you know, where they live.

05:44:33.130 --> 05:44:37.620
And if I had a Magic Wand I
would distribute the Library

05:44:37.620 --> 05:44:42.690
of Congress' reach, I mean,
facilities and capabilities

05:44:42.690 --> 05:44:48.330
for making that information more
accessible to people where they are

05:44:48.330 --> 05:44:51.230
in their homes not
just here or not just

05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:55.320 position:56%
in their library but in their homes.

05:44:55.320 --> 05:44:57.810
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome:
Great, thank you Linda.

05:44:58.930 --> 05:45:00.460
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Chandler Leege:
Maybe a little bit on that line

05:45:00.460 --> 05:45:04.760
of accessibility just for your
say Linda is I think I would love

05:45:04.760 --> 05:45:09.920
for there to be some approach or
breakthrough for urgencies creating

05:45:09.920 --> 05:45:11.270
that urgency that we need

05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:15.070
to be educating our next
generation in a way.

05:45:15.070 --> 05:45:18.430
And I struggle with
trying to articulate

05:45:18.430 --> 05:45:22.770
that message we know reading is
a long process it doesn't happen,

05:45:22.770 --> 05:45:24.550
you know, take a pill
and we all read.

05:45:24.550 --> 05:45:26.320
I wish it were that simple.

05:45:26.320 --> 05:45:32.970
But really creating that sense
of urgency for our future

05:45:32.970 --> 05:45:37.020
because of the trend is that
we have more and more countries

05:45:37.020 --> 05:45:40.460
with children that cannot
read our world is not going

05:45:40.460 --> 05:45:45.000
to become a more stable place and
we need to figure out ways fast

05:45:45.000 --> 05:45:49.950
in which we can make that
breakthrough and really start

05:45:49.950 --> 05:45:55.050
to change generations that are good
to move forward and be our leaders.

05:45:55.050 --> 05:45:58.950
&gt;&gt; Is it OK to have an audience
member to answer that question?

05:45:58.950 --> 05:46:00.250
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome: Oh yeah.

05:46:00.250 --> 05:46:02.260
&gt;&gt; OK. Because I got a totally
[inaudible], right, medicine,

05:46:02.260 --> 05:46:05.260
totally different answer, OK,
and I think there is something

05:46:05.260 --> 05:46:08.200
that could be done that would
be I think transformative.

05:46:08.200 --> 05:46:13.710
One of the most impressive health
care organizations in the US

05:46:13.710 --> 05:46:17.760
in my opinion is the Southcentral
Foundation in Anchorage, Alaska.

05:46:17.760 --> 05:46:20.540
And I won't go into detail to
why they are impressive but one

05:46:20.540 --> 05:46:26.730
of the things that they do is
they serve a medically underserved

05:46:26.730 --> 05:46:30.720
population mostly Native Alaskans
and what they gone out to do

05:46:30.720 --> 05:46:34.150
in order to improve health care
there is to first give the people

05:46:34.150 --> 05:46:36.510
who live there a sense
of pride in who they are

05:46:36.510 --> 05:46:39.470
and their own heritage,
their own background.

05:46:39.470 --> 05:46:43.820
They have begun to realize that
a sense of pride in who you are,

05:46:43.820 --> 05:46:50.780
a sense of your own history,
a sense of your own community,

05:46:50.780 --> 05:46:56.210
a sense of what their
challenges are and I'm not going

05:46:56.210 --> 05:46:57.880
to go more detail about it.

05:46:57.880 --> 05:47:01.660
It's fundamental to giving people
interest in their own health,

05:47:01.660 --> 05:47:05.330
taking care of themselves,
taking care of their families.

05:47:05.330 --> 05:47:08.640
You can't put the cart before
the horse is what they've argued

05:47:08.640 --> 05:47:09.940
for years.

05:47:09.940 --> 05:47:12.620
Now translate that into
something that the Library

05:47:12.620 --> 05:47:14.760
of Congress could uniquely do.

05:47:14.760 --> 05:47:16.060
Why should you be proud if you're

05:47:16.060 --> 05:47:18.940
from a low income area
in Philadelphia?

05:47:18.940 --> 05:47:21.640
Why should you be proud
if you're in to it?

05:47:21.640 --> 05:47:26.170
Why should you be proud if
you're this providing a place

05:47:26.170 --> 05:47:27.940
where people could go?

05:47:27.940 --> 05:47:32.110
The story of various different
demographic wake grounds

05:47:32.110 --> 05:47:35.280
and groups people in this country,
something they could look at

05:47:35.280 --> 05:47:40.150
and really develop some pride,
some ownership in, some interest,

05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:44.680
tell people how to-- where they
can go from there to learn more.

05:47:44.680 --> 05:47:47.490
I'm not going to go in
more detail about it

05:47:47.490 --> 05:47:51.410
but I don't know what
resource like anywhere.

05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:54.980
I don't know any organization
in this country or frankly

05:47:54.980 --> 05:47:58.470
for the Ed Med or any country
that has the kind of resources

05:47:58.470 --> 05:48:04.030
that this place had that
could do something like that.

05:48:04.030 --> 05:48:05.330
&gt;&gt; Anthony Bloome:
Well thank you Rob.

05:48:05.330 --> 05:48:08.340
So John, all these people
are waving their Magic Wands.

05:48:08.340 --> 05:48:12.540
Our session is done but I would
say in this period of partnership,

05:48:12.540 --> 05:48:14.050
you know, we found particularly

05:48:14.050 --> 05:48:15.980
with the [inaudible]
grand challenge model.

05:48:15.980 --> 05:48:18.640
If you have a problem there's good
will and there's people out there

05:48:18.640 --> 05:48:22.600
that are probably have some ideas
to help you achieve a solution.

05:48:22.600 --> 05:48:25.260 position:56%
So I want to thank once again and
ask you to please join me in a round

05:48:25.260 --> 05:48:27.510 position:56%
of applause for our three panelists.

05:48:27.510 --> 05:48:31.160
[ Applause ]

05:48:31.160 --> 05:48:32.870
And invite John to come back up.

05:48:32.870 --> 05:48:35.170
Thank you.

05:48:43.100 --> 05:48:45.480
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well first a
couple of thank yous to everybody

05:48:45.480 --> 05:48:46.950
for sticking it out with us.

05:48:46.950 --> 05:48:48.580
Gosh, we've had quite a day.

05:48:48.580 --> 05:48:50.330
It's been a wonderful day.

05:48:50.330 --> 05:48:55.190
I am going to respond but first I'd
like Dr. Sullivan said he has been

05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:59.770
with us all day and I'm looking
around and I wanted to ask him

05:48:59.770 --> 05:49:02.520
if he's willing to make some
comments on what he's heard

05:49:02.520 --> 05:49:05.640
and maybe present another challenge
for the Library of Congress

05:49:05.640 --> 05:49:08.370
to which I will attempt to respond.

05:49:08.370 --> 05:49:09.670
Would you mind?

05:49:09.670 --> 05:49:12.410
Would you like-- Yes,
let's get a microphone.

05:49:12.410 --> 05:49:19.140
&gt;&gt; Well, let me say again for me
this has been a very exciting,

05:49:19.140 --> 05:49:23.570
very rewarding day and I
think I've learned a lot

05:49:23.570 --> 05:49:26.420
from all of the presenters here.

05:49:26.420 --> 05:49:31.960
I was thinking it was back
in 1979 that Joyous Richmond

05:49:31.960 --> 05:49:34.070
when he was surgeon general
and assistant secretary

05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:38.300
of health issued a report
called Healthy People.

05:49:38.300 --> 05:49:42.780
That was a prescription for indeed
people taking responsibility

05:49:42.780 --> 05:49:45.940
for their own health in
setting goals for them

05:49:45.940 --> 05:49:50.890
and it's been my pleasure
and opportunity as secretary

05:49:50.890 --> 05:49:54.160
to issue an update
Healthy People 2000

05:49:54.160 --> 05:49:57.040
which we issues in
September of 1990.

05:49:57.040 --> 05:49:59.230
It had grown then.

05:49:59.230 --> 05:50:04.380
We had some 298 objectives for
people really taking responsibility

05:50:04.380 --> 05:50:08.220
for their health and showing
people the power that they had

05:50:08.220 --> 05:50:15.790
to indeed protect their health
and project their health forward.

05:50:15.790 --> 05:50:20.710
That has really now it its
current iteration is now Healthy

05:50:20.710 --> 05:50:22.520
People 2020.

05:50:22.520 --> 05:50:25.250
So this has been a growing effort.

05:50:25.250 --> 05:50:30.590
It has become much-- The public
has become much more aware of this,

05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:35.230
individual citizens, companies
promoting health behavior

05:50:35.230 --> 05:50:37.630
in their employees
and the recognition

05:50:37.630 --> 05:50:40.440
of the business community
that a healthy work

05:50:40.440 --> 05:50:42.440
for us is a positive for them.

05:50:42.440 --> 05:50:46.250
I was pleased to see the business
representation here today.

05:50:46.250 --> 05:50:52.500
So, I think that with the growing
interest and focus on this as well

05:50:52.500 --> 05:50:57.660 position:56%
as the fact that with the Affordable
Care Act we've now provided added

05:50:57.660 --> 05:50:59.440
resources for this.

05:50:59.440 --> 05:51:03.360
This is a great opportunity so
I think we have a lot yet to do,

05:51:03.360 --> 05:51:07.900
a lot of challenges but I think the
environment is much more positive.

05:51:07.900 --> 05:51:12.070
Twenty or 30 years ago much of
what today's discussion was about,

05:51:12.070 --> 05:51:15.730
people would have interpreted as
well kind of feel good activity,

05:51:15.730 --> 05:51:17.330 position:56%
something that makes you feel better

05:51:17.330 --> 05:51:19.630
but we don't really
know whether it works.

05:51:19.630 --> 05:51:22.540
But then now have been
enough studies showing

05:51:22.540 --> 05:51:27.710
that physical activity reduces
death rates, reduces heart disease,

05:51:27.710 --> 05:51:32.670
diabetes make slow the progression
of development of Alzheimer's.

05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:38.230
So, I think we have enough now
that the kinds of activities

05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:41.880
that have been described
today really should go forward

05:51:41.880 --> 05:51:45.160
and as we heard from our
business colleagues return

05:51:45.160 --> 05:51:49.340
on investment is now
very much documented.

05:51:49.340 --> 05:51:53.200
So I think this for me has
been a very enlightening day,

05:51:53.200 --> 05:51:56.050
a very encouraging day and I
certainly think the Library

05:51:56.050 --> 05:51:57.820
of Congress is a great place

05:51:57.820 --> 05:52:01.260
to really help get this movement
further around the country

05:52:01.260 --> 05:52:03.720 position:56%
so those are my comments, thank you.

05:52:03.720 --> 05:52:05.020
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well,
thank you very much.

05:52:05.020 --> 05:52:07.560
And thank you for joining us
today it's really been a joy

05:52:07.560 --> 05:52:10.040
and you've made a major
contribution.

05:52:10.040 --> 05:52:13.710
I see a couple of other people
before I present we're not going

05:52:13.710 --> 05:52:16.310
on much longer it's
been a wonderful day

05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:20.440
but Laura Bailey has
been with me for this.

05:52:20.440 --> 05:52:24.660
We have done the planning with
help from many others for this.

05:52:24.660 --> 05:52:28.940
I'm wondering if you might want
to say a few things about today

05:52:28.940 --> 05:52:34.340 position:56%
and Robi would you like to say a few
things in a minute and then I'll try

05:52:34.340 --> 05:52:38.390
to rewind this up and get us out of
here with promises for the future

05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:40.860
that I hope we can follow up on?

05:52:40.860 --> 05:52:43.590
&gt;&gt; Well, I would also
to thank John and all

05:52:43.590 --> 05:52:47.250
of his helpers at Library
of Congress.

05:52:47.250 --> 05:52:52.650 position:56%
I was kind of saying to John and
others at a meeting in February here

05:52:52.650 --> 05:52:56.930
that I don't think you always
realize the power of your brand

05:52:56.930 --> 05:53:00.640
and the Library of Congress
is a brand like no other.

05:53:00.640 --> 05:53:06.390 position:56%
And I think when you put your name
behind the cause really great things

05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:11.430
can happen and I so appreciate
everyone who's been here all day,

05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:15.890
all the speakers, all the planning
that went in to your comments

05:53:15.890 --> 05:53:18.300
and I hope it was a
good for everyone.

05:53:18.300 --> 05:53:20.010
I certainly learned a lot.

05:53:20.010 --> 05:53:25.070 position:56%
I do think that the theme of urgency
came up a couple of times Jeff

05:53:25.070 --> 05:53:27.120
and I talked about that at lunch

05:53:27.120 --> 05:53:31.150
and then Rebecca mentioned
the urgency is her Magic Wand,

05:53:31.150 --> 05:53:37.480
how do we keep this issue present
and have that sense of urgency.

05:53:37.480 --> 05:53:39.240
We really do know enough

05:53:39.240 --> 05:53:42.880
to certainly make things
much better than they are.

05:53:42.880 --> 05:53:47.130
And so, where do we find that
urgency and will to work together

05:53:47.130 --> 05:53:50.560
in some new ways to get
this done, so thank you

05:53:50.560 --> 05:53:51.860
and I'll pass it to Robbie.

05:53:51.860 --> 05:53:53.160
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you very much.

05:53:53.160 --> 05:53:56.820
&gt;&gt; Robbie Harris: It's a privilege
right now to say a few words,

05:53:56.820 --> 05:54:00.620
just a few, at the end to be here.

05:54:00.620 --> 05:54:05.560
I'm just sitting thinking
about the fact that as authors

05:54:05.560 --> 05:54:08.890
and illustrators as I
mentioned this morning we're

05:54:08.890 --> 05:54:12.640
on our own room working a way
and then with our publishers

05:54:12.640 --> 05:54:15.450
and editors and wonderful people.

05:54:15.450 --> 05:54:21.640
But we're not out there doing the
work that all of you are doing

05:54:21.640 --> 05:54:29.070 position:56%
so what I hope and what I learned
from today is that I want to go back

05:54:29.070 --> 05:54:36.170
to my friends and colleagues
and everybody in the field

05:54:36.170 --> 05:54:41.300
of children's books
and all even apps,

05:54:41.300 --> 05:54:47.150
people are creating apps what's
going online and say, you know,

05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:51.870
there's something about health
out there that all of those can do

05:54:51.870 --> 05:54:56.400
and continue to do if we
really, really care deeply

05:54:56.400 --> 05:55:00.250
about the children in
out family and certainly,

05:55:00.250 --> 05:55:04.360
thank you all who've talked about
our most vulnerable families

05:55:04.360 --> 05:55:11.160 position:56%
and ways that hopefully one can help
those families move out of poverty.

05:55:11.160 --> 05:55:15.200
And I think this is
certainly that's the record--

05:55:15.200 --> 05:55:19.950
that struck a chord in me, so many
people talked about it so thank you

05:55:19.950 --> 05:55:22.670
for all that all of you do.

05:55:22.670 --> 05:55:25.440
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And finally-- Jeff
would you like to say something

05:55:25.440 --> 05:55:28.220
at the end today and this
will be the last person call--

05:55:28.220 --> 05:55:30.480
&gt;&gt; Oh that's pressure John.

05:55:30.480 --> 05:55:31.780
&gt;&gt; John Cole: No, no.

05:55:31.780 --> 05:55:33.230
I'm putting the pressure
on myself Jeff.

05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:35.850
I just want you folks to get
a chance to say something.

05:55:35.850 --> 05:55:39.270
&gt;&gt; Well I just want to thank again
everybody for participating today

05:55:39.270 --> 05:55:41.710
and as I've said to several
people during the day.

05:55:41.710 --> 05:55:44.250
This is really one of the few
opportunities, unfortunately one

05:55:44.250 --> 05:55:48.560
of the few opportunities we
have for so many people who look

05:55:48.560 --> 05:55:51.820 position:56%
at this problem from so many
different place whether it's working

05:55:51.820 --> 05:55:55.420
with adults as I do, whether
it's working with government,

05:55:55.420 --> 05:56:00.920
private sector, business,
children's literacy and in health

05:56:00.920 --> 05:56:04.230
and it doesn't happen often
enough and I think, you know,

05:56:04.230 --> 05:56:09.090
when we saw the connections being
made and the recommendations

05:56:09.090 --> 05:56:10.390
that you're talking about Tony,

05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:13.700
you can see how much value
these kind of discussions have.

05:56:13.700 --> 05:56:16.310
And I guess I would just end
with, you know, I hope we live

05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:18.910
with that spirit that this
is a collective issue.

05:56:18.910 --> 05:56:23.820
There's a lot of energy and
it's incredibly important,

05:56:23.820 --> 05:56:29.200
we talked a lot about early
childhood and how crucial that is.

05:56:29.200 --> 05:56:30.680
But it goes beyond.

05:56:30.680 --> 05:56:36.380
It goes also to older children,
teenagers and of course adults

05:56:36.380 --> 05:56:39.500
and we've got to look
at this problem

05:56:39.500 --> 05:56:43.770 position:56%
from all those perspectives I think
for us to make significant progress.

05:56:43.770 --> 05:56:45.930
So again thank you to everyone

05:56:45.930 --> 05:56:48.770
who put this day together it
was wonderful and thank you John

05:56:48.770 --> 05:56:51.840
and I look forward to
your closing remarks.

05:56:51.840 --> 05:56:56.570
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I'm going to promise
things right that, who knows.

05:56:56.570 --> 05:56:59.670
Also however Tony thank
you, I mean we've--

05:56:59.670 --> 05:57:03.810
it's been a wonderful experience
inside the library to do this

05:57:03.810 --> 05:57:06.060
and I'll just share
that with you a little.

05:57:06.060 --> 05:57:10.140
First we have three or four board
members from the literacy board

05:57:10.140 --> 05:57:13.350
which is I'm going to say a little
bit about the literacy project

05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:16.250
and how we might with
literacy awards program

05:57:16.250 --> 05:57:18.170
and how we might carry forward.

05:57:18.170 --> 05:57:22.310
But even within the Library of
Congress today and I was so pleased

05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:25.600
that we had our own,
Dr. Charles was here,

05:57:25.600 --> 05:57:29.390
the people from health
services I learned a lot

05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:31.280
about what the Library of Congress.

05:57:31.280 --> 05:57:36.360
We are a big organization,
3800 people spread all

05:57:36.360 --> 05:57:39.110
over this area and in other places.

05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:43.030
And I was so pleased in their
interest in this and I learned

05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:48.670
and that's another example of, you
know, we need to get to talk more

05:57:48.670 --> 05:57:51.420
and learn about our own
organizations and see

05:57:51.420 --> 05:57:53.150
which way they're headed.

05:57:53.150 --> 05:57:55.980
Now the library of congress has--

05:57:55.980 --> 05:57:59.450
is an exciting part of our history
right now because the new Librarian

05:57:59.450 --> 05:58:01.700
of Congress has been nominated.

05:58:01.700 --> 05:58:08.600
We are hoping that there will be
hearings soon and I was so pleased

05:58:08.600 --> 05:58:12.820
that the department of education
had a hearing on a new leader

05:58:12.820 --> 05:58:16.830
and nobody stop that
and it sailed through

05:58:16.830 --> 05:58:20.530
and we are hoping for
new leadership.

05:58:20.530 --> 05:58:22.860
It also has to be confirmed
by the senate

05:58:22.860 --> 05:58:28.350
which is I'm pausing a little
bit here but we have great hopes.

05:58:28.350 --> 05:58:31.500
So here are some of
the opportunities

05:58:31.500 --> 05:58:33.380
and I appreciate what people said.

05:58:33.380 --> 05:58:37.670
I see them through my job, my
two fold job for which I'm paid

05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:41.390
and my other job for which I'm
not paid which is as a historian

05:58:41.390 --> 05:58:42.990
of the Library of Congress.

05:58:42.990 --> 05:58:47.340
I can see an opportunity coming
historically for this institution

05:58:47.340 --> 05:58:52.230
with new leadership because a lot
has happened in terms of outreach

05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:57.110
and those of you who were able to
join us last night met the person

05:58:57.110 --> 05:59:02.630
who introduced Dr. Bailey, Jane
who is the new director of national

05:59:02.630 --> 05:59:04.500
and international outreach.

05:59:04.500 --> 05:59:09.060
And this is the new department
comes out of a larger department

05:59:09.060 --> 05:59:13.630 position:56%
but it indicates a new interest in
outreach for the Library of Congress

05:59:13.630 --> 05:59:19.300
that is above board, it's the name
of the organization is outreach.

05:59:19.300 --> 05:59:22.930
And the Library of Congress has
had a lot of outreach going on

05:59:22.930 --> 05:59:27.930
but it's been segmented and it's
not really been up front in the way

05:59:27.930 --> 05:59:31.650
that it needs to be now
because as an institution

05:59:31.650 --> 05:59:36.690
as we've developed
we had 5200 employees

05:59:36.690 --> 05:59:39.330
in the Library of Congress in 1992.

05:59:39.330 --> 05:59:41.350
We now have 3800.

05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:43.920
We have not given up
a single function.

05:59:43.920 --> 05:59:46.460
We still have strong prestige.

05:59:46.460 --> 05:59:50.980 position:56%
We still have dedicated people who
were working on each of these areas.

05:59:50.980 --> 05:59:53.190 position:56%
One of the reasons that numbers gone

05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:57.100
down is a good reason it's
cataloging it's been centralized

05:59:57.100 --> 06:00:00.910
they are-- automation has helped us

06:00:00.910 --> 06:00:04.010
but we're also doing
a lot of outsourcing.

06:00:04.010 --> 06:00:10.380 position:56%
So we haven't lost any functions and
in the mean time outreach has grown.

06:00:10.380 --> 06:00:13.650
And part of it is our
presence on the website.

06:00:13.650 --> 06:00:17.820
When we first develop the
national digital library of

06:00:17.820 --> 06:00:21.360
and then eventually the
worldwide web came along,

06:00:21.360 --> 06:00:24.820
the Library of Congress did some
testing for the digitalization

06:00:24.820 --> 06:00:28.770
that we've been doing and had
struck a bargain with congress

06:00:28.770 --> 06:00:33.370 position:56%
about funding yet another new office
and the bargain that was struck was

06:00:33.370 --> 06:00:38.000
if we paid with private money
with a Madison council group

06:00:38.000 --> 06:00:43.230
that supports us to get started
with the national digital library

06:00:43.230 --> 06:00:49.380
and then did some testing about
who is using our digitize product

06:00:49.380 --> 06:00:54.120
which turned to be American history
American memory would congress go

06:00:54.120 --> 06:00:59.100
along and help fund the development
of this national digital library?

06:00:59.100 --> 06:01:04.040
Well, we succeeded in that but
guess what the new survey did

06:01:04.040 --> 06:01:05.680
after two years.

06:01:05.680 --> 06:01:09.450
It showed us we had a whole
new class of users, students

06:01:09.450 --> 06:01:13.360
and teachers were using
American memory and some

06:01:13.360 --> 06:01:16.540
of our digitized products.

06:01:16.540 --> 06:01:18.650
And one of the results
was the creation

06:01:18.650 --> 06:01:21.060
of something called
educational outreach.

06:01:21.060 --> 06:01:24.970
So for the first time we have a
major outreach function funded

06:01:24.970 --> 06:01:28.770
by congress to reach out
to teachers and students.

06:01:28.770 --> 06:01:33.420
And they bring students here to
learn how to use online resources.

06:01:33.420 --> 06:01:37.550
I'm going towards this idea of
reaching out internationally

06:01:37.550 --> 06:01:40.670
because our international
role has grown

06:01:40.670 --> 06:01:44.540
since World War II the
same time the worldwide web

06:01:44.540 --> 06:01:47.890
and this new educational
outreach has started.

06:01:47.890 --> 06:01:50.110
And our new emphasis has got to be

06:01:50.110 --> 06:01:55.350 position:56%
and I'm sure the new librarian will
recognize this on the education side

06:01:55.350 --> 06:01:59.090
and in the areas-- so this is
actually impart why the center

06:01:59.090 --> 06:02:02.620
for the book was created with
Dr. Boorstin [assumed spelling]

06:02:02.620 --> 06:02:04.630
where he looking ahead
we were reaching

06:02:04.630 --> 06:02:07.200
out to promote books in reading.

06:02:07.200 --> 06:02:11.520
And one of the answer actually when
I'm thinking of Rob in a way is

06:02:11.520 --> 06:02:16.190
that we have established centers
every state, we don't pay for them,

06:02:16.190 --> 06:02:19.570
they are partnership
organizations that have the job

06:02:19.570 --> 06:02:26.000 position:56%
of promoting locally books, reading,
literacy and libraries in that area

06:02:26.000 --> 06:02:30.040
and that's closely
associated with state pride.

06:02:30.040 --> 06:02:34.860
And each state wants to have and
keep a state center but they have

06:02:34.860 --> 06:02:36.160
to do something and they have

06:02:36.160 --> 06:02:39.280
to really reevaluate
after every three years.

06:02:39.280 --> 06:02:45.590 position:56%
And as the installation of the pride
in the state and put it together

06:02:45.590 --> 06:02:49.380
in our country but it's
the state pride issue

06:02:49.380 --> 06:02:53.240
which we also are capitalizing
on in such a way that we have

06:02:53.240 --> 06:02:55.000
in Alaska center for the book.

06:02:55.000 --> 06:02:59.150
They tell you what work they do,
they promote reading and literacy

06:02:59.150 --> 06:03:04.950 position:56%
in Alaska but they use it with the
state library and they do data basis

06:03:04.950 --> 06:03:07.690
about Alaska writers each state.

06:03:07.690 --> 06:03:09.450
And we have helped develop

06:03:09.450 --> 06:03:13.190
through our national book
festival a whole system of state

06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:14.670
and regional book festivals.

06:03:14.670 --> 06:03:17.140
We don't run them they're
locally done.

06:03:17.140 --> 06:03:22.820 position:56%
But it's a long this idea of rebirth
at the state level of activities

06:03:22.820 --> 06:03:25.550
that are related to
education, books,

06:03:25.550 --> 06:03:28.400
reading, literacy and libraries.

06:03:28.400 --> 06:03:32.150
And I think that if I have, you
know, I have much to say about it

06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:40.480
and I'm working hard at it is the
area with this where we are headed.

06:03:40.480 --> 06:03:43.430
David Rubenstein has
helped us immensely.

06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:48.480
He the benefactor I talked about
earlier today by doing the funding

06:03:48.480 --> 06:03:51.530
for the national book festival, I
mean, for the Library of Congress

06:03:51.530 --> 06:03:57.060
to have a national book festival
free that celebrates readers

06:03:57.060 --> 06:04:01.000
and writers and now has moved
to the conventions center.

06:04:01.000 --> 06:04:04.750
And last year the convention
center put out a news release,

06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:07.740
we moved from the mall on
to the convention center.

06:04:07.740 --> 06:04:11.980
It said that one day crowd was
the largest crowd in the history

06:04:11.980 --> 06:04:13.950 position:56%
of the Washington Convention Center.

06:04:13.950 --> 06:04:21.620
They estimated 125 to 150,000
people came to that program

06:04:21.620 --> 06:04:27.650
which now Mr. Rubenstein with the
development of the program part

06:04:27.650 --> 06:04:35.310 position:56%
of today also is helping with the
literacy corner at the book festival

06:04:35.310 --> 06:04:37.870
and with the outreach
that we are doing

06:04:37.870 --> 06:04:42.430
with the literacy awards program
is being tied in institutionally

06:04:42.430 --> 06:04:45.790
in ways that I think give
me hope for just some

06:04:45.790 --> 06:04:47.680
of the suggestions that were here.

06:04:47.680 --> 06:04:51.230
I didn't mention Judy is
still here but I mention--

06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:54.750
should have answered with
having NLS as part of this along

06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:57.250
with health services
the center for the book.

06:04:57.250 --> 06:05:03.020
We are able to pull the library
together in this area of reading

06:05:03.020 --> 06:05:06.190
and literacy promotion in
ways that we've not done.

06:05:06.190 --> 06:05:10.940
Now, this isn't a complete answer
but it is an answer I think

06:05:10.940 --> 06:05:15.850
to the hopefulness of carrying
on with some of the ideas

06:05:15.850 --> 06:05:17.880
that we've talked about today

06:05:17.880 --> 06:05:21.450
because Mr. Rubinstein
is quite interested

06:05:21.450 --> 06:05:25.980
in helping support this kind
of activity and with the help

06:05:25.980 --> 06:05:30.440
from our partners and our advisory
board members who are here today,

06:05:30.440 --> 06:05:36.360 position:56%
we continue to stretch literacy and
the Library of Congress in new ways.

06:05:36.360 --> 06:05:41.600
Last year's symposium was literacy
in poetry, this year it's poetry,

06:05:41.600 --> 06:05:45.940
it's literacy and health and we've
made new friends and new partners.

06:05:45.940 --> 06:05:49.800
There'll be another one next year,
two people and are meeting on,

06:05:49.800 --> 06:05:52.220
the day before yesterday, they
say it's got to be on literacy

06:05:52.220 --> 06:05:55.070
and technology and we'll
have another board member

06:05:55.070 --> 06:05:59.520
who really thinks it should be on
literacy and indigenous cultures

06:05:59.520 --> 06:06:02.860
which would bring us into
a whole another range

06:06:02.860 --> 06:06:08.570
of partners plus we have picked up
partners along the way, Reach Out

06:06:08.570 --> 06:06:15.010
and Read was here today and, you
know, the fact that it not only,

06:06:15.010 --> 06:06:17.800
you know, was-- it isn't
here because it was a winner

06:06:17.800 --> 06:06:21.160
of the Rubinstein Award,
it's here because its work is

06:06:21.160 --> 06:06:24.240
so important to what we're doing.

06:06:24.240 --> 06:06:29.500
And so we're going to be using the
literacy awards program also funded

06:06:29.500 --> 06:06:32.930
by Mr. Rubinstein as part
of this outreach effort.

06:06:32.930 --> 06:06:37.590
. And I explained, I-- well,
other some of people weren't here

06:06:37.590 --> 06:06:42.480 position:56%
and I'll slow down in a second, but
we're expanding the number of awards

06:06:42.480 --> 06:06:46.600
that are organizations that are
recognized through their work

06:06:46.600 --> 06:06:48.190
in literacy in this program,

06:06:48.190 --> 06:06:52.000
I talked about that a
little bit last night.

06:06:52.000 --> 06:06:55.740
And we would be able to expand
and to include the range

06:06:55.740 --> 06:06:57.780
of organizations that are here.

06:06:57.780 --> 06:07:02.490
And we also want to look back
to past winners, if you are part

06:07:02.490 --> 06:07:05.660
of the network now and
even though Reach Out

06:07:05.660 --> 06:07:08.970
and Read has always been a reading
and literacy promotion partner

06:07:08.970 --> 06:07:12.940
to help with this new outreach.

06:07:12.940 --> 06:07:17.170
So I end up, I'm sorry I'm going
on a bit but I'm optimistic

06:07:17.170 --> 06:07:21.590
and this kind of meeting
has teach me optimistic

06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:27.340
because I can see partners and
interest and I also as a historian

06:07:27.340 --> 06:07:30.750
of the Library of the Congress
know its potential in terms

06:07:30.750 --> 06:07:32.680
of international outreach.

06:07:32.680 --> 06:07:39.320
I know its potential in terms of
technology and part of this is--

06:07:39.320 --> 06:07:43.010
and I also know the potential
of having new leadership

06:07:43.010 --> 06:07:45.270
in an organization like this.

06:07:45.270 --> 06:07:50.230
Library of Congress was created
in 1800, we've had 13 librarians

06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:54.050
of congress, it's a long term
of offices especially who one

06:07:54.050 --> 06:07:57.670
of them only lasted a year
and a half, he died in office.

06:07:57.670 --> 06:08:01.060
So you're talking about,
now there's a limitation

06:08:01.060 --> 06:08:04.040
which I think is a good thing
on the term of the library

06:08:04.040 --> 06:08:06.970
and of the congress
to a total of 20 years

06:08:06.970 --> 06:08:10.010
with 10 year and a 10 year renewal.

06:08:10.010 --> 06:08:15.430
But it is a period historically
that is will be a revitalization

06:08:15.430 --> 06:08:21.350
for the library and your presence
in the planning that's been done

06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:26.220
in bringing us all together, I
consider to be an important part

06:08:26.220 --> 06:08:30.910
of it and I would challenge myself
and I challenge the rest of you

06:08:30.910 --> 06:08:35.790
to keep us on the track
that you've helped us step

06:08:35.790 --> 06:08:38.050
on today and move ahead.

06:08:38.050 --> 06:08:41.420
So I'm going to end, thank you
all for participating especially

06:08:41.420 --> 06:08:44.550
to Laura and board members,

06:08:44.550 --> 06:08:48.250
the NEMOURS was we couldn't
have done this without NEMOURS

06:08:48.250 --> 06:08:53.420
and we're just very pleased
with everything that's going on

06:08:53.420 --> 06:08:56.100
and I think we have a number
of our participants here

06:08:56.100 --> 06:09:00.440 position:56%
and let's give them a hand and thank
you very much for being with us.

06:09:00.440 --> 06:09:03.070
We'll be back in touch but let's--

06:09:03.070 --> 06:09:05.130
[ Applause ]

06:09:05.130 --> 06:09:08.770
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
