00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 align:start position:0%
are IQ tests so now they're more
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.269 align:start position:0%
are IQ tests so now they're more

crystallized than fluid we'll get to
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.740 align:start position:0%
crystallized than fluid we'll get to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 align:start position:0%
that in a minute but crystallized
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 align:start position:0%
that in a minute but crystallized
knowledge<00:00:34.079><c> is</c><00:00:34.200><c> what</c><00:00:34.350><c> you</c><00:00:34.469><c> accrue</c><00:00:34.739><c> across</c><00:00:35.010><c> time</c>

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 align:start position:0%
knowledge is what you accrue across time
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge is what you accrue across time
so<00:00:35.910><c> you</c><00:00:35.969><c> could</c><00:00:36.090><c> say</c><00:00:36.300><c> that</c><00:00:36.329><c> fluid</c><00:00:37.290><c> intelligence</c>

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 align:start position:0%
so you could say that fluid intelligence
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.130 align:start position:0%
so you could say that fluid intelligence
is<00:00:37.980><c> what</c><00:00:38.129><c> programs</c><00:00:38.550><c> your</c><00:00:38.760><c> brain</c><00:00:38.969><c> it</c><00:00:39.690><c> fills</c><00:00:39.989><c> it</c>

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
is what programs your brain it fills it
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
is what programs your brain it fills it
with<00:00:40.170><c> facts</c><00:00:40.770><c> let's</c><00:00:40.950><c> say</c><00:00:41.129><c> it</c><00:00:41.250><c> filled</c><00:00:41.460><c> it</c><00:00:41.579><c> with</c>

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 align:start position:0%
with facts let's say it filled it with
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 align:start position:0%
with facts let's say it filled it with
knowledge<00:00:42.059><c> and</c><00:00:42.300><c> then</c><00:00:42.840><c> but</c><00:00:43.230><c> you</c><00:00:43.410><c> can</c><00:00:43.559><c> get</c><00:00:43.710><c> an</c>

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge and then but you can get an
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.110 align:start position:0%
knowledge and then but you can get an
estimate<00:00:44.190><c> of</c><00:00:44.250><c> your</c><00:00:44.370><c> intelligence</c><00:00:44.730><c> by</c>

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
estimate of your intelligence by
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.209 align:start position:0%
estimate of your intelligence by

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 align:start position:0%
sampling your domain of factual
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
sampling your domain of factual
knowledge<00:00:47.460><c> and</c><00:00:47.850><c> the</c><00:00:48.539><c> reason</c><00:00:48.840><c> for</c><00:00:48.960><c> that</c><00:00:49.020><c> is</c>

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the reason for that is
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the reason for that is
that<00:00:49.320><c> well</c><00:00:49.950><c> obviously</c><00:00:50.489><c> the</c><00:00:51.000><c> better</c><00:00:51.149><c> the</c>

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
that well obviously the better the
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
that well obviously the better the
programmer<00:00:51.809><c> the</c><00:00:52.020><c> better</c><00:00:52.199><c> the</c><00:00:52.379><c> content</c><00:00:52.890><c> and</c><00:00:53.100><c> so</c>

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 align:start position:0%
programmer the better the content and so
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 align:start position:0%
programmer the better the content and so
what<00:00:53.760><c> that</c><00:00:53.789><c> also</c><00:00:54.059><c> means</c><00:00:54.210><c> is</c><00:00:54.510><c> that</c><00:00:54.570><c> you</c><00:00:54.840><c> can</c><00:00:55.020><c> you</c>

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
what that also means is that you can you
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 align:start position:0%
what that also means is that you can you
could<00:00:55.949><c> if</c><00:00:56.190><c> you</c><00:00:56.399><c> were</c><00:00:56.550><c> did</c><00:00:56.910><c> prefrontal</c><00:00:57.449><c> cortex</c>

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
could if you were did prefrontal cortex
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.130 align:start position:0%
could if you were did prefrontal cortex
was<00:00:58.109><c> damaged</c><00:00:58.590><c> later</c><00:00:58.949><c> in</c><00:00:59.160><c> life</c><00:00:59.539><c> your</c><00:01:00.539><c> fluid</c><00:01:00.809><c> IQ</c>

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
was damaged later in life your fluid IQ
 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 align:start position:0%
was damaged later in life your fluid IQ
could<00:01:01.260><c> plummet</c><00:01:01.500><c> but</c><00:01:01.800><c> your</c><00:01:01.920><c> crystallized</c><00:01:02.399><c> IQ</c>

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 align:start position:0%
could plummet but your crystallized IQ
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 align:start position:0%
could plummet but your crystallized IQ
remain<00:01:03.059><c> more</c><00:01:03.239><c> or</c><00:01:03.300><c> less</c><00:01:03.390><c> intact</c><00:01:03.840><c> so</c><00:01:04.559><c> even</c>

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 align:start position:0%
least that's how it looks to me so okay
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 align:start position:0%
least that's how it looks to me so okay
so<00:01:19.500><c> how</c><00:01:19.950><c> smart</c><00:01:20.250><c> do</c><00:01:20.340><c> you</c><00:01:20.369><c> have</c><00:01:20.460><c> to</c><00:01:20.580><c> be</c><00:01:20.790><c> to</c><00:01:21.270><c> be</c>

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 align:start position:0%
