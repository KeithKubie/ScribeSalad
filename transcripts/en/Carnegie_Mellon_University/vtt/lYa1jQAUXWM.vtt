00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:06.013
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of
the Board of Trustees and the members of

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:10.706
the Academy, I now present you with the
tenth president of Carnegie University,

00:00:10.706 --> 00:00:13.060
Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.540
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Congratulations.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.999
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.830
Thank you.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.180
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.460
Thank you very much.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.020
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.120
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.080
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.840
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:01.276
Chairman Rohr, trustees,

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:06.020
faculty, colleagues, students,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.424
staff, alumni and honored guests,

00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:15.400
good morning, and thank you.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.354
It's a great honor and
a truly humbling experience to stand

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:29.469
here as the tenth president of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.772
I hereby accept the symbols,
the Office of the President and

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:39.037
all of the responsibility
pertaining thereto.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:49.037
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.736
&gt;&gt; It brings me great joy to celebrate
this occasion with my family,

00:01:55.736 --> 00:02:01.402
especially my wife Tris and
my children, Daniel, Thomas, and Sarah.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.008
Who have always been-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.600
&gt;&gt; Who have always been my greatest blessing.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.730
I am so touched by the presence of
friends, former students, colleagues and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.911
collaborators who have traveled
from across the country to be here.

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:29.369
Also, I want to acknowledge
community partners and

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.900
civic leaders from the Pittsburgh region
who are showing their support for

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.937
this university today and every day

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:43.173
and I would especially like
to thank my dear friends,

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:48.647
Marlene Behrmann, Keith Block
and Martha Pollack for

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:53.413
their kind and
thoughtful words this morning.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:56.003
Martha, I've been
following your footsteps.

00:02:56.003 --> 00:03:01.118
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What you didn't tell them is that,

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:05.141
you were my department head, and
my provost, my boss for many, many years.

00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.726
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I don't know what you

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:08.500
are planning to do next.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.257
I'm pretty happy to be here,
so don't do anything else.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:15.737
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:22.907
&gt;&gt;APPLAUSE]

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:25.392
&gt;&gt; Today's ceremony is a celebration

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:27.055
steeped in tradition.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:33.765
The singing of our national anthem,
our academic regalia.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.220
The iconic sound of bagpipes.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.275
These rituals remind us
that at this moment,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.950
it's not about the beginning
of my journey as president.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.100
Rather, this ceremony celebrates
our storied history as a

00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:58.759
community of scholars in a nation
driven by learning and discovery.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.390
CMU is relatively a young university.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.450
We've come so far in such a short time

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.390
and our accomplishments would have not
been possible without the leadership of

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.419
my predecessors.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.097
I especially want to acknowledge and

00:04:17.097 --> 00:04:21.821
thank President Emeritus Jerry Cohon and
past Provost-

00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:28.287
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:28.287 --> 00:04:30.672
&gt;&gt; and past provost Mark Kamlet-

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:33.135
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:33.135 --> 00:04:34.321
&gt;&gt; for their-

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:41.100
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.989
&gt;&gt; for their enduring commitment

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:44.299
to this university.

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:47.762
We are so grateful to you for
everything you have done for

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:50.005
Carnegie Mellon, Mark and Jerry.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:57.172
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:57.747
&gt;&gt; Of course,

00:04:57.747 --> 00:05:01.270
great leaders are inspired by
an extraordinary community.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.290
As Mark and Jerry can attest,
countless faculty, staff, alumni

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.283
and partners helped to build a foundation
of excellence CMU enjoys today.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.510
I am grateful to all the men and
women who have guided

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.930
this university since its founding,
and who will secure its future.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.110
In particular, I wish to recognize
the members of Carnegie Mellon's Board of

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.650
Trustees who are the stewards
of this institution.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.650
I am so grateful for
their trust they have placed in me.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.880
Trustees, would you please
stand to be recognized?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.537
Carnegie Mellon Trustees.

00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:49.379
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:50.295
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.160
Please be seated.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.240
I would also like to acknowledge and thank
the university deans, vice provost and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.440
executive management team,
my co-conspirators who do so

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.700
much to advance CMU everyday.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.991
Would the university leadership team,
please stand to be recognized.

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:11.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:21.895
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:25.120
&gt;&gt; Like many of us here,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.335
I left home as a teenager
to pursue an education.

00:06:29.335 --> 00:06:33.430
As I prepared for
my journey from Iran to Texas,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.323
I remember asking my
mother to help me pack.

00:06:37.323 --> 00:06:42.160
She said, "pack light because whatever

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.123
you need, you will find there."

00:06:46.123 --> 00:06:51.060
Pack light because whatever you need,
you will find there.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.080
And so as I left home, with little
more than a sense of optimism, and

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.210
a desire to make the most of
the incredible opportunities

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.420
that only an education in
the United States could provide.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.300
I've carried my mother's words
with me over these many years.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.600
I think her advice may have been based
on hope that I would return home

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.740
once the initial excitement wore off,
but I was pretty stubborn.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.500
In fact, I got my tenacity from her

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.580
along with a work ethic
instilled in me by my father.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.330
My siblings who are here
can attest to that.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.610
But looking back, perhaps my mother
was hinting at the knowledge

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.720
I would accumulate in the journey ahead.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.840
As a teacher and advisor,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.800
I came to understand the incredible
power of education to change lives.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.310
As a researcher, mentor, entrepreneur,
I observed the potential of

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.630
a single idea to launch a new enterprise
or disrupt an entire industry.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.200
And during my time in public
service in Washington DC,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.200
I saw how these ideas,
how the ideas emerging from higher

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.210
education serve as the foundation
of our success as a nation.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.967
My 30-year career ultimately led me here,

00:08:23.967 --> 00:08:29.496
to this city and
this university, this community.

00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:38.860
Our community embodies all of my most
fervent beliefs and my greatest passions.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.766
Every day at CMU, I am inspired by you.

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:48.361
Here, the world's most ambitious
students collaborate at the edges and

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:52.970
intersections of diverse fields, and
go on to change the world as alumni.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:01.040
Here, faculty leave an indelible mark
on society through their scholarship.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.748
Here, professionals and

00:09:02.748 --> 00:09:07.570
dedicated staff create an environment
that support our shared success.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:16.670
These are the people and the ideals that
set CMU apart from the very beginning,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.070
when Andrew Carnegie founded
the Carnegie Technical Schools to educate

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.490
the sons and
daughters of factory workers in 1900.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.653
Early, it's in evolution,
this institution would house two great

00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:38.930
learning environments, the College of
Engineering and the College of Fine Arts.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.060
You see, right from the start,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.230
we were bringing together creativity and
industry.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.730
Our willingness to take risks
continued into the 20th century,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.845
when we became the first degree granting
drama institution in the United States

00:09:57.845 --> 00:10:05.900
and then when the Mellon Institute
of Research founded by

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.850
Richard Andrew Mellon merged with Carnegie Tech,
to create Carnegie Mellon University

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.200
and again, when Newell, Simon, Perlis, and

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.350
Raj Reddy came to dominate the emerging
field of computer science

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:25.599
and established artificial intelligence
as the next frontier in human progress.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.100
To paraphrase CS pioneer Grace Hopper,
the most

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.050
dangerous phrase in the English language
is, "we've always done it this way."

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:43.310
So at a time when computers were
barely understood, we were among

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:49.402
the very first to recognize the power of
computing and we made some big bets.

00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:53.470
In 1965, we established our
Department of Computer Science.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:58.582
In 1979, we founded the first
Robotics Institute at a US university.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:11:02.290
In 1984, we attracted funding
from the federal government

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.418
to launch
the Software Engineering Institute.

00:11:04.418 --> 00:11:07.360
And in 1988,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.020
we announced the first college in the
world devoted solely to computer science.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.121
Ours is still the model
that others follow.

00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:29.888
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:33.249
&gt;&gt; In the process,
we've created new fields of inquiry,

00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:37.980
such as machine learning, transition
design, and the science of learning.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.520
We've magnified our societal impact
through technologies like autonomous

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.220
vehicles and additive manufacturing

00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:52.243
and we did all of this, while also
cleaning up at the Tonys, the Emmys and

00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:53.898
the Putnam competition.

00:11:53.898 --> 00:12:03.523
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:07.280
&gt;&gt; There's a lot to be gained
by looking back at our past.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.120
We see who we are, who we've always been.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.558
Alumni from those early years
would certainly see themselves

00:12:17.558 --> 00:12:22.211
in today's students,
entrepreneurial, creative,

00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:27.261
collaborative, whip smart,
and just a little bit quirky.

00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:32.635
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; While the past has left a bright trail,

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:36.240
the future is arriving faster
than anyone could have predicted

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.360
and you've heard several
speakers talk about that.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:45.270
Our entire world is adapting to
unprecedented advances that are rapidly

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.690
transforming our economy,
our society, and our culture.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:57.620
We must ask ourselves, how can higher
education fit into this dazzling future?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.150
Indeed, our industry has
recently come under scrutiny.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.340
This is not a new phenomenon.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:13.000
Academic institutions have often been seen
as, or criticized rather, as ivory towers.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.690
But there is no doubt that sustained
investment in research and

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.383
education has fueled our nation's
broad prosperity since World War II.

00:13:23.383 --> 00:13:33.342
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:36.609
&gt;&gt; Universities exemplify our faith in

00:13:36.609 --> 00:13:43.571
the power of education to transcend
social, economic and racial divides.

00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:47.687
To reinforce our role as
pillars of progressive society,

00:13:47.687 --> 00:13:51.131
higher education must
approach our mission with

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:55.690
renewed attention to the unique
demands of tomorrow.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.659
At stake is the ability of our
society to retain its fundamental

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:06.488
commitment to democracy, truth,
equity and freedom of expression.

00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:17.326
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:14:17.326 --> 00:14:18.694
&gt;&gt; At Carnegie Mellon,

00:14:18.694 --> 00:14:23.260
we have always responded to challenges
with trademark fearlessness.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:29.120
I'm reminded of the leadership
of Dick Cyert, who not only not

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.600
pioneered a new model for business
education as dean of our business school,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:40.010
but would later serve as one of
the most visionary CMU presidents.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.350
More than 40 years ago, he made bold,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.290
but calculated investments in the very
areas that define our leadership today.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:57.950
These risks were not always met with
broad support, but they paid off.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.090
As a result,
CMU grew from a small regional institution

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.879
to an international center
of higher education.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.460
The time to be intentionally
bold is once again upon us.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.210
We have a singular opportunity to
wield our exceptional strength,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.900
and make the next big investments
in our global leadership.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.350
Let's consider together what society
needs most from academic institutions

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.240
in the context of our two core missions,
research and education.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.120
At CMU, we advance human knowledge
through scholarly research, and

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.100
forge new connections to our
humanity through the arts.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.000
But the nature of research and
creativity is rapidly changing,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.910
increasingly becoming dependent on
people working across the boundaries of

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.630
established disciplines, and
on computational data-driven

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.710
approaches that are accelerating
discovery and innovation.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.157
This is precisely where CMU excels.

00:16:07.157 --> 00:16:12.151
In fact, we have cultivated
a distinct leadership where these

00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:16.970
two areas intersect at the nexus
of technology and society.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:24.274
Through this expertise we're enhancing
the way we live, work and communicate

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:31.262
and we're shaping modern culture through
visionary art, performance and design.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:41.440
CMU legend, Herb Simon once said, "we're
not observers of the future, we're actors."

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:47.590
Our job is to design a sustainable and
acceptable world and bring it about.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:55.789
This remains true, as true today as
when he said it more than 20 years ago.

00:16:57.782 --> 00:17:02.534
What has also remained constant is
the tremendous responsibility that

00:17:02.534 --> 00:17:04.440
comes with this influence.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:10.490
I was reminded of this last year when I
came across an editorial by David Brooks

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:15.640
in the New York Times which reflected
on Pittsburgh's renaissance.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.540
Of course, our connection to this
city is one of our greatest strengths.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.940
But this article,
while acknowledging CMU's positive impact,

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:33.950
also warned of a so-called
Carnegie Mellon layer of prosperity

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.360
that had not quite penetrated
working class neighborhoods.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.680
Indeed, we are witnessing
the disfranchisement of a growing

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.840
segment of our population.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.980
People who just do not see themselves
as part of this new economy,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.891
who can't even imagine a pathway to entry.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.720
While the nature of this divide has
been debated

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.840
by pundits on the left and on right,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.820
this goes far beyond partisan politics.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.850
We all bear responsibility for

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.570
ensuring that the future we're
building works for everyone.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.180
If we succeed,
the United States will continue to serve

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:24.000
as a shining example of prosperity and
democracy for the rest of the world.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.320
Here lies the greatest obligation for

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.489
institutions of higher
learning in the modern era and

00:18:32.489 --> 00:18:37.170
a commitment that lies at
the heart of CMU's leadership.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.110
Even as we break new ground in technology,
we must work to mitigate any

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.080
consequences that diminish
human dignity and opportunity.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:55.120
That is why at CMU, scientists and
engineers work together with philosophers,

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.614
artists, economists who will
shape what might be possible.

00:18:59.614 --> 00:19:03.873
With ethicists, humanists,
and policy experts,

00:19:03.873 --> 00:19:08.616
who will guide our path and
with the behavioral scientists

00:19:08.616 --> 00:19:12.890
who will measure the impact
of our work on humanity.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.050
Reinforcing our distinct strength at
the nexus of technology and humanity will

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:25.950
be crucial to building an extraordinary
momentum in both research and creativity.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.810
And as president, I am committed
to supporting this leadership

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.910
by investing in a diverse community
of faculty and researchers,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.580
by doubling down on our partnership
beyond the borders of our campus and

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.670
by creating vibrant, living laboratories
in communities around the world.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.520
This is the next frontier for
Carnegie Mellon and

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.655
I believe it will only deepen our
societal impact heading into the future.

00:19:53.655 --> 00:20:03.655
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.080
&gt;&gt; As much as we value our impact of or

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.720
our research and

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.930
creativity, we are equally committed
to our educational mission.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.455
And as a CMU parent,

00:20:18.455 --> 00:20:24.203
the responsibility of preparing the next
generation is deeply personal to me.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:31.156
To the CMU students here today and

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:39.540
also across various campuses,
and our campus watch parties,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.380
You are my most important motivation.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.324
You're spending your most
formative years here.

00:20:48.324 --> 00:20:51.840
From what I remember from
my own college experience,

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:57.400
you are undoubtedly forming
lifelong friendships.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.530
You know, many of my best friends from college
are still my best friends today.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.100
The foundation you built here will
sustain you as you enter a world defined

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.300
by continuous disruption.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.665
According to a recent study, about
two thirds of jobs that you will hold

00:21:13.665 --> 00:21:16.373
throughout your lives, do not even exist.

00:21:17.716 --> 00:21:21.133
This reality has dramatic and
immediate implications for

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:23.580
the kind of education you deserve today.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:30.960
Throughout our history, every period
of significant technological change

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.339
has been met with a corresponding
wave of innovation in education.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.760
I'm here to tell you that, right now,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.440
we are at the dawn of the next
major transformation in education

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.960
and Carnegie Mellon will be at
the forefront of these changes,

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.720
from curriculum to pedagogy to
structure and organization.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.210
We are re-imagining our education
with your futures in mind.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.570
We're breaking down disciplinary silos and
launching

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.530
cross-cutting programs that better serve
your interests and society's needs.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.870
Programs like behavioral economics,
neuroscience and IDEATE.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:20.300
We're embedding continuous
learning in the skills that will

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.290
only increase in demand as automation
re-shapes the future of work,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.510
Skills like communication,
critical thinking, and entrepreneurship.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.220
We're investing in infrastructure that
supports the new ways that students learn

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.310
and collaborate,
spaces like Tepper Quad and Scott Hall.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.030
We're utilizing our expertise in
the science of learning to develop

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:53.440
a personalized model of education
focused on how each of you learns best.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:00.300
Every day we work to build and
sustain a community that's inclusive,

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:04.890
equitable, nurturing for
both graduate and undergraduate students,

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:08.560
a place where diverse
perspectives can come together

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.230
in a culture of civil
discourse.  To our students,

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:21.410
thank you for entrusting us with this
most important chapter in your lives.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.440
You will always be at
the heart of my presidency.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.720
As we consider -

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.900
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.000
&gt;&gt; As we consider the aspirations that

00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:47.977
unite this global community,
philanthropy must continue to catalyze and

00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:50.550
support our forward momentum.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.210
In fact, this university was
founded by an act of philanthropy.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.640
At this pivotal moment,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.840
I am delighted today to announce
two extraordinary new commitments

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.620
that will provide critical
resources to Carnegie Mellon.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.610
In recent years, Carnegie Mellon has
been making significant investments for

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.300
our College of Engineering,

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:20.800
including a state of the art maker
ecosystem that serves the entire campus.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.319
Today I'm pleased to announce
that The Allegheny Foundation

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:30.671
has committed a $30
million lead grant toward

00:24:30.671 --> 00:24:35.976
the transformation of Scaife Hall
into a modern new home for

00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:39.817
our Mechanical Engineering Department.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:49.600
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.660
&gt;&gt; This grant, the largest in the history
of Allegheny Foundation,

00:24:53.662 --> 00:24:58.372
will enable us to bring our total
infrastructure investments in engineering

00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:02.480
over the last decade to more
than a quarter billion dollars.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.380
With this commitment, CMU will be better
able to compete for best students and

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.840
faculty, driving Pittsburgh's
reputation as a hub for innovation.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.376
We're joined today by Matt Groll,
President and Chairman of

00:25:17.376 --> 00:25:21.798
Allegheny Foundation, please join me
in thanking Allegheny Foundation for

00:25:21.798 --> 00:25:24.056
their generosity to Carnegie Mellon.

00:25:24.056 --> 00:25:26.515
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Matt, please stand to be recognized.

00:25:26.515 --> 00:25:36.515
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:25:39.576 --> 00:25:42.401
&gt;&gt; At a time when college education has

00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:47.112
never been more important,
many prospective students and

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.700
middle class families feel as
though they're simply priced

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.980
out of education that they may need for
the future.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:02.167
This is why CMU has made growing our
endowment for scholarships, fellowships and

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:07.240
financial aid one of our most
important strategic priorities.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.046
Today I am pleased to
announce that CMU Trustee,

00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:16.503
Tod Johnson and
his wife Cindy have committed

00:26:16.503 --> 00:26:21.311
$50 million to create
an endowment to support

00:26:21.311 --> 00:26:26.395
undergraduate scholarship and
student success.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:27:15.300
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.600
&gt;&gt; You know, I made the announcement a couple of times

00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:24.596
yesterday and I said this last night,
every time I'm making this announcement,

00:27:24.596 --> 00:27:27.740
when I get to the word student,
I choke up.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.220
That's why we're here.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.600
Tod and Cindy will you stand please,
to be recognized.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:49.480
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.040
&gt;&gt; Well, I lost my place.

00:27:51.045 --> 00:28:00.540
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.410
&gt;&gt; Boy, I didn't realize this speech was this long.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:06.240
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I know, tell me about it.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240
&gt;&gt; I know, tell me about it.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.000
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.740
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:28:20.871 --> 00:28:23.461
&gt;&gt; Back to the place that
I lost track of time.

00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:27.640
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This support will

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.510
greatly expand our ability to
ensure that a Carnegie Mellon

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:39.060
education Is within the reach
of all talented students.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.460
This gift,the largest toward scholarship
support in Carnegie Mellon's history,

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.330
was inspired by Tod's own path
to success here at CMU and

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.770
the fellowship that funded his education.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.980
Please once again, join me in thanking and

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.700
congratulating the Johnson's for their
generosity and commitment to our students.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.010
Todd and Cindy we are so
grateful to you for your generosity.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:12.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:12.415 --> 00:29:18.005
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:29:18.005 --> 00:29:19.541
&gt;&gt; I hope you packed a good lunch,

00:29:19.541 --> 00:29:20.669
this is a long speech.

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:25.382
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; My fellow Tartans,

00:29:25.382 --> 00:29:29.874
whether you're in Pittsburgh,
Silicon Valley,

00:29:29.874 --> 00:29:34.678
Australia, Rwanda or Qatar,
I hope you are as excited

00:29:34.678 --> 00:29:39.600
as I am about the future of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.870
To be part of CMU at
this moment is to be at

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:51.070
the cusp of the next great phase
of societal and human development.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.340
If we continue doing what we do today,

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.550
we'll maintain momentum and
continue to be a great university,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:11.020
but if we are very intentional,
if we are unapologetically bold,

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:18.310
and if we are committed to taking risks,
I am confident

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.790
that we will position ourselves among
the top tier institutions in the world.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.640
A place that's known for
the writing the story of this century,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.470
an institution dedicated
to anticipating and

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:37.890
solving the most pressing
challenges facing humanity.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.600
Through creative inquiry,
through scientific discovery,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.220
through the impact of technology, and

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.890
through a transformative
education that changes lives.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:55.800
As we embark on this exhilarating
future together, we do so

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:01.160
as a community bound together
by a set of core values

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.052
that serve as our foundation, integrity,

00:31:05.052 --> 00:31:10.360
knowledge, compassion, respect.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.018
The great scientist,
Albert Einstein understood

00:31:14.018 --> 00:31:18.961
this fundamental connection between
excellence and human values.

00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:23.190
In 1950 he wrote, "Only morality in our

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.660
actions can give beauty and
dignity to life.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.709
To make this a living force and
bring it to clear consciousness,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.860
is perhaps the foremost task of education."

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:48.050
Andrew Carnegie put it a little bit
more simply, "My heart is in the work."

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.400
Each one of us has a role to
play in bringing beauty and

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.610
dignity to our mission through
the impact we make on society,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.920
the leaders we develop, and
opportunities we create for others.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.620
I feel privileged to work with
such outstanding partners, and

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.760
I look forward to all that
we will achieve together.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.760
Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:48.800
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
