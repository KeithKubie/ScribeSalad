00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:01.697
Oh, you can have the last strawberry.

00:00:01.697 --> 00:00:02.457
Oh thank you!

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:04.267
OVER MY DEAD BODY...

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:10.647
(smacking and nyaming noises)

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:12.786
First, I would still eat that.

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:15.297
And two, why do people even say

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:19.577
(slowed) "Over my dead body"?

00:00:19.577 --> 00:00:25.197
Whenever someone says that, it's like, 
"Yeah dude, obviously I'm not gonna kill you over whatever we're talking about."

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.760
But if I was..

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:29.048
are you REALLY willing to die for this?

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:30.918
Are you really..

00:00:30.918 --> 00:00:31.628
willing..

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:32.457
to die?

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:35.048
You'll get that strawberry over my dead body.

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:37.608
(dramatic music)

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:38.768
Wanna duel?

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:39.488
(lightning strikes)

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:40.951
(groans)

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.520
Well that was easy.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.558
I mean, unless it's booby trapped.

00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:45.878
(beeping)

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.688
(lasers screech)

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:49.537
God dammit.

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:51.438
(screeching continues)

00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:54.908
I was wondering where the phrase 
"over my dead body" even came from,

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.447
so I asked my best friend,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.060
the internet.

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:04.829
"Though not much is known about its origins, 
scholars do know that it was used during the 1800s,

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.908
as a common hyperbolic expression often used in jest."

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.589
They joked in the 1800s?

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:15.219
"What was a typical joke for the 1800s?"

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.269
(old fashioned music)

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:16.899
Mother,

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.179
it strikes me that you are VERY LAZY just now.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.799
(gasp)

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.378
How dare you say so!

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:23.717
Why?

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.429
Don't you see I'm making bread?

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:26.170
True,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.739
but that is neither more nor less than LOAFING!

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.950
VO: The juvenile prankster got no 
hotcakes several days thereafter.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.330
The mother is slowly recovering.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.140
That was pretty good.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.900
Yeah, for 200 years old, that's not that bad. 
I'm sure that was like comedy gold back in the day.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.590
This whole video is basically just me saying,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.380
"I don't like the phrase 'over my dead body'."

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.720
Because it insinuates a challenge.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870
And when you challenge me,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.890
challenge accepted.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.130

Right now, I'm listening to 
To All The Boys I've Loved Before,

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.011
