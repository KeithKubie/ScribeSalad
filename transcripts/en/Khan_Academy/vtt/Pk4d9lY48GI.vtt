00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.860
- DNA gets a lot of attention as the store

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.252
of our genetic information, and it deserves that.

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:07.889
If we didn't have DNA, there would be no way

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.826
of keeping the information that makes us us,

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:13.322
and other organisms what those organisms are.

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.654
And DNA has some neat properties, it can replicate itself,

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:19.591
and we go into a lot of depth on that in other videos.

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.516
So DNA producing more DNA, we call that,

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.488
we call that replication, but just being able

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.856
to replicate yourself on its own isn't enough

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:31.527
to actually produce an organism.

00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:33.059
And to produce an organism, you somehow have to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.451
take that information in the DNA, and then

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.921
produce things like a structural molecules,

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.218
enzymes, transport molecules, signaling molecules,

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:48.291
that actually do the work of the organism.

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.054
And that process, the first step, and this is all a review

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:53.179
that we've seen in other videos.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.785
The first step is to go from DNA to RNA,

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:57.774
and in particular, messenger RNA.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:02.052
"Messenger RNA," and this process right over here,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:04.293
this is called transcription.

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:06.127
"Transcription," we go into a lot of detail

00:01:06.127 --> 00:01:08.089
on this in other videos.

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:10.225
And then you wanna go from that messenger RNA,

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:14.126
it goes to the ribosomes and then tRNA goes and grabs

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:17.191
amino acids, and they form actual proteins.

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.359
So you go from messenger RNA, and then in conjunction,

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.958
so this is all, this is in conjunction with tRNA

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:32.888
and amino acids, so let me say "+tRNA," and "amino acids."

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:35.849
And I'll write "amino acids" in, I'll write it in a brighter

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.123
color, since that's going to be the focus of this video.

00:01:39.123 --> 00:01:45.990
So tRNA and amino acids, you're able to construct proteins.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.789
You are able to construct proteins,

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.191
which are made up of chains of amino acids,

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.351
and it's the proteins that do

00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:56.392
a lot of the work of the organism.

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:59.550
Proteins, which are nothing but chains of amino acids,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.885
or they're made up of, sometimes

00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.627
multiple chains of amino acids.

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:05.924
So you can image, I'm just going to, that's an amino acid.

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:07.724
That's another amino acid.

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:10.092
This is an amino acid.

00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:13.041
This is an amino acid, you could keep going.

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.420
So these chains of amino acids, based on

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.554
how these different, based on the properties

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:21.017
of these different amino acids,

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:23.049
and how the protein takes shape and how

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.883
it might interact with its surrounding,

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:27.855
these proteins can serve all sorts of different functions.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.619
Anything from part of your immune system,

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.324
antibodies, they can serve as enzymes,

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:38.420
they can serve as signaling hormones, like insulin.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.986
They're involved in muscle contraction.

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:42.287
Actin and myosin, we actually have

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.726
a fascinating video on that.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.491
Transport of oxygen.

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:46.455
Hemoglobin.

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:48.719
So proteins, the way at least my brain of it,

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.089
is they do a lot of the work.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:54.419
DNA says, well, what contains the information,

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.809
but a lot of the work of organism is actually done,

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.526
is actually done by the proteins.

00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:02.349
And as I just said, the building blocks

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.054
of the proteins are the amino acids.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:07.027
So let's focus on that a little bit.

00:03:07.027 --> 00:03:10.859
So up here are some examples of amino acids.

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.786
And there are 20 common amino acids,

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:17.523
there are a few more depending on what organism you look at,

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:19.740
and theoretically there could be many more.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.087
But in most biological systems,

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:24.826
there are 20 common amino acids that the DNA is coding for,

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.219
and these are two of them.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.017
So let's just first look at what is common.

00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:33.022
So, we see that both these, and actually all three of this,

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:36.761
this is just a general form, you have an amino group.

00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.059
You have an amino group, and this where,

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.461
this is why we call it an "amino," an amino acid.

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.423
So you have an amino group.

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.258
Amino group right over here.

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:49.056
Now you might say, "well, it's called an amino acid,"

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.960
"so where is the acid?"

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.720
And that comes from this carboxyl group right over here.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.392
So that's why we call it an acid.

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:02.384
This carboxyl group is acidic.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.520
It likes to donate this proton.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.656
And then in between, we have a carbon,

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:09.152
and we call that the alpha carbon.

00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:12.020
We call that the alpha carbon.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.493
Alpha carbon, and that alpha carbon is bonded,

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.594
it has a covalent bond to the amino group,

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:18.591
covalent bond to the carboxyl group,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.959
and a covalent bond to a hydrogen.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.187
Now, from there, that's where you get the variation

00:04:24.187 --> 00:04:26.242
in the different amino acids, and actually,

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:30.294
there's even some exceptions for how the nitrogen is,

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.825
but for the most part, the variation between

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:36.018
the amino acids is what this fourth covalent bond

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:38.189
from the alpha carbon does.

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.321
So you see in serine, you have this,

00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:45.155
what you could call it an alcohol.

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:47.187
You could have an alcohol side chain.

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:50.728
In valine right over here, you have a

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:54.917
fairly pure hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon side chain.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:58.158
And so in general, we refer to these side chains

00:04:58.158 --> 00:05:01.154
as an R group, and it's these R groups

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:05.159
that play a big role in defining the shape of the proteins,

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.051
and how they interact with their environment

00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:08.955
and the types of things they can do.

00:05:08.955 --> 00:05:10.755
And you can even see, just from these examples

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:13.518
how these different sides chains might behave differently.

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:16.084
This one has an alcohol side chain,

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:18.859
and we know that oxygen is electronegative,

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.378
it likes to hog electrons, it's amazing how much

00:05:21.378 --> 00:05:23.979
of chemistry or even biology you can deduce

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.220
from just pure electronegativity.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.750
So, oxygen likes to hog electrons, so you're gonna have

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.757
a partially-negative charge there.

00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:38.259
Hydrogen has a low electronegativity relative to oxygen,

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.291
so it's gonna have its electrons hogged,

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.822
so you're gonna have a partially positive charge,

00:05:42.822 --> 00:05:46.781
just like that, and so this has a polarity to it,

00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.789
and so it's going to be hydrophilic, it's going to,

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.693
at least this part of the molecule is going to

00:05:50.693 --> 00:05:54.153
be able to be attracted and interact with water.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.288
And that's in comparison to what we have over here,

00:05:57.288 --> 00:06:02.489
this hydrocarbon side chain, this has no polarity over here,

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:04.683
so this is going to be hydrophobic.

00:06:04.683 --> 00:06:08.015
So this is going to be hydrophobic.

00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:10.523
And so when we start talking about the structures

00:06:10.523 --> 00:06:12.625
of proteins, and how the structures of proteins

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.552
are influenced by its side chains,

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:17.524
you could image that parts of proteins that have

00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:18.917
hydrophobic side chains, those are gonna

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.460
wanna get onto the inside of the proteins

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.561
if we're in an aqueous solution,

00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:24.722
while the ones that are more hydrophilic

00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:26.255
will wanna go onto the outside,

00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:27.427
and you might have some side chains

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:29.250
that are all big and bulky, and so they might

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.420
make it hard to tightly pack, and then you might have

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.080
other side chains that are nice and small

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.355
that make it very easy to pack, so these things

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:39.653
really do help define the shape,

00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:41.487
and we're gonna talk about that a lot more

00:06:41.487 --> 00:06:44.482
when we talk about the structure.

00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:47.861
But how do these things actually connect?

00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:49.324
And we're gonna go into much more detail

00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:51.924
in another video, but if you have...

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:56.684
If you have serine right over here, and then you have

00:06:56.684 --> 00:07:01.514
valine right over here, they connect through

00:07:01.514 --> 00:07:03.558
what we call peptide bonds, and a peptide

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:08.515
is the term for two or more amino acids connected together,

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:10.257
so this would be a dipeptide, and the bond

00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:12.253
isn't this big, I just, actually let me just,

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:14.692
let me draw it a little bit smaller.

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:15.585
So...

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.455
That's serine.

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.624
This is valine.

00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:23.654
They can form a peptide bond, and this would be the smallest

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:27.428
peptide, this would be a dipeptide right over here.

00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:30.052
"Peptide," "peptide bond," or sometimes

00:07:30.052 --> 00:07:32.141
called a peptide linkage.

00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:35.253
And as this chain forms, that polypeptide,

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:37.610
as you add more and more things to it,

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.660
as you add more and more amino acids,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.518
this is going to be, this can be a protein

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:47.687
or can be part of a protein that does all of these things.

00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:50.021
Now one last thing I wanna talk about,

00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:52.888
this is the way, the way these amino acids have been drawn

00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:54.920
is a way you'll often see them in a textbook,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.193
but at physiological pH's, the pH's inside of your body,

00:07:59.193 --> 00:08:01.956
which is in that, you know, that low sevens range,

00:08:01.956 --> 00:08:08.318
so it's a pH of roughly 7.2 to 7.4.

00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:12.985
What you have is this, the carboxyl group right over here,

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:15.087
is likely to be deprotonated, it's likely

00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:16.991
to have given away its hydrogen,

00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:19.452
you're gonna find that more likely than when you have...

00:08:19.452 --> 00:08:21.019
It's gonna be higher concentrations having been

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:23.121
deprotonated than being protonated.

00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:26.894
So, at physiological conditions, it's more likely

00:08:26.894 --> 00:08:33.546
that this oxygen has taken both of those electrons,

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.125
and now has a negative charge,

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.947
so it's given, it's just given away the hydrogen proton

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:40.153
but took that hydrogen's electron.

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:43.717
So it might be like this, and then the amino group,

00:08:43.717 --> 00:08:46.689
the amino group at physiological pH's,

00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:49.150
it's likely to actually grab a proton.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.691
So nitrogen has an extra loan pair,

00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:55.153
so it might use that loan pair to grab a proton,

00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:56.952
in fact it's physiological pH's,

00:08:56.952 --> 00:08:58.752
you'll find a higher concentration of it having

00:08:58.752 --> 00:09:01.457
grabbed a proton than not grabbing a proton.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:05.695
So, the nitrogen will have grabbed a proton,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:07.587
use its loan pairs to grab a proton,

00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:09.793
and so it is going to have...

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.825
So it is going to have a...

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:14.321
It is going to have a positive charge.

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:19.394
And so sometimes you will see amino acids

00:09:19.394 --> 00:09:21.217
described this way, and this is actually more accurate

00:09:21.217 --> 00:09:24.491
for what you're likely to find at physiological conditions,

00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:26.256
and these molecules have an interesting name,

00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:28.752
a molecule that is neutral even though

00:09:28.752 --> 00:09:31.120
parts of it have charge, like this,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.419
this is called a zwitterion.

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:35.985
That's a fun, fun word.

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:39.874
Zwitterion.

00:09:39.874 --> 00:09:41.558
And "zwitter" in German means "hybrid,"

00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:44.809
and "ion" obviously means that it's going to have charge,

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:46.086
and so this has hybrid charge,

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.990
even though it has charges at these ends,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.293
the charges net out to be neutral.
