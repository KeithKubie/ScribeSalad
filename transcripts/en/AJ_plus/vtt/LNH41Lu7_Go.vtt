00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.740
“We are U.S. citizens, but we're not able to vote for the United States president.”

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.300
“A third of our island is occupied by the U.S. military.”

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.340
“The United States could have made Guam a state at any time. It hasn't.”

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.960
In Part 1 of this series, I looked at how Guam became a colony of the United States.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.940
In this part, I want to look at what it’s really like to live in an American territory,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.680
and how some people are envisioning a different relationship between Guam and the U.S.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.680
For tourists, the five populated U.S. territories seem like great places to take a tropical vacation.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.140
But the people who live there face higher unemployment

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.300
than the national average and the worst poverty rates in the country.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.900
On Guam, the poverty rate is 50% higher than the rest of the U.S.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.480
The military presence here is huge, with installations taking up 27% of the island’s land.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.300
With all of this in mind, many young people on Guam see the military as an opportunity.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.000
“I joined because I felt like I needed a foundation to start off my career.”

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.360
Chad wants to work in the entertainment
industry, but with limited options on Guam,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.640
the military seemed like a good stepping-stone to reach his dreams.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.040
“Buenas and hafa adai, guys! Good morning! Today is a brand-new day!

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.800
My pineapple sweetheart and love, my pineapple sweetheart…

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.040
I’m from Yona, a little village. The village of Yona in Guam.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
There’s this one house that we all grew up in, in my grandmother's house,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.920
like everyone from my great-grandmother to my grandmother to my mom.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.860
I was like, what am I going to do? And my dad was telling me,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.960
he was like, you should just join the Air Force.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.280
And I was like, really? The Air Force, I don't think I'm fit for that or cut out for that.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.680
And so when I did decide to join, what made me go through it is my dad,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.720
my brothers who joined – if they did it, then I could do it.”

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.600
Being in the military is like having an all-access pass to steady work,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.880
cheaper prices, and a chance to explore the world.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.960
Life on base can feel like a privilege compared to many neighborhoods on the island.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.800
“You kind of just, like, get tired of the same routine and get tired of the same minimum-wage pay.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.720
And so you're thinking like what can I do to get better financial stability?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720
The only answer to that, to me, I think is the military.”

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.860
“It's really a local islander thing. It seems like it's beyond patriotic. It's engraved in our blood, you know.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.900
It's a family traditional thing. I joined the military when I was in high school, my senior year.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.100
And I was 18 years old.”

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.380
Guam actually has a higher military enlistment rate than any state --

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.220
as many as one in eight adults here are veterans.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.400
But that doesn’t mean they have the same rights as most U.S. citizens.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.140
Rodney served two tours in Iraq and has since created an organization

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.240
to help veterans recover from the trauma of war.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.420
“In here, we have, right now we have hens. We have a couple baby chicks.”

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.360
-- “And so how does this help veterans who come here?”

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.120
“It really takes your mind off what you’re going through. Or what you’ve experienced downrange.”

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.020
While Rodney is proud of his military service,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.620
he wasn’t happy with how he was treated by Veterans Affairs when he retired and returned to Guam.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.220
“It's taken me 15 years, um, to finally get actual services for treatment.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.380
Currently, I fly to Hawaii to receive my counseling through a psychologist.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.120
When you look at the appointment wait times, they've exceeded 30 days, some as much as eight months,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.800
some as a year. And that's why veterans just give up on the VA. They give up on the system.”

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.500
Many veterans on Guam believe that they’re treated differently because they’re a territory.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.020
There’s only one outpatient clinic on the island with two doctors to serve thousands of veterans.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.760
And it’s common for vets to take a 7-hour flight to Hawaii for services like specialized PTSD treatment.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.120
Rodney’s tours in Iraq have taken a toll.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.440
He’s experienced depression and survived a suicide attempt.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.000
“To lose people in battle, to see that, to pick up the body parts of American soldiers,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.280
being diagnosed with PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, spinal problems, stuff like that.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.320
Not being able to vote for president is…it's like a piece of me is missing.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.820
Even though when I say I am an American, I say it painfully.”

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.420
If Guam were a state, it would have more political power to get better resources

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.000
and have a say in who gets to be president.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.080
“I know what's better for me and my family. And if I had a choice, that would be pushing for statehood.”

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.180
Rodney’s taking this fight to the Supreme Court.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.280
He’s joined a lawsuit that's fighting to give the 4 million Americans who live in the territories the right to vote.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.660
It’s an uphill battle.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.660
I couldn’t stop thinking that despite Rodney and Chad’s service,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.640
they still can’t vote for president. I wanted to know what the military thought about all this.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.240
“What's the military’s response to the fact that so many people from Guam serve in the U.S. military

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.560
but can't even vote for their commander in chief?”

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.820
“I don't have a response for it.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.780
That's a question that has nothing to do with the military.”

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.560
“Does the military support anything in terms of status quo, Guam becoming a state?”

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.700
“The DOD [Department of Defense] doesn't have an opinion on the political status of the island,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.780
except to just be the best neighbors that we can be.”

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.100
“It’s always important to ask for permission whenever you’re entering

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.220
a place where there’s artifacts or the bones of ancient Chamorros.”

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.580
Not everyone thinks statehood is the best way forward.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.700
Miget is part of the independence movement that wants to change Guam’s relationship with the military.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.780
He took us to the cultural site Ritidian, also known as Litekyan,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.760
which has caves with indigenous Chamorro markings dating back generations.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.720
“You come in here and you get reminded that, man, a thousand years ago maybe,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.460
somebody, there was a Chamorro who was standing here.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.200
And it’s like a message, it’s like, ‘Hey, don’t give up.’”

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.920
Miget and the independence movement are fighting to preserve sites like these,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.540
but the military plans to build a firing range right next door.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:37.420
It’s part of a military buildup that would move 5,000 additional marines from Okinawa, Japan, to Guam.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.040
“A lot of people who come to Litekyan – who sort of walk down this trail,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.600
who see the medicinal plants here, who go into the caves –

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.060
for them, they’re like, ‘Why would you want to disrupt a place like this?’”

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.180
The firing range will limit access for locals who use this area regularly.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.320
“Well, and it seems like even to this day,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.780
people are coming here to get plants for healing, to come in here to go fishing…”

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.500
– “Oh, absolutely. This is why the firing range issue is so contentious.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.940
A lot of these culturally significant areas are on bases.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.180
As an individual, you can’t say, ‘You know what, I would like to go and visit a sacred site to my ancestors.’

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.120
Because there’s a fence. There’s a gate. There’s a pass procedure.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.640
Just look at a map of Guam. 212 square miles, one-third of it military facilities.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.120
All of these things are tied to us being a territory.”

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.760
Independent Guåhan is trying to get people to think about an alternative to Guam’s current status.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.500
“Inspired by the strength of our ancestors, we educate and unify all who call our island home.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.800
To build a sustainable and prosperous, independent future.”

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.300
“Independence is a way for us to redefine ourselves

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.620
and to really return to who we were intended to be by our ancestors.”

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.520
The threat of a nuclear attack from North Korea is in Guam’s recent memory.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.000
But the independence movement doesn’t want to be caught in the middle of U.S. conflicts any longer.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.480
“It became more urgent for me, as a mother,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.980
because I often think, well, what do I want my children to inherit?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.920
There is no choice. This is my homeland, this is their homeland.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.760
I would rather that they be here and know who they are than anywhere else in the world.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.780
So if this is the place that is their home, I want to make it safe.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.980
I want to make it reach its greatest potential for them.”

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.260
Others argue that without the military to defend it, Guam would be an easy target,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.720
especially when it comes to nuclear warfare.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.060
“There's some people who are like, um, they quote, ‘Free Guam.’

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.240
And I'm like, free Guam for what? Free Guam so we can get bombed?”

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.060
But Miget says that independence doesn’t necessarily mean kicking the U.S. out.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.920
He says Guam could have a defense agreement with the military.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.660
The U.S. would keep its bases here, if they agree to defend the island in return.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:11.300
“Over the past 70 or 80 years, about 80 different countries moved from being colonies to independent.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:16.240
And in that time, Guam kind of remained stuck in the exact same place.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.260
What we have now with the relationship between Guam and the United States is

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.280
the relationship between a colony and a colonizer. It’s a relationship that shouldn't exist anymore.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.880
Just like most people would say a relationship between a slave and a master shouldn't exist anymore.”

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.180
In 2017, the UN decolonization committee voted in favor of a resolution calling for the U.S. government

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.400
to cooperate with Guam’s right to self-determination –

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.540
to decide whether it should be a state, independent or something else.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.700
But that resolution is nonbinding.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:54.740
Guam’s colonial past has created a system of dependency on the U.S., militarily and economically.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.420
But there’s a growing group of young people on Guam who are looking to traditional Chamorro culture

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.480
to help change the future of their island.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.840
Thank you for watching part 2. Keep watching!

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.580
Because in this next episode, we’re going spearfishing.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600
There’s an amazing group of young people on Guam

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.420
who are embracing indigenous traditions to create a more sustainable future.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.000
I really want you to meet them.
