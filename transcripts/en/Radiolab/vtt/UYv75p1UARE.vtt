00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.740
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab podcast. And uh,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.710
before we really get rolling and just want to say one thing,

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.870
we're going to be in la next week, May 8th, ninth and 10th are,

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.610
we're going to be at the Royce Theater for three nights, uh,

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.580
with our live show in the dark, which includes Paul libelist and dance troupe,

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.020
the singer Songwriter Tau Win, and uh, the comedian Demitri Martin.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.401
Awesome lineup.

8
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:27.450
You can still get tickets at radiolab.org/in the dark folks who've seen this

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.920
show. Tell your La peeps to come check it out. Yeah. Uh,

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.590
I don't know what we're doing today. So you, you go, well,

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.670
cause here's what we're doing.

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.570
Maybe six years ago I had just returned to national public radio and, uh,

13
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.900
and for the first story I did, we just put that in context.

14
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:47.160
I mean you started national public radio started kind of started near the

15
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:50.790
beginning and then you went away to do great things on TV for 23 years.

16
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.450
I was missing and then I came back again. Yeah. Okay. So where am I pop back?

17
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.590
I brought this puzzle back with me. It was, it was about motherhood actually.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.530
And uh, it's, well, you'll see,

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.700
why don't I just play you the piece that I aired back in, Gosh, 2006,

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.890
2000 2006.

21
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.100
<v 1>It's another time in Paris. Robert Krulwich has the story.</v>

22
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.210
For years it was thought as soon as a baby is conceived,

23
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:21.070
once it starts to grow inside a mom, it gets its own very private space.

24
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.461
There is,

25
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:25.510
there's a placenta and placenta was thought to be a fairly impenetrable barrier.

26
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.850
So says Dr. Kirby Johnson of Tufts University,

27
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:30.190
the baby and its cells stay on the baby's side.

28
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.630
The mommy cells stay on the mommy side and nature keeps them separate until

29
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.600
time to go. The surprise,

30
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.050
when scientists at Tufts took blood from ordinary pregnant moms, we would find,

31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.710
for example, in a teaspoon of blood, dozens,

32
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.640
perhaps even hundreds of cells from the baby, from the baby.

33
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
So baby cells were slipping out of the placenta into the moms.

34
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.870
But because babies do have different genes,

35
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.780
one would expect them to be attacked fairly rapidly.

36
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.260
You would expect them to be cleared within hours if not days.

37
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.300
What we've found is that that is not the case. Not Anywhere near the case.

38
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.830
It turns out that baby cells stay in their mom's, not for days or weeks,

39
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.480
but for decades, four to five decades following the last pregnancy,

40
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.210
so 40 years after conception,

41
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:25.330
that son or daughter who can now be a middle aged pharmacist or something.

42
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.950
Yet they're fetal cells.

43
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.760
Their baby cells are still floating around inside the mother. Yes.

44
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.260
Even his 60 year old mother's 70 80 perhaps 90 year old women.

45
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.630
You sure this? Absolutely. Yeah.

46
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.770
These cells last essentially forever in the mouth in the mom and says,

47
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.040
Carol Art Lit who studies fetal cells at Thomas Jefferson University in

48
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:48.790
Philadelphia. Even if a woman has a miscarriage or an abortion,

49
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.230
even if there is no baby,

50
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.150
the cells of an unborn child will stay in the mother for decades,

51
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.520
but why? What exactly are they doing in there for years and years and years?

52
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.140
Yeah, that's a good question. Well, one early hypothesis,

53
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.750
and it's not the nicest ideas as Kirby Johnson,

54
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.050
is that certain auto immune diseases such as Lupus,

55
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.730
rheumatoid arthritis, Scleroderma, are much more common in women than men.

56
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.910
And that's one component of the hypothesis is that this prevalence in women is

57
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:27.500
due to fetal cells. So later in life, when the mother's joints inflame,

58
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.620
maybe it's her fetal cells, her own Bibi's taken a poke at her.

59
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.250
In fact, Kirby's mom did have an autoimmune disease.

60
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:39.270
It was a bad one for awhile. Kirby thought, well, his cells were responsible.

61
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.200
So I apologized immediately and said, well,

62
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.600
there's nothing much I can do about it. Yeah, but it's like stopping Kirby.

63
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.990
But you know what? I was always doing that to my mother.

64
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.720
How always causing problems. And it was just another on the long line of,

65
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:52.730
of those kinds of things.

66
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.230
But happily the folks at Tufts proposed an alternative,

67
00:03:56.231 --> 00:04:00.190
a second theory to explain what fetal cells are doing in the moms. Well,

68
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.730
theory number two is the polar opposite of theory, number one. Yep.

69
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.730
Good fetal cell hypothesis proposes that the son or daughter cells stay in mom,

70
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.220
not to hurt her, but to protect,

71
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.960
defend and repair her for the rest of her life whenever she gets seriously ill.

72
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.180
And that's a more attractive idea.

73
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.550
It's such a personal thing and it does touch the heartstrings of even the most

74
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.810
hard nosed research scientist. But they all have mothers,

75
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.860
but they all have mothers and happily they now have evidence more and more

76
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:35.480
evidence as Kirby Johnson. But it looks like the good hypothesis may be correct.

77
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:37.130
For example, here's a case. Well,

78
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:42.131
this was a woman who came into a neighboring hospital in Boston with symptoms of

79
00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:44.264
hepatitis.

80
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.440
She was an intravenous drug user and she had had five conceptions.

81
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:51.500
You'd had one child, two miscarriages, two abortions,

82
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:55.070
that's five in all she could be carrying there for a lot of fetal cells.

83
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.050
And they examined her and in the process she had a liver biopsy and the doc

84
00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:00.291
said, well,

85
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:03.800
why don't we send her liver to the lab to see if there are any fetal cells

86
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.950
gathering where she's got trouble. And when they looked,

87
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.700
we found hundreds and hundreds of fetal cells.

88
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:15.200
Normally they'd expect five or 10 cells, but this was a very large,

89
00:05:15.201 --> 00:05:17.750
we cited literally sheets of cells,

90
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.690
whole areas that seemed to be normal,

91
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600
meaning that those fetal cells had gathered at the liver and like stem cells.

92
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:28.170
They just turned themselves in this case, into healthy liver cells.

93
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.030
And most interestingly,

94
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.770
this woman did not desire to have any further treatment done. In fact,

95
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.200
she wanted to get back to her normal life and be left alone.

96
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.280
And so she left the hospital with hepatitis. But when they checked months later,

97
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:45.860
they learned that she is completely healthy, no signs of,

98
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.650
of further liver damage. So no medical intervention,

99
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.200
but just a huge number of her babies fetal cells.

100
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.560
Could that lead you to think the poetic thought that she was safe by her kids?

101
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.700
We want to think that good. I know you do. Um,

102
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.680
there it's the most likely obser explanation.

103
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.420
But in science there is such a thing as a too dangerously beautiful idea.

104
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.660
That's right. Right. If,

105
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.930
and and we say the same thing to ourselves because it shows such a basic

106
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:18.741
wonderful thing,

107
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:23.741
but it has to be right and we can't be led astray by our own desire for,

108
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.360
for it to be true.

109
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.650
So they are systematically testing the good hypothesis and the bad hypothesis.

110
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:35.651
All these ideas on laboratory mice and when they see mother mice with all kinds

111
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:40.730
of diseases, infectious disease, cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer,

112
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.250
cervical cancers, we find fetal cells there.

113
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.300
We know that fetal cells don't over and over and over and over and over and over

114
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.230
suggesting that fetal cells regularly rushed to the places where they're needed

115
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.000
in the mom and says, Carol Art Lit.

116
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.420
<v 2>There's a lot of evidence now starting to come out that these cells may actually</v>

117
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.770
be repairing tissues

118
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.490
<v 1>that is protecting the mom.</v>

119
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.480
While the other hypothesis that fetal cells hurt the moms, they're,

120
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.180
the more they look, the less they find the,

121
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
I can't recall a single study that's been truly reproduced to verify the bad

122
00:07:15.271 --> 00:07:19.410
fetal cell hypothesis. So while no one knows in the end which way it'll go,

123
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.100
I think that that's something that we're going to see within the next five years

124
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.080
or less so far a sense is building that fetal cells probably stay in mothers for

125
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.750
decades to defend and to protect them,

126
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.640
which increasingly is a quiet constellation to Kirby Johnson because it's now

127
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.570
more likely that his sales and his brother's cells were helping their mom not

128
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:40.404
hurting.

129
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.560
And even though his mother did die Kirby's beginning to feel differently.

130
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.000
Well, maybe if it wasn't for my brother and I,

131
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.250
she may have passed a few years earlier,

132
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.090
maybe we bought her a couple of extra years of time so she could have a few more

133
00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:58.850
birthdays and a few more mother's days. And that if I can just say that,

134
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.590
that I, there is some way where I can even have the remotest fraud that I had

135
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.240
contributed to the extension of my mother's life,

136
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.560
even if it was a few days that would make all of the years that I spent doing

137
00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:14.610
this research worthwhile. Rapid Krulwich, NPR news, New York.

138
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.693
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

139
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.990
<v 1>hmm. So it's been, um, more than five years. As I said,</v>

140
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.140
since I talked to Kirby Johnson, uh, six years really.

141
00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:28.860
So I figured he might have an answer by quieter there.

142
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.800
Hello. Hi Garvey. Hi Robert. How are you?

143
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.060
I wanted to know what do you now know about what those fetal cells are really

144
00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:38.400
doing? Right? So when we left left it,

145
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.670
you were tipping between two possibilities.

146
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:46.020
One is that they do some harm or the aggravate conditions later in the mother's

147
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:49.740
life or the opposite that they help in the mother's life. Right?

148
00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:52.470
And do you now have a sense of which was right? Well,

149
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.070
I think it's more than we

150
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 0>originally thought. Like you would expect it. Isn't that always the case? Yeah,</v>

151
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.121
but,

152
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:05.121
but what we're able to do though now is more specifically argue for or argue

153
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.910
against one of those different hypotheses.

154
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.870
So here's how he's addressed the question cause this is a completely new

155
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:13.620
development.

156
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.000
He's working with mice and he's taken the glow from another animal,

157
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.880
comes from some sort of fish, a greenish glow.

158
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.850
The green fluorescent protein exists in nature.

159
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.270
He's plucked it on to the fetal cells of a pregnant mouse. Right, exactly.

160
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.140
So what is that like? Is that if you do a, um,

161
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.720
a tummy scan on a pregnant lady mouse,

162
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:36.990
can you look inside and it's like going to the movies and see? Absolutely.

163
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:39.600
It is like the movies, it is shiny,

164
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:44.520
glowing green and it is extremely easy to see. I mean, yeah, a child could,

165
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:49.380
could say that all that's green so he can look at the mouse and he can see from

166
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:52.770
the little bits of glean glow where the fetal cells are.

167
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.800
And we find these cells virtually anywhere we look like the longest spleen,

168
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:01.650
liver, bone marrow, heart. We even find them in brain tissue,

169
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.180
which will help figure out what they're doing so he can track them. Yes.

170
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.140
And we've read and now that he has tracked him, he says, all right,

171
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.530
what I said before about fetal cells, probably helping moms.

172
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:17.280
I think that in many cases is still true. If you've got a mom who's suffering,

173
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.410
say from some liver disease or something,

174
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.580
you can see fetal cells doing something there and these cells may be able to

175
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:28.170
contribute to tissue repair after an injury or chemical or environmental

176
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:32.530
assault. So these are helpers. Helpers get definitely yet, but,

177
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.420
but unlike six years ago now, he suspects that if a mother has,

178
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.800
let's say rheumatoid arthritis or some kind of auto immune disease where the

179
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:45.630
maternal immune system seemingly attacks itself in this autoimmune fashion,

180
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.590
now he sees other kinds of fetal cells that seem to be causing a problem.

181
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.130
Their behavior seems to suggest that they are attacking them out,

182
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.720
actually attacking maternal tissue. The go get mommy group,

183
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.770
right? And the unfortunate go get mommy group. Wait.

184
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:03.780
So there are some kinds of fetal cells that are good,

185
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:08.130
some that are bad and it seems to depend on what again on like where it is in

186
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:12.180
the body or what disease seems to depend on a longer and longer list of

187
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:14.940
variables. So including for example,

188
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.780
who the father was that that matter.

189
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.960
We'll remember every fetal cell is half mom and half dad.

190
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.980
We actually do see differences in the cells that are present in the mother.

191
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.250
Depending upon the genetic background of the father and of bad daddy's and good

192
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.790
daddy you. That is entirely possible.

193
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.730
I think we would say good daddies and less good daddies. But what we're,

194
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.890
is that because you're at a university and you never liked to call daddy's bat

195
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.450
one's a bad daddy, but wait a second,

196
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:46.740
does he know how to explain the difference?

197
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.350
Like why one dad would be good and one wouldn't be bad?

198
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.890
I don't think he knows yet. Oh,

199
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.940
we haven't been able to quite delineate why one cell may be doing something good

200
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.840
or maybe be doing something bad.

201
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.710
It may be the very same cell type that's might even switch sides.

202
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.980
Possibly could. I mean it's sort of like behavior.

203
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.930
You get good kids and you get bad kids. [inaudible] a bad days.

204
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.820
He got good cells and you got pad cells.

205
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.280
This is getting complicated so the cells can be good or bad.

206
00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.100
Depends on the disease, that location and the dad,

207
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:21.670
but we're not really sure if it was the end of the list. We actually get longer.

208
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.390
There's a number of other variables, the number of pregnancies,

209
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.800
also pregnancy loss, whether it's through miscarriage or through termination,

210
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.690
maternal age. That's another very important variable. So who's your daddy?

211
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.150
How old are you when you're pregnant?

212
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.590
How many times have you been pregnant before? Yes, and many other influences.

213
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.130
It it's impossible to correlate a second. So this is,

214
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:49.630
so when we got to the poetry part of our interview back then you said to

215
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:50.290
yourself,

216
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.290
my brother and I either roughed up our mother or gave her a few more,

217
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.570
you know, birthdays, right?

218
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.220
It's possible that one of us had a more positive impact than the other.

219
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.040
I mean there's obviously no way of knowing that,

220
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.400
but any normally inquisitive mind would start to wander to say,

221
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:16.030
well what if this or under what circumstances you,

222
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.260
my mind is wandering wildly now because when we last and that's all we want you

223
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:25.240
to do, we want, no, I don't want you to be a much better story. If it was,

224
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:27.610
if it had been for me, if it had been,

225
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.370
if it had gone clearly one way or the other.

226
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.090
But the story you're now telling me is that you and your brother can now meet

227
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:37.720
for coffee and you can look into each other's eyes and you will not know between

228
00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:41.710
the two of you whether you helped your mom, whether you hurt your mom,

229
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:42.910
whether you did both,

230
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.630
whether your contribution was bigger or less than the hap stance of your dad's

231
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:49.900
genetic makeup and an n, n, n,

232
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.410
n this is getting a much harder to be a much harder story to tell.

233
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.150
It is much harder to tell.

234
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:58.450
So what are you as the story gets blurrier and Blurrier,

235
00:13:58.451 --> 00:13:59.740
why are you still in the game?

236
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:06.090
A lot of this is driven as you know by the issues that my mother has or had and

237
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.910
I still have that in the back of my mind and I can't get that out of my mind

238
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.530
that a lot of the issues that my mother had recur in the literature,

239
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.520
what that means is that the diseases that killed his mom are the very kinds of

240
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:27.550
diseases that show up in his, in his research and, and we,

241
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:30.340
towards the end we had conversations about fetal cells.

242
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.670
And it made us closer.

243
00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.060
And I could share my scientific background in the work that I was doing in a way

244
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.780
that comforted her,

245
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.470
I think to a certain degree to know that I was investigating something that was

246
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:48.790
directly related to her health issues. And, uh,

247
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.000
towards the end we had a lot of real nice conversations about the work that I

248
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:56.990
was doing and the, the latest discoveries. And she would always ask,

249
00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.590
or the after she would ask how I was, she would say, how was the work?

250
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.530
But here's what look,

251
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.230
I think there's a chance that your fetal cells in your moms sometimes helped in

252
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:11.390
sometimes hurt. So you're not going to come out the hero.

253
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.820
You might even come out the villain.

254
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.050
Doesn't that SAP your enthusiasm for this a little bit.

255
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.510
At some level, of course,

256
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.900
I would want to think that my cells contributed in some small way to some

257
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.580
improvement to my mother's health.

258
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.580
If I find out that it wasn't the case, well that's the truth.

259
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.600
And as a scientist, I want to find the truth.

260
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.220
Whether or not the truth is wonderful or the truth is horrible.

261
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.380
That's what I want to find out,

262
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.880
regardless of what the end personal outcome is.

263
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.880
And what if the truth is, well, some of the time you helped,

264
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.330
some of the time you hurt much of the time, it didn't matter.

265
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.900
It doesn't. That hurt you a little bit. Can you get up the next morning and say,

266
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:07.820
let's find out how unimportant I am? Well,

267
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.040
that's, that is, uh,

268
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.200
a very difficult question.

269
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.290
I know if I were to be able to go to my mother,

270
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.820
if I put my best effort forward to finding the truth,

271
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.960
and even if it was a negative or was a mixed bag or perhaps was even not really

272
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:38.690
much of anything, at least I know what the truth is.

273
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.740
And both as a son and as a scientist,

274
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.780
that would be a value to me. Hmm. I may feel unfortunate that I,

275
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:54.770
that I wasn't able to do something more than the, you know, the,

276
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:57.530
the emotional support that I could provide my mother,

277
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:03.070
but I have to look at it as finding the truth.

278
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.213
Yeah.

279
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.320
<v 4>[inaudible] so that's where we land. Yeah. Happy Mother's Day. Oh,</v>

280
00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.560
that's right. This is [inaudible]. This is mother's Day.

281
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.320
I mean, kind of. That's two weeks before. Yeah.

282
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.990
I don't know that mothers really need a day.

283
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:25.060
They should basically own the calendar,

284
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.530
but since here we are chronologically near Mother's Day, happy mother's Day.

285
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.570
You're welcome.

286
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.590
[inaudible] [inaudible] you've written about this on your blog, right? I have,

287
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.520
yeah. Yeah. I should say I should. We were, that is a,

288
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:55.140
it's called Krulwich wonders. Uh, so you just write k, R, U, l, W, I,

289
00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:59.360
c h wonders into any search engine and there it is. And yeah, this, this,

290
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.900
this issue and other things many times a week. So yeah, check it out.

291
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.440
It's pretty good.
