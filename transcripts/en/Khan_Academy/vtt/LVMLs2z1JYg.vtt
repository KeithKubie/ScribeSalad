00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:01.936
Let's say that many years ago,

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:03.803
you started yourself a
nice little business.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.582
You have no debt and
your business every year

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.189
generates a pre-tax income

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.641
of a million and a half a year and a

00:00:09.641 --> 00:00:11.404
third of that goes to taxes.

00:00:11.404 --> 00:00:13.937
So you get a nice one million dollars

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:17.144
a year of net income and
it's a super stable business,

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.336
nothing risky over here.

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.738
Just by virtue of what your business does,

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.670
the odds of this one million a year

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.868
changing for the better or
the worse isn't that likely.

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:29.137
So this is essentially your ...
This is what your balance sheet

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:29.893
would look like.

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:30.893
These are your assets.

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.144
You have no debt.

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:33.736
Let's assume you have no liabilities

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:35.811
and so you own all of the equity.

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.978
You essentially own all of the assets,

00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:39.478
but you're nearing retirement

00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:41.336
and you want to kind of cash out.

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:43.203
You don't necessarily want
to sell to your competitors

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:45.561
or maybe there aren't any
natural competitors to sell to

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.895
because you've been comp
... Well, you don't want to

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.669
sell to them if they exist
because you've been competing

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:51.478
with them for your ... for your whole life

00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:53.802
and this isn't the type of
business that you can IPO

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:55.803
because it's not quite big enough.

00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:57.604
So maybe we bump into
to each other and I say,

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:00.405
"Hey, this business looks
interesting. I like the idea that"

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:03.203
"your business is stable and
can generate a lot of income"

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:05.135
"year after year after year."

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:07.336
So what I say is, "Hey,
would you be willing to take"

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:09.144
"10 million dollars for your business?"

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:13.604
So I offer ... I offer 10 million dollars.

00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:15.071
And to you that sounds pretty good.

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.700
That's about ten times ...
That's exactly ten times

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.311
your yearly net income.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.475
This isn't a growing
business, just very stable.

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:24.269
Seems like a reasonable deal to you.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:25.978
On the other hand for
me, I'm like you know

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:28.338
paying 10 million dollars
and getting a million dollars

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.337
a year, that's kind of 10% on my money.

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:33.270
That's okay, but maybe I
can get some leverage here.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.467
Maybe I don't have to put
all of the 10 million in

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:36.978
maybe I could borrow some of it

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:39.336
and maybe I'll get a
better return that way.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:42.404
So when it comes time to closing
... When it comes time to

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.978
closing, so I'm buying the assets.

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:46.736
So these are the same
assets that I'm buying

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:49.603
and I'm gonna give them ...
and the money that I raise

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:51.210
for these assets are gonna go to you,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.337
the person who started this business.

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:55.135
So here are the assets.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.603
So instead of me putting up
the entire 10 million dollars,

00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:01.644
what I do is I put up one
million dollars myself

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:04.870
So I put up one million dollars myself,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.671
one million from ... from me.

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:09.003
And I go to a bank and I say,

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.939
"Look, will you lend me 9
million dollars? I'm going to

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.145
"put a million dollars of my
own money. Will you lend me"

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.961
"9 million dollars to
help borrow ... to help"

00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:18.478
"buy this business for
10 millions dollars?"

00:02:18.478 --> 00:02:19.004
and the banks says,

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.311
"I don't know. That's a lot of money."

00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.444
"We're putting a lot of money at risk."

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:24.535
and I'l say, "Look, you can
charge me a decent interest rate,"

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.669
"maybe a 10% interest rate
and this is a super stable"

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.004
"business, so clearly I'll
be able to pay the interest"

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.478
"on that money from the business
and if for whatever reason"

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:35.978
"I'm not able to pay you the money,"

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:39.143
"you can get the business. So,
I'm essentially giving you"

00:02:39.143 --> 00:02:40.423
"the business as collateral."

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:42.668
So you find some bank to agree to it

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:45.643
and so they will lend
you 9 million dollars.

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:47.737
They will not lend you 9 million dollars.

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:50.004
Nine million dollar loan

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:55.871
and let's say that it is at
a 10% ... 10% interest level.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.883
So now, after I have ...
So 9 million from the bank,

00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:01.449
one million from me. That goes to you.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.599
You can now retire and buy your dream home

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.461
or whatever else you
might have needed to do

00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:06.961
with that money.

00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:10.404
You could leave it for your
children, whatever you might ...

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:12.938
Donate it to charity,
whatever floats your boat

00:03:12.938 --> 00:03:15.003
but now the capital
structure of the business

00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:16.337
looks like this.

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:17.670
I now do have a lot of debt.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.605
I bought you out using leverage.

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:22.227
This is a leveraged buyout.

00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:24.730
So now, there is one
million dollars of equity

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.833
that came from me

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:30.478
and there's 9 million dollars
of debt that came from the bank.

00:03:30.478 --> 00:03:32.727
That's 9 million dollars of debt.

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:37.144
Assets, at least what I paid
for it was 10 million dollars.

00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:39.144
Liabilities are 9 million dollars.

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:40.803
So what's left over is one million.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:42.311
And let's think about how this investment,

00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.737
assuming the business keeps
generating a million a year,

00:03:44.737 --> 00:03:47.463
let's think about how good
of a payoff this might be

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:50.334
for my one million dollar investment.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:54.143
So before I had a pre-tax
income of 1.5 million.

00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:59.739
So 1.5 million pre-tax. Pre-tax before.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.310
Now I'm going to have
to pay some interest.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.003
So now I'm going to have to
pay ... So 9 million dollars

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:10.978
at 10%, that is $900,000 in interest.

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.337
So now my pre-tax won't be 1.5 million.

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:17.144
I'm also going to have
to pay 900k in interest.

00:04:17.144 --> 00:04:22.936
So minus 900k means that I have 600,000,

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:30.404
so 1.5 - 900k is 600,000
per year pre-tax income,

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.605
600,000 per year in pre-tax income

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:35.402
and then I will pay taxes on that.

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.670
The cool thing about corporate interest

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.561
is that it's tax-deductible.

00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:41.894
It's deducted from your pre-tax income.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:45.009
So you take the 900 from
the 1.5, you have 600,000

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.622
leftover and then you pay taxes on that

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:48.643
and let's say it's
still the same tax rate,

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:51.477
so roughly one-third of
it goes to the government

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:56.136
and so that you are left
with 400,000 net income

00:04:56.136 --> 00:04:57.712
and if you look at the
math, this is actually

00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:01.003
a pretty good deal for me or
I should ... I was saying you,

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:02.270
but I'm the guy who bought it.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.560
You're the guy who sold me the business,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560
so this is me now.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.727
I am left with $400,000
net income per year,

00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:11.604
which is pretty good because I only made

00:05:11.604 --> 00:05:13.404
a one million dollar investment.

00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:15.405
So even though this looks
like a sleepy business,

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:17.143
even though it looked
like it was only getting

00:05:17.143 --> 00:05:20.935
a 10% yield on it, because
I was able to leverage up.

00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:23.336
I was able to do this leveraged buyout,

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:27.070
I'm now able to make $400,000 per year

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.144
on a one million dollar investment

00:05:29.144 --> 00:05:34.310
and now all of a sudden that is
a not so sleepy annual return.
