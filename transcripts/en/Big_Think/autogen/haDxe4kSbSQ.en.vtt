00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 
when I play Bach I try to make the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090
when I play Bach I try to make the
 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.340
when I play Bach I try to make the
dances a dance and make them all really

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350
dances a dance and make them all really
 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.670
dances a dance and make them all really
lively and light and think about how

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680
lively and light and think about how
 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.620
lively and light and think about how
they would have been played in the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630
they would have been played in the
 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.620
they would have been played in the
Baroque era of course now that we have

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630
Baroque era of course now that we have
 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.350
Baroque era of course now that we have
the piano compared to the harpsichord or

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360
the piano compared to the harpsichord or
 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.270
the piano compared to the harpsichord or
the clavichord there's a completely

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280
the clavichord there's a completely
 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.520
the clavichord there's a completely
different sound so I wouldn't try to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530
different sound so I wouldn't try to
 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.390
different sound so I wouldn't try to
imitate the harpsichord but we still

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400
imitate the harpsichord but we still
 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.860
imitate the harpsichord but we still
want to keep some of the essence of the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870
want to keep some of the essence of the
 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.900
want to keep some of the essence of the
harpsichord in it so I like to play with

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910
harpsichord in it so I like to play with
 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.479
harpsichord in it so I like to play with
like some of the timings in it because

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489
like some of the timings in it because
 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.430
like some of the timings in it because
on harpsichord there's no dynamics so

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440
on harpsichord there's no dynamics so
 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.250
on harpsichord there's no dynamics so
all you can do is with timing and with

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
all you can do is with timing and with
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.530
all you can do is with timing and with
touch and articulation so I like to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540
touch and articulation so I like to
 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.360
touch and articulation so I like to
bring it some of those aspects on to the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370
bring it some of those aspects on to the
 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.540
bring it some of those aspects on to the
piano and but keep it in the Baroque

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550
piano and but keep it in the Baroque
 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:12.830
piano and but keep it in the Baroque
style while having a piano sound

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.730
 
I think one I know I have a lot of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
I think one I know I have a lot of
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.940
I think one I know I have a lot of
friends who also play instruments and

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
friends who also play instruments and
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.919
friends who also play instruments and
mainly their reason for not liking Bach

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929
mainly their reason for not liking Bach
 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.069
mainly their reason for not liking Bach
is because it's so hard but I'd like to

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079
is because it's so hard but I'd like to
 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.709
is because it's so hard but I'd like to
encourage them to explore more of it

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719
encourage them to explore more of it
 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.419
encourage them to explore more of it
because it's hard so that they can

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429
because it's hard so that they can
 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.100
because it's hard so that they can
discover something new within each piece

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
discover something new within each piece
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.389
discover something new within each piece
and hopefully they can use that and take

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399
and hopefully they can use that and take
 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.330
and hopefully they can use that and take
it and apply it to other composers so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
it and apply it to other composers so
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
it and apply it to other composers so
that's also helpful I think it's a good

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
that's also helpful I think it's a good
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.749
that's also helpful I think it's a good
way to help people learn how to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
way to help people learn how to
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.289
way to help people learn how to
multitask because you have to deal with

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
multitask because you have to deal with
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330
multitask because you have to deal with
so many different voices that's once and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
so many different voices that's once and
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.160
so many different voices that's once and
they all have to be really clean it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
they all have to be really clean it's
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.679
they all have to be really clean it's
also just really fun to play and it

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689

helps you improve your technique there's
so many running lines I mean you have to

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239
so many running lines I mean you have to
 

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.510
so many running lines I mean you have to
practice them at first of course but

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
practice them at first of course but
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.859
practice them at first of course but
after a while when you get the hang of

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
after a while when you get the hang of
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359
after a while when you get the hang of

work

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
 
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.210
 
I usually work on pieces for at least a

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
I usually work on pieces for at least a
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.280
I usually work on pieces for at least a
year I mean I start I listen to them

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
year I mean I start I listen to them
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350
year I mean I start I listen to them
when I first start playing them and I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
when I first start playing them and I
 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.630
when I first start playing them and I
listen for which ones I like so I'll

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
listen for which ones I like so I'll
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.550
listen for which ones I like so I'll
pick them up find the music and just

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
pick them up find the music and just
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.150
pick them up find the music and just
start working on them by myself and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
start working on them by myself and
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.490
start working on them by myself and
usually it takes me about a year or so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
usually it takes me about a year or so
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.310
usually it takes me about a year or so
to get some good practicing in to get

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320
to get some good practicing in to get
 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.470
to get some good practicing in to get
some good understanding about the piece

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
some good understanding about the piece
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.130
some good understanding about the piece
and then after that of course during

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
and then after that of course during
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.450
and then after that of course during
that time I've worked with my teachers

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460
that time I've worked with my teachers
 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.760
that time I've worked with my teachers
but after that we'll start preparing it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
but after that we'll start preparing it
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.860
but after that we'll start preparing it
to use maybe for performances or other

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
to use maybe for performances or other
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350
to use maybe for performances or other
things like that
