00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.010
So did you figure out what caused the error? Hopefully

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.200
you discovered that it was this one. The first query orders

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.770
by name. And then you added the inequality filter from

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.860
max attendees. So the first sort order is name, but it

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.510
should really be max attendees, because that's where we have

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.830
the inequality filter. Composite index not existing might be a problem

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.830
that you run into, but it isn't the problem this time.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.430
Unless you deploy straight to app spot, in which case you've

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.120
got a couple of different errors going on. And again,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.590
this is a problem you might run into. If you

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.470
try to filter, say, on max attendees greater than 100,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.660
and seats available less than ten. Because then you'd be

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.240
using inequality filters on two different properties in a single

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.000
query. But in this case, this particular error should not

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.330
be the problem. We're only using an inequality filter on

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.550
a single property. So, here's the arrow in the API's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.900
explorer, and you see it tells us exactly what the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.800
problem is. First sort property must be the same as

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.220
property to which the inequality filter is applied. In your

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.629
query, the first sort property is main. But the inequality filter

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.800
is on max attendees. So when you get these kinds

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.600
of errors or any errors, don't be frightened by them, just

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.250
go ahead and read them. There's valuable information in the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.860
errors that will pinpoint the problems and help you fix them.
