mobile doing typography on mobile is
 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.899
mobile doing typography on mobile is
extremely different than doing

typography on print there are some

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
typography on print there are some
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230
typography on print there are some
things in common but there are some

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
things in common but there are some
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.609
things in common but there are some
things that are that are really

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
things that are that are really
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069
things that are that are really
different you have to be very focused on

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
different you have to be very focused on
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.450
different you have to be very focused on
the performance a you know of of the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
the performance a you know of of the
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850
the performance a you know of of the
text stack because you've got only so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
text stack because you've got only so
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039
text stack because you've got only so
much battery and only so much ram but

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
much battery and only so much ram but
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960
much battery and only so much ram but
you really do have very powerful compute

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
you really do have very powerful compute
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.819
you really do have very powerful compute
resources you've got you know multi-core

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
resources you've got you know multi-core
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249
resources you've got you know multi-core
multi gigahertz processes in there so if

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
multi gigahertz processes in there so if
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350
multi gigahertz processes in there so if
you want to do sophisticated advanced

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
you want to do sophisticated advanced
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179
you want to do sophisticated advanced
typography you do have the compute power

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
typography you do have the compute power
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.980
typography you do have the compute power
to do that 60 frames a second is

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
to do that 60 frames a second is
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.209
to do that 60 frames a second is
absolutely a requirement and this is

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
absolutely a requirement and this is
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.499
absolutely a requirement and this is
again both a challenge and an

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
again both a challenge and an
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.020
again both a challenge and an
opportunity that that you can do these

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
opportunity that that you can do these
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700
opportunity that that you can do these
really rich animations and transitions

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
really rich animations and transitions
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.479
really rich animations and transitions
and do this kind of interactive motion

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489
and do this kind of interactive motion
 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.949
and do this kind of interactive motion
typography that that really is you know

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
typography that that really is you know
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.690
typography that that really is you know
completely impossible in a print

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
completely impossible in a print
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.870
completely impossible in a print
background but

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
background but
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120
background but
have to make everything fit in that 16

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130
have to make everything fit in that 16
 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.060
have to make everything fit in that 16
millisecond budget you've got a very

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070
millisecond budget you've got a very
 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.830
millisecond budget you've got a very
small screen and this has some

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
small screen and this has some
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.200
small screen and this has some
interesting challenges in how you create

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210
interesting challenges in how you create
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.870
interesting challenges in how you create
your layouts how you do the paragraph

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880
your layouts how you do the paragraph
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.990
your layouts how you do the paragraph
layout but but a flip side it again is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000
layout but but a flip side it again is
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.430
layout but but a flip side it again is
that on modern devices you have this

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
that on modern devices you have this
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.700
that on modern devices you have this
very high resolution then as I mentioned

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
very high resolution then as I mentioned
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.320
very high resolution then as I mentioned
you know we have this requirement to

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
you know we have this requirement to
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.200
you know we have this requirement to
support all of the languages of the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210
support all of the languages of the
 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.580
support all of the languages of the
world all the scripts of the world but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590
world all the scripts of the world but
 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.140
world all the scripts of the world but
we have a lot of really good resources

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
we have a lot of really good resources
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.140
we have a lot of really good resources
both in fonts and typography control of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150
both in fonts and typography control of
 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.500
both in fonts and typography control of
how you do that and then you know I'm

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510
how you do that and then you know I'm
 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.030
how you do that and then you know I'm
going to talk about some of the line

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040
going to talk about some of the line
 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.170
going to talk about some of the line
breaking improvement some of the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
breaking improvement some of the
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.340
breaking improvement some of the
paragraph layout improvements in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
paragraph layout improvements in
 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.570
paragraph layout improvements in
marshmallow and those were really

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
marshmallow and those were really
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.000
marshmallow and those were really
motivated by a need to get this working

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
motivated by a need to get this working
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.350
motivated by a need to get this working
in very small screens like watch faces

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
in very small screens like watch faces
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.510
in very small screens like watch faces
so I'm going to just kind of introduce

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520
so I'm going to just kind of introduce
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.890
so I'm going to just kind of introduce
this concept of you know like the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
this concept of you know like the
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.690
this concept of you know like the
advance of display technology this was

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
advance of display technology this was
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.550
advance of display technology this was
the first mobile device I ever had when

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
the first mobile device I ever had when
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.580
the first mobile device I ever had when
I was 12 years old and I mean as you can

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590
I was 12 years old and I mean as you can
 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.710
I was 12 years old and I mean as you can
see it's got a lot of the elements of a

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720
see it's got a lot of the elements of a
 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.860
see it's got a lot of the elements of a
modern mobile device you know it even

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870
modern mobile device you know it even
 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.060
modern mobile device you know it even
has a really nice big keyboard but the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
has a really nice big keyboard but the
 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.760
has a really nice big keyboard but the
display technology at in this generation

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770
display technology at in this generation
 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.160
display technology at in this generation
of technology is kind of the bare

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
of technology is kind of the bare
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.960
of technology is kind of the bare
minimum that you need to get text

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
minimum that you need to get text
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360
minimum that you need to get text
displayed at all and I think that that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370
displayed at all and I think that that
 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.790
displayed at all and I think that that
evolution you know kind of carried that

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800
evolution you know kind of carried that
 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.860
evolution you know kind of carried that
there was a very primitive approach to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870
there was a very primitive approach to
 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.620
there was a very primitive approach to
just get the the letters drawn on the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630
just get the the letters drawn on the
 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.540
just get the the letters drawn on the
screen and not really think about

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550
screen and not really think about
 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.210
screen and not really think about
typography another good thing about the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
typography another good thing about the
 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.800
typography another good thing about the

you have a very small number of pixels

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250
you have a very small number of pixels
 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.120
you have a very small number of pixels
to represent the text and you have a lot

display technologies and they were

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000
display technologies and they were
 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.749
display technologies and they were
really thinking how how if we were

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759
really thinking how how if we were
 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.550
really thinking how how if we were
redesigning this from scratch if we

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560
redesigning this from scratch if we
 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.219
redesigning this from scratch if we
really could do anything what would we

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229
really could do anything what would we
 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.629
really could do anything what would we
do and the result of that exploration

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639
do and the result of that exploration
 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.670
do and the result of that exploration
really synthesized into a set of

in the material design spec I really

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789
in the material design spec I really
 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.379
in the material design spec I really
recommend it it's very you know has a

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389
recommend it it's very you know has a
 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.079
recommend it it's very you know has a
lot of good good information and a lot

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089
lot of good good information and a lot
 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.969
lot of good good information and a lot
of good guidance about how to do

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979
of good guidance about how to do
 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.129
of good guidance about how to do
typography with in material design and

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139
typography with in material design and
 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:56.279
typography with in material design and
of course another part of that is a much

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289
of course another part of that is a much
 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.519
of course another part of that is a much
greater expanded palette of different

00:06:59.519 --> 00:06:59.529
greater expanded palette of different
 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:02.100
greater expanded palette of different
weights and of different sizes and how

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
weights and of different sizes and how
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.619
weights and of different sizes and how
you kind of use the weight and size

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:04.629
you kind of use the weight and size
 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.600
you kind of use the weight and size
instead of having just one size of text

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610
instead of having just one size of text
 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.389
instead of having just one size of text
one way you use this to indicate the

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:09.399
one way you use this to indicate the
 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.949
one way you use this to indicate the
structure of your app the structure of

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:10.959
structure of your app the structure of
 

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:15.570
structure of your app the structure of
the information in your app so the the

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580
the information in your app so the the
 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.269
the information in your app so the the
cornerstone of typography in material

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:18.279
cornerstone of typography in material
 

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:20.760
cornerstone of typography in material
design is the robot 02 typeface and so

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770
design is the robot 02 typeface and so
 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.499
design is the robot 02 typeface and so
this was an update that happened in

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:22.509
this was an update that happened in
 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.320
this was an update that happened in
lollipop and you know it was pretty

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330
lollipop and you know it was pretty
 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.209
lollipop and you know it was pretty
subtle a lot of people probably didn't

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219
subtle a lot of people probably didn't
 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.429
subtle a lot of people probably didn't
even notice it but there was actually a

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:29.439
even notice it but there was actually a
 

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:32.040
even notice it but there was actually a
lot going on in this update so one of

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050
lot going on in this update so one of
 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.869
lot going on in this update so one of
the things is the expanded Unicode

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879
the things is the expanded Unicode
 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.759
the things is the expanded Unicode
coverage it actually increased by a

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:35.769
coverage it actually increased by a
 

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:39.119
coverage it actually increased by a
factor of three and we have full support

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:39.129
factor of three and we have full support
 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.719
factor of three and we have full support
for Unicode 84 Latin Greek and Cyrillic

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729
for Unicode 84 Latin Greek and Cyrillic

for Unicode 84 Latin Greek and Cyrillic
script and that covers a lot of the

00:07:46.109 --> 00:07:46.119
script and that covers a lot of the
 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:48.779
script and that covers a lot of the

languages in the world that arm you know
 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:50.639
languages in the world that arm you know
that are maybe less familiar to us like

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:50.649
that are maybe less familiar to us like
 

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:52.769
that are maybe less familiar to us like
other African languages use a lot of

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:52.779
other African languages use a lot of
 

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:56.279
other African languages use a lot of
kind of unusual Latin characters we also

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.289
kind of unusual Latin characters we also
 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.259
kind of unusual Latin characters we also
expanded the weights and styles that we

00:07:58.259 --> 00:07:58.269
expanded the weights and styles that we
 

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.659
expanded the weights and styles that we

visual effects that you can get and all
 

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.959
visual effects that you can get and all
of those include Truitt Alex and we also

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:09.969
of those include Truitt Alex and we also
 

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:11.909
of those include Truitt Alex and we also
have a family of condensed which is

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919
have a family of condensed which is
 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:14.429

better for better information density

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:14.439
better for better information density
 

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.429
better for better information density

we really treat almost everything we do

00:08:40.439 --> 00:08:40.449
we really treat almost everything we do
 

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:46.379
we really treat almost everything we do
in a very open open source manner so the

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:46.389
in a very open open source manner so the
 

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:49.170
in a very open open source manner so the
design updated as well and this is just

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.180
design updated as well and this is just
 

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.910
design updated as well and this is just
a little bit of a kind of a before and

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920
a little bit of a kind of a before and
 

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.889
a little bit of a kind of a before and
after and you can see there's it's a

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:52.899
after and you can see there's it's a
 

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:54.340
after and you can see there's it's a
little subtle but like there's kind

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.350
little subtle but like there's kind
 

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.310
little subtle but like there's kind
a stiff sides to some of the characters

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320
a stiff sides to some of the characters
 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.920
a stiff sides to some of the characters
like a capital o and that has become a

00:08:59.920 --> 00:08:59.930
like a capital o and that has become a
 

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.010
like a capital o and that has become a
more refined gentle curve some of the

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.020
more refined gentle curve some of the
 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.420
more refined gentle curve some of the
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.430
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual
 

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.690
shapes were maybe a little bit unusual
like the k's and the capital r and those

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.700
like the k's and the capital r and those
 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.610
like the k's and the capital r and those
have become kind of more simplified and

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:09.620
have become kind of more simplified and
 

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.830
have become kind of more simplified and
more streamlined and we also went from a

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:11.840
more streamlined and we also went from a
 

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.370
more streamlined and we also went from a
square dot on the eyes and JS to a round

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:15.380
square dot on the eyes and JS to a round
 

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.740
square dot on the eyes and JS to a round
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.890
on so it's just it's an evolution it's a
more refined form of the original kind

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:20.900
more refined form of the original kind
 

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.650
more refined form of the original kind
of you know design it's very central to

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:25.660
of you know design it's very central to
 

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.480
of you know design it's very central to
to Android and very central of course to

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:28.490
to Android and very central of course to
 

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.510
to Android and very central of course to
material design so you know I talked

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:31.520
material design so you know I talked
 

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.550
material design so you know I talked
about the global reach of the Android we

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560
about the global reach of the Android we
 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.080
about the global reach of the Android we
talked about a lot about the next

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.090
talked about a lot about the next
 

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.020
talked about a lot about the next
billion users and you know they're there

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.030
billion users and you know they're there
 

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.790
billion users and you know they're there
like we heard in the previous you know

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800
like we heard in the previous you know
 

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.260
like we heard in the previous you know
talk about you know how do you reach

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:44.270
talk about you know how do you reach
 

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.600
talk about you know how do you reach
them through the Play Store console but

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:46.610
them through the Play Store console but
 

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.490
them through the Play Store console but
there's also a lot that you have to do

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.500
there's also a lot that you have to do
 

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.080
there's also a lot that you have to do
with the presentation of text and

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.090
with the presentation of text and
 

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.020
with the presentation of text and
language in these devices so again

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.030

Roboto to dramatically increases the

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:55.520
Roboto to dramatically increases the
 

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.940
Roboto to dramatically increases the
Unicode coverage and you can see this is

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:57.950
Unicode coverage and you can see this is
 

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.650
Unicode coverage and you can see this is
just a sample this is just one of the

00:09:59.650 --> 00:09:59.660
just a sample this is just one of the
 

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.130
just a sample this is just one of the
pages of kind of additional extended

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:03.140
pages of kind of additional extended
 

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.170
pages of kind of additional extended
Latin characters and another thing I'll

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.180
Latin characters and another thing I'll
 

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.910
Latin characters and another thing I'll
point out just you know for this slide

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920
point out just you know for this slide
 

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.060
point out just you know for this slide
somewhat like if you look kind of near

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.070
somewhat like if you look kind of near
 

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.550
somewhat like if you look kind of near
the middle on towards left hand side you

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560
the middle on towards left hand side you
 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.680
the middle on towards left hand side you
see some oohs with some EE stacked

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:16.690
see some oohs with some EE stacked
 

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.690
see some oohs with some EE stacked
accents and that's a very common pattern

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:19.700
accents and that's a very common pattern
 

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.880
accents and that's a very common pattern
in a lot of languages but not not

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:21.890
in a lot of languages but not not
 

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.680
in a lot of languages but not not
European languages that we're used to so

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:23.690
European languages that we're used to so
 

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.780
European languages that we're used to so
you see it in Vietnamese and some of

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:25.790
you see it in Vietnamese and some of
 

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.430
you see it in Vietnamese and some of
these other languages so you really when

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440
these other languages so you really when
 

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.320
these other languages so you really when
you're when you're designing your apps

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.330
you're when you're designing your apps
 

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.300
you're when you're designing your apps
when you're testing your apps you really

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.310
when you're testing your apps you really
 

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.970
when you're testing your apps you really
need to be careful to test them in some

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:33.980
need to be careful to test them in some
 

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.800
need to be careful to test them in some
of these other languages to make sure

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:35.810
of these other languages to make sure
 

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.570
of these other languages to make sure
that you've got enough vertical space

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:37.580
that you've got enough vertical space
 

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.970
that you've got enough vertical space
this is kind of one of the one of the

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:39.980
this is kind of one of the one of the
 

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.700
this is kind of one of the one of the
real key takeaways that if you just

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:42.710
real key takeaways that if you just
 

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.350
real key takeaways that if you just
design in English you've got these

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360
design in English you've got these
 

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.760
design in English you've got these
letters they don't have anything going

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:45.770
letters they don't have anything going
 

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.290
letters they don't have anything going
on above they don't have anything going

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.300
on above they don't have anything going
 

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.780
on above they don't have anything going
on below but that is not the experience

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790
on below but that is not the experience
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.680
on below but that is not the experience
of you know the millions hundreds of

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:53.690
of you know the millions hundreds of
 

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.710
of you know the millions hundreds of
millions of people around the world so

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720
millions of people around the world so
 

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.450
millions of people around the world so
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:58.460
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic
 

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.090
in addition to Latin Greek and Cyrillic
there's this huge diversity of other

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.100
there's this huge diversity of other
 

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.740
there's this huge diversity of other
languages and in fact this is the list

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:02.750
languages and in fact this is the list
 

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.810
languages and in fact this is the list
of scripts not even languages there's

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:04.820
of scripts not even languages there's
 

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.640
of scripts not even languages there's
many scripts that support multiple

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.650
many scripts that support multiple
 

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.990
many scripts that support multiple
languages

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000
languages
 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.480
languages
these are the note o scripts that we're

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.490
these are the note o scripts that we're
 

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.490
these are the note o scripts that we're
supporting in marshmallow so it really

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:12.500
supporting in marshmallow so it really
 

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.760
supporting in marshmallow so it really
is you know huge expansion compared with

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:15.770
is you know huge expansion compared with
 

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.950
is you know huge expansion compared with
previous versions of Android and it

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:17.960
previous versions of Android and it
 

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.250
previous versions of Android and it
really covers a very large fraction of

not or does this flag exist in the case
of the flag emoji and so we've got this

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:20.870
of the flag emoji and so we've got this
 

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.480
of the flag emoji and so we've got this
new API that will tell you it's very

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:22.490
new API that will tell you it's very
 

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.660
new API that will tell you it's very
fast and we really recommend we really

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:24.670
fast and we really recommend we really
 

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.130
fast and we really recommend we really
want you to be using haskell if so you

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:27.140
want you to be using haskell if so you
 

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.990
want you to be using haskell if so you
know what emoji are on your on your

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000
know what emoji are on your on your
 

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.460
know what emoji are on your on your
device what you can use um so then I

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:33.470
device what you can use um so then I
 

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.620
device what you can use um so then I
want to talk about some of the

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:35.630
want to talk about some of the
 

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.090
want to talk about some of the
typography features we've really been

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.100
typography features we've really been
 

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.280
typography features we've really been
expanding this you know the goal my goal

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.290
expanding this you know the goal my goal
 

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.450
expanding this you know the goal my goal
certainly is to make Android typography

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:42.460
certainly is to make Android typography
 

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.640
certainly is to make Android typography
match what you can do on the web and

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:45.650
match what you can do on the web and
 

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.680
match what you can do on the web and
match what you can do not just in print

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:47.690
match what you can do not just in print
 

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.360
match what you can do not just in print
but like really high-quality print and

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.370
but like really high-quality print and
 

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.530
but like really high-quality print and
so I'll walk you through some of the

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:50.540
so I'll walk you through some of the
 

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.250
so I'll walk you through some of the
things that we do here I'll just go

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:54.260
things that we do here I'll just go
 

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.540
things that we do here I'll just go
through this list and then I'll show

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:55.550
through this list and then I'll show
 

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.910
through this list and then I'll show
some examples that we we have kerning

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920
some examples that we we have kerning
 

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.000
some examples that we we have kerning
and ligatures we've actually had those

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.010
and ligatures we've actually had those
 

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.400
and ligatures we've actually had those
since I think jellybean mr2 but now

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:03.410
since I think jellybean mr2 but now
 

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.990
since I think jellybean mr2 but now
there's more control so if you want to

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000
there's more control so if you want to
 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.220
there's more control so if you want to
turn those on and off there's

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.230
turn those on and off there's
 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.680
turn those on and off there's
fine-grained control to do that we have

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:08.690
fine-grained control to do that we have
 

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:13.660
fine-grained control to do that we have
this font feature settings attribute

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:13.670
this font feature settings attribute
 

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.870
this font feature settings attribute
where you really can go in and control

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880
where you really can go in and control
 

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.310
where you really can go in and control
the open type features i'll give you

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320
the open type features i'll give you
 

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.590
the open type features i'll give you
several examples of that and that's

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600
several examples of that and that's
 

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.750
several examples of that and that's
using a CSS compatible syntax so we want

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:22.760
using a CSS compatible syntax so we want
 

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.250
using a CSS compatible syntax so we want
to make this stuff so you know if your

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:24.260
to make this stuff so you know if your
 

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.180

designers are you know used to

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.190
designers are you know used to
 

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.440
designers are you know used to
controlling typography on the web we

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.450
controlling typography on the web we
 

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.030
controlling typography on the web we
want to make that kind of impedance

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040
want to make that kind of impedance
 

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.440
want to make that kind of impedance
mismatch as smooth as possible so so you

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.450
mismatch as smooth as possible so so you
 

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.270
mismatch as smooth as possible so so you
can just take that knowledge and apply

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:37.280
can just take that knowledge and apply
 

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280
can just take that knowledge and apply
it to android apps and then this is a

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.290
it to android apps and then this is a
 

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.510
it to android apps and then this is a
little bit more technical thing but we

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:40.520
little bit more technical thing but we
 

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.690
little bit more technical thing but we
use opentype integrally to give you

it's presented and we use opentype to

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:56.900
it's presented and we use opentype to
 

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.800
it's presented and we use opentype to
control that and I'll talk a little bit

00:16:59.800 --> 00:16:59.810
control that and I'll talk a little bit
 

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.050
control that and I'll talk a little bit
also about what you want to do in your

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.060
also about what you want to do in your
 

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.199
also about what you want to do in your
app to make that work perfectly so

00:17:05.199 --> 00:17:05.209
app to make that work perfectly so
 

00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:07.449

definitely a sign of kind of more

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360
definitely a sign of kind of more
 

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.210
definitely a sign of kind of more
sophisticated typography that you don't

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.220
sophisticated typography that you don't
 

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.010
sophisticated typography that you don't
just put the letters that in some cases

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.020
just put the letters that in some cases
 

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.500
just put the letters that in some cases
you have these combinations and you have

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:23.510
you have these combinations and you have
 

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.090
you have these combinations and you have
a specifically drawn glyph that

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:25.100
a specifically drawn glyph that
 

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.429
a specifically drawn glyph that
represents more than one letter and this

00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439
represents more than one letter and this
 

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:30.070
represents more than one letter and this
is certainly you know this exists in

especially in serif fonts you really

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840
especially in serif fonts you really
 

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.570
especially in serif fonts you really
need those ligatures for the font to

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:37.580
need those ligatures for the font to
 

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.000
need those ligatures for the font to
display correctly so if again as you're

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.010
display correctly so if again as you're
 

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.820
display correctly so if again as you're
using custom fonts in your app you want

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:42.830
using custom fonts in your app you want
 

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.280
using custom fonts in your app you want
those ligatures and the same is true for

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:45.290
those ligatures and the same is true for
 

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.110
those ligatures and the same is true for

that's actually a lollipop plus API
another kind of great hidden feature is

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:20.179
another kind of great hidden feature is
 

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:22.210
another kind of great hidden feature is
the use of proportional and old style

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.220
the use of proportional and old style
 

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.180
the use of proportional and old style
numbers and these are really important

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:25.190
numbers and these are really important
 

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.000
numbers and these are really important
for kind of a more refined sophisticated

typography that the default numbers are
 

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.680
typography that the default numbers are
basically the same size as capitals and

basically the same size as capitals and
they're all the same width and being the

they're all the same width and being the
 

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.090
they're all the same width and being the
same width is really important if you've

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.100
same width is really important if you've
 

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.580
same width is really important if you've
got some kind of animated display you

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:39.590
got some kind of animated display you
 

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.080
got some kind of animated display you
don't want it to be juddering back and

the point where the line is full then
 

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.220
the point where the line is full then
you just break at the word boundary and

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.380
things like Persian numerals and so on
or not well Persian numerals are

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:17.390
or not well Persian numerals are
 

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.590
or not well Persian numerals are
complicated but the point is that you if

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600
complicated but the point is that you if
 

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.290
complicated but the point is that you if
you know the language then setting it

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:23.300
you know the language then setting it
 

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.240
you know the language then setting it
will get the correct lookups to happen

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:25.250
will get the correct lookups to happen
 

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.920
will get the correct lookups to happen
on the font the locale also affects line

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:29.930
on the font the locale also affects line
 

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.630
on the font the locale also affects line
breaking there's some languages we're

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640
breaking there's some languages we're
 

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.130
breaking there's some languages we're
deciding where the boundaries are

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:33.140
deciding where the boundaries are
 

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.780
deciding where the boundaries are
between words where you can break the

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:34.790
between words where you can break the
 

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.400
between words where you can break the
line is actually kind of a complex

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.410
line is actually kind of a complex
 

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.400
line is actually kind of a complex
question ty is the most common certainly

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:39.410
question ty is the most common certainly
 

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.130
question ty is the most common certainly
that you'll see where there's no spaces

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.140
that you'll see where there's no spaces
 

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.780
that you'll see where there's no spaces
and so you really in the case of Thai

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:43.790
and so you really in the case of Thai
 

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.880
and so you really in the case of Thai
you need a dictionary you need to say

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:45.890
you need a dictionary you need to say
 

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.770
you need a dictionary you need to say
you know this is the word so that I know

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:47.780
you know this is the word so that I know
 

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.360
you know this is the word so that I know
where the boundaries of the words are

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:49.370
where the boundaries of the words are
 

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:51.940
where the boundaries of the words are
and that is completely reliant on

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:51.950
and that is completely reliant on
 

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.740
and that is completely reliant on
knowing what the language is if you just

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:53.750
knowing what the language is if you just
 

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.440
knowing what the language is if you just
put tight x through but don't identify

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.450
put tight x through but don't identify
 

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.020
put tight x through but don't identify
that the language is thai then it gets

00:30:59.020 --> 00:30:59.030
that the language is thai then it gets
 

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.290
that the language is thai then it gets
confused and you get line breaks in in

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.300
confused and you get line breaks in in
 

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.730
confused and you get line breaks in in
potentially very bad places that don't

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.740
potentially very bad places that don't
 

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.190
potentially very bad places that don't
don't line up with words at all and then

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200
don't line up with words at all and then
 

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.330
don't line up with words at all and then
of course lastly

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:07.340
of course lastly
 

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.880
of course lastly
now that we have automatic hyphenation

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:09.890
now that we have automatic hyphenation
 

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.460
now that we have automatic hyphenation
that knowing which dictionary of

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.470
that knowing which dictionary of
 

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.510
that knowing which dictionary of
patterns to use depends on the language

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:16.520
patterns to use depends on the language
 

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.060
patterns to use depends on the language
and if use and this is like most of the

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.070
and if use and this is like most of the
 

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.920
and if use and this is like most of the
things that I just talked about you know

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:20.930
things that I just talked about you know
 

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.680
things that I just talked about you know
are kind of more exotic languages to to

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:23.690
are kind of more exotic languages to to
 

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.450
are kind of more exotic languages to to
this audience but automatic hyphenation

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:25.460
this audience but automatic hyphenation
 

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.610
this audience but automatic hyphenation
is important between you know for

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:27.620
is important between you know for
 

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.010
is important between you know for
example Norwegian and English they're

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.020
example Norwegian and English they're
 

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.770
example Norwegian and English they're
both in the same script but if you use

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:32.780
both in the same script but if you use
 

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.240
both in the same script but if you use
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.250
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get
 

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.150
the wrong patterns you'll get you'll get
weird hyphens and then there's an a you

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:37.160
weird hyphens and then there's an a you
 

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.410
weird hyphens and then there's an a you
know like there's this like how do you

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:38.420
know like there's this like how do you
 

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.920
know like there's this like how do you
know what the what the language is and

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:40.930
know what the what the language is and
 

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.790
know what the what the language is and
fortunately there is an open source

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:42.800
fortunately there is an open source
 

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.430
fortunately there is an open source
library I mean this is actually mostly

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440
library I mean this is actually mostly
 

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.620
library I mean this is actually mostly
developed by google but it's out there

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:47.630
developed by google but it's out there
 

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.590

the compact language detector library

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600
the compact language detector library
 

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.440
the compact language detector library
which is now in its second version as

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.450
which is now in its second version as
 

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.060
which is now in its second version as
open source and it's designed to be very

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.070
open source and it's designed to be very
 

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.100
open source and it's designed to be very
performant very fast it's not a huge

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.110
performant very fast it's not a huge
 

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.290
performant very fast it's not a huge
dependency to take on so if you've got

00:31:59.290 --> 00:31:59.300
dependency to take on so if you've got
 

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.330
dependency to take on so if you've got
an app where you know you're displaying

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:01.340
an app where you know you're displaying
 

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.730
an app where you know you're displaying
messages and you really don't have the

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:03.740
messages and you really don't have the
 

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.100
messages and you really don't have the
metadata you don't know what where it

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.110
metadata you don't know what where it
 

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.870
metadata you don't know what where it
came from what that language is but you

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880
came from what that language is but you
 

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.360
came from what that language is but you
want to ensure that it's displayed with

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.370
want to ensure that it's displayed with
 

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.220
want to ensure that it's displayed with
the highest quality and of course that

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.230
the highest quality and of course that
 

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.140
the highest quality and of course that
metadata can be really useful for lots

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.150
metadata can be really useful for lots
 

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.450
metadata can be really useful for lots
of other things then then we really do

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:16.460
of other things then then we really do
 

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.190
of other things then then we really do
recommend this this compact language

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200
recommend this this compact language
 

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.610
recommend this this compact language
detector and and that'll you pipe the

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.620
detector and and that'll you pipe the
 

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:24.010
detector and and that'll you pipe the
output of that intersect like two into

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:24.020
output of that intersect like two into
 

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.720
output of that intersect like two into
sent text locale and that really

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:25.730
sent text locale and that really
 

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.730
sent text locale and that really
improves the quality of your of your

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:27.740
improves the quality of your of your
 

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.810
improves the quality of your of your
display so that's that's kind of all of

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:31.820
display so that's that's kind of all of
 

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.270
display so that's that's kind of all of
the prepared topics that I had I want to

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:34.280
the prepared topics that I had I want to
 

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.970
the prepared topics that I had I want to
open it up to questions uh I'm happy to

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:36.980
open it up to questions uh I'm happy to
 

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.040
open it up to questions uh I'm happy to
answer any questions you have and please

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.050
answer any questions you have and please

answer any questions you have and please
wait for the mic to come to you

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:53.950
 

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.779
hello on the topic of custom funds so

00:32:57.779 --> 00:32:57.789
hello on the topic of custom funds so
 

00:32:57.789 --> 00:33:00.480
hello on the topic of custom funds so
you can achieve custom fonts via like on

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:00.490
you can achieve custom fonts via like on
 

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.519
you can achieve custom fonts via like on
simple view such as text view but it's

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:02.529
simple view such as text view but it's
 

00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:05.490
simple view such as text view but it's
pretty difficult to do for framework you

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:05.500
pretty difficult to do for framework you
 

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.919
pretty difficult to do for framework you
are classes there's like navigation view

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:07.929
are classes there's like navigation view
 

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:10.169
are classes there's like navigation view
or like toolbar is there a recommended

00:33:10.169 --> 00:33:10.179
or like toolbar is there a recommended
 

00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:12.000
or like toolbar is there a recommended
way by the frameworks team to achieve

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.010
way by the frameworks team to achieve
 

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.710
way by the frameworks team to achieve
like custom fonts globally was in your

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:13.720
like custom fonts globally was in your
 

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.759
like custom fonts globally was in your
app yeah that's a good question I there

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:17.769
app yeah that's a good question I there
 

00:33:17.769 --> 00:33:22.980
app yeah that's a good question I there
I don't think we have a mechanism for

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:22.990
I don't think we have a mechanism for
 

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.860
I don't think we have a mechanism for
like applying a font you know globally

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:25.870
like applying a font you know globally
 

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.139
like applying a font you know globally
across the app so unfortunately I think

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:28.149
across the app so unfortunately I think
 

00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:29.340
across the app so unfortunately I think
that is something that you have to do

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:29.350
that is something that you have to do
 

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.360
that is something that you have to do
you know with with code but but that's a

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.370
you know with with code but but that's a
 

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.250
you know with with code but but that's a
that's something you know that we're

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:35.260
that's something you know that we're
 

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.649
that's something you know that we're
interested in looking at making easier

00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659
 

00:33:39.659 --> 00:33:42.840
hey I get a lot of requests from design

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:42.850
hey I get a lot of requests from design
 

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.230
hey I get a lot of requests from design
for situations where they want the text

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240
for situations where they want the text
 

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.680
for situations where they want the text
to be exactly this size possibly because

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:49.690
to be exactly this size possibly because
 

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.029
to be exactly this size possibly because
it's aligning with an image or something

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039
it's aligning with an image or something
 

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:53.730
it's aligning with an image or something
like that is there what is your

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:53.740
like that is there what is your
 

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.889
like that is there what is your
recommendation for what I really like to

00:33:55.889 --> 00:33:55.899
recommendation for what I really like to
 

00:33:55.899 --> 00:33:58.139
recommendation for what I really like to
do is have the text shrink down if it's

00:33:58.139 --> 00:33:58.149
do is have the text shrink down if it's
 

00:33:58.149 --> 00:34:00.000
do is have the text shrink down if it's
in sale language that it has more text

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.010
in sale language that it has more text
 

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.769
in sale language that it has more text
there yeah what is your recommendation

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:01.779
there yeah what is your recommendation
 

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:05.039
there yeah what is your recommendation
for that that's a very common request

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:05.049
for that that's a very common request
 

00:34:05.049 --> 00:34:07.769
for that that's a very common request
and we do not have support in the

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:07.779
and we do not have support in the
 

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:09.899
and we do not have support in the
framework for that yet it is something

00:34:09.899 --> 00:34:09.909
framework for that yet it is something
 

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.659
framework for that yet it is something
that we are really looking at there are

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:12.669
that we are really looking at there are
 

00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:15.030
that we are really looking at there are
a number of open source libraries one of

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040
a number of open source libraries one of
 

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.550
a number of open source libraries one of
the reasons that we haven't um

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560
the reasons that we haven't um
 

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.809
the reasons that we haven't um
implemented something like that we I

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:18.819
implemented something like that we I
 

00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:21.359
implemented something like that we I
looked at it and one of the problems

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:21.369
looked at it and one of the problems
 

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:23.190
looked at it and one of the problems
that you get into is that you get kind

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200
that you get into is that you get kind
 

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.680
that you get into is that you get kind
of how do you specify what that behavior

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:25.690
of how do you specify what that behavior
 

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.329
of how do you specify what that behavior
should be so you just specify kind of

00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:27.339
should be so you just specify kind of
 

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:28.740
should be so you just specify kind of
one point in there where you want it to

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:28.750
one point in there where you want it to
 

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.290
one point in there where you want it to
be exactly that size but there's a lot

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:31.300
be exactly that size but there's a lot
 

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.419
be exactly that size but there's a lot
of other use cases where people are

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:33.429
of other use cases where people are
 

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.099
of other use cases where people are
trying to you know because you're trying

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:35.109
trying to you know because you're trying
 

00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:36.899
trying to you know because you're trying
to line it up basically with other other

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:36.909
to line it up basically with other other
 

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.609
to line it up basically with other other
graphic elements there's a lot of other

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:38.619
graphic elements there's a lot of other
 

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:40.319
graphic elements there's a lot of other
cases where people are just mostly

00:34:40.319 --> 00:34:40.329
cases where people are just mostly
 

00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:41.700
cases where people are just mostly
concerned about making it fit so they

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:41.710
concerned about making it fit so they
 

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.440
concerned about making it fit so they
want kind of different logic they want

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:43.450
want kind of different logic they want
 

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:45.510
want kind of different logic they want
something that says make it a standard

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520
something that says make it a standard
 

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.240
something that says make it a standard
size make it 14 SP unless it doesn't fit

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.250
size make it 14 SP unless it doesn't fit
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.700
size make it 14 SP unless it doesn't fit
and then we excuse me and then we want

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:50.710
and then we excuse me and then we want
 

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.379
and then we excuse me and then we want
to have it shrink down to some other

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:52.389
to have it shrink down to some other
 

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.119
to have it shrink down to some other
size but we don't want to have it shrink

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:54.129
size but we don't want to have it shrink
 

00:34:54.129 --> 00:34:55.980
size but we don't want to have it shrink
bound to you know below like eight

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:55.990
bound to you know below like eight
 

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:58.349
bound to you know below like eight
because then it becomes illegible so you

00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359
because then it becomes illegible so you
 

00:34:58.359 --> 00:35:00.240
because then it becomes illegible so you
get these cases where like specifying

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.250
get these cases where like specifying
 

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.790
get these cases where like specifying
how you want that behavior to scale is

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800
how you want that behavior to scale is
 

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.220
how you want that behavior to scale is
kind of complicated and that's that's

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:05.230
kind of complicated and that's that's
 

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.540
kind of complicated and that's that's
kind of you know we when we

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:07.550
kind of you know we when we
 

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.220
kind of you know we when we
if and when we do implement something

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.230
if and when we do implement something
 

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.570
if and when we do implement something
like that in the framework we really

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:10.580
like that in the framework we really
 

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.760
like that in the framework we really
need to make sure that we get that we

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:12.770
need to make sure that we get that we
 

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.670
need to make sure that we get that we
cover the range of behavior in a way

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680
cover the range of behavior in a way
 

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.060
cover the range of behavior in a way
that makes sense until then you know i'm

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.070
that makes sense until then you know i'm
 

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.640
that makes sense until then you know i'm
not going to recommend any specific open

that was misleading that it's not CSS

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:50.690
that was misleading that it's not CSS
 

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.110
that was misleading that it's not CSS

we're in that particular slide I was

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:01.610
we're in that particular slide I was
 

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.400
we're in that particular slide I was
talking about font feature settings and

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:03.410
talking about font feature settings and
 

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.160
talking about font feature settings and
it's like the syntax because you know

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.170
it's like the syntax because you know
 

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.300
it's like the syntax because you know
specifying all these open type features

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:07.310
specifying all these open type features
 

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.580
specifying all these open type features
is kind of a complex thing it's not just

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:09.590
is kind of a complex thing it's not just
 

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.470
is kind of a complex thing it's not just
like a number or something like that and

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480
like a number or something like that and
 

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.310
like a number or something like that and
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:15.320
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is
 

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.980
so we adapted the syntax from CSS it is
compatible with CSS so if you have that

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:17.990
compatible with CSS so if you have that
 

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.930
compatible with CSS so if you have that
particular feature other features that

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:19.940
particular feature other features that
 

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.450
particular feature other features that
we've got like letter spacing the name

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:22.460
we've got like letter spacing the name
 

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.580
we've got like letter spacing the name
of the future the meaning of the future

we're trying to make it consistent with
 

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.260
we're trying to make it consistent with
CSS but we haven't like implemented a

web browser and android framework you

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880
web browser and android framework you
 

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.030
web browser and android framework you
know text you can use web view but

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040
know text you can use web view but
 

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.310
know text you can use web view but
that's you know there's there is not

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320
that's you know there's there is not
 

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.550
that's you know there's there is not
like a generic CSS translator it's just

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560
like a generic CSS translator it's just
 

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.300
like a generic CSS translator it's just
these specific features that are low

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.310
these specific features that are low
 

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:50.620
these specific features that are low
impedance or compatible with CSS ok what

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:50.630
impedance or compatible with CSS ok what
 

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.840
impedance or compatible with CSS ok what
is the performance cost of the high

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:52.850
is the performance cost of the high
 

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:54.730
is the performance cost of the high
quality text layout strategy with

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:54.740
quality text layout strategy with
 

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.980
quality text layout strategy with
hyphenation for example if you like want

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:56.990
hyphenation for example if you like want
 

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:58.090
hyphenation for example if you like want
to actually change the text view

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:58.100
to actually change the text view
 

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.860
to actually change the text view
contents so what is that going to cost

00:36:59.860 --> 00:36:59.870
contents so what is that going to cost
 

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.190
contents so what is that going to cost
you at a later time well you you you

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200
you at a later time well you you you
 

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.930
you at a later time well you you you
know measuring text performance is

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:04.940
know measuring text performance is
 

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.400
know measuring text performance is
really complex I mean the the order of

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.410
really complex I mean the the order of
 

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:13.410
really complex I mean the the order of
magnitude is that it's about the same as

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:13.420
magnitude is that it's about the same as
 

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:18.340
magnitude is that it's about the same as
simple text in lollipop so you know it's

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:18.350
simple text in lollipop so you know it's
 

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.170
simple text in lollipop so you know it's
doing more work but we actually took a

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:20.180
doing more work but we actually took a
 

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:20.910
doing more work but we actually took a
wrench to it

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920
wrench to it
 

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.010
wrench to it
and did a lot of optimizations to make

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:23.020
and did a lot of optimizations to make
 

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.930
and did a lot of optimizations to make
it go faster there's going to be some

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:24.940
it go faster there's going to be some
 

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.460
it go faster there's going to be some
specific cases that are going to be a

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:26.470
specific cases that are going to be a
 

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.590
specific cases that are going to be a
little slower there's other cases like

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:28.600
little slower there's other cases like
 

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.570
little slower there's other cases like
if you're editing a very large buffer

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:30.580
if you're editing a very large buffer
 

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.130
if you're editing a very large buffer
that it's going to be a lot faster

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.140
that it's going to be a lot faster
 

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.310
that it's going to be a lot faster
because we really did a lot of them a

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320
because we really did a lot of them a
 

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.890
because we really did a lot of them a
performance improvement in that area so

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:37.900
performance improvement in that area so
 

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.600
performance improvement in that area so
ultimately if you're really concerned

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:39.610
ultimately if you're really concerned
 

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.370
ultimately if you're really concerned
about performance like if you've got if

almost happened in this talk and I

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440
almost happened in this talk and I
 

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.839
almost happened in this talk and I
wanted to keep it simple because I

00:39:08.839 --> 00:39:08.849
wanted to keep it simple because I

watch face so just so maybe I should

00:39:18.559 --> 00:39:18.569
watch face so just so maybe I should
 

00:39:18.569 --> 00:39:21.950
watch face so just so maybe I should
just explain that that there's layers in

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960
just explain that that there's layers in
 

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.009
just explain that that there's layers in
of the text stack where text view is the

00:39:25.009 --> 00:39:25.019
of the text stack where text view is the
 

00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:27.319
of the text stack where text view is the
one that most of you interact with but

00:39:27.319 --> 00:39:27.329
one that most of you interact with but
 

00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:30.499
one that most of you interact with but
underneath text view is static layout

00:39:30.499 --> 00:39:30.509
underneath text view is static layout
 

00:39:30.509 --> 00:39:32.359
underneath text view is static layout
and statically out does a lot of the

00:39:32.359 --> 00:39:32.369
and statically out does a lot of the
 

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.339
and statically out does a lot of the
things around line breaking and

00:39:34.339 --> 00:39:34.349
things around line breaking and
 

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:36.589
things around line breaking and
paragraph layout and then below that is

00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599
paragraph layout and then below that is
 

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:38.299
paragraph layout and then below that is
like draw text in the kind of very low

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:38.309
like draw text in the kind of very low
 

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.700
like draw text in the kind of very low
level api's and instead of a out we have

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:40.710
level api's and instead of a out we have
 

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.589
level api's and instead of a out we have
a new method that lets you kind of

00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599
a new method that lets you kind of
 

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.200
a new method that lets you kind of
address the shape by controlling indents

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:45.210
address the shape by controlling indents
 

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.870
address the shape by controlling indents
on the paragraph and so yes the watch

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880
on the paragraph and so yes the watch
 

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.999
on the paragraph and so yes the watch
face was absolutely a motivation for

00:39:49.999 --> 00:39:50.009
face was absolutely a motivation for
 

00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:52.430
face was absolutely a motivation for
that we are seeing other applications

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440
that we are seeing other applications
 

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.259
that we are seeing other applications
people are adopting it in cases where

00:39:54.259 --> 00:39:54.269
people are adopting it in cases where
 

00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:57.710
people are adopting it in cases where
people are you know doing custom views

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720
people are you know doing custom views
 

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.299
people are you know doing custom views
rather than just relying on text view

00:39:59.299 --> 00:39:59.309
rather than just relying on text view
 

00:39:59.309 --> 00:40:01.400
rather than just relying on text view
one of the really nice ones is when you

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:01.410
one of the really nice ones is when you
 

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.079
one of the really nice ones is when you
just get to flow around an image where

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:03.089
just get to flow around an image where
 

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:04.400
just get to flow around an image where
you're basically doing something like a

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:04.410
you're basically doing something like a
 

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:10.069
you're basically doing something like a
you know like a web style float and you

00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079
you know like a web style float and you
 

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:14.089
you know like a web style float and you
know it is possible to do your own
