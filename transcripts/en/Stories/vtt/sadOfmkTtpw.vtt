00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.500
Mike Basich was a snowboarding pioneer.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.099
But after hundreds of competitions that brought
money and fame, he went in search of something

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.099
different.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.560
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560
Welcome.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.160
Thank you.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:28.980
It's such a rush just to get up here.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.419
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.510
When did you first get into snowboarding?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.970
My mom was always looking for something different
and fun for us to try out, so that's how we

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.970
discovered it.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.129
And the sport had no rules.

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.100
And that's where-- that kept us in it, because
no one was telling us what to do.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Oh!

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
Ouch!

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.040
From 7 to about 14 years old, I had epilepsy.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.180
And so being different than everyone else,
you felt at home.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.590
That's something my parents drove into me
every day, saying it's OK to be different.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.040
I just tackle things that way.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.590
Well, welcome.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.480
Wow.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.510
This is the inside.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
It's beautiful.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.940
How long did it take for you to build this
place?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.880
It took me five years-- two and a half years
to do all the rock work.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.590
I think I moved about 175 ton of rock.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.590
Every piece of cement was hand mixed, and
gathered the water for it by hand, as well.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.620
God, it's such a labor of love.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.000
You get to do fun things.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.590
This is actually a shower here.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.030
And it's a seat in the daytime.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.920
But you get to use-- it's a bit camping style.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.070
No shower curtain, just out in the open.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.780
Pouring water, sitting down.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.540
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.010
I've got a little oven, which the door's from
the junkyard.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.799
And bought a nice little fireplace, which
is my cooking, heating water, warming the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.799
place.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.869
So that's the central attention for the utilities.

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.979
Yeah.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.979
This is it.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.540
Where are you getting your water?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.200
Yeah, this is creek water, which I have two
creeks on the property.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.290
Mike, where do you sleep?

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.780
I've got the loft as my bedroom-- very different
than anywhere else I've lived.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.480
I go to bed with the sun, and I wake up with
it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.819
I don't feel like I'm trying to race time.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.620
In a city, you always feel like you're on
a rat race.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.760
And here, it feels like you're in sync with
what's actually happening.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.910
So this was your dream.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.060
Since you were a little boy, you've been wanting
to do this.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:53.360
This is my dream and reality, 40 acres to
do whatever I want with.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.440
It's really fun.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.340
Tell me when you first started getting into
that competitive circuit.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.960
Competitive circuit was right off the start.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.190
The World Cup, traveled the world a bunch--
I'd be in a different country almost every

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.190
weekend.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.190
Worked my body hard.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.500
I was making about $170,000 a year.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.290
Played it pretty smart.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.050
I bought my first house, 4,000 square-foot
house-- huge-- because I went for the American

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.050
dream.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.130
I bought the big house and had a fancy car.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.800
It didn't do anything different for me.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.650
It just took up time.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220
We started getting sponsors that didn't have
anything to do with snowboarding.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.770
You started dealing with people that didn't
really care about your imagination.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.140
I let go of the competition 15 years ago,
at least.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.629
I do a lot through photography through snowboarding,
so that's been my outlet versus the competition.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.000
And that's how I end up in the back country.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:06.930
Where did the decision come from to build
this place off the grid?

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.989
Nature inspires me, and that's why I choose
this kind of environment.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.739
I want to learn how to live off the grid,
have appreciation for nature, and how to keep

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.340
the rain off my head, stay warm.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.340
Wow.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.629
This is breathtaking.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.849
This glass is definitely a heating tool for
me.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.289
It faces south, so it's a great space to have
that much glass.

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.669
Not a bad view.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.669
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:33.740
Not a bad way to wake up.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.960
This is the great outdoors.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.539
I got a chairlift over here that's super fun
to ride.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:39.539
You built that?

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.130
Yeah, it took me about eight months with some
friends.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.270
You get to ride all this terrain here, which
is super fun.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.389
This is your giant playground right here.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.370
Yeah, this is my own private resort.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.139
There's a water source on this pillar, water
falls into the hot tub.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.830
So you don't have a toilet in your house,
but you have a hot tub.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.180
Yep.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.219
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.529
How did you come up with the design for the
home?

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.639
The design's built on the golden ratio.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.349
Building under that law of nature is supposed
to make the space feel more fit to the body.

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.099
This one is a pentagon, which if you connect
all those dots, you get a star.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.529
And that's what the star you saw on the window
represents.

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.520
It casts a shadow on the floor, which is another
smaller pentagon.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.389
And they all meet at 3:02 on my birthday.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:43.960
That was how it all came down to a personal
building for me.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.449
I've ended up here off the road, off the beaten
trail, and loving it.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.580
I like to think of it as getting back to the
basics of humanity.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.330
I like feeling connected to the Earth more
than I could with a 4,000 square-foot house.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:07.479
So it gave me the strength of doing everything
myself, and the lessons, and a childhood dream

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.740
that I wanted to fulfill.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.080
And that's what this project of this house
was about, was to fulfill a childhood dream.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.419
In the next episode of "Going Off Grid," we
meet a family that left everything behind.

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.389
We carry water for the shower, just like we
carry everything, in a basin.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:32.069
And we heat up water on the propane torch,
mix that together with cold water until we

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.819
have the temperature right.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.960
And then that mix , we'll run through a hose
downhill to the shower.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.930
