see I don't think the way in which

00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:56.179
see I don't think the way in which
 

00:24:56.179 --> 00:24:59.490
see I don't think the way in which
knowledge is structured is hardwired I

00:24:59.490 --> 00:24:59.500
knowledge is structured is hardwired I
 

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.020
knowledge is structured is hardwired I
think the way in which knowledge is

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.030
think the way in which knowledge is
 

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.390

forms change so will the structure of

forms change so will the structure of
 

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.600

knowledge and so too often now the

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:13.610
knowledge and so too often now the
 

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.040

structure of the institution and the

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.050
structure of the institution and the
 

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.990

global education network one of the

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:26.420
global education network one of the
 

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.150
global education network one of the
questions I ask myself is what would it

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:28.160
questions I ask myself is what would it
 

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.010
questions I ask myself is what would it
be like to create an educational

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:30.020
be like to create an educational
 

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.340
be like to create an educational
institution this is going to be online

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:32.350
institution this is going to be online
 

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:37.210
institution this is going to be online
now at that time it would be this has

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:37.220
now at that time it would be this has
 

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.860
now at that time it would be this has
become much more familiar in the last 12

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:38.870
become much more familiar in the last 12
 

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.330
become much more familiar in the last 12
years but at that time it wasn't very

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:40.340
years but at that time it wasn't very
 

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.620
years but at that time it wasn't very
familiar I think that's one of the

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:41.630
familiar I think that's one of the
 

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.110
familiar I think that's one of the
reasons we failed but what would it be

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120
reasons we failed but what would it be
 

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.370
reasons we failed but what would it be
like to create an educational

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.380
like to create an educational
 

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.770
like to create an educational
institution structured like a network

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:47.780
institution structured like a network
 

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.860
institution structured like a network
rather than a series of silos how would

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:50.870
rather than a series of silos how would
 

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.410
rather than a series of silos how would
that look and I've continued to think

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:53.420
that look and I've continued to think
 

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.930
that look and I've continued to think
about that I think we would move and

00:25:58.930 --> 00:25:58.940
about that I think we would move and
 

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.140
about that I think we would move and
again these are terms that are used in

customization I'll come back to that in

a minute I think the structure would be

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000
a minute I think the structure would be
 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.780
a minute I think the structure would be
much more decentralized and distributed

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:13.790
much more decentralized and distributed
 

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.450

this model I think the order would be

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640
this model I think the order would be
 

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.790
this model I think the order would be
much less linear much more nonlinear in

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:21.800
much less linear much more nonlinear in
 

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.650

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.600
terms of how one progresses through it
and I think it would look much more like

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:25.610
and I think it would look much more like
 

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.390
and I think it would look much more like
a wall than a series of much more like a

this from 1982 2005 more than
 

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:50.960
this from 1982 2005 more than
four-fifths of the total increase in

get much much more from Republicans okay
so what do we make of this at the time

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:13.650
so what do we make of this at the time
 

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.210
so what do we make of this at the time
of nine point six percent unemployment

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:16.220
of nine point six percent unemployment
 

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.860

then invite outside members because we

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440
then invite outside members because we

don't have the expertise among our
faculty in a particular subject so it's

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:40.870
faculty in a particular subject so it's
 

01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:42.810

of that way to invite faculty with you

01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:06.580
of that way to invite faculty with you

you might have a core faculty there

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600
you might have a core faculty there
 

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.210

from that let's just take Columbia let's

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:49.540
from that let's just take Columbia let's
 

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.300
from that let's just take Columbia let's
say it's at Columbia there are four

graduate program and then ate that would

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:56.230
graduate program and then ate that would
 

01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:58.560

from other schools it would only be one

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:01.690
from other schools it would only be one
 

01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:04.220
from other schools it would only be one
PhD program you might still have

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:04.230
PhD program you might still have
 

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:08.850
PhD program you might still have
programs in all of the different schools

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:08.860
programs in all of the different schools
 

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.440

at the undergraduate level but with

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:10.450
at the undergraduate level but with
 

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:12.570
at the undergraduate level but with
fewer faculty at that point so so it

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:12.580
fewer faculty at that point so so it
 

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.430
fewer faculty at that point so so it
wouldn't just be that you would have the

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440
wouldn't just be that you would have the
 

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.950
wouldn't just be that you would have the
NYU and the Columbia PhD programs

01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960
NYU and the Columbia PhD programs
 

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.710
NYU and the Columbia PhD programs
cooperating but there would be fewer PhD

01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:19.720
cooperating but there would be fewer PhD
 

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.140
cooperating but there would be fewer PhD
programs it would be instead of eight we

01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:22.150
programs it would be instead of eight we
 

01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:24.030
programs it would be instead of eight we
would have one that would be shared and

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040
would have one that would be shared and
 

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.140
would have one that would be shared and
there would then be fewer PhDs turned

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:28.150
there would then be fewer PhDs turned
 

01:19:28.150 --> 01:19:31.350
there would then be fewer PhDs turned
out all right there would be and again

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360
out all right there would be and again
 

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.729
out all right there would be and again
I'd understand the problems with it

01:19:32.729 --> 01:19:32.739
I'd understand the problems with it
 

01:19:32.739 --> 01:19:34.440
I'd understand the problems with it
there would be fewer faculty required

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:34.450
there would be fewer faculty required
 

01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:36.750
there would be fewer faculty required
and so on and so forth with that but but

01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760
and so on and so forth with that but but
 

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.700
and so on and so forth with that but but
you again you're not looking you could

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:38.710
you again you're not looking you could
 

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:41.760
you again you're not looking you could
do this with China you have a kind of

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:41.770
do this with China you have a kind of
 

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:43.200
do this with China you have a kind of
joint burrow chat but I mean so would

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:43.210
joint burrow chat but I mean so would
 

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:46.890
joint burrow chat but I mean so would
that be one feasible to deserve one

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:46.900
that be one feasible to deserve one

I think that what you're proposing here
 

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.479
I think that what you're proposing here
is you know more imaginative than what

is you know more imaginative than what
 

01:19:57.489 --> 01:20:02.070
is you know more imaginative than what
is being done in some disciplines and

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080
is being done in some disciplines and
 

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.220
is being done in some disciplines and
fields that it is true that we really

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:05.230
fields that it is true that we really
 

01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:10.979
fields that it is true that we really
produce too many PhDs and there are no

01:20:10.979 --> 01:20:10.989
produce too many PhDs and there are no
 

01:20:10.989 --> 01:20:13.470

positions but if this has not you know

01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480
positions but if this has not you know
 

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.390

depends on the field like my field is an

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400
depends on the field like my field is an
 

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.340

expanding field a lot of liberal arts

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:17.350
expanding field a lot of liberal arts
 

01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:21.150

colleges in universities are increasing

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:21.160
colleges in universities are increasing
 

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.600
colleges in universities are increasing
you know at adding a you know field of

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:24.610
you know at adding a you know field of
 

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:26.580
you know at adding a you know field of
modern Chinese Studies and we we don't

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:26.590
modern Chinese Studies and we we don't
 

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.320
modern Chinese Studies and we we don't
have enough qualified people to fill

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:28.330
have enough qualified people to fill
 

01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:30.840
have enough qualified people to fill
those positions so it really differs and

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:30.850
those positions so it really differs and
 

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:33.990
those positions so it really differs and
my question is I think how do we then

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000
my question is I think how do we then
 

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.390
my question is I think how do we then
decide which disciplines and fields

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400
decide which disciplines and fields
 

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.380
decide which disciplines and fields
would then need the cluster or should we

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:43.390
would then need the cluster or should we
 

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:45.060
would then need the cluster or should we
you know should different universities

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:45.070
you know should different universities
 

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:48.090
you know should different universities
come together and rationally plan things

01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:48.100
come together and rationally plan things
 

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.580
come together and rationally plan things
out and say well we know the next we

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:50.590
out and say well we know the next we
 

01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:52.700
out and say well we know the next we
project in the next five or seven years

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:52.710
project in the next five or seven years
 

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:56.310

we need to focus on this zone of inquiry

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320
we need to focus on this zone of inquiry
 

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.410
we need to focus on this zone of inquiry
and therefore faculty from these

01:20:58.410 --> 01:20:58.420
and therefore faculty from these
 

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.080
and therefore faculty from these
different universities around the

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:01.090
different universities around the
 

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.390
different universities around the
country all around the world should then

01:21:03.390 --> 01:21:03.400
country all around the world should then
 

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.150

well this is another enormously

01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:17.980
well this is another enormously
 

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:23.460
well this is another enormously
complicated set of issues and we must

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:23.470
complicated set of issues and we must
 

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:27.030
complicated set of issues and we must
also recognize we must also recognize

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040
also recognize we must also recognize
 

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.140
also recognize we must also recognize
that the issue of tenure is related to

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:31.150
that the issue of tenure is related to
 

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:34.470

governance is also a big problem when

01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000
governance is also a big problem when

you're asking how do we decide or who

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:39.010
you're asking how do we decide or who
 

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:42.530
you're asking how do we decide or who
decides and some of these things I think

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:42.540
decides and some of these things I think
 

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:46.260
decides and some of these things I think
yes I mean again if you think if you

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:46.270
yes I mean again if you think if you
 

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:49.620
yes I mean again if you think if you
think but the problem with account

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:49.630
think but the problem with account
 

01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:51.210
think but the problem with account
system is autonomy that everything's

01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:51.220
system is autonomy that everything's
 

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.350
system is autonomy that everything's
seen as separate so we have these

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360
seen as separate so we have these
 

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.330
seen as separate so we have these
different department but yeah I think we

01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:54.340
different department but yeah I think we
 

01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.550
different department but yeah I think we
wouldn't it be radical if a group of

01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560
wouldn't it be radical if a group of
 

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.170
wouldn't it be radical if a group of
schools came together and said let's

01:21:58.170 --> 01:21:58.180
schools came together and said let's
 

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.530
schools came together and said let's
figure out how we can share resources

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540
figure out how we can share resources
 

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:04.440
figure out how we can share resources
the model that I just suggested was on

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:04.450
the model that I just suggested was on
 

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:08.040
the model that I just suggested was on
the table in the 1970s and it it wasn't

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.050
the table in the 1970s and it it wasn't
 

01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:10.890
the table in the 1970s and it it wasn't
until the early 1970s that state schools

01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:10.900
until the early 1970s that state schools
 

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.130
until the early 1970s that state schools
felt free to allow their institutions to
