00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.680
There are 206 bones in the human body, and
yes, it’s the same for men and women.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.040
No, women don’t have fewer ribs than men,
and men don’t have one extra bone, if you

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.450
know what I mean.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.629
You know what I mean.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.609
But several mammals, including our close relatives
like chimpanzees, do have that extra bone,

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.990
so today let’s talk about why other animals
have penis bones while humans got the shaft.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720
It wasn’t always this way.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.900
Researchers who traced its evolutionary timeline
found the penis bone, also known by its scientific

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.680
and less fun name the baculum, first evolved
around 145 million years ago after placental

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.960
and non-placental mammals split.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.580
This means that way back, our ancestors had
a baculum, and on the way to being human they

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.600
lost it.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.559
The researchers put that about 1.9 million
years ago.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.039
Ironically, in the time of Homo erectus.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.800
The reason why we lost our baculum may be
down to our mating strategy.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.030
Baculum length in primates is closely correlated
with intromission time, which is how long

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.739
the penis is inside the vagina.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.870
If a primate is going to spend a longer time
doing their monkey business, it helps to prop

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.289
up their banana.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.960
What constitutes a long intromission?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.410
According to the researchers, 3 minutes, and
humans don’t quite make the cut.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.010
Our average time from penetration to ejaculation
is less than two minutes, so it looks like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.160
we just don’t need the extra support.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.700
There are primates like bonobos who copulate
for 15 seconds at a time, and yet they still

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.040
have a baculum.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.460
This might be because they’re polygamous
primates, where many males mate with many

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.350
females, meaning competition is stiff so they
have to be too.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.380
In other polygamous species, having a bone
in their boner will help keep them copulating

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.440
longer, so other males don’t get a chance
with their lady.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.500
They are, quite literally, cock blocking.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.590
By comparison humans face less competition
for mates because of our monogamous mating

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.590
strategy.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.090
And that along with short intromission times
may be why our baculum was lost to history.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660
You may think we got stiffed, but I have some
news that’ll pick you up.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.780
Penis bones come in all shapes and sizes,
and while some of them are impressive and

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.740
slightly terrifying, like the 2 foot baculum
of the walrus, plenty of them aren’t.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.100
Chimps, for example, have a baculum about
the size of your fingernail.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.051
In fact even without the extra skeletal bone,
humans still have the biggest penises of the

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:09.051
great apes.

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.160
So, you know what, I don’t miss it.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
Great news!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.090

For more on that crazy walrus baculum watch
Carin talk about it on Wild Sex, here.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.010
Make sure you subscribe for more videos and
remember…

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.940
Gorillas, with all their chest-thumping, only
have a 2.5 inch penis.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.910
Showing yet again, that we are all compensating
for something.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.400
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
