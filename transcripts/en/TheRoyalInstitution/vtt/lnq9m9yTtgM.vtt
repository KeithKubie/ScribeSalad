00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.251
We can all sense how far away things are.

00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:04.880
There are lots of ways we perceive distance,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.789
but a classic method we learn at a young age

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:10.820
is that things that are further away look
smaller.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.599
In this activity you and your children will
explore

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.010
how size affects the way we perceive distance,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.940
and use that knowledge to try and trick your
own brains.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.100
Our brains use visual information

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.649
like the size of objects to tell how far away
things are.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.289
A fun way to start investigating this

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.510
is to compare the size of a toy car held close
to your eye,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.650
with a real car across the street.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.530
So they do look the same size, but are they?

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.420
No, this is teensy-weensy, and that one I
can't do this to!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.310
So just now, outside, we held up this small
car against a car across the road.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.920
How did the car across the road look, the
real car?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.440
Smaller than this car.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.740
But which one is bigger?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.280
That one!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.030
And why did that one look smaller...

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.330
You can explore the idea further with a simple
drawing activity.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.610
So, what we're going to: You're going to grab
a pencil,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.180
and I'm going to draw a house here, you're
going to draw a house over there.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.441
Working together, draw two houses on a piece
of paper.

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:43.970
I'm going to stick a rocket launcher on my
house, aiming at your house...

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.040
By introducing some visual cues to these drawings,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.220
you can start to experiment with your understanding

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.860
of how our brains process depth.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.920
That's a good house!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.950
Now we are going to draw a house from here
to here using a ruler

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.080
to separate the landscape from the sky.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.680
Do you know what we call that line?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.680
Horizon?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680
Yeah!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680
Next, add the horizon:

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.820
A horizontal line that cuts across the image
and separates the ground from the sky.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.880
Just point to anywhere along the line there.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.460
I'm going to put a little dot where you put
your finger.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.710
Now, that little dot is going to be the point
that's so far away we can't see it.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.480
Next add in the vanishing point.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.360
This can be anywhere on the horizon line,
between the two houses.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.670
Draw lines from the corners of your houses
going towards the vanishing point

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.050
to add in the side walls and give the drawing
a 3D look.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.100
Encourage the kids to think about how positioning
and size

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.480
make things look near or far away on the drawing,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.980
and how that�s similar to real life.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.330
Whose house looks bigger?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.069
Me, me me!

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.069
And why does your house look bigger?

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.500
Because it's closer to the end of the page
and because I drew it bigger.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.020
And what about mine?

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.100
Yours looks smaller because it's closer to
the other end.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.250
Whose house looks closer to the vanishing
point?

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:28.210
I have a little LEGO man here and I'm going
to put him right by the door of your house.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.370
How does he look, in terms of size?

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.120
He looks small.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.590
You can play around with your drawings by
adding in toy people at different points.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.560
What about if I put him next to my house here?

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.880
Your house looks tiny so he looks like a giant.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.090
The toy people will look small in some parts
of the drawing, and like giants in others,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.380
because their size does not change relative
to the drawing.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.580
And we can take advantage of this idea in
a simple illusion�

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.270
So now that we know that things that look
further away look smaller,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.160
we are going to use that to trick our brains.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.400
We're gonna cut these out and build weird
shaped room.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.890
This 'weird-shaped room�, also known as
an 'Ames room' is a false-perspective room.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.900
A type of illusion that takes advantage of
how our brains perceive depth.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
Download the templates from rigb.org/experimental,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.160
carefully construct the Ames room,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.250
and take a look through the peephole to see
it for yourself.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.040
So have a look through that hole. How does
it look?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040
Looks normal.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.100
When our viewpoint is restricted like this,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.650
all the angles and lines of the room line
up in just the right way

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.900
to appear as normal shaped room.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.770
But if you add in two objects of the same
size, such as two toy people...

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.960
Do they still look the same size?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.320
Oh my gosh! No!

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.639
Who looks bigger?

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.220
That one.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.940
But those are the men we just had, but one
of them looks...

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.940
smaller!

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.940
Why's that?

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:18.050
It's hard to explain, it looks like a straight
house but it's actually not.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.590
llusions like this boggle our brains.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.270
While you�re doing your drawings and looking
at the Ames room, ask lots of questions.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.430
For example, ask your kids if they can work
out how the illusino works to trick their

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.889
brains.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.740
Me and Sahara had a great time today building
this Ames room.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.680
You can have a go yourself, just download
the templates from the Ri website,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.669
and send us pictures of your Ames room, we'd
like to see them.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:54.520
