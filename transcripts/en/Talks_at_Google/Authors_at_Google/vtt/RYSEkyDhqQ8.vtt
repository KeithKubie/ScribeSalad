SCOTT WIENER: Thanks
for having me back.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.860
Last time I came in,
we did a discussion

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.450
about the various styles of
pizza that exist in New York,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.010
and what the differences
and similarities are,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.710
and that was a whole lot of fun.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.800
And I think the
whole talk ended up

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.110
being over an hour of just
straight discussion of--

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.270
Were any of you guys there?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.905
OK, so you remember what it was.

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:26.540
It was just talking pretty--

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.486
AUDIENCE: And eating.

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:28.450
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah, and eating.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.241
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:30.840
The table was covered in pizza.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.400
And in the past year,
I've had so many people

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.600
who've come on tours and
been like, yeah, I found out

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.500
about you because I watched
this hour and eight minute

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.820
long video of you
standing in front

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.690
of a wall talking about pizza.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.780
And it just blows my mind.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.800
I'm like, really?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.430
You watched that?

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.400
I figured that, you
know, these things go up,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.400
and it's just kind of
like, you know, it's there

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.280
just in case you need
it in the future.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.580
But no, it was just
really, really funny.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.180
So this book just came out
in November, and when it did,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.160
I was just kind of trying
to brainstorm about,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.785
you know, I want to
talk to some people

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:11.650
about what this book is about,
because every time I mention

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.190
what it's about, which is
just about pizza boxes,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.830
it begins this
flurry of questions.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.060
And so what I want to talk to
you guys about are pretty much,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.100
I want to answer
all these questions

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.780
before you have a
chance to ask them.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.120
And then once I go
through some stuff,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.230
if you have any other questions
about, of course, pizza--

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.660
I cannot ban you from
asking pizza questions--

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.250
but specifically, this project.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.970
I'd never written a book before,
and in doing all the work

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.540
that I do, there's so many book
projects that come to mind.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.700
But there are also a
lot of books about pizza

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.540
that are out there already.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.580
But the thing that I
really wanted to focus on

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.700
was, first and
foremost, I wanted

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.060
to get away from what everybody
else was talking about,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.900
which is subjective things
like what food tastes like.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.449
Or like cookbooks, which I
know, I cook some pizza at home

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:02.490
sometimes, but I'm not
going to write a cookbook.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.370
But I also happen to
collect pizza boxes.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.400
And that's just a huge
thing, like, literally

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.509
in the closet for me.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.545
And I wanted to bust
it out of the closet,

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:13.900
and that's what this is.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.010
So yeah.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.910
I run towards, for anybody
who did not come last time,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.770
or has never been on
a pizza tour with me,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.900
I run tours of pizzerias--
famous pizzerias.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.250
And I take people all around.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.900
And as Greg said, I get to go
to places like the International

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.100
Pizza Expo and judge
pizza competitions.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.720
I was just at a pizza convention
in Brazil, in Sao Paulo,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.570
to talk about pizza box design
and pizza box variations

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.870
in New York City.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.957
And that was pretty fun.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.540
I'm going to show
you some pizza boxes

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.910
that I picked up on that trip.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.570
They are bonkers.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.340
Seriously.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.450
I know it sounds crazy when I
say something like that a pizza

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.280
box could be bonkers, but I
guess the best way to even get

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.980
into talking about this is I
want you just do me a favor.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.680
Close your eyes,
if it helps, but I

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.554
want you just picture
a pizza box, OK?

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.095
From the top.

00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:10.950
Like the top down.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.042
And you can open your
eyes if you want, OK?

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:15.511
Wait, I don't know what this is.

00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:16.010
Anyway.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.580
Pizza box.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.020
This is probably what most of
you were thinking about, right?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.250
White with red
smudgey inky printing.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.150
Totally boring.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.160
Totally generic.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.750
It says something like the
word pizza, which is obvious,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.720
because anytime you
have a square box that's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.050
two inches deep, that's what's
in it, you know what I mean?

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.000
You see a movie
that has that box,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.480
it can have no printing on
it, and you know, pizza.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.830
There's no other food that
you see the container,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.840
and you think immediately
about the food itself.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.760
Like maybe an ice cream cone,
but that is part of the food.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.100
There's no steak box,
you know what I mean?

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.420
There's no spaghetti container.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.919
Chinese food, I
guess, is one thing,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.890
but even now, everybody's using
plastic containers instead

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.390
of that.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.250
But this has been
pretty much the same

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.220
for the past 65, 70 years.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.837
And of course you start off
by thinking about pizza boxes

00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:05.295
like this, especially
in New York--

00:04:05.295 --> 00:04:09.940
this white with red
smudgey inky printing.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:18.339
But I collect pizza boxes, and I
have over 720, 725 pizza boxes.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.811
And that slide that I went past.

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:21.310
Right.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.290
Spoiler alert.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.010
I have the world's largest
collection of pizza boxes

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.580
as certified by the Guinness
World Records Organization,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.690
and that is true.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.020
So just to let you know,
I want to use this time

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.490
to take you through
what that collection is,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.090
and what it means, and
why I collect pizza boxes.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.630
Because when you think
about pizza boxes like this,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.770
then it's like, a collection of
them, to most people, is like,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.680
this guy just doesn't
throw out his garbage.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.201
And I want to just make it
very clear that I do throw out

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:50.700
my garbage.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.560
I'm pretty good at that.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.830
But I also like to save
pizza boxes that are unique.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.510
Pretty much the reason why I
collect pizza boxes is in 2008,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.830
I saw a pizza box that did not
look like this red inky smudgey

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.207
printing on white cardboard.

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:09.790
It was yellow.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.030
It was in Israel, so right away,
there's Hebrew writing on it,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.570
and it's a yellow box, and
it's got blue writing on it.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.370
And that just blew
my mind right away.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.710
I don't know if that
would blow your mind.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.140
But now that I've
been collecting

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.810
a bunch of pizza boxes
I found, boxes from 45,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.155
50 different countries that
are totally, totally amazing.

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:34.530
This is the reason
that I collect

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.450
pizza boxes is that this
is a real pizza box.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.830
This is a photograph of the
actual cardboard box sitting

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.520
on a wooden table in my
apartment, and that's it.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.780
But it's a painting.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.480
This is mass produced.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.320
There are thousands of these
probably now in the garbage.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.550
But a pizzeria delivers
your pizza in this.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.927
And right off the bat,
different from the pizza boxes

00:05:58.927 --> 00:05:59.760
I showed you before.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.850
It doesn't say any words on it.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.850
It says one word
on the whole box.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.390
I know you probably
can't see it,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:13.240
but in the lower left hand
corner, it says, C-I-A-N-C-I-O.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.580
Ciancio, the artist's name,
signed on the image that was

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.530
used for the box.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.390
Ciancio, I later
found out, is probably

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.040
the most prolific pizza
box artist in the world.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.600
He's done 250 designs that
have landed on pizza boxes,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.290
and this is just
one that I thought

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.990
was kind of creepy,
but also just amazing

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.720
that you get a pizza
with this in it.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.090
And I feel like I would
hesitate more than normal

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.480
before I open up the box,
just looking at that.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.620
But anyway, of the boxes that
I have, over 700 of them,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.760
I have so many
that are like this

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.710
that now when people
send me pictures of them,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.751
and they're like, look at
this crazy box I found,

00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:57.690
I feel so terrible sometimes
when I'm like, I got it.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.320
I got that one.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.195
Don't worry about it.

00:06:59.195 --> 00:07:02.500
But then all the time, I get
pictures that people send me,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.150
and oh, it's amazing.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.977
And then I say, oh,
yes, can you send it?

00:07:06.977 --> 00:07:08.810
What's the cleanliness
factor on the inside?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.390
Because I try to
get clean boxes.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.900
And he goes, oh,
it's pretty bad.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.310
Pulled it out of the dumpster.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.325
And then I hate to do it,
but I say, let this one go.

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:19.230
Just let it go.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.620
But anyway, the whole pizza
box collection kind of

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.910
started back in 2009.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.690
So I run this company
called Scott's Pizza Tours,

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.470
and every year, we do a big
fundraising event called

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.900
Slice Out Hunger, which we
get a bunch of pizzerias--

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.050
like 45, 50 pizzerias
in a room in SoHo.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.130
They all bring 30 or 40 pizzas.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.920
We sell the pizza
for $1.00 a slice,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.730
and all the money we raise gets
matched by a bunch of sponsors

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.540
that we have.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.150
And all that money goes to the
food bank for New York City.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.567
So in 2009-- this is last year.

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.400
This is more recent.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.240
But in 2009, we raised
maybe $800, $900.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.170
Then the next year,
we raised over $1,000.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.070
And then the next year,
we raised over $10,000.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.160
And then last year
we raised $20,000.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.030
And this year coming
up in October--

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.860
not really coming
up soon, but October

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.890
is National Pizza Month,
so we do it in October.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.170
We're going to raise $50,000.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.230
So every dollar that
we send the food bank

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.494
provides five meals for
the homeless in New York.

00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.660
So we're going to feed a
quarter of a million people

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.660
just with three hours
of pizza eating.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.410
And I had no idea.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.250
Foolishly enough,
I did not think

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.770
that having pizza from
amazing places that

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.539
don't sell by the slice, like
Lombardi's, or like places that

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.280
do sell by the slice but
are expensive, like Di Fara

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.370
and incredibly far away, of
course-- I didn't think that

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.830
was enough of a draw.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.810
So when we started the event--

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.979
Here's what the event
looks like now, last year.

00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:49.395
It's really funny,
because there's

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.740
this one girl in the middle
of the frame just staring

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.051
at the camera.

00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:55.030
Creeps me out every time.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.575
Oh, and she's
holding that box we

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:58.326
were talking about
before-- the green box.

00:08:58.326 --> 00:08:59.283
We'll get back to that.

00:08:59.283 --> 00:09:01.210
But anyway, when it
started, I thought, like,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.750
oh, let's put together
some of my pizza boxes.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.405
I had 20 or 30 at the time.

00:09:05.405 --> 00:09:08.400
Let's put 15 or 20 pizza
boxes from around the world

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.560
on the wall and make
a little gallery show,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.410
and then that will be the draw.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.540
And the $1.00 slices
will be the afterthought.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.700
I don't know why I thought that.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.870
But people would
go, OK, now I've

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.620
spent some time
looking on the wall.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.024
I had a couple of
really cool boxes.

00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:26.690
A couple of ones that
weren't that cool,

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.620
but they were from
the Czech Republic,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.279
and they were from
Turkey, and so

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:31.570
I thought that was interesting.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.670
You know, see what pizza boxes
are like in other countries.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.350
Because you already anticipate
that language and food

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.340
and money and customs are
different in other countries,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.000
right?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.470
But the pizza box is something
that, for some reason,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.710
you don't expect any variation.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.600
But then, of
course, there it is.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.650
So I started collecting boxes.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.150
I have this pretty cool network
of people who are really

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.150
into pizza from all over the
world who take tours with me

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.440
or do whatever, and I
can send out an email,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.560
and I started getting
packages of pizza boxes.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.375
And the problem is
that after this event--

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:06.500
well, not really a problem.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.380
It's kind of a good thing.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.088
After this event, they
kept sending them.

00:10:09.088 --> 00:10:13.940
So I ended up with sort of a
growing collection of pizza

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.700
boxes, on a shelf, that's my
apartment in Clinton Hill.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.310
I had to leave it because there
were too many pizza boxes.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.740
But that top shelf--
every six months

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.680
I would flip it because
it would bow so much.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.990
And everybody who ever was at
my apartment would look at it,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.210
and then look downward at
where my computer lives.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.020
And they would say,
like, bad idea.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.852
Bad idea.

00:10:37.852 --> 00:10:39.560
Oh, and even that
other shelf was bowing.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.700
It was a terrible idea.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.060
But anyway, people
kept sending me boxes.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.490
And I had so many different
ways of collecting boxes.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.750
People would come on tours
and bring me pizza boxes

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.450
from their home cities
or their home countries.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.570
Sometimes with a full
pizza inside the box,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.570
which was kind of weird.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.270
But I remember this one.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.660
These folks called me one day
and said something about, oh,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.285
what time does the tour start?

00:11:02.285 --> 00:11:03.812
We're coming in from St. Louis.

00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:05.270
And as soon as I
said that, I said,

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.020
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.040
Can you bring me a
pizza box from Imo's?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.610
It's this pretty significant
pizzeria in St. Louis.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.840
In fact, there is sort
of a St. Louis style

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.110
pizza which has Provel
cheese, and it's

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.340
a thin, circular cracker crust,
and they cut into squares,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.330
and it goes exactly back
to this one pizzeria

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.870
in the early 1970s.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.860
So it was a box that
I felt like I needed

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.350
to have that box
in the collection,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.950
and of course, they brought.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.280
This one guy, not only did he
grab me this awesome pizza box,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.960
but he stole a plate
from the pizzeria,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.710
because he thought
it was really cool.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.200
It had this embossed
little pizza guy on it,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.380
and gave me this stolen plate
as well, which was kind of fun.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.050
I just get all these pizza
boxes from people who will--

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.842
I'll get an email or a text
from some number I don't know.

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.800
My phone number is on
the tickets for my tours,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.790
so I just get these random
texts-- meet me at this corner.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.900
I've got a box.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.070
I actually met someone
right over here

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.070
across the street by Chelsea
Market two or three years ago.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.160
He was from New Zealand.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.690
He brought me a couple boxes.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.050
And I was just like--
I kind of wanted

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.810
to have a friend with
me, just in case.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.350
It was just really weird.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.911
I've got this one guy from--
I think he's in Sweden.

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:19.410
No, Norway.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.090
It's Sweden.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.410
He works for a pizza
chain, and he sends me

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.040
a bunch of their new boxes
every 8 to 10 months in exchange

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.900
for maximum strength eye drops,
because he can't get them

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.819
in his country.

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:36.610
It's the weirdest thing
ever, and I'm like,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.940
I hope I'm not helping him
build some bomb or something.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.850
I don't even know.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.100
But it's just weird
things that happen.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.550
I get packages sometimes.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.577
People will email me.

00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.410
Hey, I'm in-- like,
this one was from Japan.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.942
Hey, I'm in Japan.

00:12:50.942 --> 00:12:52.150
I want to send you something.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.025
So I send my address.

00:12:53.025 --> 00:12:53.570
No big deal.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.320
But the package comes,
and it's like, even

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.710
the packaging is funny.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.207
Because sometimes people
flatten down the box.

00:12:59.207 --> 00:13:01.290
Sometimes they put cardboard
pieces on the outside

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.130
to protect it.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.430
Sometimes they just
take a full pizza box

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.390
and wrap it and then send
it, which is really funny.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.109
And they could get
crushed that way.

00:13:09.109 --> 00:13:09.650
I don't know.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.274
It's dangerous.

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:13.732
I should make a tutorial for
how to mail me a pizza box.

00:13:13.732 --> 00:13:14.690
Maybe I should do that.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.460
Maybe a video later today.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.320
And it's funny, because
once you open up

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.880
a box like this
from Japan, boom--

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.850
there's a yellow box with
this weird teddy bear

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.260
character, which
I later found out

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.200
is a very popular
character in Japan.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.240
It's like, the teddy bear
is just always chilling out.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.285
It's always just laying down.

00:13:35.285 --> 00:13:36.285
I don't really know why.

00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:37.720
I don't know anymore behind it.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.830
But the problem is, you've got
a box like this from Japan,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.080
and then I'm always sort
of cringing a little bit

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.440
as I open it up, because
boom, it's been used.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.310
Uh-oh.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.530
Danger, right?

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.160
And not only has it
been used, but it's

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.243
been cut really bizarrely.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.930
Whoever boxed this
up, clearly, you

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.064
know that it's a one
piece clamshell box.

00:13:58.064 --> 00:13:59.730
They were standing
right at the opening.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.260
They sliced it straight
down the center first.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.390
But then after that,
they start in the center

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.470
and drag out for
all their slices

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.716
instead of doing cross
slicing, which, in New York,

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:11.090
you see most of the pizzas
are cross sliced, because it's

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.590
faster.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.880
But this one, the person
went right from the center,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.770
but missed the center
target every time.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.450
I just love that
even seeing that, you

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.830
can tell something more by it.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.530
And in Japan, I find that
their receipts are all

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.670
written into the lid of the box.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.690
Multiple boxes that
I have have that.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.640
It's really amazing.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.880
But one of the questions
that comes up all the time

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.020
is do you also have a huge
collection of cockroaches?

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.360
And I say no, and
that's because I

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.487
have a method of
protecting these boxes.

00:14:39.487 --> 00:14:41.320
So when I get a box,
the first thing I'll do

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.730
is take a razor
blade-- and I had

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.890
to have somebody take
pictures of me doing this

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.010
so I could explain to
people that I'm not

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.240
a disgusting human.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.812
But you scrape out all
the cheese, of course.

00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:56.020
This one was sliced a little
bit better, you can see.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.380
But after all the
cheese is removed,

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.050
a thin coat of polyurethane
over the soiled spots.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.500
That will seal them in.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.224
No big deal.

00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:06.015
It won't be sticky.

00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:06.930
It'll be fine.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.160
Dries overnight.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:08.820
It's all good.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.790
Only about 3% of the boxes
that I have have been used,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.460
and so it's really
not that many.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.887
And I don't have a whole
bunch of mice hanging

00:15:17.887 --> 00:15:19.220
around the pizza box collection.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.360
But one of the places that
I get some of my boxes

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.164
is at pizza trade
shows, which I go

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:27.580
to because I write for a trade
magazine called Pizza Today

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.170
Magazine.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.360
It's a magazine for
the pizza industry.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.960
Pizzerias get it in the mail.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.190
I might have a copy of it here.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.550
I think 40,000 pizzerias-- yes!

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.690
But it's embarrassing, because
the cover shot is a slider.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.180
So I'm sorry about that.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.680
Trust me.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.270
Other months,
there's a huge pizza.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.930
There's a centerfold of pizza
and everything like that.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.310
But anyway, so I write a
column for this magazine,

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.370
and so that means that I get
to go to these events and judge

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.034
competitions.

00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:54.950
And it's a lot of fun.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.800
But secretly-- not
secretly, it's public--

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.190
but I, over the past few
years, have been going right

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.950
to the pizza box
companies, because they

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.400
have these huge displays.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.560
They want you to see what
they can do on pizza boxes.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.667
And in New York, nobody
spends money on pizza boxes.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:12.250
They're all doing
really cheap things.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.810
But here, you get
this huge spread,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.470
and you find these insane--
like this company in California

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.830
has the largest pizza
box on the planet.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.760
The largest deliverable pizza.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.130
I guess this photo was
taken a few years ago,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.540
but I got this box last year.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.930
I had to go out to LA.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.860
I was visiting my brother,
and we got the pizza.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.480
We had 20 people try to eat it.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.750
We didn't even get
through half of it.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.200
And then I had to cut
the box a little bit

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.207
and mail it to myself.

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:42.040
And then, of course,
this year at the event,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.570
I showed them the book,
and how in the book,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.520
there's this shot right in the
beginning in the section where

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.310
I explain why I
collect pizza boxes,

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.860
and it's me standing in front
of that giant pizza box.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.985
And they were like, oh, we
would have sent you one.

00:16:55.985 --> 00:16:58.875
I'm like-- it was a $200 pizza.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.710
But anyway, at events like
this, it's really fun.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.490
Once the event is done
on the Thursday at 2:30,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.990
everybody starts to leave.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.490
And they're not going to
box up their pizza boxes.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.520
They're not going
to take them home

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.540
and say, oh, these
are our samples.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.099
We need them.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:18.598
No.

00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:20.250
They leave them as garbage.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.310
And so that's when
I swoop in, and I

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.329
cherry pick which ones I
want, which ones I like,

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:27.290
and then it's so funny.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.100
As everybody's breaking
down the event,

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.760
I'm sitting there
piling up boxes.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.940
And then there's a
FedEx in the building

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.759
in Vegas at the Expo Center.

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:37.300
I just go there,
ship them to myself,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.984
and then a week later,
it is like Christmas Day.

00:17:40.984 --> 00:17:42.900
Because I don't remember
what I even boxed up.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.000
So it's incredible.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.870
But a lot of these
companies-- it's funny.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.120
After a few years,
now they know.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.600
They're like, oh, yeah,
you can take whatever.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.000
Sure.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.340
Oh, we've got a new one for you.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.923
We'll hide it behind
these other ones.

00:17:52.923 --> 00:17:53.710
It's so funny.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.049
But I have some other ways.

00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:59.590
Talking about getting into the
pizza industry side of things,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.690
I started visiting pizza box
manufacturing facilities,

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.180
and that's why I put this
picture into the slide show--

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.560
because that is what a
pizza box manufacturing

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.630
facility looks like.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.650
This is how exciting things get.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.870
We're talking like
it's really exciting.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.070
But it's really funny, because
when you get into these things,

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.770
oh, man.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.350
As I was writing the book,
suddenly it was not just like,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.430
oh, I'm a collector and I
want some of the pizza boxes.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.672
It's suddenly like, oh, I'm
writing a book about it.

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:28.130
And it's funny, because I always
think about the convention

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.150
as-- do any of you
guys collect anything?

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:31.766
You must.

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:34.114
What do you collect?

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:35.610
SCOTT WIENER: Oh, really?

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.210
Whoa.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.060
I hope it's not human
spines or something.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.760
But, you know, some
people collect, let's say,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.134
action figures, right?

00:18:43.134 --> 00:18:44.800
Like sci-fi action
figures or something.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.500
They have conventions for that.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.070
And you can go and
buy them and trade,

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.810
and there's a whole
marketplace for it.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.310
And eBay.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.080
You can do whatever.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.220
But pizza boxes, there is none.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.500
I may be the only
collector of them.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.077
And so therefore, when
I email a place and say,

00:19:00.077 --> 00:19:02.160
I want to check out these--
I collect pizza boxes,

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.150
and I'm going to do this
book, they just let you in.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.940
Maybe 10 years,
20 years from now,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.990
there will be pizza
box collectors,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.660
and it will be a
hard thing to get in.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.490
So I'm just, like,
excited about these days

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.040
where I can walk into
a pizza box facility

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.070
and just walk around and be
like, oh, I want one of those,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.361
I want one of those, and then
they just hand them over.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.600
I got to hang out with
Manny at the place

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.675
called Rock 10, the
country's largest producer

00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:31.300
of pizza boxes.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.740
65% of the pizza boxes in this
country are made here by Manny.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.650
But Manny was hanging out, and
he took me on this whole tour.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.390
And the best thing
that happened was he

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.932
showed me their display
hallway, which was amazing,

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.390
because I was like,
wow, beautiful.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.220
But then he showed
me the back room.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.900
The storage room, where
they put all their samples,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.570
which was unbelievable.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.843
Because he was like, oh,
we have this one from 1996.

00:19:55.843 --> 00:19:58.655
This one's from '89.

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:00.030
We haven't printed
it since then.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh, do you want any of these?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.850
And I was just like, oh!

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.420
I drove up, I
emptied my whole car.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.140
I drove back with just a back
seat full of pizza boxes.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.430
And so I didn't even
have to lock my car,

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.139
because nobody was
going to touch my car,

00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:15.013
you know what I mean?

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.060
It was just amazing.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.895
He showed me all
these amazing boxes.

00:20:17.895 --> 00:20:21.550
And then the problem was that I
had a houseful of pizza boxes.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.489
And I don't keep them like this.

00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:25.530
I took this picture the
day we were photographing

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.488
the boxes for the book.

00:20:26.488 --> 00:20:28.810
But just to give you
an idea of the scope,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.670
that is maybe about 100 boxes.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.700
And at the time this picture was
taken, I had about 600 boxes.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.620
So when they're compressed, they
don't take up much room at all.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.230
It's just that
this was, you know,

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.396
to take some pictures of it.

00:20:42.396 --> 00:20:43.860
But to be able to
store them, I had

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.030
to change my
mentality for storage.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.052
Instead of having just
a little weak shelf that

00:20:50.052 --> 00:20:52.260
was going to bow, I had to
shift it all a little bit.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.150
So this is most
of the collection

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.460
as of maybe about a year ago.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.170
And I'm pointing to the top
portion of a coat closet

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.560
where all the boxes live.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.720
And I know it looks like
it's not going to work,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.230
but you see three
stacks of-- sorry.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.845
I was about to point at it,
but using the same hand that's

00:21:12.845 --> 00:21:14.470
in that picture, and
it's really weird.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.240
So I'm gonna go over
here and do this.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.494
It's even weirder.

00:21:19.494 --> 00:21:20.327
Greg, can you point?

00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:21.720
No.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.220
But anyway, these
are stacks, right?

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.680
And each one of those
stacks is one little bundle

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.770
of these boxes.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.210
And this is two
bundles right here.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.410
So there's a whole ton of boxes.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.450
And I'm just looking
at it right now.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.040
There are already bundles
in that little portion

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.170
of the closet right there.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.990
But trust me, they
all flatten down,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.660
and I kind of wedge some of
them up like a reverse Tetris

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.935
situation, and
they all fit right

00:21:46.935 --> 00:21:48.437
in the top of that closet.

00:21:48.437 --> 00:21:50.270
Except there are 50 of
them that are kind of

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.183
in the side of the closet on
the bottom, but most of them

00:21:52.183 --> 00:21:52.710
are up top.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.320
It's just that everybody always
asks, where do you store them,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.350
after they ask
the bugs question.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.290
So that's where they're stored.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.820
Now I have 150 more
than I had at this time,

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.960
so now they are spilling
out into the living room.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.450
But that's my thing.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.120
I'll deal with that.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.750
I'm looking for a
storage unit, maybe.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.680
We'll see.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.130
But the time came for when
we started putting together

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.240
this book, which is
published by a company called

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.180
Melville House
that's in Brooklyn.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.840
And they just publish these
really weird and interesting

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.340
books.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:27.042
And the president of the
company, in a meeting one day,

00:22:27.042 --> 00:22:29.000
said, I read some article
that was interesting.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.427
It was about pizza.

00:22:30.427 --> 00:22:32.010
Maybe we should do
a book about pizza.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.830
And then somebody in the
group-- this is a weird story.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:39.560
Somebody in the group,
I had met years ago

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.150
when I showed up
to an open house

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.220
that I found on Craigslist for
an apartment in Park Slope,

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.570
and met this girl who
worked for this company.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.730
I didn't get the apartment,
but years later, she's

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.710
like, dating a
friend's roommate,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.670
and suddenly she makes this
connection at this meeting.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.254
Oh, I know this guy who's into
pizza and does pizza stuff.

00:22:58.254 --> 00:22:59.420
Maybe we should talk to him.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.080
And then the president
of the company says,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.913
yeah, you know what?

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:05.010
It would be cool to do something
about pizza box artwork,

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:11.170
because I used to have a couple
of boxes from-- they used

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.560
to be in Hoboken--
I used to have

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.060
some old boxes on the wall, and
that was really interesting.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.940
Maybe he knows
something about that.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.450
Then she calls me
up, and I'm like,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.533
you don't even understand.

00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:23.575
Because I was already
thinking about how

00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:25.990
it would be great to do a
book, but I'm a little lazy,

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.955
so I never wrote
a proposal for it.

00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:30.330
And then these guys call me
up, and they're like, come in

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.350
and we'll talk about it.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.350
And I explained exactly what I
was into, what I wanted to do.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.230
I said, you know, I
love the art of it.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.120
But I also really want
to have some history.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.420
And I told them I definitely
want a page or a spread that

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.570
was a glossary with diagrams
of different styles of boxes

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.740
from around the world.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.850
And they were like,
yeah, we can fit that in.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.260
And it was just an
amazing situation.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.940
And so the folks from
the company-- they said,

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.920
OK, we've got to
photograph the boxes.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.420
So they sent over
their art director

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.320
who just came to my
apartment, because I

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.153
said I didn't want the
boxes going anywhere,

00:24:03.153 --> 00:24:04.790
because they are special.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.790
And he came in.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.600
We photographed a ton of boxes.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.140
This is really amusing.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:17.070
So Wa Ming is holding up the
lid of a reusable pizza box

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.540
to bounce light onto this
pizza box for the photo.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.010
And it's just-- and we used
that photo for the book,

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:24.920
and I'm so happy about it.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.590
It's like, I would love
to have a little comment

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.390
section in the book that's
like, we used one pizza

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.694
box to bounce light for this.

00:24:31.694 --> 00:24:33.360
If you've gotten this
far into the book,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.620
you will be amused by that.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.000
You know what I mean?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.860
But it was just really amazing.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.305
But then we ended up with
all these photos of boxes,

00:24:40.305 --> 00:24:42.770
and I had to figure out a
way to put them all together.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.720
So instead of doing
something chronological

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.060
about pizza development,
which we sort of do,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.440
but we kind of split the buck
up into different sections

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.000
about American classic
designs, portraiture, scenery,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.810
that kind of thing.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.220
So the classic
American would be one

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.640
or two color print
on a white box.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.890
The OK chef, Uncle Luigi, I
call him, doing his thing.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.170
That's total typical
American box.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.770
This is a place in
Brooklyn, Sam's Restaurant,

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.250
which has two or three
typical elements.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.640
It's got that
weird steamy pizza,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.080
it's got the OK chef,
Uncle Luigi, over there.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.930
But actually, wait a second.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.895
It's just the reverse,
but beyond that, they're

00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:25.770
pretty much the same.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.315
It's just that I stare at this
exact image, and he changes.

00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:30.440
There's two different ones.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.920
There's one with no
sideburns, and then there's

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.010
one with sideburns.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.189
But beyond that, everything's
pretty much the same.

00:25:37.189 --> 00:25:38.480
So I just wanted to check that.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.630
He's backwards.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.584
It's OK.

00:25:39.584 --> 00:25:40.540
AUDIENCE: That's got
the framing of the--

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.900
SCOTT WIENER: That's the
second element that I love,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.950
which my buddy, Mark Bellow,
who runs a pizza making school

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.120
on the Lower East Side
called Pizza a Casa.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.217
He asked me about this print,
because he was like, yeah,

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.800
I was thinking about
getting a tattoo,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.280
like a barbed wire thing.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.470
And I was like, you always,
if you have a tattoo or not,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.225
everyone has an
idea of what they

00:26:02.225 --> 00:26:04.100
would get if they were
going to get a tattoo.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.320
That would be it for me.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.225
Like, that would absolutely
without question be it,

00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:09.750
and it's amazing.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.660
Because it's this pattern
from the Northeastern US.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.030
I tracked down the guy
who created that pattern.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.280
And you only see it in
the Northeastern US.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.320
So that's why you
can kind of track

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.600
where a box from by the
imagery that's on it.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.360
And so unfortunately, it
didn't make it into the book,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.030
but there is a page in
the book of the history

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.860
of this guy-- this chef.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:37.390
But my dream is to track down
the guy himself, or his family,

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.877
and see pictures-- like,
family pictures of that guy.

00:26:40.877 --> 00:26:41.960
And maybe he's doing that.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.709
Maybe he's not.

00:26:42.709 --> 00:26:43.250
I don't know.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.530
But it's based on a guy.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:45.860
That's somebody's uncle.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.487
So I'm working on that.

00:26:47.487 --> 00:26:48.570
We'll see if that happens.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.010
But anyway, there's a
motif that I really love,

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.960
which is totally basic.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.640
It's the proud chef motif.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.720
He's standing in front of
an oven, a wood fired oven,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.850
he's holding the pizza,
and it may or may not

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.450
say some words
that may or may not

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.350
useful to you as a
pizza consumer at all.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.445
Pizza, oven fresh.

00:27:04.445 --> 00:27:07.430
OK, whatever.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.780
But that's the way
it looks in the US.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.570
And it's this kind of
funny terrible line

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.200
drawing that's missing shading.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.040
And I never thought about this
until a designer friend of mine

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.330
came to one of these
book events in Boston,

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.290
and he sat down with me and he
started coloring in the box.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.420
And he's like, this is
what they meant to do.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.604
But they didn't.

00:27:25.604 --> 00:27:28.020
And then he colored it in, and
I was like, oh my goodness.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.686
I never even thought
about it like that.

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:31.120
But that's our American version.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.070
Totally simple.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.570
Two color.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.240
That's it.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.770
But then the version
from Italy is full color,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.370
and he's not holding the pizza.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.490
He's so proud.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.020
He's got his arms crossed.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.135
He's so psyched.

00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:47.980
He's got his tomatoes just down
there, hanging out, whatever.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.000
Not a lot of cheese on that pie.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.010
A weird double crust
situation going on.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.160
But again, doesn't matter.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.280
And then this wood
fired oven with a fire

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.180
that is not like
any fire you've ever

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.830
seen in an actual
wood fired oven.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.000
But whatever.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.410
That's the Italian
version of it.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.340
But then you get to-- this
is from the Czech Republic.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.240
And it's got a similar
thing going on,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.619
but it's got a pudgier chef.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:11.410
There's still the wood
fired oven, the arch

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.740
in the background,
the word pizza.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.270
There's basil all around,
just like in the last one.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.640
I love when you can
trace the same motif.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.790
And they're not necessarily
copying each other,

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.060
it's just like, what would
you do on a pizza box?

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.830
Show the pride, and
the ingredients,

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.160
and have that be that.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.990
And here's one from Israel,
which is standing right

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.920
in front of the
oven, holding a pizza

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.590
that if you look close
enough, each slice

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.360
has a different topping
combination on it,

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.400
which is ingenious.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.860
And a friend of mine in
St. Petersburg, Florida,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.400
invented this thing that you put
onto a pizza before you top it,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.645
and it has separate little
separations, and this way,

00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:52.420
you can top it.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.930
And you bake it with that on
it, so it keeps the ingredients

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.580
from going on other slices.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.520
It's crazy.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.440
I don't think he's going
to use it for real,

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.420
but it was in his trunk,
and it was amazing.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.650
But anyway, this guy had
it, I guess, in Israel.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.184
But all the words
on the screen, it

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:10.850
says the same things
that our boxes say.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.410
Like, hot and fresh,
and delicious pizza.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.570
It's nothing new.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:17.110
I love this other motif.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.280
This is a more interesting
one, I think, of the

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.955
behind the scenes
chefs in the kitchen.

00:29:22.955 --> 00:29:25.704
There's this is guy on the
left who's kind of by the oven.

00:29:25.704 --> 00:29:27.120
There's the guy
in the front who's

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.245
cutting the finished pizza.

00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:32.810
There's the brick all around
on the outside and the awning,

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.790
and then the bubbles on the
top and bottom with text.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.930
So memorize that right now.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.390
Bubbles with text,
awning, the word pizza.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.220
OK?

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.600
Now check this one out.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.690
Different company, different
artist, everything.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.220
Awning.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.214
Says the word pizza.

00:29:50.214 --> 00:29:52.130
But now on the bottom,
there's different text.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.140
And in fact, this text,
I think, is even better.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.150
It says, enjoy your
delicious moments.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.770
It's not just about pizza.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.990
It's like a life thing.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:04.990
It's like a fortune cookie.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.250
Enjoy your delicious moments.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:06.970
I just love that.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.760
But also, if you look
at the artwork on this,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.670
this is very clearly
multiple clip art sources

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.890
that don't match perspective.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:26.080
The two people in the image are
clearly not of the same planet.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.070
I mean, this guy by the oven
has this whole different face.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.230
The guy in the front-- just
everything's different.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.110
But if you go back
to this other one,

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:39.530
you can see, guy by the
oven, guy in the front.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.630
It's just the same exact
idea, but it's like--

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.200
and one of these did come out
10 years after the other one.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.342
And maybe somebody
copied it off the other,

00:30:48.342 --> 00:30:49.550
but it doesn't really matter.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.770
Nobody's like, I want to
protect the fact that I have

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.740
an image of somebody
making pizza on my box.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.380
Nobody cares.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.810
But it's just really
funny that even the awning

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:02.290
and all these things
are so the same.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.090
Oh, and by the way,
I should point out

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.380
that this box
company has locations

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.410
all around the country.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.450
And you can see this box in
the Southwest, the Northeast,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.280
and in the Southeast.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.620
This company-- if you
look really closely,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.180
you can see there's a name on--
you can't see it in this image,

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.030
but on the olive oil,
there's a brand name.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.210
On the can of tomatoes,
there's a brand name.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.040
All these have brand names.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.070
And this says quality right
on a badge on his shirt.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:39.060
Those are all house brands
of Restaurant Depot/Jetro,

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.600
the supply warehouse for
restaurants, where restaurants

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.460
go and pick up produce
and pick up vegetables

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.290
and all that kind of
stuff, and dry goods.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.870
This is a box that's printed
just for Restaurant Depot.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.596
It does not say that
on the box, but you

00:31:50.596 --> 00:31:52.720
could tell because of the
brands that are on there.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.840
And this box in particular
is only available west

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.100
of the Rockies, because
of where it's printed.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.030
And so you know when
you see this box,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.300
you can tell the location.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.180
So it's always funny to me.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.471
I brought this up once about
how, you know, in a movie,

00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:05.940
if you see this
pizza box, you can

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.952
tell where they're
shooting the movie.

00:32:07.952 --> 00:32:11.090
And it can be a generic
box, but you can still tell.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.790
And then a friend
of mine mentioned

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.040
donut boxes in California
are pink donut boxes,

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.160
and in New York, they're
white donut boxes.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.880
And so you can tell
where a movie's

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.680
being shot by the color
of the donut boxes,

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.635
if your movie is about donuts.

00:32:24.635 --> 00:32:27.000
But if this movie's about
pizza, then we know what's up.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.960
But check this out.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.920
This is packaging for, I
think, soccer uniforms,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.950
and it's the exact-- here we go.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:37.056
Camera one, camera two.

00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:39.940
Camera one, camera two.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.050
I love it so much.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.330
It's the same image, and
apparently, this image

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.491
is enough to force
this person to want

00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:47.490
to put it on-- you know.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.570
And even if you look
at-- see the sausages?

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.566
Keep your eye on the
garlic and the sausages.

00:32:51.566 --> 00:32:52.440
Those hanging things.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:52.705
Boom.

00:32:52.705 --> 00:32:53.390
Soccer balls.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.160
Love it.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.710
Of course that's where you
hang your soccer balls.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.980
In your kitchen, where
you bake your shirts.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.570
I don't even know.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.550
But anyway, you've
probably seen this box.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.500
This is the box that you
see the most in New York,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.570
mostly on the streets,
like in the garbage

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.260
or meant to go to the garbage.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.450
It's usually red.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.010
She's holding up
one that's blue.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.670
Which actually is
kind of interesting.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:23.010
The red ones-- Italian
pizzerias get the red ones,

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.622
but Greek pizzerias asked them
to change the red to blue,

00:33:26.622 --> 00:33:28.830
because they're Greek, and
they want blue on the box.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.401
And so then they sell
these in different colors.

00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:32.150
It's really funny.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.180
In the collection, I have
one of every color variation.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.690
So it looks like an Andy Warhol
Campbell's Soup can type thing,

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.370
but way better.

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:43.230
But in the book, part
of what I wanted to do

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.700
was I'm so interested
in these images.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.470
Like, there are so
many images of a table,

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.670
a cafe with a full pizza,
two glasses of wine,

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.210
but two empty seats.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.575
What's going on?

00:33:58.575 --> 00:33:59.450
You know what I mean?

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.241
And this is like, I
have so many boxes that

00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:02.519
have that same motif.

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:04.560
There's a bike laying over
here, there's no bike,

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.969
some of the bushes are
the same from box to box,

00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:08.760
but they're different
companies altogether.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.810
This one is amazing, and
I'm interested in this art

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.780
and how did it get that way?

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.350
So I went to the source.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.710
This is the artist, Holly.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.580
Holly Del Rey
designed this piece,

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.190
and so it's really funny.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.530
Nobody had ever asked
her anything about this.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.530
But I've seen this
box billions of times.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.840
Like, when you think about an
artist-- you're an artist, OK?

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.300
And maybe you sell prints.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.139
Maybe you sell a couple
of hundred prints.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.960
There are 20,000 of these
boxes being printed every day,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.860
you know?

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.650
That's a hugely impressive
number for a piece of art.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.850
And so I just asked
her, how many meetings

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:46.530
did it take before this
image was the right one?

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.590
And what were the
problems with the image?

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.423
Oh, they wanted the
bushes a different size.

00:34:50.423 --> 00:34:52.787
Oh, they wanted it to
be a more relaxed feel.

00:34:52.787 --> 00:34:54.370
And then the question
always comes up.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.880
I always ask, well, were there
ever people in the image?

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.486
And it's like, no.

00:34:58.486 --> 00:34:59.790
There actually weren't.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.840
The thing is, they want
to have an image that's

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.010
easy to duplicate, and
so the registration--

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:08.570
if it's two colors or more-- the
registration, if it's ever off,

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.190
it's not going to really
distract from the image itself.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.900
However, I should have given
you guys a picture of this.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.530
I have versions of this box
where the registration is

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:21.090
so off that the wine is
not in the glass at all.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.370
And I don't count those as
boxes in my overall collection.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.290
So, like, the Guinness
people would get mad

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.540
if they were like, well,
that's the same thing.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.570
It's just printed wrong.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.440
But in my private version
of the collection,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.940
I love the screwups.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:34.870
They're the best.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.370
And there are some
pizzerias-- a lot

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:40.610
of the pizzerias in Brooklyn
buy misprinted pizza boxes

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.560
from the pizza box companies.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:46.080
So you might go into, let's
say, La Villa in Park Slope,

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.240
and you might get a box
from Antonio's, you know?

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.650
But it's just printed wrong.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.732
Or maybe they printed too
many, and Antonio's was

00:35:52.732 --> 00:35:53.690
like, we're not buying.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:54.880
I only said 5,000.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.120
You gave me 10,000.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.740
They might just buy
them straight out.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.090
And they don't fold them inside
out to hide the other logo.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:00.756
They don't care.

00:36:00.756 --> 00:36:02.070
You already bought their pizza.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.420
What do they care?

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.314
You're going to go
there again, because you

00:36:05.314 --> 00:36:06.980
live in the neighborhood,
because that's

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:08.188
the way New York pizza works.

00:36:08.188 --> 00:36:10.780
But it's just amazing
to me, things like that.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.044
Now, this is Pat Trilli,
who is 94 years old

00:36:14.044 --> 00:36:16.460
and he called me last week,
and I haven't called him back,

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.876
and I really should
call him back.

00:36:17.876 --> 00:36:19.740
Maybe we'll all
call him together.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.750
Who basically-- he did
not create the phrase,

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.310
"You've tried the rest,
now try the best,"

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.500
but he is of the
generation that did.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.310
He started selling custom
printed pizza boxes in 1955

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.200
in Brooklyn.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.040
Now he's retired
and lives in Jersey,

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.830
but he has this garage where
he has a bunch of old pizza

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.510
boxes-- just a
few-- and diagrams,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.825
and letters from
Domino's explaining

00:36:44.825 --> 00:36:46.200
to people about
how they're going

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.170
to go through a big expansion,
which was when Domino's became

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.090
a national name.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.640
I have the letter-- well,
he has a letter of saying,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.670
"Be ready to produce 3
billion pizza boxes,"

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.890
or whatever the number is.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.440
Get ready to produce
a lot of pizza boxes,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.314
because we need them.

00:36:58.314 --> 00:37:04.460
And Pat Trilli was
the inspiration

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.192
for the image of this
pizza guy on the box.

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:08.900
And I'm sure you've
seen this box before.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.020
This is kind of a big
box in the New York area.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.330
But a friend of his
from the fourth grade

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.570
is the artist that did this.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.590
And he originally
said, oh, I'm going

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.756
to make it look like you do.

00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:19.430
And at that time,
he looked like that.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.100
I don't think he was
running so much at the time.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.740
But it's just amazing, the
people behind these boxes.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.410
This is Ciancio.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.510
This is the prolific
pizza box designer

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.350
who I asked him to send
me a couple of images

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.530
so that we can put something
in the book of him,

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.310
because I wanted people to
know who's behind these things.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:41.475
And he sent me one where he's
holding the brush in the air,

00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:43.350
and it's like one of
those Walt Disney things

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.262
where one of his
characters is there,

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:46.720
and he's just
holding a brush near.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.120
We didn't use that,
but I loved it.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.400
It was amazing.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.899
I'll email it to
you if you want it.

00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:51.557
But there's Ciancio.

00:37:51.557 --> 00:37:53.890
I'm really interested in the
backgrounds of these folks.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.510
That's one of his boxes.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.080
He did that one with the
two kids-- the creepy kids

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.680
on the wall.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.880
But there's another one.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.760
There's pizza that's
always involved,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.510
but it's always sort of
a passive participant

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.590
in the image.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.200
See, he does things
with pizza boxes

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.234
that-- it's got a whole story.

00:38:13.234 --> 00:38:14.650
It doesn't have
to have any words.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.900
I feel like he's one of the
truly great storytellers

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.277
alive right now, because
he tells these amazing--

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:21.860
and you can make up
anything you want.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.840
And I have another box that
has two characters, a guy

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.920
and a girl with a scooter,
and there's pizza involved.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.280
But they're riding, right?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.030
Well, this, I think
is part two from that.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.941
This is-- there's been
some kind of an issue.

00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:34.940
You're driving too fast.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.580
You're driving me crazy.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.610
Pull over.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.940
And then he says, wait.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.030
We almost forgot.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.780
We got this pizza.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.936
He's, like, trying to
get her back, you know?

00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:44.435
And she's being
all, like-- you know

00:38:44.435 --> 00:38:46.790
she's gonna eat that
pizza, but she's

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.540
being all, like, I don't know.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.040
At least that's
what I think of when

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.260
I stare at this for
hours every day.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.330
But I just love that
there are these stories.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.080
And, by the way, you know that
this is going to work out.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.850
Do you see that shooting star?

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.569
See it?

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:01.860
Everything's going to work out.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.630
Ciancio knows it.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.447
I know it.

00:39:03.447 --> 00:39:05.030
But it's funny,
because Ciancio speaks

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:09.940
no English, so our interviewing
process was all through--

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.190
actually, through Google
Translate, so thank you guys.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:17.100
And it was amazing, because he
would send these emails about,

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.040
like, I'm curious.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.025
What is this book even doing?

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:23.150
And then when I sent him,
I just said, don't worry.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.775
Just chill out.

00:39:23.775 --> 00:39:26.770
I sent to him, and he was
like, ah, that's great.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.540
Because there's a
little sketch of him

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.540
somewhere in here of just
like-- not the Walt Disney

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.029
version of it, but somewhere.

00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:36.070
Anyway, there was some
little funny sketch of him

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.090
that I just thought
was really, really

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:39.900
funny to see this guy's image.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:48.531
But I love branded boxes, like
marketing tie-in pizza boxes.

00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:50.280
So these are some boxes
I want to show you

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.590
that are not in the book,
because of trademark issues.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.960
But they're also the
only boxes I've ever

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.845
purchased online off of eBay,
and it's like six boxes.

00:40:00.845 --> 00:40:03.510
It's all the ones I've
ever bought, ever.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.820
And they're all these funny
collectible ones that came out.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.580
This one was 2000, when
Episode I came out,

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.090
and it's pretty awesome, right?

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.330
It's pretty epic.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:15.477
Only a two color
image, but of course

00:40:15.477 --> 00:40:17.060
it's big companies
like Pizza Hut that

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.170
have the dollars to
do something like this

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.790
and to do big marketing tie-ins.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:23.900
But then, of course, I just
couldn't-- yeah, right?

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.320
The Darth Maul one is badass.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.380
It is.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.250
But the Jar Jar Binks
one, that is goofy.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.251
And it's like, you show
it to a bunch of people,

00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:33.666
and you know when you hear
laughs, you're like, all right.

00:40:33.666 --> 00:40:34.810
These are the right people.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.090
But it's really funny to me.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.270
And I have Anakin.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:42.430
And somebody was selling a set
of four, and I'll never forget.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.510
My mom called me, and she
was like, so what's up?

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.170
And I was like, well, you know,
there's these pizza boxes,

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.400
and I'm thinking
about bidding on them.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.150
And I've never done
this with pizza boxes.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.650
I don't know if
I'm crossing a line

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.600
with this collection
and all this.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.340
Because the thing
about the collection,

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.520
and about collecting in
general, is a lot of it's

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.478
about the personal stories
and the interaction.

00:40:59.478 --> 00:41:00.240
That's why.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.730
I don't need to have
10 billion pizza boxes.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.850
To be honest, one day, I will
be done collecting these,

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.218
and I will just set them on
fire, you know what I mean?

00:41:08.218 --> 00:41:11.650
And I will just stand
there in a blaze.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.300
Hopefully not in the apartment.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.235
And I'll never forget.

00:41:15.235 --> 00:41:17.380
She was like, how much?

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:21.100
And I said, it's like $50
or something like that.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.220
And she's like, go for it.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.530
And I was like, you're right!

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.530
It was just amazing.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.067
She was like, go for it.

00:41:28.067 --> 00:41:29.900
I was like, you're not
supposed to say that.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.010
But one of the coolest
ones I ever got actually

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:34.210
came out April of 2013.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.440
This was just a year ago.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.420
Really, really fresh.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.420
The R2-D2 Domino's Japan box.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.870
How sweet is that?

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:46.080
It was $30 for the one box,
but it was worth it, right?

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.569
And it's a Domino's box.

00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:49.610
Of course they're going
to do a tie-in like this.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.193
But, you know.

00:41:50.193 --> 00:41:53.045
He has the shape of
their box, sort of.

00:41:53.045 --> 00:41:55.940
And the book is all
pictures of tops of boxes,

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.300
but I have to show you this.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.460
The back of the box.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.860
The functional explanation.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.410
And, I mean, it's in Japanese.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.670
I don't know how to read it.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.880
If anybody can read
it, please tell me.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.920
I mean, I want to
know how he works.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.450
But it was just amazing to me.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:14.180
The marketing in this box
is really-- the little

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.970
Domino's logo in the
lower right hand corner.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.050
But it's such a cool
collectible box,

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:20.697
and I think it got
a lot of press.

00:42:20.697 --> 00:42:22.280
I don't remember how
I heard about it,

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.550
but I guess, like,
I have alerts set up

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.600
for every time pizza
box things happen.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.230
And it doesn't
happen very often.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:37.630
But my other favorite thing are
the unlicensed, total ripoff--

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:40.400
this one's not in the book,
because I only got recently.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.410
Anybody ever go to Paulie
Gee's in Green Point?

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.255
OK, so Paulie brought
me back this box.

00:42:45.255 --> 00:42:48.880
He was on a skiing vacation
with his sons in the Alps,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.630
and of course, he's
tweeting the whole time.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.850
He's being such a nuisance.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.680
But he sends me this image,
and he goes, you want it?

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.340
And I'm like, are
you even-- I was

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.760
like, if you saw that
and walked away from it,

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.680
I will never talk to you again.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.690
Of course I want it!

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.960
This is the definition
of what I want!

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.110
They'd never license
images for pizza boxes.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.510
I've spoken with Matt Groening's
lawyer and 20th Century Fox's

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.670
lawyer, everybody,
and they're like, no.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.240
Because the reason
is-- I do have

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.692
a Simpsons box
that's in the book.

00:43:20.692 --> 00:43:21.400
It's even better.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.890
There she is.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.290
It's almost like the
proud chef motif,

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:30.171
but they've taken Homer and
Bart and totally disguised them.

00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:30.770
Oh, no.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.460
Those are other characters.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.370
This other one, it's
very clearly-- I mean,

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.400
come on, right?

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.034
Here, it's like, no, no, no.

00:43:38.034 --> 00:43:39.220
Homer doesn't have hair.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.928
Bart doesn't have a
bulge out of the back

00:43:40.928 --> 00:43:43.230
of his neck or a spiky goatee.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.060
And the physics of how
he's riding this skateboard

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.500
escape me, because it doesn't
look-- well, maybe he's

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.210
landing at Homer's feet.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:51.770
I don't know.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.670
I always think about it that
he's taking off, but no.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.586
Actually, now that I
look at it, he's landing.

00:43:55.586 --> 00:43:58.200
But anyway, the
image of this box

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.940
is the image on the
box within the box.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.920
So it's even better.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.810
And that's a whole motif that
people use all over the place.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.650
Mostly in Italy.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.814
And this box-- I got
it in Amsterdam, OK?

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:12.022
I'll tell you the name of
the pizzeria so you can go.

00:44:12.022 --> 00:44:13.820
But it's a generic box.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.880
He gave me the place.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.310
I said, oh, can I
get a pizza box?

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.030
And it was kind of boring.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.900
I said, oh, thanks.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.810
I collect them.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.194
And he goes, oh, I'll show
you this other one we have.

00:44:21.194 --> 00:44:22.610
I don't know if
you're interested.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.460
And he showed it
to me, and I swear.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.840
I'm not exaggerating at all.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.810
I blacked out.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.620
I was with some friends,
and they describe the sound

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:40.054
that I made as like a screech,
but like a guttural screech,

00:44:40.054 --> 00:44:41.220
as if it was like, [GROANS].

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.640
Like, that's what I wanted.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.860
I'm always on the hunt.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.360
I'd love to find some
unlicensed Disney boxes,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.470
because that's, like,
Disney would probably

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.379
march in and set them all
on fire and walk away.

00:44:52.379 --> 00:44:53.170
I want to get some.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.230
I want that, and I want
some Ninja Turtles boxes,

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.730
but I don't think
they really exist.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.930
I have one, but it's
recent, and it's bogus.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.660
But something like
this is just amazing.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.684
And then you get
interactive boxes.

00:45:05.684 --> 00:45:07.100
I don't know if
you guys have ever

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.180
been involved with
interactive pizza boxes,

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.010
but it's kind of
catching on a little bit.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.940
Domino's printed up
30 million of these

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:20.010
a few years ago as a partnership
with Hasbro, Parker Brothers.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.230
I think they're the same now.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:25.410
But where they wanted people
to have family game night.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:27.760
And so you buy a pizza,
and then you get this game,

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.440
and it's Connect Four by Four,
which is a version of Connect

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.690
Four, but you can
have four players.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.100
And each of the tokens, which
is the sides of the box,

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.190
they're all either yellow
or red on the outside

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.440
and then one of the colors
is different on the inside.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.310
So when you put a token down, it
counts for both the outer color

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:46.300
and the inner color.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.240
So your opponent could use that
piece to his or her advantage.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.229
I've never played it,
but it seems interesting.

00:45:53.229 --> 00:45:55.270
We actually we took a
photo of this for the book,

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.840
and it's really funny, because
after we took all the pictures

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.100
and I looked at the photo
on the book, I was like,

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.160
three different people
won in the version

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.700
that we photographed
for the book.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.260
All we did was place
the pieces down

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.760
so it would look
like it made sense,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.330
but that's a real fun fact.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.380
But I love these
interactive boxes.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.580
And this one's even better.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.120
It's a company called PackToy.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.470
This is an American box.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:20.420
And it's an 80
piece jigsaw puzzle.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.170
Because when you put
together a pizza box,

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.390
you're basically putting
together corrugated board

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.300
and stamping that with a die.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.775
And that die is
going to give you

00:46:29.775 --> 00:46:33.020
the score marks for the
sides, the cuts for the vents.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.047
But why not make a
little puzzle out of it?

00:46:35.047 --> 00:46:37.380
Well, except for the fact
that the puzzle may fall apart

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.380
onto your pizza, but
that's a whole other thing.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.220
But that's what it is here.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.150
But hold on a second.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.360
So I was just in Brazil
like two weeks ago

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.710
where they had taken this
to a whole other level.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.530
Same company, but in
Brazil, their boxes

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.750
are octagonal, first of all.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.780
And second of all, each
one of these pieces

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.160
pops out of the box.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.320
And if you can't
visualize it right now,

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.990
this picture from the
internet will help you.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.890
Toy airplane.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.380
Seriously.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.670
And so I talked to this company
when I was working on the book,

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.840
and the company sent me
these promotional images,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.900
and I'm freaking out.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.210
I'm talking to myself, just,
like, I need to get this.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.570
Where am I going to get it?

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.320
And then they're telling
you, oh, well, we

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.820
went out of business,
though, but we

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.230
sold a lot of those in Brazil.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.840
And it's like, well, I'm
never going to get there.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.890
This was a year ago.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:27.830
I was like, whatever.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:31.250
But I just knew that
oh, this existed,

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.860
and how this is like the dream.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.189
And then last week, I
was at this convention,

00:47:37.189 --> 00:47:38.730
and we were talking
about some boxes,

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.690
and one guy says, oh,
yeah, one of our clients

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.260
has a box that
becomes an airplane.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.750
And I was like-- again,
I almost blacked out.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.050
But the next day, he shows
up and he handed it to me.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.430
He handed this to me.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.440
And I just couldn't
even believe it.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.290
It's like the Holy Grail.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:56.832
It's amazing.

00:47:56.832 --> 00:47:57.998
But that's not the only one.

00:47:57.998 --> 00:47:59.030
They also have this one.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.560
Dinosaur.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.220
Right?

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.140
Dinosaur!

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.170
And I have this one,
too, but I'm never

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:07.870
going to take it apart, ever.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.160
So I'm just glad that they
have these promo images.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.250
But you take your pizzeria
and you have all your branding

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.120
on there, but then it
also has this thing,

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.090
and it becomes a toy.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.440
Because the idea is, if
you have this pizza box,

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.680
it's really good marketing.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.040
It's like a little billboard.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.900
But the numbers are that
2.5 people on average

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.110
will see every pizza box.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.671
So when you walk out of the
pizzeria, and you're seeing it,

00:48:32.671 --> 00:48:34.170
somebody on the
street might see it,

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:35.480
some half person might see it.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:36.646
I don't know how that works.

00:48:36.646 --> 00:48:40.030
But what if you
encourage somebody

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.280
to keep the box around longer?

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.770
Then it's going to increase
the chances of your marketing

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.270
power.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:48.960
So a box like this?

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:56.310
This one's from Japan, and
you can download an app,

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:59.670
and the app-- I would show it to
you, but it's only on my phone.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.340
You won't be able to see it.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.765
You focus on the box,
and it recognizes

00:49:03.765 --> 00:49:04.640
the image on the box.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.740
And it's sort of like
the way a QR code works,

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.130
but not totally boring.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.590
Your screen turns
into something,

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.150
and you start to see this
character, Hatsune Miku,

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.060
starts to dance
around on the box.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:19.200
And as you move the camera,
you're moving the angles,

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.690
and she keeps looking
at the camera,

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:23.480
and she'll dance at you.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.370
And then you can go
closer and further away.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.300
It's the weirdest thing ever.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:29.954
Only in Japan.

00:49:29.954 --> 00:49:31.120
And this was last year, too.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.880
And it came out, and my
publisher emailed me,

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.150
and they were like, hey,
did you hear about this?

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.800
Too bad it just came out.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.466
You probably won't
make it for the book.

00:49:39.466 --> 00:49:41.570
And I was like,
give me two weeks.

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:43.400
I had it two weeks later.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.160
I had to call this
guy I knew in Japan.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.410
We were going to the pizza
Expo last year, and I said,

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:47.700
can you bring it?

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.120
And he brought it, and it
was the greatest thing ever

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.050
in my life until this happened.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.860
Which is Hell Pizza
from New Zealand, which

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.430
I can demonstrate to you how
this works, because I brought

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:06.210
my dad's iPad, which I'm pretty
much borrowing from him just

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.830
for this.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:13.300
It comes with this game.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.190
Now, first of all, the
box is pretty neat,

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.023
because you can't really
see it, but there's

00:50:17.023 --> 00:50:19.910
a perforation over here,
and everything for them

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:21.400
is hell themed and demon themed.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.380
The perforation in the shape
of a coffin, which you pop out

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.820
of the box and you fold it up
and use it for your leftovers.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.895
But on the side of the
box, on the coffin,

00:50:30.895 --> 00:50:32.990
it says, "For your remains."

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.990
It's incredible.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.010
So I want to try to
show this to you.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.050
I'll see if it works.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.080
This is really funny,
because the guys who

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.780
designed this-- they
sent me some boxes,

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.800
and then they opened
up the app outside

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.760
of New Zealand
for a short window

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.895
so that I could download it, and
it was the funniest thing ever.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.050
So I'm loading this thing, and
I'm only hoping it'll work, OK?

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:04.391
But it says point at
pizza box to play, OK?

00:51:04.391 --> 00:51:06.890
Now I'm going to point it at
this screen, and I'm hoping you

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.070
guys can see this.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.160
I pointed it-- oh,
it's kind of weird.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.830
It's kind of getting weird.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.740
Uh-oh.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.500
Point at pizza box to play.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:21.500
Oh, my hand was in the way?

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.730
I hope this works.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:24.890
Well, if not, I'll just
bring in a box next week,

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.030
and we'll play.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.370
Oh my God!

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:30.490
OK, you ready?

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:31.110
Are you ready?

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.620
Can you see this?

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.620
OK, I'm touching the screen,
and it becomes a first person

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.520
shooter.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.440
And in the middle
of the screen--

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.950
and it's much better
when the box is

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:43.116
flat on a table, not when
you're at bird's eye view.

00:51:43.116 --> 00:51:45.863
But there's a pizzeria in the
center, and there are zombies.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.800
Zombies who you have
to kill so that they

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.950
don't mess with the pizzeria.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.675
And when you buy pizzas
from this company-- oh, man,

00:51:59.675 --> 00:52:00.800
I've got to get real close.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.240
I should come here all the time
and play on y our huge screen

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:03.790
here.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.750
But you see the deal.

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:10.670
You move around, and
you can see on the sides

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.150
of it and the whole thing.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.370
And it's their pizzeria.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.460
And it's totally incredible.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.900
There's my living room
floor, and there's

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.800
this weird scene
happening on it.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.710
It's totally amazing.

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.640
But that would
definitely force me

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.310
to keep the box around longer
so I could play this game.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.290
And then it's not torn up
and looking like a dinosaur.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.140
It's sitting there as a
billboard for this company.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.540
It's totally ingenious.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.060
And I guarantee this is going
to be happening more and more,

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.270
because of course, there's a
bunch of investments in making

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.728
these games and
these interactions.

00:52:41.728 --> 00:52:44.590
But once you can interact with
something like a pizza box

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.010
more, then it's not garbage.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.560
Totally blows my mind.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.096
So anyway, I wanted
to give you an idea.

00:52:53.096 --> 00:52:54.720
I think now at this
point, you probably

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.190
understand why I collect
pizza boxes, all right?

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.150
It's like, there is
more to the pizza

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:02.720
box than just the
structure itself.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.435
But there's also a lot to talk
about with regard to technology

00:53:05.435 --> 00:53:08.700
of the box and its ability
to transport pizza,

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.610
and steam release, and
all stuff like that,

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:14.290
which I may have to talk
about at another time.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:17.410
But right now, do we have time
for questions or something?

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:17.960
OK.

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.170
Now, if you guys have any
questions about anything pizza

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:24.440
related, pizza box
related, let me know.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.095
I have a few minutes.

00:53:26.095 --> 00:53:26.780
Yeah, what's up?

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.940
AUDIENCE: Do you
like to eat pizza?

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.190
SCOTT WIENER: I love it, yeah.

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:33.450
Yeah But no, it's a funny
question, because I mean,

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.660
I have to limit myself
to 15 slices a week

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.870
because of how much
I'm exposed to it.

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.492
So every day, I have
one or two tours.

00:53:39.492 --> 00:53:40.700
Like, tonight, I have a tour.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.860
We'll go to four places.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:43.300
There will be leftover slices.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.940
I will want to eat them,
but I have to keep a limit.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.790
But I don't eat
pizza out of boxes.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.430
Not out of respect for the
box, but out of respect

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.420
for the pizza, because the box
is the worst thing you can ever

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.200
do to a pizza, because
it traps so much steam,

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.650
and then the crust gets
soggy, and then that steam

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.310
breaks down the box
itself, and then

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.890
you end up tasting the
cardboard of the box.

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:07.240
So I love eating
pizza, but I don't ever

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.680
order pizza to be delivered,
even though I love pizza boxes.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.860
But I love them as
an art form, not

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.500
for their functionality at all.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:20.510
AUDIENCE: So you love pizza,
you love boxes, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.760
SCOTT WIENER: Yeah, what's up?

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.400
AUDIENCE: Well,
surely there must

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:29.360
be some kind of logical solution
to prevent all of those pizza

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.672
box problems from happening.

00:54:31.672 --> 00:54:33.630
SCOTT WIENER: There are,
but they're expensive.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:36.280
The problem is that the pizza
box is an invisible cost.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.159
So when you buy a
pizza to dine in

00:54:38.159 --> 00:54:39.700
and then you buy it
to take out, it's

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.330
the same price, even
though they have

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:43.180
to spend a little
bit more money.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.309
In the US, you're talking
about $0.35, $0.45 per box.

00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:48.350
It's not really that bad.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.080
Brazil, they're
over $1.00, $1.50,

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.410
because they're doing
these crazy airplane boxes.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.920
But there are a couple boxes.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.820
This one is called
the impact box,

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.505
and you can get this box
at Eataly or Don Antonio

00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:04.770
on 50th and 8th Avenue
or in southern Italy

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.160
where it has 17 vents.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.540
Which is OK, but
what it really has is

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.080
the inside is a
metallic coating so

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:15.760
that it keeps heat
transfer on the inside,

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.870
and also prevents
grease from leaking

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:19.540
into the cardboard
of the box and making

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.284
it unrecyclable in
some municipalities.

00:55:22.284 --> 00:55:23.700
But there's an
even better version

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.300
of the box, which is this one.

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:28.410
This is called the
Vent-It Box out of India.

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:33.510
And the way the corrugation
works is it's three layers, OK?

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.416
There's an outer liner-- I
anticipated the question.

00:55:38.416 --> 00:55:40.640
There's an outer
liner, an inner liner,

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.500
and then a fluted medium, OK?

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.210
Now, what they do with
this vented box is instead

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.160
of gluing all three together
and then punching out the holes,

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:55.420
they glue the inner liner
and the fluted medium,

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.050
punch out holes, and then
they take the top paper

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.220
and they punch out holes.

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:03.650
And when they put them
together, they don't line up.

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:06.200
If you think about the
fluting like this table,

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:09.595
one hole on the bottom is here
and the other one on the top

00:56:09.595 --> 00:56:11.520
is upstream, here.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.630
So steam rises up, it
travels through the fluting,

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:16.570
and it escapes indirectly.

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:22.790
So since it keeps
a consistent level,

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.700
then it doesn't lose a lot of
heat, but it does lose steam.

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:30.560
So you do you have a
solution, but it's expensive.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:31.246
Yeah?

00:56:31.246 --> 00:56:33.912
AUDIENCE: So all do these custom
pizza boxes pay for themselves?

00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:37.131
Or is it just an act of love
and they go this extra mile

00:56:37.131 --> 00:56:38.422
because they really love boxes?

00:56:38.422 --> 00:56:41.150
Or does it actually get them
more business subsequently?

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:43.670
SCOTT WIENER: Well, I mean,
it's definitely getting them

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.970
more business, without a doubt.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.910
It's marketing.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.350
If your box says
hot and fresh pizza,

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:51.540
then there's nothing to
indicate where it's from.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.210
If the box says Jimmy's Pizza
Shop, then maybe you see it,

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.990
you see it on the
garbage pile, then

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.470
maybe the more often you
see that name, then you say,

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.720
I've seen that box.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.860
Let's go to Jimmy's.

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.690
In my neighborhood, there's one
pizzeria that has custom boxes,

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:08.710
and they are busier
than the other ones.

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:13.717
And it's hard to tell if it's
that they make more money,

00:57:13.717 --> 00:57:15.300
so maybe they're
spending it on boxes.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.064
But I doubt that.

00:57:16.064 --> 00:57:18.230
Nobody's going to be like,
hey, we have extra money.

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:19.210
Let's not keep it.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:20.520
Let's make a cool box.

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.910
It's not going to happen.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:22.680
It's marketing.

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.370
Big time.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.880
And now pizzerias
is are starting

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.490
to get more into the marketing,
because they're realizing

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.800
you have to do something to
keep up with the next guy,

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.760
whether it's a
video game, or it's

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.322
coupons that pop out
of the box, or there's

00:57:35.322 --> 00:57:37.030
something more
interactive about the box.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.360
We were talking before
about the green box, which

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.210
is a box that has perforations
s it breaks down into plates,

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.620
and then a storage container
for y our leftovers.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.745
And that's cool, because
it'll break down,

00:57:47.745 --> 00:57:49.495
and you can leave it
in your refrigerator,

00:57:49.495 --> 00:57:52.200
and it doesn't take up
a crazy amount of room.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.180
So you're more likely
to keep that box around.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.809
And it says right
on it, green box.

00:57:55.809 --> 00:57:57.600
It's advertising for
the green box company.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.850
But if your pizzeria
uses their box,

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:01.680
you can do your
own branding on it.

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.540
It will still say
green box on the side,

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.830
but you can do your own thing.

00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:06.246
And then people
will say, oh, they

00:58:06.246 --> 00:58:07.820
have that box
that's really cool.

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.119
We should order from them.

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:10.910
I don't think that
happens a lot right now,

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:13.350
but I'm hoping that will
happen more in the future

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:16.900
so that I will have more
awesome boxes to collect.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:17.410
G-man.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.957
AUDIENCE: Any
chance of us seeing

00:58:18.957 --> 00:58:20.105
more of this in New York?

00:58:20.105 --> 00:58:21.915
An artistic renaissance
in New York?

00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:24.510
SCOTT WIENER: No.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:26.610
I don't think it'll
happen anytime soon,

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:31.090
just because New York has such a
built in audience for pizzerias

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:33.090
that you're going to the
place on your corner,

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:34.710
or if you're going
out of your way,

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.910
you're going out of
your way for someplace

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:37.200
you read about online.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.880
It's not because of the box.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.860
New York is a different
world for this.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.320
New York will always
be generic pizza boxes.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.810
But when you go out into other
countries and other cities,

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:50.500
and so much more custom.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.830
Colorado has a lot of custom.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:53.490
Florida has a lot of custom.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:56.020
But it's just really tough
to be in the New York market

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:59.080
and sell somebody on
custom and say, oh, here's

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.965
why you should spend
the extra $0.04 a box,

00:59:00.965 --> 00:59:02.210
or whatever it might be.

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.890
I wish.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:03.400
Yeah?

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.130
AUDIENCE: Just curious, how do
your family and friends view

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.040
your collection?

00:59:09.665 --> 00:59:10.790
SCOTT WIENER: I don't know.

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.050
It's funny.

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:19.060
When I started doing pizza
tours, that's weird, right?

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.850
But then they saw that
I was legit about it

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.360
and running it in a
serious way, and that there

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.710
was press about it.

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:30.590
And my parents could be proud
about it and talk at work.

00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.130
My mom's colleagues at
work cut out pizza articles

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:34.320
all the time.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.780
So I get an envelope every
month of all the pizza articles,

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.920
which, of course, we
have the internet,

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.080
and I already have them.

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.577
But it's so sweet.

00:59:42.577 --> 00:59:43.160
It's so great.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.290
So when the pizza
box thing happened,

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.530
I think they were already
kind of cooled off.

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.530
They knew that if I was up
to something, it was OK.

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:54.240
And then when the book project
came up, that's legitimate.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.666
And now it's been on TV
for different things.

00:59:57.666 --> 00:59:59.040
I just did an
interview yesterday

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.590
with the History Channel about
the history of packaging,

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:03.880
and pizza boxes in particular.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.665
So when my dad sees
that, he'll understand.

01:00:06.665 --> 01:00:08.020
He'll be great with that.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.870
But it would be really funny.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:09.390
I won't tell him.

01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.181
He'll just be watching
the History Channel,

01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:12.510
and it'll just happen.

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.680
And then he'll be like,
oh, man, it's real.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.370
There you go.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.950
Yeah.

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:20.290
So I honestly don't know
what their true feelings are,

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:22.370
but they haven't said
much negative to my face,

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:23.492
so that's good.

01:00:23.492 --> 01:00:24.950
They're really
supportive about it.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.991
I mean, they bring me
pizza boxes from vacations.

01:00:29.828 --> 01:00:30.850
Good question.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:31.665
Yeah, what's up?

01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:33.290
AUDIENCE: What's the
conservation state

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.210
of the boxes?

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.441
Because you keep them
way past their intended.

01:00:36.441 --> 01:00:37.190
SCOTT WIENER: Yes.

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.495
Do you mean, are
they breaking down?

01:00:39.495 --> 01:00:40.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.070
SCOTT WIENER: OK, so since I
have these boxes from the '80s

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.550
and '90s that were
in a storage room,

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:50.940
and they still look OK, then I
think we're in all right shape.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.930
But I keep them all
compressed, and I

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.602
keep them stacked
against each other,

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:56.810
so I think that's better
than if they were in a room.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.240
I don't have them on display.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.031
I have six or seven on
display, but they're

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.954
ones I have doubles of.

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:05.380
But I think they're OK.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.190
I photograph all of them, so
at least I have the images.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:11.300
And I just hope to not
touch them too much.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.690
The more that I would tamper
with them, the worse it'll be.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:16.430
Something did happen
recently where

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:21.190
we did an art show at my
publisher's bookstore in Dumbo,

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:24.460
and we covered the walls with
12 of my favorite pizza boxes.

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.130
And I had these
frames built that

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.880
were two pieces of
Plexi that pull together

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.504
to sandwich in the boxes.

01:01:31.504 --> 01:01:32.920
And it didn't cover
it all around,

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.320
but it was a pretty cool
way to display them,

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.736
and it looked
really, really good.

01:01:35.736 --> 01:01:38.480
And it's not confirmed
yet, but we're

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.930
really close to confirming.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.960
We're going to do another
gallery show of 100 pizza boxes

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.420
in Berlin, and then in London,
sponsored by a company that

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.542
does food delivery in Europe.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.250
Hopefully that'll be
confirmed next week.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.730
But that'll be just
like this, and the idea

01:01:56.730 --> 01:02:00.360
is you want to get people to
see that this is a funny thing.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.760
You go out and check this out.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.390
But it's also to have a
greater respect for something

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.380
that you thought was just
so simple and basic that it

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.260
needed no attention at all.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:13.480
Like if one day somebody tells
me about different shoelaces,

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.490
at first I'll be like, no way.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.057
But of course,
maybe shoelaces are

01:02:17.057 --> 01:02:18.890
crazy and cool and
different, and who knows?

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:20.140
The flat ones and
the round ones.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.005
I don't even know.

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.590
Now I'm thinking about it.

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:24.360
I'm getting nervous
that I'm going

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.419
to start collecting shoelaces.

01:02:26.419 --> 01:02:27.460
Who brought up shoelaces?

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.360
It was me.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.610
Anyway, good question, though,
about the conservation.

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:31.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:33.286
SCOTT WIENER: I'm
not worried yet.

01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:36.342
I mean, I'm looking
for a storage space.

01:02:36.342 --> 01:02:38.050
And when I find one,
it'll have to be one

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:42.120
that I can have some
kind of control over.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.670
Even if I can just put something
in there to absorb moisture.

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:48.780
But I'm worried about drying
out the boxes too much.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.270
Right now, they're really
happy in my apartment

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:52.947
in a cool, dark place.

01:02:52.947 --> 01:02:54.655
Wherever you store
your olive oil, that's

01:02:54.655 --> 01:02:57.230
where you store
your pizza boxes.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.594
AUDIENCE: Have you seen any
that have deteriorated yet?

01:02:59.594 --> 01:03:00.510
SCOTT WIENER: Not yet.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.968
The only reason
they deteriorate is

01:03:01.968 --> 01:03:06.520
when I keep boxing them up
and then flattening them down.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.152
I see little corners, you know,
like the flaps from the side.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.110
I'll see them laying
around my apartment floor,

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:14.562
and I'm like, ah, another
one bites the dust.

01:03:14.562 --> 01:03:16.270
Of course I want to
keep them all intact,

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.960
but I can't keep them perfect.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.390
My fear with doing this show
and with doing the one in Europe

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.860
is that's a lot of
transport for these things.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.220
They're not meant for that.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.720
That's a lot of putting them
together and taking them apart,

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.370
and they don't all fold
up the same, you know?

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.940
So the differences between one,
like the Walker-style box that

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.576
folds up with a front flap--
you get into doing that,

01:03:38.576 --> 01:03:39.450
and there's a rhythm.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.610
But then you switch
to a tab lock box,

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:46.470
and suddenly you have--
they're going to be messed up.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.440
So that's why it's really tough.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.000
If we're going to do some
kind of thing like a big show,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.360
then I would have to
photograph the heck out of it,

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.920
and I have to be ready to
kiss some of them good bye,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.950
because they might
not make it, you know?

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:05.070
But what good is a collection
if you can't see it?

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:06.880
Good question, though.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.644
Any other questions?

01:04:09.644 --> 01:04:13.260
Well, thanks for coming out
and hanging out and listening.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.640
We didn't even show
you a picture of food.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.720
So that's weird.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.790
That was one thing with
the book is I kind of said,

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:25.700
I don't want a single food
porn picture in the book.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.179
It's got to be about the boxes.

01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:28.470
It's got to be about the boxes.

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:29.928
And they were
totally cool with it.

01:04:29.928 --> 01:04:33.110
So the only food in there
is photo quality images

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:41.070
of pizzas in Pakistan and in
Cuba, and they look disgusting.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.300
So if you want to come
over and check it out,

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.450
I brought a bunch of cards about
the book and about the tours.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.460
So if you're curious
about any of that stuff,

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.090
come and check it out.

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.215
If you have other questions,
come and check it out.

01:04:52.215 --> 01:04:54.280
I don't have a tour to
do today until 7:00,

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.367
so I'm just hanging out.

01:04:55.367 --> 01:04:56.950
Although, no, I'm
going to the library

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.533
to do a bunch of
research, because I'm

01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:01.240
going to start working on
another book pretty soon about

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.370
some more of the intense
history of some pizza stuff.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:06.270
So there's all that.

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:07.645
If you have
questions about that,

01:05:07.645 --> 01:05:09.390
come and let me
know, because that's

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:12.302
all I've been reading about for
the past few weeks in libraries

01:05:12.302 --> 01:05:14.010
and looking at deeds
and stuff like that.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.776
But thanks for
coming out, and have

01:05:15.776 --> 01:05:16.900
an awesome rest of the day.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.250
[APPLAUSE]
