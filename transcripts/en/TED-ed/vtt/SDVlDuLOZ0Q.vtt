00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.498
I think the most interesting job

00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:12.480
that's going to exist probably in the next ten years

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.479
is going to be a space miner.

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:15.970
So, this is going to be somebody

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.716
who's going to be mining asteroids in space

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:21.970
because there's a lot of minerals

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.093
that we need these days

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:24.889
to make the technologies that we use everyday,

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:25.889
including your cellphone,

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:27.002
your computer,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.860
and there's a limited number of them on Earth,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.501
but we know that they exist in space.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.159
And so, as our capabilities to go to space,

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.778
look at, say, the Mars Curiosity rover

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:40.784
that's now driving around the surface of Mars

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.110
and the new Mars I initiative

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.817
to send a, start a colony on Mars,

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:47.529
I think that, you know,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.123
space is really where there's incredible opportunity.

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:53.527
And so, I think it's going to be fascinating

00:00:53.527 --> 00:00:55.052
to see the day when we have people

00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:58.517
that are working in space

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.226
on asteroids.
