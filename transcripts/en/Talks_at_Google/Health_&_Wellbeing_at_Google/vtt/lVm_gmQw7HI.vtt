00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.920
MARIA DE LA FUENTE: Today, we
would like to introduce Javid.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160
So in behalf of Google
and all of the Googlers,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.990
welcome to Google.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.781
DR. JAVID ABDELMONEIM:
Thank you very much.

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.374
Thank you.

00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:18.310
SPEAKER 1: Hi, there.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.714
DR. JAVID ABDELMONEIM: Hello.

00:00:19.714 --> 00:00:20.507
Hello.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:21.090
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.506
So, Javid, just
so you know, we're

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.570
expecting something like this.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.037
Do you have instruments,
or a band, or what--

00:00:27.037 --> 00:00:29.120
DR. JAVID ABDELMONEIM:
That's sitting at the back.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.172
The rest of the team is there.

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:32.130
SPEAKER 1: I'm kidding.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm sure no one's is
here to hear about me,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.875
but I'm just going to briefly
introduce you to everyone.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:36.800
And I'll pass the mic.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.720
So Javid is probably
one of the people we

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.397
need to hear more of at Google.

00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:43.230
He's been working in
Doctors Without Borders

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.160
for a very long time.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.951
And he's worked in a
lot of crisis regions,

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.697
like the Ebola crisis in Sierra
Leone, like refugees in Athens.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:51.530
He's also worked around
the regions as well.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.670
So I'm sure we can learn
a lot from what he does.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.590
So I think the best
way in these talks

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.410
is to make it a very
organic, very open thing.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.200
So we'll have Javid talk
for about 20, 25 minutes,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.815
but your feedback is great.

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:04.440
I think he also is
very curious to know

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.230
what you guys think about their
operations and what they do.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.780
So I think we'll be able to
have a very nice discussion

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.530
together.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.360
So thank you, guys.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.300
And off to Javid.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.440
DR. JAVID ABDELMONEIM:
Thank you, [? Majid. ?]

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.791
Thanks very much, everybody.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.740
Thank you for having
me and MSF here

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.100
for what is your inaugural
Google talk here in Dubai.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.300
So I think that's fantastic.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.490
I'm going to give
you an idea of what

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.220
it's like to work on the
frontline in MSF as a doctor.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.670
I'm a doctor myself.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.060
And also to give you a chance
to ask questions to clear up

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.320
any ideas you might have.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.220
So what I'm going to do over
the next almost 40 minutes,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.900
actually-- so
sorry to shock you;

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.560
I'll try and keep it down--

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.140
is give you a picture
of what I first

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.360
did with MSF, Medecins
Sans Frontieres,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.050
and what I last did.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.670
And they tie in somehow.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.230
But interestingly,
I found out today

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
that one of your Google
mottoes is don't be evil.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.490
Is that right?

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.240
And of course, the first
medical ethic is do no harm.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.509
I don't know if you knew that.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170
So that's a really nice
link between Google

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.260
and Medecins Sans Frontieres,
Doctors Without Borders.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.150
We're a medical organization.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
And medical ethics are a
core value of who we are.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.780
And who am I anyway?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.470
So I'm an emergency physician.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.630
I work in hospital in London.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.890
But I also go to
the field with MSF.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.240
I'm now on the board of MSF UK.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.660
We manage ourselves.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.439
We can be the governors
of the charities.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.480
And this is a picture of
me on the ship Aquarius,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.790
taken last summer, about
which I'll talk later.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.660
I actually pointed here.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.790
Just to really map out--

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.130
the founding
principles of MSF are

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.350
what you see there--
independence, neutrality,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.060
and impartiality.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.570
The independence comes from
the funding stream, essentially

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.689
being literal public,
and also the fact

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:02.730
that we govern ourselves.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.880
So people like me who
have been in the field,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.150
we can put ourselves
forward for elections

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.560
internally to manage
the charity, which

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.090
is what I do currently.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.940
Impartiality is a medical
thing, essentially.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.610
It's the fact that a human
being in front of you,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.260
no matter what
their religion is,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.650
or no matter where they're from,
how they got ill or injured,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.900
they're your patient.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.450
And a patient is a patient, and
you're the health care giver.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.630
So you don't ask questions
about your patient.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.730
That's what impartiality is.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.920
So my first experience with MSF,
I was one year in the field.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.660
I was six months in Iraq.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.450
And while I was in Iraq, there
was the Haitian earthquake,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.510
which was right at the
beginning of January 2010.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.700
And in fact, Haiti
was the first time

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.730
Google got together with MSF.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.050
You helped with some mapping
of the disease of cholera

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.710
when it struck the country later
in the year, in October time.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.220
And I'll come on to a little
bit of the cholera experience

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.290
there.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.330
But this was a difficult
experience for me.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.880
I had gone there to work
in this hospital here.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.092
So just look-- oh, wrong button.

00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:13.340
Does the pointer-- can
you see the pointer?

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.880
This was the medical
tent just here--

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.850
32 inpatient beds.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.480
So I was there to run the
internal medicine department

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480
that you see there.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.060
The emergency room, which
is just behind it, and also

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.680
the Intensive Care Unit.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.180
But obviously, the
standard of care

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.830
after an earthquake
in that setting

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.060
are not as high as
you might expect.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.780
So it was really
quite challenging.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.480
I was seeing a lot of
infectious diseases, typhoid,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.100
malaria particularly,
tuberculosis, HIV,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.940
which I had no means to
treat, lots of violence,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.470
lots of interpersonal
violence, and a lot

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.160
of non-communicable diseases,
so asthma, diabetes, strokes,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.970
heart attacks.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.580
So a really wide variety of
caseload but in very difficult

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.050
circumstances.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.660
So despite my having
arrived in Haiti in June--

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.430
I left Iraq in--

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.690
I took a month break.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.560
I arrived in Haiti at
the beginning of June,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.040
which was already six
months after the earthquake.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.390
But it still looked like this.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.560
These are all my pictures.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.935
I keep pressing
the wrong button.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.280
Every building, everywhere,
some form of destruction.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.320
You can't imagine.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.970
Every horizon just
rubble and destruction.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.510
But people trying to
get on with their day.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.300
Here are two boys--

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.304
if the pointer works.

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:41.720
You can see two
boys there walking

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.760
past this building
going to school.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.120
This picture on the
bottom left is just tents.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.790
People were living in tents.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.170
I didn't go anywhere special
to take this picture.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.480
Every sidewalk, every pavement.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.640
You drive to work,
this is what you see.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.610
Or if they had managed to
get together some money

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.980
to build some proper shelters--

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.810
proper in terms of
a bit more solid--

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.170
you can see there in the bottom
right some corrugated tin

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.560
because the hurricane season
comes on later in the year.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.300
It's imperative to try and get
a little bit more fixed shelter.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.150
But what this paints a
picture is that there

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.610
was no water and sanitation.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.530
Very hot, very
cramped conditions.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.200
On a background of
where we were working,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.660
which is a place called City of
Soleil, which meant Sun City.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.630
It's the favela, so to speak,
the slum of the capital.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.960
And here is our convoy
arriving through the gates

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.120
of the hospital.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.430
The UN wouldn't
even go in there.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.370
There was no safety
for anyone, but MSF

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.440
in such a place because
of the gang warfare

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.830
that was rife there.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.950
But we-- because we
gave free health care

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.920
and had been there for many
years-- had free access.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.140
So it was-- there was
a lot of violence.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.000
There was a lot of gun crime
and a lot of sexual violence

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.560
that I was treating
in my emergency room.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.040
So it was difficult.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.786
And as you can see there,
that picture in the tent,

00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:07.910
this is one of the doctors.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.250
You can see how
cramped the beds are.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.115
But what we're doing here
is those top two pictures

00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:17.240
are taken on the same day that
Hurricane Thomas was coming in.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.980
At this point, the
cholera had struck

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.480
in the north of the
country already,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.210
but it hadn't
arrived in the city.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.570
But November 4, we were just
packing up the hospital.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.640
We had to vacate the
lower ground floor.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.500
My medical tent
had to pack it up.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.810
There was no way that would
have survived a hurricane.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.160
Had to move all the patients.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.780
Either discharge
them or move them up

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.665
into the hospital first floor.

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:42.290
So that's the picture inside the
tent with most of the patients

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.400
having gone.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.280
And just four of us
there in the team,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.880
one of the nurses,
the logistician,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.940
and the medical team
leader, and myself,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.670
did an extra hurricane
night shift in case

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.800
it should strike the
hospital and there were

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.375
any emergencies at that time.

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:59.000
So we stayed in the
hospital overnight.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.480
But actually, the
hurricane swerved

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.760
north at the last
minute and really missed

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.190
hitting the city firmly.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.700
But nonetheless, there was
a big storm, lots of water.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.060
And cholera is water-borne.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.100
It's spread through water.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.190
And it gives you symptoms
of a very profuse diarrhea

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.670
and vomiting.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.020
And the very next
day, it essentially

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.990
washed into the city
with Hurricane Thomas

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.410
and into the slum.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.110
And I had just finished
that night shift.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.700
I was just walking out.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.330
And there was a trauma case.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.770
A man had been hacked by a group
of vigilantes and attacked.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.050
And he had been
accused, so to speak,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.710
of stealing a purse from
a woman in the area.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.970
And we weren't able to save him.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.690
He was hacked to death.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.950
My clothes were absolutely
covered in blood.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.260
But luckily, because I had
spent the night in the hospital,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.210
I had an extra bag.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.530
And I changed my clothes.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.110
And on the way out to
go to the car park,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.840
we had situated a
pre-triage area.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.490
You don't want any
patient with cholera

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.350
to be able to
enter the hospital.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.820
It's highly infectious.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.630
And we had pediatrics
and obstetrics.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.110
We needed to keep all these
vulnerable patients separate

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.610
from the cholera patients.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.990
And I went into the tent.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.780
And the nurses said, I think
we've got our first cases.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.700
And it was three children
and some parents.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.450
And indeed, they
were cholera cases.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.980
And the next day, we had 16.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.182
And the next day, we had
something in the mid 20s.

00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:37.640
And by the end of
the week, we were

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.640
approaching 200 cases a day.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.300
And it was something
that you just no

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.050
matter how you think
you may be prepared--

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.990
and it was my first time in such
a field-- there was something

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.006
very, very hard to manage.

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:55.080
Patients, when they're
sick with cholera--

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.180
this picture on
the top left there,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.880
you can see there
are holes in the bed.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.230
There's a hole in the bed.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.850
Yeah?

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.310
So under that hole is a bucket.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.090
And at the top end is a bucket.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.180
The patients get so
debilitated that you just

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.110
do it in your bed.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.590
And your job is to wash them
and to get rid of the buckets

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.440
and fill it with chlorine,
because chlorine neutralizes

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.390
the cholera toxin.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.896
And we were building beds.

00:10:20.896 --> 00:10:21.770
We'd run out of beds.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.020
And you put two, three
children down on a bed just

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.890
to find space.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.120
And people were coming--

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.270
it's such a violent
part of the city

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.770
that people wouldn't
come overnight.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.120
It's so dangerous to
be outdoors overnight.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.590
So there'd be a lull.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.840
There'd be a lull overnight.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.197
And we were doing our
day shift in the hospital

00:10:38.197 --> 00:10:40.280
and volunteering to do
extra shifts in the evening

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.000
until the emergency pool
came to bolster our services.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.090
So overnight, you would do
little logistical things.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.330
The huge buckets at the top
left of that top left picture,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.320
they're about 200 liters of
oral rehydration solution, which

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.590
is if you're only a moderate
case, you just need to top up.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.830
The management of cholera
is to avoid dehydration.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.240
It's as simple as that.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.860
It'll self limit up until then,
essentially, give or take.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.630
But patients lose
so much fluids.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.200
If they're very, very severe--

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.930
you can see these
bags of fluids here.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.010
Each one is one liter.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.700
The normal human
need is 2.7, call it

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.210
three, liters in a day without
extra losses, so three liters,

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.560
24 hours.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.260
A severe case of cholera
may need five, six, seven

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.290
liters in the first two hours.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.155
You die in two hours by
vomiting and diarrheaing

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:40.440
your entire body fluids out.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.050
It's severe when it's severe.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.150
And it's really, really not fun.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.670
I remember one night,
a different night,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.825
this oral rehydration
salt buckets had run out.

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.200
Because if you're
a moderate case

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.430
and you're not vomiting
too much, you can drink.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.120
And that's the best way
to get fluids into you.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.500
But those buckets had run out.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.340
It was raining.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.424
It was about 3:00
in the morning.

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:04.340
You've had a long day.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.980
It's like, oh, my god, why the
hell have these buckets run out

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.090
right now?

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.279
And there wasn't any of the
ready made solution left.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.320
You're chasing your tail.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.545
Logistics couldn't keep up.

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:14.420
You're building beds.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.240
Patients are down.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.310
ORS has run out.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.430
Make some.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.719
So I had to tear each
sachet, 200 sachets, of--

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:23.510
I'll put this down.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.910
I'm not managing to point--

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.590
of oral rehydration
salts into this buckets

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.940
and then fill it up in the rain.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.260
And you're just having
one of these moments

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.330
in your life when you
think to yourself,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.100
how have I ended up
in this situation

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.050
where it's 3:00 in the
morning, it's raining,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.670
people are all around me,
sometimes you hear gunshots

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.670
left, right, and center.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.850
And it's just-- so I had one
of those moments where you just

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.899
question what path you've
taken in your life.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.440
And I thought, right,
I'm going to go

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.720
to bed for a couple of hours.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.880
But before I went to bed,
I saw two of the cases

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.640
were really quite on the
borderline of switching

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.880
from those oral fluids,
the bucket drinking,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.060
to the intravenous fluids.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.900
So I told the team members,
guys, keep an eye on those two.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.009
They were young girls, actually.

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:10.050
Keep an eye on those two.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.633
I'm going to go for
a couple of sleep.

00:13:11.633 --> 00:13:16.370
Have a low index of suspicion
for switching to intravenous.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.430
And I came back,
and they were dead.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.340
And exactly-- gasp, sigh.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.430
And what can-- well,
I blamed myself.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.180
What can you do?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.920
And you just think
to yourself, my god,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.745
I should have just put
that cannula in myself,

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:36.650
and the children
would be alive today.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.050
So it's a difficult--

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.940
it's a difficult
thing to deal with.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.160
I'm quite all or
nothing in that way.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.280
You are success or fail,
no gray in between.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.110
And I ended up fixing
on this negative moment.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.180
And it's quite hard,
because you have to stuff

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.430
the orifices of
a human when they

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.610
die with cholera with
cotton soaked bleach,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.710
because things ooze out
and become infectious.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.240
And so I had to hand back
this young girl to her mother

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.620
in the morning.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.680
And you're blaming yourself.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.230
And she's looking at you and
saying thanks for trying.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.330
So this was an awful moment
for me, particularly,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.620
which I haven't talked about.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:18.330
This is only the third time I've
talked about this since 2010.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.700
But it was a circumstance--
the first time

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.280
I had seen there was no dignity
for patients whatsoever.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.350
This is a cattle truck.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.990
This is how we had to
transport patients.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.240
This lady was actually pregnant.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.420
You sit them on
buckets to move them

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.580
from a triage area to the actual
main cholera treatment center

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.620
that we built in a football
pitch down the road.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.540
There was no dignity.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.160
And there was fear
in the community.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.270
There hadn't been cholera
for centuries in Haiti.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.690
And so when we were first
doing transfers during the day,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.280
they were throwing
rocks, burning tires.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.090
So we had to do it overnight.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.450
And again, you have these night
shifts where it's raining,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.950
and you're pushing patients
like this into a truck,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.780
covering the truck
with plastic sheeting

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.940
so no one can see what's
inside, and moving them

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.380
across the city.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.140
It's not a dignified--

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.370
it's not dignified.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.800
It's inhumane.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.350
But needs must.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.260
It was what we had to
do to just try and get

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.640
anything done for these people.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.450
It was a very
difficult situation.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.830
But that was the last month
of my six months there.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.410
And if I would ever
characterize the first five

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:40.290
months of being just a low
grade assault on my psyche.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.144
I wanted to be able
to treat strokes,

00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:43.560
but we didn't have
the medication.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.351
I wanted to be able to
treat heart attacks,

00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:47.400
but there was no
coronary care unit.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.830
I wanted to be able to treat
these men with tuberculosis,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.800
but there were no other actors.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.730
It's an earthquake.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.320
So you can't.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.835
But when you're faced with these
patients, and you just say,

00:15:57.835 --> 00:15:58.710
I know what you have.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.890
I know what I want to
do for you, but I can't.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.431
This is what's going
to happen to you

00:16:02.431 --> 00:16:04.170
over the next few months--

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.570
a death sentence in
a few of the cases.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.320
It's hard to deal with.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.420
And then the cholera came.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.340
And I've just told
you how that was hard.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:17.700
So this picture, 1st of December
2010, when I left Haiti,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.410
is a happy picture.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.410
This is me after a
few beers, and I'm

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.502
flying away the next day.

00:16:23.502 --> 00:16:24.460
And I haven't given up.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.501
And I've done six months.

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:27.360
And yes, I stuck it to the end.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.702
And I was recreating here--

00:16:29.702 --> 00:16:31.410
you know sometimes
you have a few drinks,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.790
and you think you're funny.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:39.970
But I was recreating how I felt
at the end of these six months.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:45.420
I felt smashed up and beaten up
and run over by an MSF pickup.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.500
It was a hard six months.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.930
And it was also at the end of
an entire year in the field

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.020
having been in Iraq before that.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.480
So I had promised to
myself really actually

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.012
not-- to give up medicine.

00:16:56.012 --> 00:16:57.720
I had promised myself
to give up medicine

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.880
at that point, which
was at the end of 2010.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.120
And I tried.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.190
But I came back.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.430
MSF has this-- no matter
how difficult it is,

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.310
there are moments where
you just love it so much.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.569
And I'll come on that shortly.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.430
But I found-- you saw
that tent that was empty,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.056
and I took the picture of the
doctor pushing the drip stand.

00:17:17.056 --> 00:17:18.930
While we were doing
that, one of the patients

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.819
gave me this letter.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.589
And he was a young man.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:26.099
I don't think you can actually
quite read it there or not.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.920
It says, I salute you
in the name of He,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.050
who through his
death, gave us life,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.460
Jesus Christ, dear, Dr. Javid.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.380
So it's a very eloquently
written letter.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.210
And he goes on to talk about
if you despise your neighbor,

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:42.930
it's a sin.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.440
But blessed is he who cares
for others, who carries on.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.090
And he says--

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.760
I'd forgotten who he was
at the time of reading,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.500
but he was actually
a young man who

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.680
had a cardiac arrest,
respiratory arrest.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.820
He had an acute asthma attack.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.050
And I remember very clearly
being called into the ER

00:17:59.050 --> 00:17:59.950
to try and help.

00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:05.130
I had actually said don't
continue resuscitation,

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.216
because we didn't have
real intensive care.

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:08.340
We didn't have ventilators.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.160
We didn't have oxygen.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.380
But the staff appealed to me.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.950
He's young.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.700
I thought, OK, there's
one other treatment

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.350
we haven't tried here.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.620
Let's do it.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.930
And he had survived.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.110
He had survived well
enough with brain capacity

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.000
to write this
beautiful letter to me

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.670
as a thank you to say
you didn't give up on me.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.360
Thank you.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.140
And I think right now--

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.950
I needed that.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.800
Because I was
developing a sense--

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.730
over the years--

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.650
I came to read this
three years after I left

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.600
Haiti, a couple of years ago.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.450
I had developed a sense that
everything I had done in Haiti

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.010
was failure.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.570
Everyone I saw died.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.790
It was difficult. I was blaming
myself for a lot of the deaths.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.060
And I found it very hard
to deal with mentally.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.010
But this guy reminded
me in a short, sharp way

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.670
with this letter, hey, you
know, you did OK sometimes.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.210
So it's a very
important letter for me.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.530
And it ends be blessed
by God forever.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.564
A big thank you to
all the staff of MSF.

00:19:12.564 --> 00:19:14.730
Because earlier on he says
thank you are the biggest

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.500
words in the human dictionary.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.540
So I think it's such
a beautiful letter.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.170
But I share that with
you just to say sometimes

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.600
it's too easy to fixate
on how you don't do well.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.960
But others remind you
that you may have done OK.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.160
That was one of my first
experiences with MSF,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.170
but my last experience was
just last summer on the ship.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.170
So despite having tried to
leave MSF and leave medicine

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.370
how many times, I'm still here.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.040
I'm still coming back from war.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.040
And it's worth it.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.930
But what's Aquarius?

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.930
Aquarius is one of our
search and rescue vessels

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.510
on the Mediterranean.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:51.360
It works just--
this doesn't point.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.020
We work in this area
here, just north of Libya.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.590
Because there are many,
many deaths in people

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.140
trying to cross the
Mediterranean towards Europe

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.094
from Libya.

00:20:02.094 --> 00:20:03.510
And these are the
number of deaths

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.380
in that Search and Rescue
zone, the SAR, just there.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.686
So people on the move
coming towards Libya,

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.810
smuggled or otherwise,
getting on to rubber dinghys

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.226
and trying to cross
the sea there.

00:20:14.226 --> 00:20:19.890
So some 2,892 deaths
in that area in 2015.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.960
And a good deal more
I'll show you shortly.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.800
But who are these people?

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.560
They're many people
from failed states

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.010
coming from Somalia, Eritrea.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.900
Eritrea-- there's lifelong
military conscription, unpaid.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.630
It's a failed state.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.590
You're a refugee by
definition if you

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.380
manage to leave that country
and you can claim asylum.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.980
Sudan, also from West
Africa, so many flow

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.250
of migrants, people on the
move, coming from the horn,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.700
coming from the west up
across the Sahara into Libya

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.230
and trying to get
into Italy there.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.940
What this shows
is actually quite

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.040
how many people there are.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.160
About 16% of all
those numbers that you

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.790
see arriving-- some 25,000
people a month in the summer

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.030
months arrive into Italy.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.030
It's a huge number.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.810
Some 16% of those are
children traveling alone

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.890
without their parents.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.010
I had a patient who was a
13-year-old boy from Darfur.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.210
He clearly had chicken pox.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.070
That was why I was
seeing him on the ship.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.130
Luckily we're-- I'll show you
how we rescue people shortly.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.160
I had a 14-year-old traveling
from Mali, no parents.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.100
In fact, his father was
in Paris he told me,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.650
trying to reach him there.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.760
But large numbers arriving in
Italy over the summer months.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.286
And this is the number that died
in 2016 despite our efforts.

00:21:37.286 --> 00:21:38.910
And you can see there
a good proportion

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:39.930
are women and children.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.060
So it's not just young
men trying to arrive,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.740
economic migrants or otherwise.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.480
But how do you convert
this situation here,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.300
which is usually what you're
faced with when you're floating

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.010
in that search and
rescue zone off Italy

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.770
in international waters,
how do you convert this

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.940
into safe bodies on our ship?

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.520
Because believe it or not,
this is a highly risky moment

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.540
right here, right now.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.450
That's a highly risky
moment for a few reasons.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.543
Usually the boats would
be fuller than that.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.630
Often, both sides of
the boat will be full,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.500
all along its circumference with
people dangling their legs over

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.070
and sitting for support.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.812
So for me, when we see this,
we say, why is it not full?

00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:26.020
Where have those people gone?

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.710
Why are these people--

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.800
what's going on with those
people just down there?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.750
Are they unwell-- not
well enough to stand up?

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.390
It's tricky.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.180
And if you're not careful with
the way you perform the rescue,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.280
they panic, and you have
this type of situation.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.790
And bodies in water is not cool.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.970
13 died on this rescue.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.360
112 survived.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.770
They're given life jackets that
when they get wet soak water

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.290
and they sink by the
smugglers and the traffickers.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.830
So it's unscrupulous
people getting these people

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.650
in these boats.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.000
This is what you convert--

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.690
that first picture
to this picture.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.300
This is a lovely, safe moment.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.800
And this is what we're doing
on the scene now in MSF.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.890
So the first boat--

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.500
I'm actually on the second
boat, if I could point,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.035
which is the boat on the
right with the white helmet

00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:16.160
on the middle person there.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.230
But the first boat is
the boat on the left.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.450
Now, if that dinghy
doesn't actually

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.946
try to drive itself away from
you when they first see you,

00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:25.070
because they think you
might be Libyan coast guard,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.130
who are now being trained and
paid by European governments

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.410
to push back these
people onto shore.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.310
And we'll come on to why that's
a bad thing with Libya shortly.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.240
So once we get to them, we use
the ship's sound system to say,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.960
hey, you're safe.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.797
We're MSF.

00:23:39.797 --> 00:23:41.630
And we do it in French,
Arabic, and English,

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.820
the three languages mainly
of those countries you saw.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.380
And Tigrinya is one
of the languages

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.496
of the horn of Africa.

00:23:46.496 --> 00:23:47.870
So we get the
messages out there.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.770
You're safe.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.690
And this first boat, our dinghy,
our rib, arrives to the dinghy

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.610
and latches on and
doesn't leave them

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.320
until the last body
is off that ship.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.690
And they arrive with the
first set of life jackets.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.500
And then, I, with two
sea rescue people,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.220
arrive on that second rib
with more life jackets.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.900
Until everyone
has a life jacket,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.784
we don't board or
take someone off.

00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:12.200
Otherwise, it might
ensue a panic,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.420
because they want
to be the off first.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.750
All this time the first
rib, the rib on the left,

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.510
has someone on there in those
four languages just saying

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.595
stay calm.

00:24:21.595 --> 00:24:23.720
Because otherwise, you'll
end up with this picture.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.894
And you don't want that.

00:24:25.894 --> 00:24:27.560
And here is another
way of looking that.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.360
So there's Aquarius
in the background.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.820
It might even go upwind
of you to block the wind,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.930
to calm the waters.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.050
It's actually amazing
how that bit does that.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.040
And you come and go.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.580
And you come and go.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.220
And you take the--

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.136
this is me, the back of
my white helmet there.

00:24:40.136 --> 00:24:43.460
And you take the women off
first, or the children,

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.600
or anyone who looks sick.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.390
And you can only fit
18 people on your rib.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.420
So sometimes if it's 190,
200 people on these rubber

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.980
dinghies, you're
going back and forth,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.890
back and forth that
distance to Aquarius.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.540
So it can be time consuming.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.430
And that's one boat.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.660
If the weather has been
bad and they've not

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.250
been able to set off--

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:06.770
if the wind is coming on to the
shore, it's only a 25 cc motor.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.560
200 people on a dinghy against
the waves, against the wind

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.910
are not going to get offshore.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.670
So sometimes they're detained
on the shore for days waiting

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.230
for the weather to improve.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.990
And then, if you
have a good day,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.035
you'll have five, six, seven,
eight, nine of these boats,

00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:22.670
these dinghies, to try and save.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.160
But there are many ships
on the sea, all coordinated

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.040
by the Italian Coast Guard.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:34.652
Two weekends ago,
8,300 people saved.

00:25:34.652 --> 00:25:38.430
But make no mistake,
none of those people

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.410
would have reached Italy.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.300
There is no way
that rubber dinghy--

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.110
it's a rubber dinghy--

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.860
can cross from Libya to Italy.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:54.150
On our ship, it's a two day,
two night sail at steam.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.460
There's no way.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.730
So accusations by
politicians or otherwise

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.129
that we're a taxi
service, I mean,

00:26:02.129 --> 00:26:04.170
there's no way these bodies
would reach the ship.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.280
And they're people who
are destitute, no shoes,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.380
just the clothing on their back.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.030
Why they left their home?

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.750
Multitude of reasons.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.390
What happened to them in Libya?

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:16.540
Dreadful situation.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.706
I'll give you some examples.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.950
But when we get
them on board, we

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.130
hand them a welcome pack,
a change of clothes.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.410
Usually, they might
be skin infested,

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.180
because the detention
in Libya is so awful

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.130
that they have scabies.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.246
They have skin infections.

00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:36.120
So we take off all their
clothes and dispose.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.280
Give them a fresh
pair of clothes.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.630
Enough nutrition for the
first day, which is biscuits.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.374
It's light and easy
to keep on a boat.

00:26:41.374 --> 00:26:43.290
But the next day, we
give them curry and rice.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.934
It's much nicer.

00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:46.350
But on the first
day, we give them

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.750
soap, toothbrush,
toothpaste, pair of clothes,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.709
a blanket, and a towel.

00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:50.708
So this is them queuing.

00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:53.189
Because it can be a bit of a
queue to hand that all out.

00:26:53.189 --> 00:26:55.230
And you're only getting
18 back at a time anyway.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.370
So it's a process.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.360
It takes time.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.556
And as soon as they get
on, you tell them this

00:27:00.556 --> 00:27:01.680
is where you need to sleep.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.580
Men this side.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.440
Women inside.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.510
You can drink water
from these blue boxes.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.410
It's filtered water.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.960
There are the showers.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.645
You tell them where
we're going, what's

00:27:11.645 --> 00:27:13.270
going to happen to
you when you arrive.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.520
You'll meet the UNHCR.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.490
The Red Cross is there.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.420
You'll be safe.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.895
But please don't wee
in the portaloos.

00:27:21.895 --> 00:27:23.850
Because if it gets too full--

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.350
and if the Coast
Guard tell us to go

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.820
to mainland rather than Sicily,
it's another 24 hour sail.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.590
400, 500 people on
board, two portaloos,

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.970
urine full, waves splash, feces,
people sleeping on the deck,

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.170
not very nice.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.150
So don't wee in the portaloos.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.812
It's like one of our things.

00:27:43.812 --> 00:27:44.520
Please don't wee.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.020
Anyway, so I'm getting--

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.930
so there's a lot of
logistics about it.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.790
But once they're on there safe,
and they often just sleep.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.810
They just sleep.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.550
For the first two,
three, four hours, you

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.350
have this very eerie silence.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.687
And you get the impression
that they've really,

00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:02.520
really not had a good
night's sleep at least

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.353
for the last three, or
four, or five nights,

00:28:04.353 --> 00:28:07.530
particularly if it
was bad weather.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.044
So it's quite quiet
those first few hours.

00:28:10.044 --> 00:28:12.210
But sometimes-- actually,
this is the women sleeping

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.290
in the shelter--

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.700
you get jubilation.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.685
These women had just
changed their clothes.

00:28:17.685 --> 00:28:20.894
They finally understood
what we were doing.

00:28:20.894 --> 00:28:22.560
They hadn't quite
realized, potentially,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.880
that we were the good guys.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.380
And so broke into song.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.740
It was beautiful.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.530
Nigerians, the Christians,
singing a very beautiful

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.672
religious song.

00:28:32.672 --> 00:28:34.380
But actually this
picture is also up here

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.500
to illustrate another thing
is that when you get groups

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.150
of young Nigerian
ladies like this

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.260
you know they're
being trafficked.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.090
So they have fallen somehow or
have been even knowingly sold

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.530
by their family or someone
else into the sex slave trade.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.380
And they are being
moved, very meticulously

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.040
in a planned fashion, from
Nigeria across the desert

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.700
into Libya, detained,
and moved on into Europe.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.330
And the hotspots, the open
detention centers in Italy

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.700
where the UNHCR and the
Red Cross and everyone

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.490
receives these people when we
arrive in Italy, they're open.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.290
And if you are 16, a minor,
14, the 13-year-old I

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.190
told you about, that's
a closed hotspot.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.565
They can't get back out into
the continent of Europe,

00:29:17.565 --> 00:29:18.690
because they're vulnerable.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.398
They're children.

00:29:19.398 --> 00:29:20.280
You look after them.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.490
But the adults--

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.410
Italy receiving 25,000
people in the summer months

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.337
for the last three
years, each year.

00:29:29.337 --> 00:29:31.170
They're doing a great
job in receiving them,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.410
but that's a lot of people to
receive into your country who

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.980
have high needs.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.970
So for them, it's a good thing
to have hotspots that are open.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.680
Adults can get out into
the rest of the continent.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.440
So the sex traffickers tell
their teenage girls to all

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.600
say they're
university, above 21.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.442
And they'll all say they're 23.

00:29:53.442 --> 00:29:54.900
And they're all
from the same city.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.240
And they're all going
to do the same thing.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.670
And you're just,
like, yeah, right.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.760
And you're given these
indicators of vulnerability

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.750
by the authorities.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.280
And we hand them over
to them on arrival

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.140
to try and just
take charge of them.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.000
But amongst these women--

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.125
these women, there were 16.

00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:14.100
Four had unwanted
pregnancies from very recent

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:14.922
sexual violations.

00:30:14.922 --> 00:30:16.755
One of them had been
raped the night before.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.460
And she said she was 23
when she first talked to us.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.690
But on those two days,
they see that you're kind.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:31.020
They get confident in
your good intentions.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.300
And she actually said on
the second day, actually,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.280
today's my 18th birthday.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.430
And she started to
tell me the surprise

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.482
party she had the year before
by her friends in Nigeria.

00:30:44.482 --> 00:30:45.940
How she wishes she
was still there.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.970
What a different
birthday this is.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.460
And it's a moment you
have with another human.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.010
It's such an interaction
I'll always remember,

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.560
because there she was
just being honest.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.980
What a rubbish situation I'm
finding myself in right now

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.940
compared to last year.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.620
I wish this wasn't happening.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.850
But then at least I take
away from that moment

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.550
that she felt comfortable
with what we were doing.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.690
We gave her a moment of caring.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:14.670
We gave her a moment to
say you're important to us.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:15.270
Be warm.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:15.900
Be safe.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.010
Be here today.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.700
Here's some food.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.430
Well, I gave her
all the medical need

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.640
that you need after a rape.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.100
And then, also, we give
psychosocial counseling.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.945
And she are handed
over to our counselor

00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:32.550
on land to carry on having
mental health follow up.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.910
But a lot of cases are beaten.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.265
So this guy was a Sudanese
professor, he told me.

00:31:37.265 --> 00:31:38.640
He could speak
French and German.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.040
And I tested him.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.970
And he had been detained three
or four times over a few months

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.260
in Libya for money.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.320
It's extortion.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.620
They imprison you.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.460
You pay money.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.120
You get out.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.620
It happened three
or four occasions.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.870
On the last occasion
he said, I'm

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:55.090
not going to do this anymore.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:55.980
They beat him.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.580
And in beating him on
his feet with piping,

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.250
he had ended up with
abscesses and a broken foot.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.100
So this is what I
was treating here.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.800
This guy, a young electrician
man, he'd been sold.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.740
Many reasons for how these
people end up in Libya.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.770
But then also Libya is
so violent and broken now

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.830
with forced detention.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.540
But he'd been sold
unknowingly to him.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.770
He was bundled into a car.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.220
He had been sold to erase a
debt he was told, transported

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.110
across the desert from
Nigeria through Niger,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.790
stop over there, into Libya.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:34.980
He was forced to work in an
armed gang stealing livestock

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.740
from other Libyans,
but he refused.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.050
An armed African--
so the Libyans

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.320
were forcing these
guys, who they'd bought,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.260
to then go and be armed robbers
to take the risk of being

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.400
shot by the Libyan police.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.380
But it leads to--

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.100
you see what I'm trying to say.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.600
So he refused to do that
and had been detained

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.760
in solitary confinement.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.477
Had lost a lot of weight.

00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:00.560
But they found out that
he was a good electrician.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.530
He'd done them
favors in working.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.470
And one guy he was lent
to-- so he's a possession.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.550
He's a slave.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.320
He was lent to another guy.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.400
He did good work for him.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.520
This guy took pity on
him and released him.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.885
And so I said, well, why
didn't you go back to Nigeria?

00:33:16.885 --> 00:33:19.780
How did you end up on
this boat, on this dinghy?

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.860
And he said, look at me.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.670
I couldn't cross the desert.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.590
I can't go all the
way back to Nigeria.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.935
The sea was just there.

00:33:26.935 --> 00:33:29.360
I thought I could get to Europe.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.370
You don't think
about the logistics

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.490
of crossing the Sahara on
your feet or otherwise.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.860
But these numbers-- these
people are managing them.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.940
But he felt he didn't have
the strength to get back.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.120
And again, when we get to Italy,
as I said, we arrive in port.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:50.710
And we hand them over to the
authorities as I described.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.662
They get safety but not
necessarily a ticket to stay.

00:33:55.662 --> 00:33:57.745
Of course, some people,
their asylum is processed,

00:33:57.745 --> 00:33:58.890
and they're sent home.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.223
Some people it's processed,
and they're allowed to stay.

00:34:01.223 --> 00:34:06.350
But this is the
lives disembarking.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.370
And then, we go
out to sea again.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:11.719
There's a big workload.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:15.469
A lot of lives to save, as
I said, some 8,300 just two

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.179
weekends ago.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:20.150
But some beautiful
sunsets out at sea.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.342
Even here in Dubai,
I saw one yesterday.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.069
That wasn't my really
last experience.

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:31.550
My last experience was that I
went back to Haiti in March,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.144
just a couple of months ago.

00:34:34.144 --> 00:34:35.810
I was lucky enough
to be able to go back

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.770
to help the teams in place to
organize a debate about how

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.698
to move forward.

00:34:40.698 --> 00:34:41.989
It's how we organize ourselves.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:44.870
It's part of our independence
to debate how we move forward

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.310
and open new projects.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.130
And this is the team there.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.179
But what I found is--
remember I said to you--

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.770
I showed you that
tented ward that I

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.960
was working in post-earthquake?

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.204
What I found was this.

00:34:55.204 --> 00:34:56.870
This is one of our
three projects there.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.920
This is a port-a-cabin hospital.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.660
But nonetheless, this is
a 100-bed trauma unit.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.730
This is the center of excellence
now in Haiti for trauma,

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.790
be it orthopedic or otherwise,
so car crashes, gunshots.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.570
And it's an MSF hospital.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.960
And I remember when I was
in Haiti we discussed,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.990
what should we do as a legacy?

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.117
What are the biggest needs here?

00:35:23.117 --> 00:35:24.950
And we identified this
is one of the things.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.770
And here I was coming
back seven years later

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.150
to see, wow, we've gone
from that tented structure--

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.380
and that was my whole memory of
Haiti-- to something like this.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.700
And it was so clean inside.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.000
It was amazing.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.070
So this is a really
positive thing for myself

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.710
to have found that MSF
is able to do there.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.890
And also, I found that we have
opened up an obstetric hospital

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.550
with neonatal intensive care,
so newborns, and a sexual health

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.725
clinic, again, because we were
seeing so much sexual violence.

00:35:53.725 --> 00:35:56.810
So this is one of the only
clinics in the country that

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.360
takes that into account,
doing psychological care,

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.330
physical care, and actually
social care empowering

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.144
the women to find a
means of earning money.

00:36:05.144 --> 00:36:06.560
So that they don't
have to go back

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.270
to where the assault
occurred, which

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.520
is a new thing for MSF to do.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.900
But I'm really
pleased to see it.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.180
And I was really
surprised to find

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.100
that the clinic was in the house
that I'd lived in in Haiti.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.820
So that picture
where I was run over

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.172
by the car, that was in
the driveway of our house,

00:36:23.172 --> 00:36:24.130
[? Amina ?] Alpha Mike.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.850
Our houses have
names, because you

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.250
need to tell the radio
station for safety that we're

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.290
going to x and y location.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.490
So this is me at the entrance in
Alpha Mike just a few weeks ago

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.060
just shocked and surprised to
see that my old bedroom was now

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.824
the psychosocial
team headquarters.

00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.365
And it's just like,
oh, wow, OK, it's

00:36:42.365 --> 00:36:46.490
a really positive change
from that awful place

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.140
that I lived for six months
and that tented hospital

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.120
to things like this.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.880
So I had a little bit
of closure and a bit

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.450
of very positive
ending for Haiti.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.370
So I'm pleased to
report that back

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:02.030
rather than to be too
moody about everything

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.690
that I've said.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.590
But one thing I take
away from the things

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.910
that I did in Haiti,
from that letter, from,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.250
for example, what I've
told you on the ship,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.760
is about these moments of
care that I'm afforded.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.610
I'm so lucky to be able to doing
what I do with MSF to really

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.270
be able to--

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.480
the way I see it, there
are seven billion universes

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.230
on this planet.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.967
We each live in
our own universe.

00:37:25.967 --> 00:37:27.800
Do you ever look at
someone when they sneeze

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.110
and you think, oh, they've just
had a moment in their life.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:30.500
No?

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:30.800
I don't know.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.280
I do that.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:31.779
I do that.

00:37:31.779 --> 00:37:34.160
I'm like, oh, that
guy just sneezed.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.150
He's having a moment.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.700
What MSF does for me
is I'm able to have

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.080
a moment with somebody else.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.430
And that moment is when
they seek health care.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:49.970
And I'm luckily able to provide
that health care through MSF.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:53.570
But you get to spend a
moment with that person.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:54.490
And it's their life.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.430
It's their universe.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.600
God knows where they've
come, where they're going,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.110
what they're hoping to
do, what they've lost,

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.086
what they hope to gain.

00:38:02.086 --> 00:38:03.710
Each of these people
I've talked about,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.810
all those numbers,
sadly the dead ones,

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.990
they're each a person.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.510
Just like you woke up today
and you go, oh, my back hurts.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.551
Oh, I have to go to work.

00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:13.590
Yes, it's Thursday.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.750
Tomorrow is the weekend.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.580
Each of those people
have those thoughts

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.324
every minute of every day.

00:38:18.324 --> 00:38:20.240
So when you see numbers,
try to remember that.

00:38:23.045 --> 00:38:28.080
We say, yes, we did 800,000
cesareans last month,

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.230
last year, of course,
the organization.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.280
But that's a woman
having her child.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.025
That's fantastic.

00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:34.900
You know what I mean?

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.040
It's just so positive.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.260
So I've been able to have
a positive ending with MSF

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.070
finally.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.180
And of course, you guys, through
your collaboration with us

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.830
over so many years,
and most recently

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.040
what you actually did in this
office, are enabling that.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.140
So it's fantastic.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.350
So I'm really here to
say thank you for that.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.520
And have shared that
experience with you.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.500

so real big thank you from MSF.

Thank you from me.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.630

how to connect on
