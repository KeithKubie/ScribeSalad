( intro music )

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.308
<i> This is the Great
 Bear Rainforest.</i>

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:10.443
<i> This is a place on the</i>

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.344
<i> British Columbia,
 Canada coastline.</i>

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.947
<i> And this is one of
 those unique places</i>

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.649
<i> where you can be sitting in a
 boat and you look at the land</i>

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.885
<i> and you can watch a bear
 and a wolf on the beach</i>

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:19.919
<i> and you look around</i>

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.154
<i> and there's a humpback whale
 and orca in the water.</i>

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:25.391 line:0%
This is one of those
incredible rare locations

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.927 line:0%
where a wild landscape
still meets the wild ocean.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.862 line:0%
Those places have
largely been relegated

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.230
into the history books.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.699
<i> This is also the only
 place in the world</i>

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.468
<i> where humpback whales sing
 on their feeding grounds.</i>

00:00:36.468 --> 00:00:38.238
<i> And this is what their
 songs sound like.</i>

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:47.647
( whales singing )

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:58.357
So, I first went to the
Great Bear Rainforest in 2010

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.859
on an expedition
organized by the

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.660
International League of
Conservation Photographers

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.597
to document the
bio-diversity of this area.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.632
Why?

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.833
Well, because tragically
there was a proposal to put

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.301
an oil pipeline that runs from

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.937
the Alberta Oil Sands all the
way to the Pacific Ocean

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.874
and then have large supertankers
travelling through these

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.309
sort of remote fjords and

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.944
channels to take
the oil to Asia.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.814
And the Gitga'at First Nation,
who are the local stewards

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.817
of this coastline had
invited us to help them

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.153
try to raise awareness
of that realm.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.422
<i> It's a rough coastline, it's
 not a place for tankers.</i>

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.958
<i> And in my mind, you know
 it's not a question of "if"</i>

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.394
<i> it's a question of when
 a spill will occur</i>

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.462
<i> if these tankers do
 move into that area.</i>

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.665
<i> It's just this incredible,
 incredible wild place.</i>

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.436
<i> Published in
 2011-2012, and, uh</i>

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.837
<i> that was not the
 end of it for me.</i>

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.072
<i> I was hooked by this place.</i>

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:47.873
I think I went back three
seasons in a row, on my own.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.476
Working with local NGOs and
the Gitga'at First Nation's.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.513
And for me the terrestrial realm
had been documented very well.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:56.382
<i>But the underwater world, by and
 large, was completely unknown.</i>

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.083
<i> So, I went there to
 try to, you know</i>

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.987
<i> really create a exhaustive
 portfolio of life in the seas</i>

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:03.156
<i> of the Great Bear Rainforest.</i>

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.724
<i> This is the cradle
 of kelp evolution.</i>

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:08.694
<i>Nowhere else on Earth are there
 that many species of kelp.</i>

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:10.663
<i> It's a cold, it's a
 nutrient rich sea.</i>

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.999
<i> Highest diversity of starfish
 in temperate waters.</i>

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.667
<i> This is a Sunflower Starfish.</i>

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.837
They grow to this sort of size.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.806
They are the largest shallow
water starfish in the world.

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.442
You know, three-four kilos,
incredible predators.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.311
<i> But for me, the one
 species that screamed out</i>

00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.981
<i> pulsating life were jellyfish.</i>

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.483
<i> And in the right months of
 the year, in the fjords</i>

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.319
<i> they aggregate in incredible
 numbers to spawn.</i>

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.455
<i> Smacks of jellyfish, that I
 just learnt a few years ago.</i>

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:37.624
<i>It's not schools, it's a smack.</i>

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:39.825
<i> This is basically me,</i>

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.794
<i> I've turned the camera
 around on myself</i>

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.896
<i> and I'm now trying to
 basically swim into</i>

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.532
<i> the densest part of
 the jellyfish school.</i>

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.235
<i> Don't ask me why. It's just,
 it's just one of those things.</i>

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.870
<i> They are caressing me.</i>

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.605
<i>I'm being tickled by jellyfish.</i>

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.174
<i> I think I get a little
 jellyfish hat now.</i>

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.643
<i> There you go.
 I've got a cap there.</i>

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.146
<i> Water is cold, it's
 four, five degrees.</i>

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.049
Every hour I climb on
the boat with my elbows

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.583
because I can't feel
my hands or my legs.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:05.618
I kind of just, you know, like

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:06.653
a seal of shimmy
out of the boat.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.222
I have this hot water hose in
my wetsuit for 10-15 minutes

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.256
lying on the swim
platform, like

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.390
you know, crying
and shivering.

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:13.726
And I do it three or four
times a day, you sleep

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.663
-really, really, really,
well on--
-( audience laughter )

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:19.332
<i> In the Great Bear Rainforest</i>

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.901
<i> the one species that is more
 important than any other</i>

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.202
<i> if there can be such a
 thing, is a salmon.</i>

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:26.372
<i> Now once a year these fish
abandon their life in the ocean</i>

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.309
<i> and they move in-shore and
 they swim up rivers to spawn.</i>

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.745
I arrive at this one pool,
right below a waterfall

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.447
and I found this
little side chamber

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.682
this little sort of
nook in the corner

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:39.652
and I kind of wedged myself
in there and I waited.

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:41.854
Five minutes, ten minutes,

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.724
20 minutes, 30 minutes.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.593
I think it was about 45 minutes
later that one fish came back.

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.162
( audience captivated )

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:51.197
And then another one came
back and then I just waited

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.599
like a, you know, I couldn't
move anyway, I was too cold

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.100
so I wasn't going to scare them.
And then I got

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.904
-this picture.
-( audience gasps )

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.906
<i> So, all these fish just kind
 of huddled together waiting to</i>

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:03.208
<i> pretty much take on these
 mighty, mighty waterfalls.</i>

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:07.180
I also, though, wanted an image
that illustrated the connection

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.983
that a lot of the wildlife
has with these salmon.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.818
And I had dreamt up this
picture of a split-level.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:15.154
Which is half underwater,
half above water.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:18.090
Underwater you have the salmon,
and above you have a bear

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.225
with the salmon in its mouth.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:21.493
And the waterfall flowing
by with a rainbow

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.863
running diagonally
across the frame.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:24.897
( audience laughter )

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.500
I sketched my pictures and
that's what I sketched.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.137
Very rarely do I get my
sketches, but,
you know, dream big.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.706
And fail spectacularly.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.074
( audience laughter )

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.244
Anyway, black bear
expert fisherman.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.579
<i> He's waiting, he's waiting
 and he has got one.</i>

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.082
<i> I watched this bear for
 hours, he had this technique.</i>

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.818
<i> And once he gets one, he walks
 up into the forest, eats</i>

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:48.254
<i> and every 15 minutes, he comes
back down he gets hungry again.</i>

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.388
<i> He gets another one.</i>

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:52.358
<i> He disappears and
 now he comes back.</i>

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.994
<i> In the meantime, I
 snuck into the water.</i>

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.163
<i> And he's just not sure.</i>

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.231
<i> You know, this is "bear
 snorkeling 101".</i>

00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.699
<i> ( audience laughter )</i>

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.235
<i> The bear can smell you even
 if you're in the water.</i>

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.270
<i> Something I learned.</i>

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.672
<i> I'm trying my best, I'm
 sneaking up to this bear.</i>

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.740
<i>I can see the salmon underwater.</i>

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.243
<i> I have this picture in my
 head and I try and I try...</i>

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:13.145
<i> Every time I get past
 this little area</i>

00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:15.315
right about now he spots me.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.516
-He was like, "I got you!"
-( audience laughter )

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.786
"I see you, you damn<i> National
 Geographic</i> photographer!"

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.287
( audience roaring
with laughter )

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.655
And it's just like, and I go

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.024
"Okay, fine, I give up, man,
alright, alright." Plan-B.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.827
If I can't get a picture
of a bear and a salmon,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.196
let me get a picture
of a salmon leaping

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.531
from the bear's perspective.
And I have timed this.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.300
I have 15 minutes before
the bear comes back.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.103
<i> So, I sit where the bear sits.</i>

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.839
<i>And I got pummeled with salmon.</i>

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.407
<i> -Now... this hurts.
 -( audience laughter )</i>

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:44.076
<i> And you know, I had bruises.</i>

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.611
<i> But again I'm more worried
 about flash placement.</i>

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.846
<i> Every time I place the flash
 they hit the flash again.</i>

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:51.917
<i> And so, complete disastrous,
 disastrous mix of things.</i>

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:53.018
( sound of waterfall )

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:54.419
<i> And it's like the shotgun,
 they come in waves.</i>

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.454
<i> Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!</i>

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.623
And there's one frame
that I kind of like,

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:00.126
and it kind of, sort of,
you know, connects...

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:03.095
I wanted a picture that connects
the salmon with the forest.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:04.463
<i> And this is what I got.</i>

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:06.031
<i> ( audience gasps )</i>

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.700
<i> "Salmon in the
 trees", I call it.</i>

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.935
<i> ( audience laughter )</i>
