00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.240
Dyslexia is often misunderstood condition
that affects over 40 million Americans and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.230
millions more across the globe.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.940
But what causes the condition and why does
it make it hard to read?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.860
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.840
Dyslexia is often described as a learning
disability where people have trouble with

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.840
language.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.890
It’s an often frustrating condition where
letters get jumbled up or it’s hard to associate

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.830
a sound with a letter, so even familiar words
are difficult to read.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.070
While we’ve been pondering this condition
for a while at @DNews just a quick shout out

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.110
to @razmataz2011 on twitter for pondering
about it too!

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.399
There’s no one size fits all experience
with dyslexia; it can be expressed in many

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.670
different ways.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.200
Some people have trouble with reading while
some people have trouble with listening, some

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.250
have a bit of both.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.760
But either way it means they’re more at
risk for falling behind in school.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.219
For the past decade researchers have discovered
more and more about the genetic link behind

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.330
the disability.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.469
One study published in the journal of Neuroscience
found that some dyslexics with a deletion

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.130
of the DCDC2 gene had trouble detecting certain
types of visual movement.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.389
While other studies like one published in
the same journal found a link between a mutation

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:17.109
in the ROBO1 gene which resulted in certain
pathways, like auditory pathways that link

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.950
the two halfs of the brain, to be weakened.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.420
And so while it’s described as a learning
disability, it can perhaps more accurately

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.569
be described as a neurological condition.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.299
Several studies comparing the brains of dyslexic
and non dyslexic individuals found some striking

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.299
differences.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.469
For example one study published in the journal
Biology Psychiatry.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:40.849
In a study of 75 children and 104 adults researchers
analyzed MRI scans to see whole brain connectivity.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.630
They found that dyslexic individuals have
weaker connections in certain parts of the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.149
brain like visual centers and in the region
between visual center and prefrontal region

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.899
and in the visual-word area.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.149
So it seems a very visual condition.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.779
And this would explain why reading becomes
difficult, but not speaking.

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:01.369
And there are studies that caution to place
all the blame on the brain.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.929
They see the cause and effect as reversed.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.709
That poor reading experiences leads to less
grey matter in certain parts of the brain.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.290
While many assume dyslexia is primarily difficulty
reading, some research suggests the underlying

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.650
deficit lies with understanding spoken language.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.329
One study published in the journal Science
found that those with the condition have trouble

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.290
understand the differences in the way people
talk.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.810
In one experiment the researchers had people
with the condition and those without listen

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.920
to voices.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.879
Those voices either spoke the language the
participants knew or a foreign one.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.870
The participants were then asked to match
the voice to an assigned cartoon avatar.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.170
Not surprisingly everyone struggled to recognize
the foreign language speakers.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.900
But the researchers found that dyslexic individuals
also struggled to recognize speakers of their

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.219
native language.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.000
So this is consistent with what other researchers
have found.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.680
A paper published in the journal Child and
Adolescent Mental Health says that “dyslexia

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.810
is best described as a core phonological deficit.”

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.720
This is called The phonological deficit hypothesis
and can be traced back to research in the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.340
1980s.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.349
Phonemes are the smallest parts of speech.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.310
Sounds like ba and da or one researcher in
this theory uses the example of the word cat.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.790
Dr. Sally Shaywitz told Scientific American
that the word “cat,” for example, consists

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.799
of three phonemes: “kuh,” “aah,” and
“tuh.”

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.051
In dyslexics struggle to separate speech into
distinct phonemes, which makes it harder to

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:24.269
for them to connect specific sounds to specific
letters and can lead to confusion.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.639
Shaywitz gives the example of a girl who was
shown a picture of a volcano but she called

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.819
it a tornado.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.489
She simply couldn’t understand the differences
in the phonemes in those two words.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.579
So it seems there might be two components
to dyslexia, visual and auditory, and it might

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.629
be expressed differently in different people.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.329
Either way, one of the prevailing theories
of the condition point the finger at difficulty

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.980
processing phonemes.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.379
While dyslexia can cause lifelong learning
issues, some call for an end to it being classified

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.530
as a learning disability.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.430
While it might affect some aspects of school
life, kids are resilient.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.400
Many find ways around the challenges dyslexia
presents.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.239
And many go on to be successful.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.730
One study published in the journal Dyslexia
found that 35% of entrepreneurs identify as

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.730
dyslexic.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.930
That’s a huge increase from 10% of the general
population.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.900
The researchers found that some of the very
skills they learned to compensate for dyslexia,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.260
they’re great at speaking and delegating
tasks, enabled them to be effective leaders.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.209
While you might be an entrepreneur, it’s
never a bad thing to get help.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.270
Early intervention improves the outcomes for
those who struggle with dyslexia and there

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.199
might be even be a new font to help! Tara
gets the scoop on a new font for dyslexics

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:41.800
in this episode, right here.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.280
Alright guys, do you have dyslexia?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.400
Know someone who does?
