Hi I'm Paul Lewis and
I'm a Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:04.410
&gt;&gt; And I'm Cameron Pittman.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.390
I make front end web development
courses here at Udacity.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.880
We're here to help you develop
apps that run at a silky smooth

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.120
60 frames per second.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660
And you may think it's just JavaScript
that you need to worry about but

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.590
there's actually a lot
more to it than that.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.602
This course is about changing the way
that you approach performance issues.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.830
We're going to help you
look at the bigger picture.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.760
&gt;&gt; Okay let's play a game.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.460
This was made by my
colleague Jake Archibald and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.740
it's designed to show off problems with
frame rates and performance on the web.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.729
See these ships at the top?

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.420
They move smoothly.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.320
The ones at the bottom judder.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.458
The game is super simple,

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:41.692
shoot the juddering ships as quickly
as you can by clicking on them.

00:00:41.692 --> 00:00:44.230
You're going to have to spot
them amongst the smooth ones.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.590
&gt;&gt; Okay,
I'm going to shoot the juddering ships.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.980
That's a hard, weird British word.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.450
&gt;&gt; It's an amazing British word.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.170
&gt;&gt; I think you made it up.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.990
&gt;&gt; It's just English,
which means I can't be wrong.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.298
&gt;&gt; That's not true.

00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:58.620
&gt;&gt; That's very true.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.040
You are not doing well.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.825
&gt;&gt; That's not great.

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:03.660
Well anyway, I hit the wrong one, but
I hope you could do a lot better.
