00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
Now let's discuss some more details
of the various types of malware.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.520
The first is trap doors.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.800
Trap doors is also known as back doors.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.810
It is a sequence of instructions
in the host program or system

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.050
that has been embedded by a programmer
and can be activated by the attacker.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.400
Essentially, a trap door provides
a secret entry point to a program or

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.900
system, and this secret entry point

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.720
is typically known only to
the programmer and the attacker.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.600
A backdoor in a program typically works
by recognizing some special input

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.540
command, such as a sequence of
input specifically crafted, or

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.460
a special user ID.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.560
For example, an attacker can gain access
to a system through the back door

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.800
without providing the proper
user authentication.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.860
A famous benign version of a trap
door sometimes called an easter egg

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.900
is the fly simulator in the 1997
version of the Microsoft Excel program.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.180
The user when entering
undocumented series of commands,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.190
can gain access to a flight simulator
program embedded within Microsoft Excel.
