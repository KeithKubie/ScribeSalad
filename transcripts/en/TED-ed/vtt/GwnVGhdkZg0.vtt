00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.018
I'm really interested in making people understand

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:12.097
about sanitation issues in the developing world.

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:14.183
And I think if I were to give a TED Talk,

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.470
I would focus on that,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.430
on the 2.5 billion people

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.216
who don't have access to sanitation

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:23.797
and try to show solutions

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:25.684
and also how we should change

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:27.154
how we think about this problem

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:29.613
because it's really a big, big problem in the world.
