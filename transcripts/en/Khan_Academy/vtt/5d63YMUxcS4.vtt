00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.670
In the last video, we named
some fairly simple ethers.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.900
In this video, we're going to
think about slightly more

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.750
complicated ones.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.110
In particular, what happens if,
in the process of having

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.970
an ether, we actually have
a ring as opposed

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.500
to just a long chain?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.140
So you can imagine a
molecule that looks

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.060
something like this.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.500
You have your oxygen.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.860
On this side of the oxygen,
you have this carbon chain

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.030
right here.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.310
You have a carbon
chain like this.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.540
But then that chain bonds
back to the oxygen.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.590
So we have a ring here.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.180
It's not obvious how
to name this.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.540
You can't just look it this
side and call it methyl.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.250
And then that side, and call
it a methyl as well.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.440
It's the same side.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.040
It connects back to itself.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640
How do you name this
type of ether?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.060
What you do is, you
just number it.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.750
You number the longest carbon
chain, like we've always done

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.640
in the case of an alkane.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.970
We can start numbering here.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.240
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.550
If we just think about the
carbon chain by itself.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.940
We know if it's one carbon,
the prefix is meth-.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.670
Two, it's eth-.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.980
Three, it's prop-.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.260
Four, it's but-.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.850
So if this was just
a carbon chain, we

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.530
would call this butane.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.760
If we only looked at this carbon
chain right here, you

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.010
would call this butane.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.710
But obviously this
isn't butane.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.390
We have this oxygen that's
bonding to the 1 and 4 carbons

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.830
of the butane.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.830
To make that clear, we call
this-- Let me color code this

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.270
part right here, this
oxygen right there.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180
It's bonded to the 1
and the 4 carbon.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.090
So we call this 1 comma 4.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.820
And this is our new word
that we're going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.860
learn in this video.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.110
1,4-epoxybutane.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.500
And it doesn't just apply when
the ether forms a large ring.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.750
It can actually form a
little subset ring

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.390
on a regular chain.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.030
So you could imagine something
like this.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660
Let me draw a chain
of carbons.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.970
Let's say we have
five carbons.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just like that.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.840
Let's say that between this
carbon and this carbon,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.210
instead of having a double bond,
this carbon actually

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.420
bonds to an oxygen, which
then bonds to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270
this carbon over here.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.375
Obviously, every carbon has
four bonds, the ones that

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:31.900
we're not drawing, those
are hydrogens.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.970
How do we name this?

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.120
Well, same exact process.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.070
We actually start numbering the
chain closer to where the

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.730
oxygen is bonded.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.830
So we start numbering at
this end over here.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.440
So this is pentane.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.110
The oxygen is bonded to the
1 and the 2 carbons.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
So we call this
1,2-epoxypentane.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.140
1 comma 2-epoxypentane.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.910
Now, in the last video, I told
you that, in general, ethers

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.410
are fairly nonreactive.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.010
They actually make for
good solvents.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.000
But, what I've just drawn here
is a special case of ethers

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.070
called epoxides.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.480
When you just have this three
atom chain right here, where

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.180
it's two carbons
and an oxygen.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.930
This is a special case of an
ether called an epoxide.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.660
This is called an epoxide.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.380
And this, unlike most ethers,
is very reactive.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.330
Another way you could think
about it, it's very unstable.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.010
This is very reactive.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.250
Sometimes people consider these
separate from ethers.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.970
The reason why they're very
reactive, is this three member

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.370
ring right here.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.260
There's a lot of strain
on these bonds.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.350
These electrons, these bonds
don't like to be that close to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.730
each other.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.200
If you actually tried to make
it with an actual model set

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.390
with molecules, you would have
trouble making it bend enough

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.900
to actually make this bond.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.110
So this is highly, highly,
highly unstable.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.560
There's actually an alternate
way to name epoxides.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.070
The alternate way, so this is
a completely legitimate way.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.300
You could name it just like
an ether with a ring.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.380
This is 1,2-epoxypentane.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.020
But the alternate way is
to pretend like you had

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.030
a double bond here.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.450
That instead of this oxygen
here, you had a double bond.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.340
If you had a double bond here,
this thing would be called,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.350
depending how you want
to name it, it

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.600
could be called 1-pentene.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.170
That's if there was not this
oxygen here, but if there was

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.070
a double bond here.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.350
1-pentene would look
like this.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.690
This is the 1 carbon.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.110
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.250
This is what 1-petene
looks like.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.490
We've learned that many,
many, many videos ago.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.800
Sometimes it's called
pent-1-ene, depending on which

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.260
convention.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.760
This is the more common one.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.490
We have this oxygen here,
instead of this double bond.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.170
Instead of calling it just
1-pentene, we call it

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.420
1-pentene oxide.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.410
Just like that.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.340
So both of these are the names
for the same exact molecule.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.850
This makes it clear that
it's an epoxide.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.230
That's kind of the special ether
that is more reactive.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.870
This is just the general way
that we name any type of

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.340
cyclic ether.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.770
So let's just do one more just
to make the point clear.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.200
Let's have a cycle branching
off of a cycle.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.100
Let's have an epoxide
off of another ring.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.860
Just to make the point clear.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.090
These aren't too hard to name.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.340
But the first time you seen
them, a little daunting.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.020
Let's say we have a cyclohexane
ring right here.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.170
So this is cyclohexane.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.900
But let's say we have a little
epoxy branching off of it,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.940
just like this.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.080
We have that going on.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.830
If we wanted to make it clear
that this is an epoxide, we

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.660
would essentially pretend.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.610
First pretend that this
is just a double bond.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.150
If this was just a double
bond, this would be

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.400
cyclohexene.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.830
If this oxygen wasn't there,
and instead we just had a

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.330
double bond here.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.130
You actually don't have to
specify the number when you

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.050
only have one double
bonded cyclohexene.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.690
Because it could have been
anywhere, and it would have

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.640
essentially been the
same molecule.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.720
But since we have this oxygen
here, instead of a double bond

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.940
that's bonding to both of these
carbons, we call this

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.605
cyclohexene oxide.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.530
This part, right here,
makes us name

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.040
this cyclohexene oxide.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:57.170
Or if we wanted to just name
this as a traditional ether,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:08.910
we would just name this
cyclohexane and put the epoxy

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.160
in front of it.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.640
Either of these are valid.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.100
Once again, you don't
have to number it.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.320
Because you could call it,
1,2-epoxycyclohexane, if you

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.930
made this the 1 or
the 2 carbon.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.880
But you know it's going to
be on adjacent carbons.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.610
And it could have really been
on any of these two.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.160
It could have been on the 3 and
the 4, and it would have

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.780
essentially been the
same molecule.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.850
So this actually makes it
clear exactly what the

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.150
molecular structure of
the molecule is.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.220
So anyway, I thought you
would enjoy that.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.920
And in the next video,
I told you that

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.270
epoxides are reactive.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.400
So I'll actually show
you a reaction

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.650
dealing with epoxides.
