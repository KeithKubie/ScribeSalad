00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.131
Physicists,

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:09.562
air traffic controllers,

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.222
and video game creators

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:14.461
all have at least one thing in common:

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.752
vectors.

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:19.092
What exactly are they,
and why do they matter?

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:23.273
To answer,
we first need to understand scalars.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.161
A scalar is a quantity with magnitude.

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.212
It tells us how much 
of something there is.

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:31.392
The distance between you and a bench,

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:34.722
and the volume and temperature
of the beverage in your cup

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.642
are all described by scalars.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:42.983
Vector quantities also have a magnitude
plus an extra piece of information,

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:44.459
direction.

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:45.972
To navigate to your bench,

00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:49.953
you need to know how far away it is
and in what direction,

00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:53.163
not just the distance,
but the displacement.

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.853
What makes vectors special
and useful in all sorts of fields

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.852
is that they don't change 
based on perspective

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:03.342
but remain invariant 
to the coordinate system.

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:04.763
What does that mean?

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:07.535
Let's say you and a friend 
are moving your tent.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:11.634
You stand on opposite sides
so you're facing in opposite directions.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:15.845
Your friend moves two steps to the right
and three steps forward

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:19.454
while you move two steps to the left
and three steps back.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.223
But even though it seems 
like you're moving differently,

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.785
you both end up moving 
the same distance in the same direction

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.414
following the same vector.

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:30.294
No matter which way you face,

00:01:30.294 --> 00:01:33.284
or what coordinate system you place
over the camp ground,

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:35.635
the vector doesn't change.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.168
Let's use the familiar 
Cartesian coordinate system

00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:40.774
with its x and y axes.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:43.794
We call these two directions
our coordinate basis

00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:46.974
because they're used to describe 
everything we graph.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.765
Let's say the tent starts at the origin
and ends up over here at point B.

00:01:51.765 --> 00:01:54.005
The straight arrow connecting
the two points

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.994
is the vector from the origin to B.

00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:59.506
When your friend thinks about
where he has to move,

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:03.847
it can be written mathematically
as 2x + 3y,

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:07.213
or, like this, which is called an array.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:08.856
Since you're facing the other way,

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:12.476
your coordinate basis
points in opposite directions,

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:15.371
which we can call x prime
and y prime,

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:18.975
and your movement 
can be written like this,

00:02:18.975 --> 00:02:21.725
or with this array.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:25.150
If we look at the two arrays,
they're clearly not the same,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.635
but an array alone doesn't completely
describe a vector.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:32.646
Each needs a basis to give it context,

00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:34.397
and when we properly assign them,

00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:38.465
we see that they are in fact
describing the same vector.

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:41.656
You can think of elements in the array
as individual letters.

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.715
Just as a sequence of letters
only becomes a word

00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:47.595
in the context of a particular language,

00:02:47.595 --> 00:02:52.966
an array acquires meaning as a vector
when assigned a coordinate basis.

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:57.246
And just as different words
in two languages can convey the same idea,

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:01.785
different representations from two bases
can describe the same vector.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:05.326
The vector is the essence 
of what's being communicated,

00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.176
regardless of the language 
used to describe it.

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:12.528
It turns out that scalars also share
this coordinate invariance property.

00:03:12.528 --> 00:03:18.048
In fact, all quantities with this property
are members of a group called tensors.

00:03:18.048 --> 00:03:22.637
Various types of tensors contain different
amounts of information.

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:26.659
Does that mean there's something that
can convey more information than vectors?

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.267
Absolutely.

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:29.897
Say you're designing a video game,

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:33.648
and you want to realistically model
how water behaves.

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:36.558
Even if you have forces acting
in the same direction

00:03:36.558 --> 00:03:38.187
with the same magnitude,

00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:42.908
depending on how they're oriented,
you might see waves or whirls.

00:03:42.908 --> 00:03:47.720
When force, a vector, is combined with
another vector that provides orientation,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.917
we have the physical quantity
called stress,

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.479
which is an example 
of a second order tensor.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:59.729
These tensors are also used outside of
video games for all sorts of purposes,

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.498
including scientific simulations,

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:02.818
car designs,

00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:04.488
and brain imaging.

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:09.149
Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family
present us with a relatively simple way

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.837
of making sense of complex ideas
and interactions,

00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:16.868
and as such, they're a prime example of
the elegance, beauty,

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:20.011
and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.
