00:00:00.508 --> 00:00:04.724
 Now the story of a young man teaches mathematics to the world 

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:07.924
 Radio News Or Spencer Michaels reported on the report 

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:11.319
 Salman Khan: If this is a quadratic equation 

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:13.322
 We try to find zeros in it 

00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:16.232
 This voice that is far from the body is heard every day 

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:20.254
 By tens of thousands of students who have difficulties in mathematics 

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:22.649
 Whether in the United States or in the world. 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.429
 Salman: What is the result of squared +4 +4 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.282
 Well, this is a Q + 2 multiplied by Q +2 

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:33.142
 Salman Khan, 33, has recently quit his job 

00:00:33.142 --> 00:00:37.171
 As an analyst to devote himself to unpaid work 

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.339
 Teaching Mathematics Online. 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.106
 Salman: Welcome to the lecture basics of collection 

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:44.839
 I know what you think 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.780
 These are cancers or cancer cells. 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.099
 When investors provide mortgage-backed securities 

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:56.071
 He has published 1200 lessons on YouTube that appear online 

00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:01.614
 Topics range from the basics of the collection and the book of Calucus advanced to science and financial sciences 

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.044
 All are free 

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:07.614
 He asked: Introduction to Trigonometry - This is where I teach people about trigonometric functions 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.624
 This is one of the most popular videos. 

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:13.026
 It has been viewed 179,000 times 

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:17.238
 This is the "pocket" of the cosmos, the "contact". 

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:24.251
 Salman Khan lives in the Silicon Valley, California, with his wife who is suffering from pneumonia at Stanford University and their new baby 

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:31.625
 The idea of ​​the Khan Academy was crystallized four years ago when one of his relatives knew how to convert kilograms to grams 

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.862
 A large number of American students face problems with mathematics; 

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.465
 Studies show they are lagging behind their counterparts in Asia 

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.591
 And Europe in mathematics and science. 

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.137
 With Khan's help, his relative got good grades in mathematics 

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:49.209
 Eventually he got a new career exploiting feelings of concern around the world. 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.697
 He records his lessons now from a converted cupboard in the back of his bedroom. 

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.574
 And never expose his face or body 

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.499
 They feel as if there is a sound in their heads 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:59.725
 And to watch it 

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.140
 You feel there was someone above your shoulder and talking with your ears 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.922
 Reversing the fact that there is a teacher standing on a patient at a distance from you 

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.762
 I am sorry for my lesson with cough 

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:11.173
 But now I want to continue with 45-45-90 Triangles. 

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:15.610
 Although he is not the first person to teach online 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.291
 His simple operations attracted more attention than most university sites, and his fame has spread 

00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:26.988
 The Castilla School in Paolo Alto invited Khan to speak to the students 

00:02:26.988 --> 00:02:29.883
 He contacted the students' body directly 

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.950
 Tell me what you do not know 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.831
 Divide decimal numbers still difficult on some 

00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.807
 If dividing decimal numbers is difficult for you, you are not alone 

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:43.145
 The feature of decimal numbers is one of the things that nobody would like to admit that they forget how to solve them. 

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:47.367
 It ripens pride in its expanding online audience 

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.667
 There are increasing numbers of viewers 

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:58.004
 The number is now 100,000 per month and 40,000 per day. 

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:03.764
 Reporter: The concept of short, repetitive lessons was attracted by freshman sophomore junior Brigitte 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.049
 Which admitted that it had encountered a problem with seventh-grade algebra. 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:14.928
 I think the teachers are good but they can not come up with a style that is perfect for everyone 

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:19.631
 But I like the concept of knowing something in class 

00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.713
 Then I can press Stop or Return 

00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:25.497
 In fact get a deeper understanding. 

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:31.144
 Shy students who do not ask questions in class can benefit more from Khan's videos 

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:35.226
 Says Kimberly Cap, who teaches mathematics in Castalia 

00:03:35.226 --> 00:03:38.144
 His lessons are not an alternative to class 

00:03:38.144 --> 00:03:41.591
 I do not imagine that there is a perfect alternative to the work we do 

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.607
 And the quality of the dialogue between students and teachers. 

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:50.330
 But Khan believes classrooms and classrooms may have their limits 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.935
 Originally, he did short lessons because of the limitations of YouTube 

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.797
 Now he believes that the shorter the better 

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:00.621
 Some researchers have told me that you are not aware 

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:05.640
 Ten minutes - we have done studies on how long a person can maintain a high concentration 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.267
 Anything more than ten minutes may lose your focus 

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.894
 I thought we all had this experience when we sat in college 

00:04:09.894 --> 00:04:13.748
 Where you can be with a professor for about ten or fifteen minutes, and then lose concentration 

00:04:13.748 --> 00:04:16.488
 Many math students agree with this view 

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:20.574
 I talked through the internet with Cody Woodward in Anchorage, Alaska, 

00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:23.361
 Which uses Khan's lessons in college. 

00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:25.424
 You helped me very, very much 

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.428
 I raised my grades in mathematics 

00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:30.512
 I learned a lot too. 

00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:35.482
 Online education, be Khan Academy, or registered university lectures 

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:40.080
 It is possible to revolutionize education in distant places in the Third World 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.126
 Access to quality education is often not available 

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:50.002
 This is hoped, a software programmer at Cisco 

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:55.219
 He and his colleagues volunteer in a "possible world" and work on their holidays 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.874
 They bring education to Africa and India for beginners 

00:04:58.878 --> 00:05:02.914
 When Neil and Megha Khan traveled to Ethiopia 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:06.889
 They found thousands of new computers sitting without work 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.045
 Because she could not connect to the Internet, so she could not get instructions online. 

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:16.817
 Neil Satisfied: It's great that many of these resources are put on a single local server 

00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:20.916
 So that we can bring it to universities, colleges and social centers 

00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:22.479
 We arrived through the Khan Academy, 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.694
 We contacted him by e-mail and asked him if we could reproduce some of the material on our servers 

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.030
 He was very willing to help us 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.048
 Jain Mega: You'll be surprised at how fast children learn these things 

00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:36.181
 So they are not curious about them 

00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:39.661
 They have heard of it and are happy to use it 

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.911
 For Khan, the teaching of mathematics, science and finance is only the beginning. 

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:49.182
 He is willing to expand his own YouTube network to include anything he knows 

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:53.176
 I want to do everything, I want to work history, I want to work rules, and I want to work every subject 

00:05:53.176 --> 00:05:59.237
 So far, except for some ad imports, he is donating his time and equipment 

00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:01.014
 It is a one-man process. 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:12.909
 But it has grown substantially, it will begin to seek external support to maintain the growth of the Academy
