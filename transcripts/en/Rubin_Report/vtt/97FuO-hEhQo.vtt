00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.740
<v 1>joining me today are two of the guys who pulled off the biggest socal hoke</v>

3
00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.810
since,
well,
the original Soko hoax.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.780
Peter goes in and James Lindsay,
welcome to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.900
Thanks for having a solid.
I am happy to have you guys here.

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.180
You're an old pro around here.
It's good to be back.
Yeah.
Pleasure.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.030
You're a first time I read enough.
I'm all new.
Well then with that spirit,

8
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:29.510
I'm going to ask you the first question for people who have no idea what the

9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:31.220
original socal hoax is,

10
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:33.920
because we're obviously going to spend a lot of time talking about what you guys

11
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.090
have done in the last year.
What was the original socal hooks when people say,
oh,

12
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:40.160
they did a socal hoax.
What is that?

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.110
<v 2>So Alan socal was a physicist,</v>

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.230
or is a physicist at Nyu and he in the nineties 95 [inaudible] 96 he was looking

15
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.980
at this postmodern cultural criticism and he was reading what they're doing and

16
00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:55.280
they're using math words or using physics ideas and terms and they're just

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.320
making up stuff,
you know,
like the,
some theorem about any,

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.980
some theorem about equality or inequalities and mathematics.
And they'll say,
oh,

19
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.900
well,
there's obviously means that there's inequalities and you know,

20
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.490
run with the pun on inequality and say some social stuff about it.

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.130
And he started reading some of the stuff that they republican or you thought,

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:14.960
there's no way,
not only are they abusing science,

23
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.090
there's no way that even understand what they're saying.

24
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.360
And he wanted to check that out.
So he wrote this paper,

25
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.340
transgressing the boundaries toward something.
What is it?

26
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.020
A hermeneutics truly transformative hermeneutic of quantum gravity.

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.560
<v 1>That sounds very impressive.</v>

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 2>It's to put it more simply wanted to argue that quantum gravity as a social</v>

29
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:33.950
construct of course.

30
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:37.470
And so he did this thing and he wrote this complete nonsense paper,

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.960
what they call a Pastiche,

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.100
where he just took quotes from the famous postmodernists and filled in with

33
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:46.940
nonsense and use lots of mathematical and physical,
you know,

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.150
scientific words and misuse them to say goofy things.

35
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.360
And he sent it to a preeminent,

36
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.520
a social commentary postponed or social commentary journal at Duke University

37
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.810
Social Tech called social text.
And uh,

38
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.330
their editors accepted it and published it.
Um,

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
and then the same day they published it,
he came out and said,
ah,
you know,

40
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:09.220
this was a fake,
he published an x was a article about it and said,

41
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:10.160
this is why I did.
It.

42
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.520
Ended up writing a bestselling New York Times best selling book called

43
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:14.570
fashionable nonsense,

44
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.620
talking about all these guys use these fashionable terms and just say the right

45
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:22.790
political things and it's all nonsense.
It doesn't really mean anything.

46
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.100
And so that was sort of the state of,
you know,

47
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:29.900
what was going on and postmodern cultural theory in the 1990s and he struck a

48
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.690
big blow against it.
Big Controversy,
New York Times,

49
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.630
front page story all over the world.

50
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.600
People dumping on him and some people supporting him,
some people dumping on him.

51
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.810
He was,
he was a big mess.
Yeah.
So that was the original hoax.

52
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.520
And he was trying to show that,
you know,

53
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.920
they were abusing scientific terminology,

54
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.480
taking out of the scientific context and using it to make political points for,

55
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.890
of course,
academic leftist,
kind of a fashionable points of view.

56
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.060
<v 1>Right?
So this is a great precursor to everything that you guys have done,
right?</v>

57
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 3>It's so consistent with the conversations that we've been having for years.</v>

58
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.120
And so many of the conversations I'm having on the show,
this,

59
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.380
this postmodern leftist orthodoxy,

60
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.700
it's actually nonsense.
And,
and,

61
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.710
and you guys set out to prove it was nonsense.

62
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:22.711
We did the first time we wrote a paper that conceptual penis as a social

63
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:26.020
construct and we argue that among other things,

64
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.760
penises are responsible for climate change.
And that,
that paper,

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.680
now that's true,
but the rest of the paper was completely relevant.

66
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.630
It came under considerable,
uh,
criticism.

67
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.020
And so we took a look at that criticism and we said,
okay,

68
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.830
let's see if we can replicate this on a grand scale.
So to be clear,

69
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.980
that was the first one that you did where you were trying to yeah,

70
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.380
I did that one.
Yeah.
But that,
that was the first one that you guys did,

71
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.930
that you were trying to get through this system.

72
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.880
The Gates are disbursed to show that they couldn't distinguish between made up

73
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
silliness and their own scholarship.
And then we,

74
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.910
we took a look at that criticism and we decided to replicate that on a massive

75
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:11.280
scale.
Yeah.
So we wrote 20 papers in 10 months.
And for context,

76
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.840
these are papers that go to peer review journals,

77
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.400
seven papers in seven years.
His tenure at most major universities.

78
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.280
And we wrote with the help of Helen Pluck rose from reo magazine who is in the

79
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.300
UK,
is not here now obviously,
uh,
we,

80
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.310
we had seven of those published or accepted for publication and the Wall Street

81
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.910
Journal caught us.
We had seven more under review or we were going to resubmit.

82
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.730
Okay.
So let's pause there for a second.
Tell me,

83
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.210
let's just go through some of the greatest hits of these papers that you got

84
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:44.950
through.
I mean they're,
they're quite brilliant,

85
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.380
but are there any that you each like to tee off?

86
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.170
<v 2>Oh my gosh,
all of them.
Yes.
Yeah.
So the,
the,</v>

87
00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:55.040
the most famous of the papers as far as people having heard about it was one

88
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:58.520
that Peter wrote the first draft of and that was the,

89
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.570
the dog humping paper as well referred to it.
Um,
it was the paper,

90
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:03.800
what was it called?
Um,

91
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.180
the title where performance in Rape Culture and Portland dog park or something

92
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.340
like that,
uh,
that you can't quite remember.

93
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:16.010
The name sort of shows you the absurdity of what you've done.

94
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.270
Like they all have like the serious subtitle and some of them have easy to

95
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:23.630
remember.
Funny Real Title Park is what we,
we all,

96
00:05:23.631 --> 00:05:26.120
we gave him all nicknames are code names or whatever throughout.

97
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:28.430
So the really the nitty gritty part,

98
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:33.431
like a human performativity in human reactions to Queer performativity in rape

99
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:37.160
culture and urban dog parks or whatever.
That's all.

100
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.690
It's all just kind of scholarly mishmash.
It's hard to keep up with,

101
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:45.260
but that paper is sort of be greatest hit because not only was it accepted for

102
00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.750
publication,
not only was it published,

103
00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:52.280
but the journal deemed that it was one of the best papers in feminist geography

104
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.300
and gave it a special recognition was gonna make a big deal of,

105
00:05:56.301 --> 00:06:00.140
it should lay out a little more specifically what it is that you were saying

106
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.100
because it was such an important academic original point of that paper was to

107
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:08.330
argue that rape culture is a big problem and the best way that we could

108
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.750
intervene upon that would be to train men the way we train dogs.

109
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.200
And so that was the original concept and the idea was we're going to start with

110
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.840
our conclusion and try to get there.
How do we get to train men?

111
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.890
Like we train dogs.

112
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.030
And so I told Pete because he takes his dogs to the dog park every day.
I said,

113
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:24.920
Pete,
use your experience from the dog park.

114
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.010
Maybe we get a dog training manual and try to figure it out from there.

115
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.900
And so he goes off the dog training manual thing.
Just wasn't working.

116
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.880
So he just starts writing his experience.

117
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.720
His experience in absurd made up experience at the dog park about he sits at the

118
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.100
dog park four or five hours a day,

119
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.880
but never in heavy rain and observes dogs and they're,

120
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:51.050
they're humping behavior and their fight closely observed the genitals of close

121
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.990
to $10,000.
Yeah,
inspected genitals.
I am committed,
I,

122
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.210
unless it's raining and then in turn Reigate their owners as their sexual

123
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.890
orientation.
But we needed something else in there,
you know,
like choice slides,

124
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.180
dog parks are petri dishes for Canine rape cultures.
But we need something else.

125
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.220
And again,
the trick to this thing is what's morally fashionable?

126
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.480
Who is the most depression variables?
So I thought,
well,
you know,

127
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:21.950
a black female criminologists so I like googled black female criminology.

128
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.220
I just looked at Wikipedia and it was like I found someone,
I'm like,
okay,

129
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.710
let's look at this through a lens of black female criminology.

130
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:32.030
They can't reject it because they'd be saying that there's something wrong

131
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.810
there.
There'd be not validating someone's lived experience.

132
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.960
So we looked at the whole thing through black feminist criminology bulletin

133
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.120
published.

134
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.150
So we've got seven of those and are accepted with seven more than mine come

135
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:46.120
three right.
Wait,

136
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.610
let's not gloss over that one cause this is actually incredible what you did.

137
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.941
Okay.

138
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:53.900
Well you want to go through the levels by far the most difficult of the papers

139
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.040
so you can incredible I guess is fair because it was really hard.

140
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.300
We had like proper internal meltdowns trying to figure out how to make this
work.

141
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.740
Um,
we took a chapter of mine comp,
uh,

142
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.170
Hitler's auto ethnography as a manifesto.

143
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.830
It's an auto ethnography for the first half.

144
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.880
And so we were flipping through a trial.

145
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.300
We thought the original thought behind that really was,

146
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.140
I think Helen suggested that we should take some awful old thing.

147
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.910
It wasn't specified that there'd be my comp yet,

148
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.750
like a theologian just railing on something or whatever,

149
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:31.751
some famous old tracks that's just gross and then rewrite it as postmodern,

150
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.910
a activist,
progressive activism or whatever.

151
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.190
And so it naturally led very quickly to mind comp.
That's,

152
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.460
that's the example.

153
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.350
So I'm reading through mine comp and then chapter 11 is the big home run

154
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:48.200
chapter.
It's like that's,
I think the,
you know,

155
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:52.520
something railing on the Jews shows up 400 times in chapter 11 alone.

156
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.040
And it was like,
Whoa,
that's too extreme.
Can't actually use that.

157
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.020
Flip to chapter 12
this is where Hitler makes us call for.

158
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.400
How are we going to organize the Nazi party and what sacrifices are necessary?

159
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.500
And I'm reading through this,
I'm thinking,
oh my gosh,
this is it.

160
00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.690
So I copy and pasted that straight out of off the internet onto a word document.

161
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:13.530
And I went through and everywhere it said,
our movement,
the party,
whatever,

162
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.020
took that out,
stuck in intersectional feminism.

163
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.960
And then I started making the sentences make sense around that.

164
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.100
And then we went through and changed all the wording just a little so it get

165
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:28.101
past plagiarism and that gave us this kind of unreadable document that was just

166
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:32.490
as transliteration of of Hitler's chapter 12 about how to be Nazis.

167
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.390
And then I think it's incredible.
Then we just added in theory.
Yeah.

168
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.990
So Helen went through primarily and was like,
Oh wow,
this reminds me,

169
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.030
she was reading a lot about choice feminism,

170
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.270
which is that if a woman makes her own choices,
that's feminist,

171
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.660
which seems like a pretty reasonable approach to feminism if you want to go with

172
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:52.440
one.
And so Helen was looking at how they were criticizing choice feminism and

173
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.990
thought that might be a good way to go with this.
So she's like,
wow,

174
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:59.190
this looks like this,
this one paper,
this looks like another one.

175
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.580
This will fit here.
And then I went through some of the intersectional,
uh,

176
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.970
you know,
critical race feminism scholarship,
the black feminism scholarship.

177
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:09.180
I was like,
Oh wow,
this sounds like that,
this sounds like that.

178
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.800
And we just started weaving in theory in between pieces of Hitler while we tried

179
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.040
to maintain the tone and flavor that Hitler was putting out.

180
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:22.041
So Hillary lays out of 14 point plan to design the Nazi party and we condensed

181
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:23.964
it down to eight,

182
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.870
reordered them so that they kind of made sense in some kind of a theoretical

183
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.080
structure.
And we sent it off to feminist theory,
a journal,

184
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.190
and we thought there's no way.
You know,
we just wanted to see what would happen.

185
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.270
We had no thinking that this would possibly get in and feminist theory,

186
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.070
pure reviewed it.
They rejected it,

187
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:44.040
but they peer reviewed it and then all of a sudden that was right when we went

188
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.850
to Portland in February last year and it was like this is a big deal that they

189
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:49.800
took it to peer review because we're going to get comments.

190
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.760
So the goal of that paper became get reviewer comments on the section of mine

191
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:55.740
competency.
When they say about it,
when they review it,

192
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:56.970
still assuming they reject it.

193
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.900
We took those comments to feminist theory gave us saying,
oh,
it's too liberal.

194
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.900
You're trying to universalize feminism and that means one woman can speak for

195
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:08.850
another woman.
It's too liberal.
That's actually,
yeah,
that's my business,

196
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.240
isn't it?
It's so,
so then we took those,
those comments.

197
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.530
We modified it a little bit.

198
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:16.890
We massage it to fit for a social work journal by working in social work stuff.

199
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.130
We send it off to a feminist social work journal and the Feminist Social Work

200
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.530
Journal gave us a few more comments.
You need to make problem,
you need to do,

201
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.640
make allyship problematic because if I claim I'm an ally now I have a power

202
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.710
dynamic with the person I'm allied with.

203
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:33.080
So problem with that slave that would be better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Something.

204
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.300
And so we did that and we sent it in back to them and they accepted it and it

205
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:43.290
was like probably days away from actually being published when Wall Street

206
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.123
Journal broke their story.

207
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.660
But they accepted this rewritten chapter of mine comp that stayed true.

208
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:49.381
And the key to that,

209
00:11:49.381 --> 00:11:53.920
what really happened with that is that Hitler was pushing the politics of Hitler

210
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.190
grew to power because he was pushing politics of grievance.
Germany got screwed.

211
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.250
We are going to rise back up to a great Germany,
blah,
Blah Blah Grievance,

212
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:01.330
grievance,
grievance,
grievance,

213
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.320
what we called our stuff that we were targeting grievance studies because they

214
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:09.340
study social grievances through not German identity,
your national identity,

215
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:13.720
but through a personal identity,
race,
gender,

216
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.440
sexuality and so on.
And so the politics of Grievance,

217
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.550
we're very appealing in a feminist social work journal.

218
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.020
That grievance can go into social work and been informed social workers on how

219
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:31.021
to make feminism more solidified to improve social work outcomes.

220
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.300
And that's where it gets really scary.
Right?
Cause that's a practical field.

221
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.590
<v 3>Right.
So,
okay.
So before we go too far on that,</v>

222
00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:42.240
let's just back up for one second and what sort of led you to and Helen to

223
00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:45.900
decide to do this in the first place.
So my audience is pretty familiar with you,

224
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:49.650
but maybe you want to give a little bit of why,
why you,
why did,

225
00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:52.030
why is it that you said,
this is what we have to do to,

226
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.830
to sort of strike this thing at the knees.
So they,

227
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.730
people had recognized what the problem was.
The problem being postmodernism,

228
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:02.640
the problem being a corrupt corruption in scholarship.

229
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:07.641
The problem being that many disciplines have lost a focus on truth.

230
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.380
They thought they already had the truth.

231
00:13:10.381 --> 00:13:13.180
So they placed an agenda before the truth.
Uh,

232
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.040
and we're deeply concerned about speech issues on campus.

233
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:22.310
We're deeply concerned about what the fact that kids in class couldn't view

234
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:28.230
alternative opinions.
And I myself don't hold those opinions.

235
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.700
I'm not a conservative,
I'm not Christian obviously,

236
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.380
but I wanted,

237
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.210
I want people to have the opportunity to voice their ideas and then other people

238
00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:42.000
to have the opportunity to respond to those ideas.

239
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.510
And so we took a look at this and we traced it back to a single body of

240
00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:53.580
scholarship,
basically anything that has the name studies behind it.

241
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.570
And so what had happened is that these people have,

242
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.600
these folks have taken over the educational administration and they're

243
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.330
institutionalizing ideas found in this body of literature and it's absolutely

244
00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:11.430
toxic to us.
It's poisoning us all.

245
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.940
And we wanted to take a look at those canons of literature,

246
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.630
which is actually when I called you.

247
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.360
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah.
You called me that day and you were like,
am I crazy?
Am I going crazy?</v>

248
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.550
And I was like,
probably carry on Pete.
And so continued.
Yeah,

249
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.790
please go on.
And so he said,
he said,
you know,
I've been looking at to,

250
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.900
to give a little more context,
actually we were,
before I get to that we were in,

251
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.980
we were in looking at social media and a lot of the people that are trying to

252
00:14:39.981 --> 00:14:42.140
have mostly on the left or try,
you know,

253
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.820
centrist liberals are trying to have honest conversations about issues about

254
00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:49.580
race,
sexuality and so on.
And what happens?
Boom,
racist,
sexist,

255
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.750
Sam Harris blasted for being a sexist over some comments you made.

256
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.510
I know a little bit about this a little bit.
Do you?
Uh,

257
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.070
and getting blasted for being a racist because of the Islamophobia thing and the

258
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:03.380
grows on racist moment with Ben Affleck,
you know,
the,

259
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:05.150
all this stuff was going on.
We're like,
what's going on?

260
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:06.590
And you try to have conversations,
you know,

261
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:10.520
with like Sam Harris is a reasonable guy.
He's an honest broker.
What's happening?

262
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.670
And we start getting called racist for talking about it.

263
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:16.130
And then every time it comes back to this,
we'll,

264
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:18.320
racism doesn't mean what the dictionary says.

265
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.760
Racism doesn't mean what you think it means.
Only white people can be racist,

266
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.830
only men can be sexist and it has to have structural power behind it and all of

267
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:29.600
this stuff.
And we're like,
that's a peculiar definition and maybe,

268
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:33.290
okay system systemic racism is a thing.
It's real.
Okay fine.

269
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.120
But that's not the whole story here.
You know,
you're using a particular term,

270
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:42.680
you're,
you're meaning a particular term by a very general term racism.

271
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.180
<v 1>Systemic racism is real.
What do you mean?</v>

272
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.440
<v 2>What I'm meaning is the,
certainly there,</v>

273
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:52.441
there are structural forces that we have for decades or centuries possibly at

274
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:57.300
least in the United States,
disenfranchise certain individuals.
We,
we,

275
00:15:57.301 --> 00:15:59.150
there was going way back,
we have slavery,

276
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:02.450
we come out of slavery and then there was segregation and there were Jim crow

277
00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:04.700
laws and we come out of that and there was,
you know,

278
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:08.930
systematically screwing over,
you know,
the housing markets in certain cities.

279
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:10.730
Chicago was particularly bad for that.

280
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.560
So there's this kind of ghettoization of it and there's all kinds of stuff like

281
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:16.670
that.
Heather have created a,

282
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.210
I think that the scholars are correct to say that there's something of an

283
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:24.320
unlevel playing field going on.
There've been great improvements.

284
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.090
However,
there are still some issues.
There are still some,
some concerns there.

285
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:28.341
You know,

286
00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:32.270
they do these studies where they put out things and they put a white sounding

287
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:35.710
name or a black sounding name and then that doesn't come out clean.
Those,

288
00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:36.560
there's a bias there.

289
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.930
<v 1>Right.
So this just for the record,
I mean this is where I would,</v>

290
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.200
where I've gotten into that moment with Larry elder that you mentioned before.

291
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.290
I don't know.
I personally wouldn't call that systemic anymore.

292
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.910
I don't think it's in the system anymore.

293
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.110
That may be individual dipole act in a racist way or in a sexist way or

294
00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:54.650
something like that.
But that doesn't mean there isn't historical

295
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.760
<v 2>and it,
so everybody got it.
I don't think that there is a institutional thing,</v>

296
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.580
whether it comes down,
I don't know whether there are issues,

297
00:17:02.581 --> 00:17:05.250
say within the police or whatever that may be.

298
00:17:05.251 --> 00:17:07.490
There are lots of racist cops and maybe there aren't,
I don't know.

299
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.390
But whether it's codify it or not,

300
00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:11.910
I don't think that that problem where it's not codafide anymore.

301
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.850
I just think it was coded by that distinction.
Yeah,

302
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.780
and the historical hangovers and et cetera.
There's a lot to it,
but sure,

303
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.920
I can accept the idea like let's just run with the idea that this whole

304
00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:26.640
structural racism thing is a thing.
Well,
when you say racism,

305
00:17:26.641 --> 00:17:29.050
but you mean structural racism,
you're cheating.
You're,

306
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.620
you're saying one word that means something to almost everybody,

307
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.400
but you mean something really narrow and specific by him.
We see this was,

308
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.740
you know,
racism.
We saw it with sexism.
See it with diversity.

309
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:39.420
You see it with inclusion.
You see it with equity.

310
00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:40.980
You see word after word after word,

311
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.500
and this is how we traced back to the literature.

312
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.340
It's like where are these kind of odd ball definitions coming from?
Oh,

313
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.180
and s at the time we thought sociology and so this is where Pete calls me one

314
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.850
day we started looking at this literature and he calls me,
he's like,
am I crazy?

315
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:54.684
Am I losing it?

316
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.200
I look at this scholarship and I was just talking to somebody about it and they

317
00:17:58.201 --> 00:18:01.140
didn't get it.
So help me out here.
I look at this scholarship and it,

318
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:06.230
it's like this gender studies scholarship plays the exact same role for gender

319
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:10.410
scholars that the Bible Place for Christians at the Quran plays for for Muslims.

320
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.510
Is that what's going on here?
And I would,

321
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.030
I had just written this book or was in the process,

322
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:16.000
I don't remember exactly the date.

323
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.740
I had written this book trying to look at the psychological motivations behind

324
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:21.480
belief in God and what people mean by that.
And I was like,

325
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:23.760
actually I think you are exactly on it.
You know,

326
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:29.060
because the idea of God represents things like morality and purpose and

327
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.760
community and various things to different people.
And here you have,

328
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:35.640
they all religions,
all have scriptures are nearly all have scriptures.

329
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:38.010
I think you actually do have the same thing here.

330
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:42.390
You have this special revelation going on where people are able to put down

331
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.710
their opinions and somehow it gets legitimized through a moral process in

332
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:50.130
religion.
It's,
you know,
a holiness,
you're holy enough.
You put down your opinion,

333
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:53.460
your Augustan,
you put down your confessions and now it becomes sacred writ.

334
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.880
And in this case it's through this kind of weakness in the,

335
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:04.551
in the progressive moral architecture that allows for people never want to be

336
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:09.990
even not just do they not want to be racist,
they want to be considered racist,

337
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:12.330
they want to be accidentally secret,
considered racist.

338
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.220
They want to be complicit and racism.

339
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.820
And there's in this whole thing to where this is such a huge taboo,

340
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:21.660
they're so afraid to become racist that they've let this stuff past to where

341
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:26.661
people can write theoretical prejudices and opinions in as if they are

342
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.990
scholarship.

343
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.350
And then it gets validated and published in the peer reviewed literature.

344
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.310
Now there's a study that says,
right,
right,
whatever it is

345
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.340
<v 3>to that point,
to this study.
And they say,
so that's,
they don't need faith.
They,</v>

346
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:39.540
they point to this,

347
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:44.070
this is how we know in your for guests and our friend Brett Orange team calls it

348
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:48.480
idea laundering.
They have an idea,
they have a moral impulse.

349
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.250
They want to discharge that.
They write in their,

350
00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:53.610
Jay may have these make believe journals and they publish it and then they start

351
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:57.240
teaching it to folks.
And then that's how it spreads.
It's like a contagion.

352
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.670
<v 2>Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
We couldn't have the conversation right,</v>

353
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:02.100
because that's what they would do because you try to have a conversation and

354
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:06.060
they say this thing and you say,
well how do you know that?
And they're like this.

355
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.410
And they point to the scholarship and Pete's idea was that's the same as when a,

356
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.800
when a Christian is,
you know,
ranting about fire and brimstone and you're like,

357
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:17.820
how do you know that this,
and they point to Deuteronomy or whatever,
you know,

358
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.810
and it's the same concept.
And so then you can't,
what do you do?
How do you argue?

359
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:26.040
Well,
the only thing you can do is say,
well maybe that scholarships questionable.

360
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.730
And then that conversation wasn't possible because if you question the

361
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:32.580
scholarship,
you're racist.
So we said,
well,
let's look at the scholarship.

362
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.720
<v 3>Yeah.
So you were piecing this together for a long time because I quote you every</v>

363
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.690
other week on the show.
When you started calling this postmodern movement,

364
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.110
a secular,
religious,
secular religion.

365
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.780
We've been talking about that for years and then all of a sudden all all you

366
00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:48.880
know I,
Andrew Sullivan,
I serve mcwhorter.

367
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:51.040
I saw all these people talking about it.
I'm I saying,
you know,

368
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.480
we're first or anything,
the hipsters have the secretary.

369
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.590
Well you are the first person that I heard talk about it and that guy was so

370
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:58.900
obvious because we came from this,

371
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:03.250
from the new atheist and the parallels with striking.
And just on that,

372
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.280
I think Mike Neda has a video on that,

373
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.910
that we tweeted a in which you can see,

374
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.450
you can literally see the canoe story that happened to Britain,
Heather.

375
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.010
And it's uh,
what's it Mike Natives?
Youtube

376
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.280
<v 2>channel is youtube</v>

377
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.060
<v 3>wells are there.
They're not just conspicuous there.</v>

378
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.590
You can't ignore them.

379
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.711
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

380
00:21:25.711 --> 00:21:29.460
It's impossible to watch this little documentary he's done on evergreen just

381
00:21:29.461 --> 00:21:31.850
recently.
So for your viewers that don't know,
Mike,

382
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.350
Nina is actually a documentary filmmaker who came in.

383
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.620
He was looking at the same kinds of problems going on in Australia,

384
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.810
getting curious about it.
That ended up by chance leading to us crossing paths.

385
00:21:42.811 --> 00:21:46.950
We told them about what we were doing last fall 2017 and he was like,
okay,

386
00:21:46.951 --> 00:21:49.320
I'll document it as long as I'm allowed to tell the truth about everything.

387
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.180
And we're like,
yeah,
that's what we want to do.
Anyway.

388
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.940
So we have a documentary filmmaker,

389
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.800
there's been following us around tracking what we've been doing and because the

390
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.500
problems so complicated,
he slowly,
you know,

391
00:21:58.501 --> 00:22:00.240
the Helen and Peter and I get all this,

392
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.400
like we did this project and we wrote these papers.

393
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.720
We've actually kind of had the secret secret fourth member who is this filmmaker

394
00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:06.961
who is,

395
00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:09.930
he learned more and more about it became kind of an integral contributor to our

396
00:22:09.931 --> 00:22:12.630
thinking and our ideas and how to communicate it.

397
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.540
And so he's now working on a documentary,

398
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.880
a feature length documentary about us and the work we did.

399
00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:21.000
But he also was running a youtube channel with shorts about either us,

400
00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:24.630
what we're doing and he just released this,
um,
hour,

401
00:22:24.631 --> 00:22:27.240
almost hour long documentary,
first half of a,

402
00:22:27.241 --> 00:22:32.160
of a longer piece on evergreen.
That's like Netflix quality.
I mean it's for real.

403
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:32.391
You get,

404
00:22:32.391 --> 00:22:37.380
you really do want to check it out on his youtube channel and it is impossible.

405
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:41.160
I would say to watch that and not see,
holy crap,

406
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.490
this is a religion and this is how it operates and this isn't just a religion.

407
00:22:44.491 --> 00:22:46.850
This is a hardcore one.
No,

408
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.631
<v 3>sorry,
go ahead.
Well,</v>

409
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:52.631
so as the guy who wrote a manual for creating atheists deprogramming religious

410
00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:55.100
thinking is something you've been interested in a long time.

411
00:22:55.101 --> 00:23:00.101
So did you view this as the first blow to enable that process to start

412
00:23:01.491 --> 00:23:06.050
happening?
I do.
I,
I think that they're,
their cannons,
their way,

413
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.130
they come to knowledge,

414
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.160
the method that they rely on is at the very least a reasonable person or barring

415
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.830
Walter Kauffman definition,

416
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.220
every reasonable person would have to look at that and say,
wait a second.

417
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.390
They have generated these self contained ecosystems that anyone looking at it

418
00:23:24.681 --> 00:23:26.360
from the outside would realize.

419
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.690
But I do think that that one of the things this project showed was that those

420
00:23:32.391 --> 00:23:34.100
canons are now de-legitimized.

421
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.360
There's no reason a serious person would take a look at that and say,
you know,

422
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.090
cause you had asked before your initial question,
like what are the papers?

423
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.680
What are the journals?
Uh,
you know,
we've published a piece in Hypatia in,

424
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.740
in which that piece said there was the joke's on you and it was criticizing us

425
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:52.280
for the conceptual penis,

426
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.240
but it was very meta paper because of the joke was actually on them for

427
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:57.500
publishing the paper.
Right?

428
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.310
So I think that a reasonable person who would look at this would say,
wow,

429
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.000
there's something going on here.
But look at the reaction to this.

430
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:06.770
It's interesting.
You know,
it's like,
yes,

431
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.980
I wrote a manual for creating atheists and what's the next,
what would,

432
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.650
what would a reasonable person say,
a reasonable person say,
well,

433
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.740
I know that sexism is wrong.
I know that racism is wrong.

434
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.820
I know that these forms of discrimination are wrong and we want to study them.

435
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:20.540
Right?

436
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.860
And these folks pointed out at a very serious flooding in the literature and I

437
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:28.550
want to maintain my intellectual and scholarly integrity and we're going to try

438
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.720
to fix those problems.
The last,
but they have not done it.

439
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.940
They have done instead is exactly what he predicted.

440
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.520
And W we wrote about in the area of piece,

441
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.050
which was instead of taking a look at how they produce knowledge,

442
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.280
they,
they now scrutinize the authors who submit.

443
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.910
So they Google.
So they make sure that the authors are legit.

444
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:55.190
So instead of being a sincere inquirer,
again,
they think they already have truth.

445
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:59.180
Exactly like a fundamentalist.
Well,
so we've seen so many examples of this.

446
00:24:59.181 --> 00:24:59.421
I mean,

447
00:24:59.421 --> 00:25:02.540
I would say this is where they could have taken a look in the mirror after Trump

448
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:05.480
got elected.
They could have taken a look in the mirror after saying you can,

449
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:09.200
everyone's a Nazi and then you can punch Nazis and the list goes on and on of

450
00:25:09.201 --> 00:25:12.740
when there could have been a moment of reflection.
We've never seen it.

451
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.910
So I know when we spoke a few days before the the Wall Street Journal piece went

452
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.080
home and we were talking about,
well,
maybe there's a chance this awake,

453
00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.690
some of them up.
And I said to you,
I was like,
no,
of course not.
I mean,
there's,

454
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.070
there's nothing that that can be done.
So then in the face of that,

455
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:31.070
if you agree with the premise,
then what can be done other than we can,

456
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.470
you can keep doing this and we can keep talking about it.

457
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:37.880
We can keep waking other people up.
But for the people that are in that cult,

458
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.530
which I actually think is inappropriate idea for it,
and then what do you do?

459
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.840
<v 2>Um,
you have to do what you always have to do,</v>

460
00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:48.450
which is you have to find ways in,

461
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.460
which means you have to find legitimate ways and effective ways and not a

462
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:58.390
authoritarian ways to,
um,
curtail their influence.

463
00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.110
If they are unwilling to wake up or change their mind or reconsider,

464
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.140
then that's fine.
Within a liberal society,

465
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:08.330
everybody's allowed to follow their conscience are allowed to have.

466
00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.690
That's the principle of freedom of religion.

467
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.400
Because you're allowed to worship as you will.

468
00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:16.870
So if you want to worship the woke God of social justice,
whatever,

469
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.330
<v 3>I know,</v>

470
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.560
I suspect that they would not afford that freedom if they were really in charge.

471
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.810
You know,
those of us that may be don't believe in it

472
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.870
<v 2>or you don't see it from hardcore religionists either they would,</v>

473
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.760
they wouldn't afford the freedom if they got the power,

474
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:33.440
either theologians or theocrats or just as scary.
So if you want to,

475
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:36.590
if you want to curtail their power,
the answer is always in secularism.

476
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.530
And it does have to come from other people.
So within,

477
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.770
there are different audiences here,
right?
So there's everyday people they should,

478
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:48.100
they,
you know,
really think twice before they enroll at,

479
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.570
if it's a kid going to college before they enroll in a gender studies program,

480
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:52.471
uh,
yeah,

481
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:56.970
probably should somebody be stepping up in the advisory sector of the academy

482
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.420
and saying,
you know,
I think you have a lot of talents.

483
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:02.580
Say it's a young black student in a lot of talent.

484
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:05.040
You could go to graduate school,
you could study.

485
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.000
And instead of saying there's this opportunity for you to study this niche thing

486
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:12.690
about lived black experience in writing an auto ethnography and get your

487
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:15.330
guaranteed phd,
cause nobody's allowed to say you're wrong.

488
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.900
Maybe you could go into some field that it doesn't have to be,
you know,

489
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.060
everybody always goes to stem,
maybe it's engineering or whatever.

490
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.080
It doesn't have to be that.
It could be anything via historian,
be an economist,

491
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.410
be a political scientist to go in and study something more rigorous that

492
00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:30.990
enhances your critical thinking in your dialectic process.

493
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.890
So that'd be advisors could do that.
And administrators.

494
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.440
<v 1>So what is the flaw is the flow of that,</v>

495
00:27:36.441 --> 00:27:38.960
although I think you're right at some level as the floor there,

496
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:41.360
that because they are viewing this as a religion,

497
00:27:41.361 --> 00:27:46.361
there's almost no way to show them that the people before them had any knowledge

498
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.170
of how the world works.
Like they really want to erase everything about the past.

499
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:51.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

500
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:56.130
I think ultimately there's the battleground is to get people to realize that

501
00:27:56.131 --> 00:27:56.970
that's unacceptable.

502
00:27:56.971 --> 00:28:00.210
So a good metaphor for that is I don't want to alienate any of your,

503
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.600
your hardest Tricia [inaudible] if you've ever been driving,

504
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:06.030
I know this is a dated example now with like cool,

505
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.280
futuristic radio and podcasts and things,

506
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:11.490
but you drive in and you're on a road trip,
you're in a difference,
you know,

507
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.940
region,
your dazzle and the dial on the radio and you're like,
God,

508
00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:16.200
I can't find anything good to listen to.

509
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:19.830
And you flip thing as like country and you flipped the thing and it's something

510
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:22.710
else.
It's talk,
you don't want to listen to that.
You flipped the thing.
Ah,

511
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.080
some rock song comes on.
You're kind of like getting into it,

512
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:28.110
your role and you know,
hit the accelerator a little bit and then they're like,

513
00:28:28.111 --> 00:28:30.600
Jesus is my light.
And you're like,
I know what this is.

514
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.630
You change the dial again right away because you hear that and you didn't want

515
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:36.930
to get proselytized to,
you wanted to listen to,
you know,
some,

516
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:39.480
some Metallica or something.
So you didn't want to hear that.

517
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.390
You thought you're into something and it's the wrong thing.
And so that,

518
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.650
that feeling you get though,

519
00:28:43.651 --> 00:28:46.350
when you hear the religious thing that you didn't know was religious and it just

520
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:47.850
hooked you all of a sudden into religion,

521
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.850
that's the reaction that people should have.
They hear this woke stuff,

522
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:55.080
check your privilege.
I know what this is.
I'm not going along with that.

523
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.530
And if they want to point to something,
they want to point to some hard evidence.

524
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.110
These guys,
but Goshen,
Lindsey Pollak,
rose,

525
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.200
they did this thing and maybe we didn't,
I mean Pete says,

526
00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:07.230
I like to nuance a little further than Pete did about de-legitimizing their

527
00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:09.900
canon.
I think that there's probably some legitimate work going on,

528
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:12.360
but who can tell what it is?

529
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.620
How do you know if I can make up stuff and Pete can make up stuff and Helen can

530
00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:20.190
make up stuff and we can just massage the literature to let it be.

531
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.620
How do you know when it's the real thing and when it's not.

532
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.600
So what we need is to clean that up and get,
get to the bottom of,

533
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:31.350
of when the work is using good,
rigorous methods and when it's not in review,

534
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:32.970
all this stuff.
Um,

535
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:33.901
<v 1>so,</v>

536
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:37.230
so I know you guys obviously got support out of the quarters that I would have

537
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:38.400
expected you to get support.

538
00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:43.401
So Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Haidt and Steven pinker and debt and all these

539
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:44.920
guys.
Okay.
Uh,

540
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.650
that's not to be surprised because these guys have been talking about these

541
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:51.340
things.
Did you get any,
did you get any support though out of,

542
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.470
did you get anything out of say,

543
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:58.471
more lefty professors that you didn't really think we're gonna whisper in

544
00:29:58.711 --> 00:30:01.930
whispers?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this is again,
that consistent story with all of this.

545
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.160
So I find when I get emails from that type of person that says,
oh,
Dave,
you know,

546
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:06.401
you're,

547
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:08.680
you're doing the right thing here and you're calling out the nonsense of the

548
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:11.530
left.
And I just can't do it because I'm at a university or I have a job.

549
00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.720
I actually am starting to hate those people.

550
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.140
I mean that sort of slightly sarcastic,
but it's not the right word,

551
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.320
but I'm really,
I'm really,
I've had it with those people.
I'm not a superhero.

552
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:21.670
I'm just doing what I think is right.

553
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.000
What is your feeling about that set of people at the university?

554
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.150
I think that we need to be more,

555
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.850
I don't mean this to sound in any other way,

556
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:34.060
but we need to be more compassionate for them.
Some people,
they don't have the,

557
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.360
they're just cowards and it's not their fault.

558
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.410
They're just live in a state of timidity or fear and they don't want to lose

559
00:30:41.411 --> 00:30:42.011
their job.

560
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:47.011
Or maybe they prioritize employment in their families and whatever it is over

561
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:51.700
the truth that that's the life they lead.

562
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:56.010
<v 2>Yeah.
If you're in a system where the system itself does not take kindly to this,</v>

563
00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.990
and I think academics have a lot of sunk costs going on into their careers,

564
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.290
and you don't have a lot of great options.
If you bail from the academy,

565
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.820
you've spent decades getting where you are.
It had to be a passion to get there.

566
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.480
So it's like,
I want to say it there.
No,
I share it with you.
By the way,

567
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.740
one of the first people who talked to me in whispers after we came public was a

568
00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:20.010
friend of mine with multiple PhDs,
big time academic guy.

569
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.480
And he came up and he was so excited.

570
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.530
Now he's even talking low even though we were alone.
And um,
yeah,
it was like,

571
00:31:25.531 --> 00:31:27.990
you know,
whispering almost to me literally,

572
00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:30.540
even though we were just the two of us.
And he said,
you know,

573
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:33.420
I am so thrilled to let you do it.
It's needed to happen,
blah,
blah,
blah.

574
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.370
The academy needs to change in these reform.

575
00:31:35.371 --> 00:31:38.280
Please don't tell anybody I said this and my reaction,
and I'm a very,

576
00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:40.780
very calm patient person.
For people who don't know me,
I,

577
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.460
I don't think I get mad maybe once a year,
if that over anything.

578
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.490
And maybe I need to,
I don't know,
but different show different.

579
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:52.540
I became mad at him like immediately my reaction was you coward.

580
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.640
But then I thought about how much he's invested in.
So I think Pete's right.

581
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.630
Compassion is necessary for the silent professors,

582
00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:04.330
but what we need also is for those who are courageous enough to open their
mouth,

583
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.270
but more people who say they look at the old communist thing where the communist

584
00:32:09.271 --> 00:32:10.080
regime is falling,

585
00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.290
but everybody's kind of going along with it and everybody knows if they're the

586
00:32:13.291 --> 00:32:16.410
first person to step out that they're going to get shot or dragged off or

587
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:18.060
whatever and it's going to silence everybody else.

588
00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.020
But if everybody at once in the town or the city or whatever all said,
you know,

589
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.430
communism's bullshit,
they couldn't do anything about it.
It's too,

590
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.750
<v 1>are you guys then you're sort of saying both things at the same time.
I mean,</v>

591
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:31.330
I get it like let's be compassionate towards people and I get it.

592
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:34.060
People have other considerations and careers and families and all those things

593
00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:36.880
and I'm not denying any of that.
But you guys aren't superheroes.

594
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:40.250
I'm not as over here.
Just speak up and I'm incredibly

595
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.940
<v 3>grateful for the people who have spoken up and has anyone not survived.
I mean,</v>

596
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:45.690
I think this is the other thing that we have to push.

597
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.040
Has anyone that spoke up about these things that spoken up?
Yes.

598
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:52.370
People who have lost their jobs.
Yes.
And,
and you know,
uh,

599
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.330
James Demora Google and um,
uh,
Lindsay Shepherd,
it looks already execute,

600
00:32:57.331 --> 00:32:59.450
but no one's been executed.
If anything,

601
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:03.820
these people are all stronger at some level.
So yeah,
I agree with that actually.

602
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.670
Yeah.
So,
so that to me,
that's where we have to go with him.

603
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.600
I'm really incredibly grateful for the people who have spoken up and I'm telling

604
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:15.080
my email box has been flooded with letters of support students,

605
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.120
people that don't know people all over the world.

606
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:18.650
And I'm incredibly grateful for that.

607
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.250
And what we are seeing is more and more people are putting their names on this.

608
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.080
That's our big change.
We're seeing that in biology for example.

609
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.300
So that's what gives me hope for this whole thing.

610
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.070
And so I have only two colleagues who have publicly come out and said that they

611
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:37.520
have support me out of the whole university.
And you know,

612
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:42.290
the Portland State University vanguard published this crazy smear hit piece on

613
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:46.730
me with a huge nose as the film I'm fill in and they spelled his name wrong.

614
00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:51.350
They said Hell had seven of these are 1110 with PhDs.

615
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:54.680
Couldn't even spell two of the three names correctly and they didn't.

616
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:57.560
It was anonymous.
The people who design side,
it was all,

617
00:33:57.561 --> 00:34:02.030
it was students and faculty and Blah,
blah,
blah.
There's no color.
So brave.

618
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.750
If they had the truth on their side and they were so right and you were so evil,

619
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.200
well you could at least put your name.
I got,
yeah.

620
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:13.010
Well that's also the part of it is that at the James Damore event,

621
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.580
when it was just James Warren,
myself was hosted at points in university.

622
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.480
We emailed the women's studies department with James Shore and myself and we

623
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:23.090
said,
come on stage and let's,
let's have it.
It wasn't a debate.

624
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:27.620
A spirited conversation got to rejections and nothing else.
Two days later,

625
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.920
February 19th James,
Lindsay Hill blockers,
and myself,

626
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.550
the first thing I said at the James Damore event,
please women's,

627
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:37.010
anyone with a phd in cause you don't want to punch down,
right?

628
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:41.270
Anyone who is qualified as PhDs published in share,
please come up,

629
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:42.830
we'll give you a seat on stage,

630
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:46.130
you can talk right beside us and we'll have a spirit of conversation.
Nothing,

631
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.460
nothing.
And then at myth con,
later on,

632
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:52.530
the organizers try to find some,
they said they,

633
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.550
they told me they spent 80 hours trying to find a qualified person,

634
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:59.720
someone in the field of gender studies.
No one would go on with James,

635
00:34:59.721 --> 00:35:01.460
Lindsey and clay Routledge in myself.

636
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.570
Is this the brilliance of what they've done?

637
00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:05.930
And I mean that obviously slightly tongue in cheek,

638
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:08.900
which is you label everyone a racist than a Nazi and everything.

639
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:10.970
And then you say,
well,
these people don't deserve platforms.

640
00:35:10.971 --> 00:35:13.520
So either they won't give you the platform in the first place or if they've

641
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:16.070
given you the platform.
Well,
they already have.
They're out,
which is,

642
00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:20.380
I don't sit on platforms with Nazis.
So,
thus they've created this engine that,
uh,

643
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.060
that gives them the ultimate escape and gives you new opera,

644
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:27.860
no opportunity to defend your ideas to them.
And one crucial piece to that,

645
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.670
which is,
uh,
one of the differences between traditional religions,

646
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:35.210
Christianity in particular,
is that they,

647
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:38.220
they don't value discourse and dialogue.

648
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.610
It's just not part of their canon.
In fact,
if anything,

649
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.680
it's viewed as a full violence.

650
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:49.070
And so when you have folks who in not only they don't value it,

651
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:51.090
they're already winning the cultural war.
Right?

652
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.100
I know that might be a controversial statement,
but,

653
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:56.960
but certainly they're winning the cultural and the academy.
Nope,
we're making it.

654
00:35:56.961 --> 00:35:59.520
I think we're making some gains,
but I think by and large gains,

655
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.270
and I think that can be metrics are like how many people are putting their names

656
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:06.330
when they come out on these letters or when they're speaking publicly about it.

657
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:11.331
But why would you have a conversation or a debate with someone if you know

658
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:13.710
you're already winning?
It's like the presidential debate.

659
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.460
You want to have more if you're losing in fewer if you're winning.

660
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.280
And so I think that's also operative.

661
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.860
<v 2>So this is where it gets a bit deep if you want.
Why does that happen?
Um,</v>

662
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.500
I mean obviously you can look at it and just that it's this brilliant strategy

663
00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:31.880
in a sense.
But um,
their literature,
again,
like I said earlier,

664
00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:34.040
they're terrified of complicity,
right?

665
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.300
They're going to be complicit in something.

666
00:36:35.301 --> 00:36:40.301
So sharing the stage with somebody with a views equals complicity and also

667
00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:44.980
giving them a platform.
But it's really difficult to understand that for,

668
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.860
for people outside of this kind of,
we call applied postmodern,

669
00:36:48.861 --> 00:36:52.580
it changed in the 90s it's not the same as Foucault and Derrida and all this

670
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.570
nonsense deconstruction stuff.
It's a bit more focused.
It's really,
it's,

671
00:36:56.571 --> 00:37:00.170
it's identity activism.
If you're outside of that view,

672
00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:04.370
it's very difficult to understand how this all works.
They,
they,

673
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.180
why do they see something like conversation or dialogue is violence.

674
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.470
And the reason is that they see that everything is,

675
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:17.390
is,
has identity in and they see identity as an ideology,

676
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.880
ideology connected to identity bakes,
that ideology into whatever it produces.

677
00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.020
So you and I are p three white guys sitting here and we're saying we should have

678
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:29.300
conversation which should have conversation.
And their answer is,

679
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.240
well of course you should.
You'd say you have conversation.
White people baked up.

680
00:37:32.241 --> 00:37:35.300
The idea of having a conversation to get to idea so that they can maintain their

681
00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:36.134
power.

682
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.460
So it's got this huge nasty conspiracy theory element that comes down to the

683
00:37:40.461 --> 00:37:42.920
very roots of what we would call applied postmodernism,

684
00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:46.430
which is the privilege and power exists to perpetuate and legitimize themselves.

685
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.850
If you don't understand that that's how they view the world.

686
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.190
It looks like they're playing this very dirty game,

687
00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:55.190
but they actually really think that this is something that we did.

688
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:58.310
It's different.
By the way from socal is socal wrote the pastiche.

689
00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:01.340
We started with these hoaxes.
The first six papers we wrote,

690
00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:02.570
the ones that just died,

691
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:05.480
cause if you remember where he said 20 and then we talked about 14 of them,

692
00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:07.730
seven accepted,
seven more in play.

693
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.250
We started with hoaxes and we couldn't get hoaxes in.

694
00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:13.580
We couldn't replicate socal cause.
And we think the reason is either,

695
00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:14.391
it could be our skill,

696
00:38:14.391 --> 00:38:17.630
but it could also be that something changed and we think that something

697
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:22.690
fundamentally changed in the late eighties and early nineties and under Kimberly

698
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.420
Crenshaw's critical race theory and intersectionality,
uh,

699
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:29.330
she literally says that we need to apply postmodernism and mapping the margins.

700
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:33.200
That's the paper that the first mention of that section then yes,

701
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:34.910
that is the birthplace of intersectionality.

702
00:38:34.911 --> 00:38:39.130
And she says that we can't achieve things if all we do is deconstruct.

703
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.520
So we need to admit that some things are real identities,

704
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:44.710
real and oppression based on identity are real.

705
00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.360
And we need to use postmodern methods,

706
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.990
apply postmodern or methods of deconstruction to achieve things through those

707
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:51.790
assumptions.
So it's a big turn.

708
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.570
So they literally see that privilege and power exist to maintain themselves,

709
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:56.500
legitimize themselves.

710
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.790
And so there's this whole kind of weird conspiracy theory element to it from

711
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:02.380
their perspective that Oh,

712
00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:06.340
you want to use reason because reason was invented by Western values that want

713
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:08.440
to perpetuate themselves and dominate the world.

714
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:12.010
And you want to use science and evidence because same reason and you want to

715
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:15.130
have conversation for the same reason.
And then when you start tying,

716
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.580
it's incredible.
It's deep.
It's Pr.
Unbelievably profound.

717
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.340
It's like the very thing that got you into the,

718
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.580
into the cognitive sinkhole in the first place.

719
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.530
The thing that can emancipate you from that.

720
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.160
You deny access just like Boko Haram,
western education forbidden,
right?

721
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.090
The one thing that these folks need is western education,
right?

722
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:37.780
So the very thing that caused the problem in the first place,

723
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.400
they avoid,

724
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:43.480
they won't take because it will liberate them from the thing that causes the

725
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.210
problem.
Yeah.
So that's what we set out to do though,

726
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:48.760
is to understand when our hoax has failed,

727
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.610
we set out to understand them on their own terms.

728
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.510
They call this being an outsider within.
Um,
and there was actually a huge,

729
00:39:55.511 --> 00:39:59.020
like in,
in lesbian research early on and lesbian social researchers,

730
00:39:59.170 --> 00:39:59.561
cause you know,

731
00:39:59.561 --> 00:40:03.760
you go into female oriented spaces or whatever and they don't quite fit.

732
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:06.430
So they are an outsider,
but they're inside and then they document it.

733
00:40:06.431 --> 00:40:08.750
And that was one of their kind of methodologies,
a approach.

734
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.230
So we became that outsiders within their thing.

735
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.410
And we wanted to actually understand the way that they think.

736
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:17.630
And so now we sit in this odd position where,
you know,

737
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:22.300
I have one foot in applied postmodern,
uh,
theology,
if you will,

738
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.060
and I have one foot in reality and I,

739
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:28.680
I can now see the world both ways.
And,
uh,

740
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.750
that's kind of like the thing that sets us apart from socal.

741
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:35.620
It's a thing that we have to offer that's very different because we understand

742
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:36.431
where they're coming from,

743
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:39.930
why they're coming from that place and how their logic and their approaches

744
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.690
broken or damaging or unethical or whatever it happens to be in that,

745
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.580
in that case.

746
00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.730
<v 1>So you mentioned sort of high level ways we can break them out as,
I mean,
one,</v>

747
00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:48.750
one simple.
I've had it,

748
00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:52.200
a couple of simple ones as I've talked to kids at schools.
One is,
you know,

749
00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:55.590
you'll say to the,
they'll say that they're for Islam and they're for gay people.

750
00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:00.360
And then you'll say,
well,
um,
can any gay person,

751
00:41:00.361 --> 00:41:01.770
is there any gate ma,

752
00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.280
is there a mosque in America or anywhere in the West for that matter or anywhere

753
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:10.260
in east or anywhere that will,
uh,
have gay marriage?
And the answer is no.
There,

754
00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:14.250
there might maybe be one discredited one somewhere apparently.
But so it's like,

755
00:41:14.251 --> 00:41:18.030
how can we be for both of these things?
This,
this actually doesn't make sense.

756
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:23.040
And that sort of little bomb in their brain does set off something I find,

757
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.810
you know,
but like,
so you need a little tricks like that.
So the best thing,

758
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.530
which then they'll tell you you're an Islamophobe anyway or something.
But

759
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.770
<v 2>I've found that actually asking people how the dog park paper,</v>

760
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:38.060
the dog humping paper got honored and then explain what the paper says.

761
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.470
How did this paper get honored as exemplary scholarship and feminist geography?

762
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:44.740
I watched kind of,
it's like the eyes on focus and come back.

763
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.250
<v 3>Yes,
I've seen it happen.</v>

764
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:49.830
You need them to understand a certain amount of what you've done.
One about like,

765
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.590
wait a minute,
I'm freezing them and for gays,

766
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:54.170
but if no gay can get married at a mosque,

767
00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:56.770
well now it seems like something sort of more obvious,
something like that.

768
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.650
One of the things I just wrote about this last year,
I'm skeptic magazine,

769
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.860
one of the things that I've learned from over a quarter century of critical

770
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:07.550
thinking is instead of asking people,
what is your evidence for that?

771
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:09.290
Which is a totally reasonable question,

772
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.940
I switched to what's called a disability question or discolor information

773
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:18.650
question.
I front load this and all of my,
my conversations now,

774
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.910
and it's basically a simple question,
how could that belief be false?

775
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.440
So someone tells you something and you say,
well,
how could,
how?

776
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.720
I'm not saying you are wrong about that.
Just like how could that be false?

777
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.500
Even asking that question opens up spaces,
you know,

778
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.500
enables people to process things and in a way in which they,

779
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.280
they ordinarily wouldn't.
It's an incredibly effective question.
Yeah.

780
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:45.230
So what tangible evidence is there that,
that this thing is starting to succeed?

781
00:42:45.231 --> 00:42:48.650
Beyond that?
You know,
there was some cover given by some,
some big names.

782
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.230
There were some good press.
Not all the press was good.
Plenty of,

783
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.910
plenty of places.
When after you guys do,

784
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.540
I mean is there more credible evidence then?
What did they go after though?

785
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.940
They went after our motivation.
Yeah,
right.

786
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:02.390
It was a lot about your motivations in particular Mr. Controversy,

787
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.500
formulate your beliefs in the base of evidence.
Huge controversy.
Uh,

788
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.540
so what the question is,
what can be done well?
Well is there tangible evidence?

789
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.780
<v 2>Yeah.
First of all we've had probably 10 to one support to distraction.</v>

790
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.310
So people writing these negative pieces.
Yeah,
they're out there.

791
00:43:18.311 --> 00:43:21.940
But I think it's 10 to one support.
And I keep hearing,

792
00:43:21.941 --> 00:43:23.260
I know it's mostly whispered,

793
00:43:23.261 --> 00:43:25.780
but PSP said some people are starting to put their names to it.

794
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:29.200
A lot of people did in his support after Portland state.
Um,

795
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.110
I'm hearing a lot of people say things like,

796
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.030
you got them and they know you've got them right.

797
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.630
You've got them and they know you've got them.
That's it.
That's powerful.

798
00:43:37.631 --> 00:43:40.180
These are people in humanities departments that are telling,
of course,

799
00:43:40.181 --> 00:43:44.290
I can't say who they are,
but they're saying they know you've got them.

800
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.180
And then the way we expected,

801
00:43:46.181 --> 00:43:49.300
you know the tornado to come after us and then there was no tornado,

802
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.080
it was just kind of this rolling over thing and eventually it's nasty hip piece

803
00:43:53.081 --> 00:43:54.970
in pizza,
student newspapers.

804
00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.720
<v 3>Right.
And that's my point is that people survive the Munster.</v>

805
00:43:58.721 --> 00:44:00.490
And I want people to understand that

806
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:01.101
<v 2>that is,</v>

807
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:05.030
it's so many people and now people are starting to put that the toe out or stick

808
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:05.781
their head out a little bit.

809
00:44:05.781 --> 00:44:07.850
They're writing things or putting their name on it when speaking

810
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.330
<v 3>up in their classes.
I get emails all the time,
Hey,
you know,</v>

811
00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:13.280
you emboldened me to speak off of my class.

812
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:16.250
And like I mentioned some of these papers,
I've mentioned this.

813
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:21.580
So we see a ground swell of people willing to question and challenge the names.

814
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:23.690
A huge thing when people come out.

815
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:27.630
I now have all these organizations that have endorsed me against,
you know,

816
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.870
the possible termination from my offenses.

817
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.480
So let's just jump there for just a sec because this is not as if it hasn't had

818
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:37.590
a professional costs for you guys.
Uh,
but for you in particular,

819
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:38.940
and I know you don't want to play the victim,

820
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.880
but can you just explain what the hell is going on over at Portland state right

821
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:46.740
now?
So,
um,
they charged me,

822
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.910
there are two charges.

823
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.520
One is not going to the RB human subjects and they considered the researchers,

824
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.170
humans,
they,
excuse me,
the journal editors,

825
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:02.490
human subjects and I was found guilty on that and it's escalated to wait.

826
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.830
Can you explain that a little bit further?

827
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.840
So there are these things called Arby's and anytime you experiment on people,

828
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.910
it originally from Tuskegee and medical experiments,

829
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.650
you need to get permission from this board and tell them exactly what you're

830
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:18.120
going to do so that they know that the,

831
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:23.310
the subjects upon whom you're doing whatever in,
in,
in,
um,

832
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.260
intervention are going to be fine.

833
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.550
So I was found guilty of not going to that.

834
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:32.880
Those are public documents that can be revealed when I received it.

835
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.050
And then that that has escalated to the provost and the president of the

836
00:45:36.051 --> 00:45:39.300
university and they can make a decision about punishments.

837
00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:43.830
I was also told that I have to take a training and there's,
I can't do any,

838
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.110
my,
I can't be a primary researcher,

839
00:45:46.111 --> 00:45:50.970
a researcher on it and anything until this has been,
um,

840
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.040
adjudicated.
Then it's,
then it's the other charges,

841
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:57.180
fabrication of data.

842
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.910
These are very serious turn the foundation of data in particular.

843
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:04.440
And the idea behind that is that you don't want the research stream to be

844
00:46:04.441 --> 00:46:08.610
contaminated,
right?
So we can't have people putting,
making stuff up,

845
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:12.000
basically publishing it.
And then what,
why people do that,

846
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:15.030
the motivation is to advance their own careers,

847
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:18.090
to get grants to publish and get tenure or what have you.

848
00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.940
Even though that's obviously not what you guys were doing,

849
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.180
you weren't falsifying data does sell off a paper that was gonna make you look

850
00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:26.820
like a rock star to get another position.

851
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:30.960
You were actually trying to help the institutions that we're trying.
There's a,

852
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.760
we can talk about the motivations,

853
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:35.280
but trust has been eroded in our public institutions.

854
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:38.550
Trust has been enrolled in the academy and it's a huge problem.
And,

855
00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:44.160
but we can talk about that.
So that invest investigation is ongoing.
And so again,

856
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.200
my union rep informed me and my lawyers that the punishment for that can be

857
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:50.910
termination.
So I'm,

858
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.480
I'm now kind of caught in limbo and I honestly do not know what's going to

859
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:58.010
happen.
Are you in any hot water beyond?

860
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.110
<v 2>No,
I'm not in any,
I,
I'm out of the academy,
so I don't have a,</v>

861
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.870
I have no institutional review board over me and I have,

862
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.210
I have nobody coming down on me.
I mean,

863
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:11.270
I did basically have to stop working my job for almost two years to do this.

864
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:16.170
So I'm semi borderline unemployed and it's kind of,
you know,

865
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:19.080
I don't think I'm getting into academia again.
Well,

866
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.060
if I wanted to try to get into that,

867
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.550
so I'm not in the next couple of killer hot water.

868
00:47:23.551 --> 00:47:27.660
But that's sort of the huge irony of this,
right?
So pizza and hot water.
But why?

869
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.980
Because he's an incident in an,

870
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.980
I'm free to do this and then there's nobody who can come down on me.

871
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:36.940
But P is under the,
you know,
possibly losing his job and all of this,
you know,

872
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.010
professional misconduct stuff.

873
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:43.570
It seems like it has technicality written all over it.
It's like,
Oh,

874
00:47:43.571 --> 00:47:45.670
you happen to be the in the wrong position.

875
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.580
Now I understand that these boards are important and what they do and then

876
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:50.440
investigation needs to be be had.

877
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.960
But at the same time it does have technicality written all over it.
There's,

878
00:47:53.961 --> 00:47:57.700
there's some weird,
how is it that they're,
this is ethical if I do it,

879
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:59.350
but unethical if he does it by,

880
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.060
by virtue of the fact that he has an academic position that should credential

881
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:05.860
him higher than that.
I'm credentialed,
but it doesn't,

882
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:08.980
it doesn't seem to really make any sense.
So for me,

883
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:11.830
I've not really had any hot water.
I also live in the south east,

884
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.760
which helps quite a bit because a,
as I was walking around,
you know,

885
00:48:15.761 --> 00:48:18.490
I'm here in southern California,
so I'm walking around in Hollywood.

886
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.930
Last night we'd go out and somebody who's like,

887
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.830
that guy's one of us and I was like,
everybody where on from was one of us.

888
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:27.730
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.
Um,
everybody agrees with me about,

889
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:29.680
I mean they don't agree with my politics necessarily.

890
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:34.330
I've do firmly plant myself on the left,
but at the same time I,

891
00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.020
they certainly agree with me about gender studies.
They certainly agree with.

892
00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:41.020
They even go further than I would go.
I think gender studies is important.

893
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:43.070
For example,
I think we should be studying gender in a,

894
00:48:43.071 --> 00:48:47.040
in a multidisciplinary way.
I just think it should have to follow,
you know,

895
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.970
the lines of evidence that should have to admit when it's wrong.
Right?
Yeah.

896
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.950
It's happening though.
Race is a huge issue.
Look how explosive it is.
For example,

897
00:48:56.951 --> 00:48:59.800
for the last several years it's been like the most explosive social topic.

898
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.890
How are you going to do it if you're not doing it rigorously?

899
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.910
<v 1>Do you think though it's possible that that race,</v>

900
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:09.911
let's say is the most explosive topic because of what they have created,

901
00:49:10.341 --> 00:49:11.330
what they have sewn.

902
00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.261
<v 2>When you,</v>

903
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:17.261
when you increase people's awareness of race or gender or identity,

904
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.600
you make it touchier.
You make it a bigger deal.

905
00:49:20.601 --> 00:49:24.710
You make people look for reasons to dig into it and you do explode the issue,

906
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.640
<v 1>right?
Yeah.
Because if everything being equal,
if you asked me,
I mean,</v>

907
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:30.340
I've been saying this a little bit more and I don't get any great joy in saying

908
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:34.540
it,
but if you asked me where the real racism is coming from right now,

909
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:36.760
it's coming from them.
It's again,
it's,
I mean,

910
00:49:36.761 --> 00:49:38.680
I say this all the time and everyone knows there's,
yes.

911
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:42.970
Are there a couple of KKK members?
Are there a couple,
a white supremacist?
Yes.

912
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:44.920
Do they have any institutional power?
No.

913
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:49.450
Does anyone with any academic power or anything think that they're good?

914
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.420
No,
but,
but this thing has power behind it.

915
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:56.770
So that's why I fear it much more and the way that it's used.
Racism,

916
00:49:56.950 --> 00:50:00.640
<v 2>racism in conservative circles coming from the southeast and having lived there</v>

917
00:50:00.641 --> 00:50:03.160
for almost 40 years,
uh,

918
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.690
has definitely changed dramatically in my life.
Um,

919
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.380
the attitudes are very,
very different.
I honestly,
it's,

920
00:50:11.381 --> 00:50:14.800
it's a whole separate show or whatever because the south has a complicated

921
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:18.490
relationship with race and racism and it's not simple and there's a lot of

922
00:50:18.491 --> 00:50:21.490
issues,
but there are also a lot of improvements.
Uh,

923
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.420
but certainly you don't see the kind of institutional racism that we used to.

924
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:29.540
There's some weird stuff around and whether that touches into it or not because

925
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:33.530
it's also got seriously legitimate things that need to be heard and discussed

926
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.260
that the left progressive left,

927
00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.560
cause I don't want to lump the whole left into the progressive left refuses to

928
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.570
have those conversations.
Honestly,
you know,

929
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:44.240
when you dump 1.8 million people into a culture,

930
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.320
all of a sudden would have a totally different culture.
Things happen when they,

931
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:47.751
you know,
there's,

932
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:51.650
there's real issues around immigration and I really wish we could have grown up

933
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:53.150
conversations about it instead of,
oh,

934
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.590
it's 100% open borders versus 100% you know,

935
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.110
build a wall or whatever the hell it is.

936
00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.360
And so I wish we could have a real conversation there.

937
00:50:59.361 --> 00:51:02.690
And part of the reason we can't is because one side is like it's racist to have

938
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:03.524
the conversation.

939
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.510
So I do actually generally agree with you that the crusade to make race more

940
00:51:08.511 --> 00:51:08.961
salient,

941
00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:12.350
which is almost directly out of critical race theory and the crusade to make

942
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:15.650
gender identity more salient,
which was almost straight out of gender theory.

943
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.620
We can go on dry dental,
the sexuality theory,
Fat Studies,

944
00:51:18.621 --> 00:51:20.900
while we write down the list of every identity category.

945
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:25.880
You can imagine the intersectional Matrix of dominance that increases.

946
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:29.720
Everybody's touching us,
everybody's willingness to be offended and everybody's,

947
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.920
everybody who can manipulate their offense to their own advantage,

948
00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:36.500
their ability and willingness maybe to take that advantage where,
yeah,
where it's

949
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.840
<v 3>there.
All right.</v>

950
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:43.070
Well that's why I believe it is the most dangerous set of ideas out there.

951
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:45.770
I believe that this set of ideas,
the way you just laid it out,

952
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:48.920
is far more dangerous than anything I'm seeing out of what Trump's saying.

953
00:51:48.921 --> 00:51:51.320
And again,
someone that didn't even vote for Trump,

954
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.890
I would say that that is what is going to turn neighbor against neighbor.

955
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.040
You will look at your neighbor and judge them by the color of their skin and

956
00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:59.390
what they should get for that.

957
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.990
Or because they're overweight or because they're a woman or because they're gay.

958
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.060
I mean,
that is what it,
it,
it's the,

959
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.250
it's the complete ripping of the fabric of everything that America is.
Yeah.

960
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:14.120
I have four.
The idea after,
I mean,
I certainly agree with that.

961
00:52:14.121 --> 00:52:18.430
I have to pause on the Trump thing.
I,
yeah,
me too.
I've been on a Trump die.
I,
I,

962
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.820
I just,
I so can't stand,
we almost did an hour without saying Trump.

963
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:27.320
Um,
yeah.
And you know what?
I don't mean to make it either or,

964
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:29.630
but this vision,
no question about it.

965
00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:34.250
That this is a toxin and it's contagious and it's destroying our societies.

966
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:35.271
And again,

967
00:52:35.271 --> 00:52:40.250
it's coming from one place and if people want to know why should they care about

968
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.020
a bought a bunch of Kooky academics,

969
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:45.380
it's because this stuff spills out into the real world and it spills out

970
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:50.300
consistently and we've now trained an entire generation of people both to be

971
00:52:50.301 --> 00:52:53.930
brittle when they hear something to be offended like that.

972
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:59.030
If you have a belief that's an evidenced or if you're a intensely ideological

973
00:52:59.031 --> 00:52:59.780
person,

974
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.440
then you have to do something to make up the slack when someone contradicts you,

975
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:07.820
when you're faced with an alternative and idea,
you can lie,
you can be offended,

976
00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:10.580
we can walk away,
you can scream at people and call them a racist,

977
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:14.720
but you can't engage their ideas.
And now we've taught in an empty,

978
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:19.100
deeply concerned about this because we've taught an entire generation of kids to

979
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.810
to not do that.

980
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.620
What we should be doing is to not teach them how to suspend their judgments,

981
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:26.070
but to make better,
more

982
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.580
<v 2>discerning judgments particularly is that spills into the moral sphere.</v>

983
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.490
So how worried are you then,
um,

984
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:37.470
when this really seeps into the political system really does seem to me that

985
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:40.710
that's the horizon horizon right now.
If you look where all the energy is,

986
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.160
it's behind the set of young democratic socialists perfectly believe all of

987
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:49.500
this.
So that's why I'm,
that's why I think it's perfect.

988
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.120
I personally feel like Trump has borderline and unmitigated disaster now we've

989
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:56.070
done really well or institutions have been strong.

990
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:58.830
So I get worried about anybody who wants to tear down,
insert institutions,

991
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:03.000
given that they are a check or if he's a,
if he's an out of control executive,

992
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:06.780
that the institutional thing itself is what controls the out of control

993
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:07.231
executive.

994
00:54:07.231 --> 00:54:10.920
That's the point of eliminating executive power is at the institution is broader

995
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:14.040
and you don't put it all in a tyrant or whatever.
If that comes along,

996
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:17.340
I don't know that he's a tyrant,
he's whatever.
But if I think,

997
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.210
let's say that I think,

998
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.450
and it's not perfectly true that he's the the most dangerous thing that's

999
00:54:21.451 --> 00:54:22.890
happening in the world right now.
I actually,

1000
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:25.470
and this is you want your controversy to see if I can talk Pete for ones.

1001
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:29.850
Come on,
give me some money.
I think Trump is a result of the regressive left.

1002
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:34.290
I think that he got elected because he stood up and he would,

1003
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:37.560
you know all these,
these skulls for years and years and years.

1004
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:39.150
You can't say that.
You can't think that.

1005
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:44.070
You can't say that in Trump would just say it and so who?
Who's watching this?

1006
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.730
You have this entire group of people who are sick.
I live in the south.

1007
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.580
I talked to him all the time.
I know these people,
these are good,

1008
00:54:50.581 --> 00:54:54.360
decent people there.
No,
most of the time,
no fan of Trump in general.

1009
00:54:54.361 --> 00:54:57.720
They don't like what he's doing politically and yet they're like,

1010
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.160
he doesn't care that those people said you can't say that.

1011
00:55:02.161 --> 00:55:07.050
He said it anyway he does.
You know you can't say such and such about this group.

1012
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.900
Trump says it.
They think,
wow,

1013
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.280
here's this kind of like Avatar of me being able to,
you know,

1014
00:55:14.281 --> 00:55:16.470
somebody else who can take the fall for it.
Take the heat for it.

1015
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:17.970
Because if I say it,
I'm going to get blasted.

1016
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.650
He says that he doesn't get in trouble.

1017
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:24.300
That appealed to a lot of people and then you have an election that was a very

1018
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:28.170
narrow margin.
You don't need a lot of people to have flipped a margin.

1019
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:33.171
So I think the reason we got Trump was very significantly to do with the fact

1020
00:55:33.661 --> 00:55:34.290
that this stuff,

1021
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:38.520
especially in 2015 decided to blow up to like the only thing you can talk about,

1022
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:39.930
check your privilege,
check your privilege,

1023
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.330
everything and I'm afraid we're going to get it again.

1024
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.650
And the reason I'm afraid especially is maybe you do,
maybe you don't know this,

1025
00:55:46.651 --> 00:55:50.100
I just recently found out that they're going to let trans athletes compete in

1026
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:52.710
the Summer Games in 2020 right before the election.

1027
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:54.300
I actually haven't heard that.
Yeah.

1028
00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:57.510
So they're going to let the Trans Athletes Compete as women in the,

1029
00:55:57.511 --> 00:55:58.650
in the 2020 games.

1030
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.970
And that's going to happen literally a couple months before the next election.

1031
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.970
The trans bathroom thing was a giant wedge issue.

1032
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.110
Who drummed it up as a wedge issue?
I don't know.
But that's a whole,

1033
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:13.090
like that's a fracture point in society right now.

1034
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:17.970
And it is one because of the gender theory doesn't play out to where anybody can

1035
00:56:17.971 --> 00:56:22.200
understand what's going on and it feels like they're being told how they have to

1036
00:56:22.201 --> 00:56:23.034
think on issues.

1037
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.420
And so then you finally have somebody who comes along and you see something

1038
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:26.640
that's outrageous,
whether it's the bathrooms,

1039
00:56:26.641 --> 00:56:30.260
if when you start having like a trans wrestler that like slam some woman

1040
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.000
<v 3>right when you were seeing there's going to be horrible for overseas,</v>

1041
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.120
which like the MMA fighter and stuff that's just like,

1042
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.170
<v 2>and broke her jaw and it's just horrifying.</v>

1043
00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:40.620
There's something off here and everybody can see it.

1044
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.430
So I really think that these,
again,
these gender issues,
race issues,

1045
00:56:44.431 --> 00:56:48.570
these stupid culture war issues are going to possibly prove decisive.

1046
00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:49.740
So anybody who's,

1047
00:56:49.741 --> 00:56:53.880
who's out there that thinks that Trump is an unmitigated disaster has to pay

1048
00:56:53.881 --> 00:56:57.890
attention to the fact of how the audience that votes for him thinks about

1049
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.320
<v 3>this social justice crap and what it's doing for them.</v>

1050
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:04.780
So I mentioned this when I had Peterson in Shapiro on,

1051
00:57:04.781 --> 00:57:08.920
but in a weird way is this where let's say three guys,

1052
00:57:08.921 --> 00:57:10.750
I can't consider myself part of the left anymore,

1053
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:14.320
but I know you do and I think you do,
but I still consider myself a liberal,

1054
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:15.790
but that's okay,
fine.
Sure.

1055
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.520
But is this where we should all be looking in the mirror and going,
man,

1056
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:22.960
this is actually the failure of the liberals that when when this monster was

1057
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.050
reconstituting itself in the name of progressivism,

1058
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:30.090
that all the liberals just kind of jumped on board and knew something was kind

1059
00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:34.480
of off like where are the liberals?
The liberals were,
I mean I get it.

1060
00:57:34.481 --> 00:57:38.770
We can name 20 people.
Okay,
great.
Yeah,
I'm not a big fan of blame at this point.

1061
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.710
I just want to fix all it'd be to mean if we want to fix it,

1062
00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.310
we have to figure out where our fault points where right.

1063
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:47.710
That well if we want to fix it,
we have to say what's the best step forward.

1064
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:51.250
And to your comment that you just made,

1065
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.280
I don't think that the solution to this is to elect people to office who are

1066
00:57:56.501 --> 00:58:00.580
steeped in identity based politics.
I think that's completely agree with that.

1067
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.770
That's a reaction to,

1068
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.560
<v 2>this is what I see.
A two.
Yeah.
Nick escalating series of reactions as well,</v>

1069
00:58:07.561 --> 00:58:10.200
how it's happened.
And what was that recent study?
It was,

1070
00:58:10.201 --> 00:58:12.730
I think they wrote about it and the Atlantic and there was the eight,

1071
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:15.960
seven political tribes,
right?
8% our social justice people,

1072
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:20.730
some comparable percent are in two factions are far right.
That's right.
People.

1073
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:25.350
And then you have this gigantic swath in the middle who are in the keyword was

1074
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.780
politically exhausted.
So where are the liberals?

1075
00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.800
They're putting their head down and they're being quiet because those lunatic

1076
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:36.300
fringes are,
whether it's classical liberals center or right,

1077
00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.880
or even dipping into the left because it works that way,

1078
00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.780
whether it's left liberals,
but you know,
true liberals are,
are,

1079
00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:46.080
are the people who need to rise up and say,
hey look,
no,

1080
00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:48.300
our society is a liberal society.
We're gonna,

1081
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:51.930
we're gonna make sure it stays that way.
In the rest,
it's politics.

1082
00:58:51.931 --> 00:58:53.940
You know how we're going to sort out these issues as politics,

1083
00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:56.100
but we have to get to a place where we can have politics again,

1084
00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:58.590
where these lunatic fringes don't want to have it.

1085
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.980
But I had this idea a couple of years ago that what we're seeing is,

1086
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:03.780
and I think this is what's triggered the problem,

1087
00:59:03.781 --> 00:59:06.660
and liberals are just sick of getting yelled at and they're tired and it's

1088
00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:09.090
exhausting.
It's constant fighting.
It's constant war.

1089
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.260
Most people don't want to fight.

1090
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:15.420
But you have these two sides and each one is able to convince the people closer

1091
00:59:15.421 --> 00:59:17.910
to it that the other side's the next essential threat.

1092
00:59:17.911 --> 00:59:20.100
So every time my wedge issue comes up,

1093
00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:24.320
every person that sees themselves on the left sides with whatever that furthest

1094
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:26.990
faction is,
when it comes down to it's gotta be this,

1095
00:59:26.991 --> 00:59:30.890
or it's gotta be that because they're so afraid that if the Conservatives get

1096
00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:34.040
power,
you know,
gays aren't gonna be able to get married,

1097
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:36.200
they're going to overturn roe versus Wade did.

1098
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.690
Everybody's going to have a coat hanger abortions or something.

1099
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:40.850
The next thing you know,
climate change is going to ruin the planet.

1100
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.580
They've in the people on the conservative side,
see the same thing.

1101
00:59:43.581 --> 00:59:46.370
If the Liberals get power,
if those Democrats get power,

1102
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.750
we're going to have open borders.

1103
00:59:47.751 --> 00:59:50.030
Muslims are going to be flooding in rapists from Mexico.

1104
00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:52.850
It's going to be this whole thing and they freak out and it's an excess.

1105
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:55.640
They feel existential threat if the other side gets power.

1106
00:59:55.641 --> 00:59:59.750
And what that's done has been this ratcheting up of tension.

1107
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.740
So the people in the middle get exhausted and they only make a choice when they

1108
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.360
feel forced to make a choice.

1109
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:09.830
And then they don't choose to be with that extremist group,
right?

1110
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.160
They trues not to be with those and they take,
take,
uh,

1111
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:17.900
they take a very broad stroke side.
What's the solution to this?
Shut up.

1112
01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:20.310
Extremists were going down the middle now,
right?

1113
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.390
So somebody comes out with an extremist thing and it's that same thing I said

1114
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:26.630
earlier,
I know what that is.
No,
we're not doing that.

1115
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:27.800
I think one of the most important things,

1116
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:31.730
and this is in our forthcoming book about how to have impossible conversations.

1117
01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:32.690
Peter and I just finished,

1118
01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.950
one of the most important things is to learn to disavow the extremists on your

1119
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:40.880
side,
so if you see yourself on the left,
say,
you know those guys,

1120
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:44.720
they don't represent me way off to the left.
I think I'm on the left,

1121
01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:48.170
but I distinguished myself from them and learn how to articulate that and then

1122
01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:49.460
the left can clean up inside.

1123
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:54.020
You can get that main body of people on the left speaking out saying those the

1124
01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:57.230
80% don't represent us.
Here's what we really believe,
and on the right,

1125
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:59.480
the same thing.
If you're on the right,
you say,
you know what,
fine,

1126
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:02.660
I'm on the right.
Good.
Those dudes way over there,

1127
01:01:02.661 --> 01:01:05.390
these guys that want to dissolve the government and drown in the bathtub used to

1128
01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:08.360
be the saying,
right?
There's shrink it to the size.
You can drown in about them.

1129
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.450
They don't represent me.
Okay.
That goes too far.

1130
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:15.170
We need a society that functions that goes too far.
I have conservative values.

1131
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.540
I have this,
I have that.
But that goes too far.

1132
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.200
And if you then the right can start cleaning itself up because right now if the

1133
01:01:21.201 --> 01:01:24.580
left tries to insist the right cleanup,
the right can't hear it

1134
01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.620
<v 1>because it's an existential polarizations.</v>

1135
01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:29.350
Interesting to me because I agree with you obviously on the left part that the

1136
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:31.000
left knee,
the liberals need to do that.

1137
01:01:31.001 --> 01:01:32.860
But to me the right basically is doing that.

1138
01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.440
They're fighting constantly about these things because you've got healthy

1139
01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:38.920
branches of Trump people and never Trumpers.
And Libertarians.
There's,

1140
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.330
there's actually some debate versus one side has the religious and the x

1141
01:01:43.331 --> 01:01:43.680
community.

1142
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:44.940
<v 2>I feel like that has,</v>

1143
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.970
has come to be the case over the past maybe four or five years.

1144
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.140
I feel like there is,

1145
01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:53.190
there has been a change to more openness and more dialogue on the right and I

1146
01:01:53.191 --> 01:01:57.570
think it's a necessary corrective to what they're seeing from the far left.

1147
01:01:57.571 --> 01:02:01.030
I don't think that was the case,
uh,
10 years ago.
Um,

1148
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:04.020
I feel like at the time of the right was locked down to the left was kind of

1149
01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:09.021
having these squabbles and then it's kind of switched which side is

1150
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.250
recalcitrant.
And I think it'll probably switch again then

1151
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.920
<v 1>eventually.
Oh,
I'm curious since both of you guys are outspoken,
atheist,
are,</v>

1152
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:19.260
is part of your worry about all of this that it seems that this set of the

1153
01:02:19.261 --> 01:02:21.930
postmodern thing is very anti religious in its own way.

1154
01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:24.000
Now I know you're okay with the anti religion part,

1155
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.980
but because they've used this set of ideas as their own religion,
does that,

1156
01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.790
you know in any way,
do you see that as a weakness of atheism?

1157
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.380
You know what I mean?
Like they've by,
by removing all religion altogether,

1158
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.120
they had a void of belief.

1159
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:42.780
So now they just picked this belief that may be the skeptic community or the

1160
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:45.370
atheist community or something needed to do more to,

1161
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.310
to provide some sort of groundwork

1162
01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:49.430
<v 2>solution hypothesis.
Right.</v>

1163
01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:52.820
And so my background for the last several years before I became a renegade

1164
01:02:52.821 --> 01:02:53.580
feminist

1165
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.260
<v 1>was a your Twitter bio.
It is.
That is your Twitter bio?</v>

1166
01:02:58.810 --> 01:02:59.130
Yeah.

1167
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:04.130
Renegade gender scholar or something happened in their [inaudible] hypothesis is

1168
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:07.010
important.
And I think that,
you know,

1169
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:10.440
next time we have a car tissue with Peterson or yeah we should talk to him about

1170
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.680
this is this is I think one of the things that people misunderstand so well

1171
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:17.150
that's why I love you.
So there's three

1172
01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.800
<v 2>pillars to why people at a psychosocial level,
they call it,</v>

1173
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:23.990
why they believe or why they ascribed to religions,
what,

1174
01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.100
what function do they play sociologically and psychologically.

1175
01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.580
One is for a feeling of,
of meaning,
making purpose,
morality,

1176
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.570
Cetera and understanding the world.
And that is kind of,

1177
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:36.250
I think what the substitution hypothesis often touches upon.

1178
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.190
Like they had this path to find meaning.
Then it went away.

1179
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:42.070
God was killed by the postmodern deconstruction.

1180
01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.550
Now they don't have a meaning structure.
Then they look also for community.
How,

1181
01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.120
how communities are formed,
how they're organized,
how you,

1182
01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:53.590
how you find standing within your community.
That also got deconstructed.
Um,

1183
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.740
so there's an aspect to both of those that people are trying to fill in.

1184
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.290
I don't think that that explains extremism though.

1185
01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.580
So the work that I've done looking into the psychology of extra of extremism is

1186
01:04:03.581 --> 01:04:04.690
the extremism isn't,

1187
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:08.020
you don't go extreme because you're looking for meaning because you have people

1188
01:04:08.021 --> 01:04:12.160
who are moderate religious people all over the world who are very,
very devout,

1189
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.330
who aren't extremists.

1190
01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:17.530
And you don't get extreme necessarily just a form of community.
You can,

1191
01:04:17.531 --> 01:04:21.640
those are calls where you start to find extremism is where people,

1192
01:04:21.641 --> 01:04:24.730
the third dimension that people go to religion for is to have a sense of control

1193
01:04:24.731 --> 01:04:25.420
in life.

1194
01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.260
And I feel like we're in a state probably because of many technological advances

1195
01:04:29.261 --> 01:04:32.500
happening so rapidly with the Internet blooming and everything is so different

1196
01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:36.280
now than it was when I was a kid.
You know,
Nintendo was the thing.

1197
01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:37.660
And now that we've got this,
you know,

1198
01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:41.830
huge internet and indeed global connectedness,
I can text people in Australia,

1199
01:04:41.831 --> 01:04:44.380
I could get my phone right now and do it and it immediately.

1200
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.400
So we've got this whole different world now and I think what's happened is

1201
01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:51.490
people are feeling a loss of control now.

1202
01:04:51.491 --> 01:04:54.460
Part of that's going to come because there's been this massive deconstruction of

1203
01:04:54.461 --> 01:04:57.010
institutions alongside it.
Um,

1204
01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:02.470
but I feel like the extremism that you see comes less from a meaning making

1205
01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:07.090
place and more from a feeling out of control place.

1206
01:05:07.091 --> 01:05:09.760
Because when you feel out of control,
you try to lock things down.

1207
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.220
And so I think the,
actually,

1208
01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:16.030
if you want to look at like a big political kind of solution to ratchet things

1209
01:05:16.031 --> 01:05:16.970
down is it's,

1210
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:20.410
it's very important right now that we start trying to look at things that will

1211
01:05:20.411 --> 01:05:25.411
actually succeed and giving people a greater sense that society is under control

1212
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:29.740
and a culture we're sure as hell isn't that.
And then the,
you know,

1213
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:31.420
being politically panicked,

1214
01:05:31.421 --> 01:05:35.590
whether it's the Obama's in office and he's going to ruin the universe from the

1215
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:37.060
conservative side or Trump's in office,

1216
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:39.820
he's going to ruin the universe from the liberal side.
Whatever it is,

1217
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.230
that panic isn't a feeling of control.
It's a feeling of being out of control.

1218
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:47.520
And that's why these issues carry existential concern for people and they,

1219
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:49.450
they're go so extreme.
So I think it's,

1220
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:53.350
I think that both the community and the meaning making structures are relevant,

1221
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:54.210
but to combined,

1222
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.910
they probably explain less than 20% of what we're seeing with these kinds of

1223
01:05:57.911 --> 01:06:01.180
postmodern religions or whatever.
And most of it,

1224
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.660
at least in their extremist forums where they matter like hipsters or a

1225
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:07.630
postmodern religion and who cares?
Who Cares?

1226
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.780
But where it gets troublesome as where you have people who feel like they're out

1227
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:13.870
of control and if they don't exert authoritarian control,

1228
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:15.490
everything's going to be terrible.

1229
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.420
And so I think that it's more of a more an access of control than an access of

1230
01:06:19.421 --> 01:06:22.630
meaning making.
Although it is more difficult,
uh,

1231
01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:26.620
to find meaning in a world where you don't just have this grand sweeping

1232
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:29.920
narrative of whether it's religion,
whether it's nationalism,

1233
01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:34.180
whether it's whatever it is,
um,
western values as a big one.
Right?

1234
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:38.020
So I think,
you know,
Bret Weinstein I saw was tweeting about this the other day.

1235
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:38.590
I think there's a,

1236
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.890
there's a thing where we all had this shared narrative of what it means to be

1237
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:43.330
American or the shared narrative,

1238
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:47.110
what it means to be spreading democracy abroad or whatever the thing was.

1239
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:50.830
You know,
this western thing and that even if you are religious or not religious,

1240
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.080
you could lock into that.
And there was this kind of shared meaning.

1241
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.870
So that's the one I would be thinking is the most scary.

1242
01:06:55.871 --> 01:07:00.010
That we're deconstructing the fact that these people are so focused on race,

1243
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:02.260
are so focused on gender,
et Cetera is one thing.

1244
01:07:02.261 --> 01:07:05.890
But the fact that they're so focused on being anti Western centric,

1245
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.290
everything that the west,

1246
01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:11.650
it is imbued with dominance and colonialism and power and it's always trying to

1247
01:07:11.651 --> 01:07:14.920
maintain itself.
So that's the thing we need to deconstruct most.

1248
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:16.610
That's the scariest idea.
Yeah.

1249
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:21.390
<v 3>All right.
P bring us home on a hopeful note that we can not only turn the tide,</v>

1250
01:07:21.391 --> 01:07:24.060
but we can get enough people to be brave enough and the emails will come

1251
01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:28.950
anonymously and that we can restore some,
some sanity or James billionaire fact.

1252
01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:32.400
Not only,
not only can we do this,
but we are doing it.

1253
01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.030
People are starting to respectfully speak on in their classes.

1254
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:41.370
People are starting to sign their names to two petitions and letters of support

1255
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.810
and people are starting to genuinely attempt to be honest brokers of

1256
01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:48.360
conversation after it,

1257
01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:51.840
a minimum of five years of feeling that they couldn't speak openly or they

1258
01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:52.770
couldn't speak freely.

1259
01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:56.400
So there's no question at all that the tide is turning and that something has

1260
01:07:56.401 --> 01:07:57.480
changed in the air.

1261
01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.780
I think that the next steps forward are that not only do we continue to question

1262
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.210
within the class,
within the academic environment,

1263
01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.770
but we also do so in a way that's civil and polite and respectful.

1264
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:14.550
We never want to lose that in our society and we've seen the consequences of

1265
01:08:14.551 --> 01:08:15.380
that already.

1266
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:20.380
So reason has been slapped around and people feel rightly so that they haven't

1267
01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:26.711
been able to to speak out and in a way that accords with their conscience and

1268
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.900
the step to get back to those values I think is to continue to attempt to be

1269
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:36.350
civil and have an honest conversation with somebody.
And if,

1270
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.110
if you're met with rage or anger,

1271
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.680
the response is not to meet someone that rage or anger.
I'll keep doing it.

1272
01:08:42.681 --> 01:08:46.070
If you guys keep doing it fair,
we'll keep doing it.
Quintin.
Alright,

1273
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.660
follow these guys on Twitter.

1274
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:52.430
It's at conceptual James and at Peter Boghossian and we'll link to where you

1275
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:54.620
want me to link to one of the videos.
Fortunately,

1276
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.980
Mike name his youtube channel as the place to go if you want to see what we're

1277
01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:00.560
up to,
what we've been up to,
what we've done,
what he's putting out.

1278
01:09:00.561 --> 01:09:04.250
It's all on the same theme.
He's his youtube channels,
our hub,
and great,

1279
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.350
don't miss it.
We're going to have a link to that right down below.
