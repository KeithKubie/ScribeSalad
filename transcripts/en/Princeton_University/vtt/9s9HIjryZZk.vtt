Kamelia Lechani:
and we are getting ready
to go to college.

Fred Swaniker:
I think it's a great time to be a young African right now.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.110
Fred Swaniker:
Because Africa today is maybe what
China was 20 or 30 years ago.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.480
Fred Swaniker:
It's just starting to take off.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.360
Fred Swaniker:
These young people are the ones
who are going to be able

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.290
Fred Swaniker:
to capture these opportunities.

Julio Blaise Maniratunga:
So, what people would hear about leadership,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.770
Julio Blaise Maniratunga:
they may think it's only
about politics and stuff,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.910 position:58%
but it's actually almost in anything.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.620

Fred Swaniker:
A leader's effectiveness is only partly a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.770
Fred Swaniker:
function of their skills.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.930
Fred Swaniker:
A huge part of the effectiveness
is the quality

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.320
Fred Swaniker:
of the networks that they have.
And the most powerful

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.760
Fred Swaniker:
network that these young leaders
have is actually with each other.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.720
Heather Haynes:

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.970

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.540
Steve Boehlke:
The most enduring way to impact

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.860
Steve Boehlke:
leadership behavior is through
what I call "breakthrough

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.500
Steve Boehlke:
awareness," where the
light bulb goes on.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.900
Steve Boehlke:
And that's what's terrific about
the opportunities to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.930
Steve Boehlke:
work in the outdoors that the
Blairstown Center provides.

All you really have is yourself, the board,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.850

Olivia Iloetonma:
Being at the Princeton-Blairstown

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.880
Olivia Iloetonma:
Center, surrounded with such
support, gave me the ability

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.290
Olivia Iloetonma:
to have the courage to step up
and do something I've never

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.540
Olivia Iloetonma:
done before.

Courage Matiza:
We basically had to travel from one tree to

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.420
Mattie Lillian Maboya:
I felt like I can do it.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.620 position:59%
Mattie Lillian Maboya:
Like, if all these people think that I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.460
can do it, why not?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.320
Mcebo Maziya:
What I learned today was the power

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.960
Mcebo Maziya:
of respect for one another.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.940
Mcebo Maziya:
The power of taking

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.510
Mcebo Maziya:
responsibility for your actions.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.360
Mcebo Maziya:
And the power of cooperation.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.960
Mcebo Maziya:
Because you can't make
a big change alone.

Chris Bradford:
One of the great things about working

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.640
Chris Bradford:
with these young leaders is that
they will start to draw

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.940
Chris Bradford:
connections between different
fields as they build

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.110
Chris Bradford:
organizations with far-reaching
impact.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.420
Chris Bradford:
So we're looking not only for
the people who will build the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.020
Chris Bradford:
Googles of Africa, but also for
the prominent writers of

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.810
Chris Bradford:
the future, or artists.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.390
Chris Bradford:
And if we can bring them into
one network, we think that

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.110
Chris Bradford:
they can collaborate through
their lives to create a very

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.310
Chris Bradford:
different Africa.

Kiiru "Sam" Gichohi:
You can only handle a network of 120

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.110
Kiiru "Sam" Gichohi:
people in your life
at any given time.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.760
Kiiru "Sam" Gichohi:
And I plan on finding the 120
people who matter most to me

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.630
Kiiru "Sam" Gichohi:
in the world, and in those 120
people, to find the five or

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.960
Kiiru "Sam" Gichohi:
seven who make me a better
person every day.

Courage Matiza:
This session basically helped me to really

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.550
Courage Matiza:
look and say, "OK, this is
what I've received.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.720
Courage Matiza:
What is it that I want to
embrace, and what is that I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.970
Courage Matiza:
want to release?"

Chris Bradford:
What we're trying to do is connect these

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.090
Chris Bradford:
amazing young leaders with
individuals who can help them

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.820
Chris Bradford:
make their dreams become a reality.

Shirley M. Tilghman:
It is so inspiring to see the students

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.520
Shirley M. Tilghman:
who are setting as one of their
goals, to become the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.950
Shirley M. Tilghman:
generation of leaders who are
going to really make Africa a

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.560
Shirley M. Tilghman:
place that is prosperous and
healthy and forward-thinking

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.590
Shirley M. Tilghman:
for all of its people.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.850
Shirley M. Tilghman:
It is a mission that we resonate
with very much here

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.250
Shirley M. Tilghman:
at Princeton,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.650
Shirley M. Tilghman:
not just leaders for Africa, but
the importance of leaders

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.610
Shirley M. Tilghman:
to get us through these very,
very stormy times.

Andrew McLaughlin:
What social networks do very well, online

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.690
Andrew McLaughlin:
social networks, is that they
make weak ties easy.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.930
Andrew McLaughlin:
Since the fall of Mubarak, the
national sound of Egypt is the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.670
Andrew McLaughlin:
sound of chairs being pulled
together in a circle.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.900
Andrew McLaughlin:
The weak ties of the online
social world are becoming

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.300
Andrew McLaughlin:
stronger ties as people get to
know each other face to face

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.240

in real life.

out there who are

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.600
Courage Matiza:
waiting to help me.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.500
Courage Matiza:
I just need to ask them.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.640 position:64%
Olivia Iloetonma:
To see it in myself, to stand up and take

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.090
Olivia Iloetonma:
initiative and move forward --

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.100
Olivia Iloetonma:
follow the road not taken, as
Robert Frost would say --

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.050
Olivia Iloetonma:
that's the thing I'll take

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.750

out the most. Yep.
