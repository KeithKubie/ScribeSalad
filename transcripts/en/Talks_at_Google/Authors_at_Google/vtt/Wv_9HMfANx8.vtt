[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:08.100
JORDAN THIBODEAU: We're
joined by Boyd Varty.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.030
Boyd was raised in Londolozi
game reserve in South Africa.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.010
He currently lives and
works at the reserve.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.410
And his most recent
projects include

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.332
advocating for restoration
of ancient elephant corridor,

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:21.540
helping the Good Work
Foundation create more learning

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.734
centers in South Africa.

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:24.150
He wrote a book
called, "Cathedral

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.240
of the Wild" about his
experiences at Londolozi.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.210
Londolozi has been in his
family for four generations now.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.120
And he's going to join us
here to share his experiences.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.818
So let's give him a
warm round of applause.

00:00:36.818 --> 00:00:39.570
BOYD VARTY: Thank you, so much.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.040
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
So starting off,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.530
can you talk about Londolozi?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.090
BOYD VARTY: Sure, so Londolozi,
the story of Londolozi begins

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.130
like a lot of good
stories with the intake

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.380
of large quantities of gin.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.670
And it begins in 1926 with my
great-grandfather at a tennis

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.350
party in Johannesburg.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.630
And he heard about these
bankrupt cattle farms

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.940
that lay adjacent to
the Kruger National Park

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.570
in the wild eastern
part of South Africa.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.970
And they had come up for sale
because they were bankrupt.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.080
And they were bankrupt
for two reasons.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.470
The one was that it's very
rough terrain out there.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.740
It's low rainfall.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.720
It's a difficult
area to operate in.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.490
And the other was
that lions were

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.290
eating all of the cattle that
roamed at the cattle ranch.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.720
And in 1926, my
great-grandfather

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.620
was an adventurer.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.000
He was a hunter.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.150
And this place that sounded
terrible to everyone else,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.737
sounded like a wild
place where you

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:36.570
could go and have an
adventure to him, where

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.445
you could go and hunt lions,
particularly, hunt lions and go

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:42.810
and hunt animals.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.380
And so sight unseen, after
too many gin and tonics,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.150
they bought the property.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.700
And they went down there for
the first time in June of 1926.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.870
And it was a whole
rigmarole to get there.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.240
You had to go out to these
sort of real border towns.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.569
And they caught a train.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.110
And the train ran through the
southern part of this property.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.600
And they bribed the
train driver to stop.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.840
And they got off and they
walked on a compass bearing

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.110
directly north into
this wild hinterland.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.970
They didn't know
where they were going.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.544
Halfway along the way, the
porters who they had with them

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:19.710
said, well, this is madness.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.510
We're being led to death here.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.760
And my great-grandfather
spoke a bit of Zulu.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.370
And he was able to talk
them into keep going.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.680
And eventually, just
as night was falling,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.230
they arrived under this
big beautiful ebony tree

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.770
on the banks of the river.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.780
And that's where they sort
of set up their first hunting

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.280
camp.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.160
And the hunting camp was--
and I should tell you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400
that the story moves
away from hunting.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.390
And I think the
story of this place

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.810
holds so much of what I
think is pertinent today.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.140
So you know what they did
is they went there to hunt.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.510
And they came down
every year in the winter

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.890
to hunt lions and leopards.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.780
And there wasn't a
lot of game there.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.220
The property was very run down.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.930
It was eye-high scrub.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.750
And they built these
three mud huts.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.470
It was very rudimentary.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.200
I'm told that people,
when it rained,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.260
would go and stand outside of
the accommodations for shelter.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.821
Because the accommodations
were so leaky and open.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.820
But for three generations,
that's what happened.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.990
They went there and they would
hunt, particularly predators.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.240
And then in 1969, my
grandfather died very suddenly.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.830
And my father and my uncle
were about 14 and 15 years old.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.984
And they were told by all of
the family advisors, look,

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.150
you've lost your father now.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.715
You need to look
after your mother.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.090
And the first
thing is you've got

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.210
to get rid of that wild
place where you go and hunt.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.160
Hunting is a bad
idea to start with.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.470
And you got to get rid of it.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.250
And they said, no, we feel
compelled towards that place.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.125
We feel called to it.

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.708
And they said, well,
how are you going

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:56.940
to look after your mother?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.910
And as teenage boys, and
I think this was probably

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.240
the beauty and arrogance
of youth, they said,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.920
we will make it pay.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.740
And that's how my family got
into the safari business.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.270
These two young
boys decided they

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.390
would make this place viable.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.079
And they decided that they would
take the entire safari business

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.589
in one go.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.800
They would do canoe
safaris, hunting safaris,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.850
walking safaris.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.020
And people would come down
and stay in these mud huts.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.810
And the first canoe safari, they
hit a hippo with their canoe.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.080
So they canceled canoe safaris.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.700
The walking safaris were
always a bit of a mess.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.100
And so it was very, you
know, they had one Land Rover

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.308
that they would drive around.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:38.710
But it only turned to the left.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.410
And if you went
there, the other thing

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.140
was in a month or
two of being there,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.280
you might see very sparse
game, a few antelope, maybe

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.020
the occasional lion or leopard.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.160
And it was trying to
get away from you.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.210
And so they were trying
to do this endeavor.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.570
But they had no guidance.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.860
And it was a pretty
ropey operation.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.620
And then they had a
real defining encounter.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.440
They met a man by the
name of Ken Tinley.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.460
And Ken was this
fascinating character.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.230
He had dropped out
of high school,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.700
but then been admitted into
a biological sciences degree.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.420
Because he drew a picture of a
moth with such intricate detail

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.810
that the dean of the biology
faculty said to him, OK,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.170
you're in.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.360
And then he had worked as
a scientist in the Kruger

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.420
National Park, where he
hadn't been well-received.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.050
Because he was a real
early believer in the idea

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.000
that all things are connected.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.520
And he was sounding
off on people's

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.760
intellectual territory,
the expert on lions,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.760
the expert on elephants.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.000
And he was saying we need
to look at it holistically.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.030
So he wasn't so well
received in the Kruger.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.370
And he went to a reserve
in Mozambique for awhile.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.010
And he lived in solitude
for about a year.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.760
And during that time, he walked
in this wild, vast landscape

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.700
of this reserve in
Mozambique called Gorongosa.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.140
And he mapped the
topography, drawing by hand.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.020
And he developed this
incredibly intricate sense

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.370
of how a landscape fits together
and how the topography informs

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.850
the flow of water and how
that informs your soils

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.610
and how that tells you
which fauna and flora you've

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.420
got there.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.010
But he thought
very holistically.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.710
And almost his connection
to the wilderness, it

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.950
almost lived inside of him.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.742
He felt it very deeply.

00:06:19.742 --> 00:06:21.450
And then the war broke
out in Mozambique.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.730
And he ran back to South Africa.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.300
And he arrived, he sort
of washed up into the camp

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.320
where I grew up.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.240
And he met these two young men.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.270
And very soon after my mother
had also moved to live there.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.840
They were living in these really
rudimentary accommodations.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.889
And they didn't really
know what they were doing.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.680
They were trying to
start a safari company.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.652
They had this vision
that they would get

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:43.860
people to come on the safari.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.680
But it wasn't really working.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.320
And he said to them, if you
want this place to work,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.670
and this was really the defining
moment or one of the defining

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.270
moments, you need to
partner with the land.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.130
You need to begin to think
of the animals as your kin.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.730
You need to think of them as
a part of an extended family

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.260
of beings.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.290
And you need to make sure that
the local people participate

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.480
in the well-being of this place.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.070
And they said to
him, well, restore

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.270
the land, partner with the
land, what do you mean?

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.870
And he said, come,
I'll show you.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.620
And he took them out
onto this terrain.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.270
And where the cattle had grazed
the land bear, what you get

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.060
is bare ground.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.524
And then when the rain falls,
you lose all of that moisture.

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:26.940
And then as you
lose the moisture,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.290
you get scrub coming in.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.420
And the scrub
starts to take over.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.219
And he showed them how you could
clear the scrub away and plug

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.010
it into where you were
losing the moisture,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.200
in these deep, erosive furrows.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.090
And it's kind of like putting
the plug back in a bath.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.610
And as you do this work
of clearing the scrub

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.330
and restoring these
micro catchments,

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.120
suddenly the grassland
started to come back.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.864
And so they started this
work of restoring the land.

00:07:50.864 --> 00:07:52.530
And suddenly, there
would be grasslands.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.030
And then one day,
you would come out

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.620
and where there had
been no animals,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.600
suddenly there would
be a herd of zebra

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.020
and then suddenly a
herd of wildebeest.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.690
And slowly, and then they
started to see nyala.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.440
And there was this real sense
that as they had this intention

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.400
to work with the land, the
land was starting to respond.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.640
And about six or seven
years into that process,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.010
they had another real
defining encounter.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.104
And it was late one afternoon.

00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:20.520
They had been
working on the land.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.880
They were driving home in
this beat up old Land Rover.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.910
And into the late afternoon
light, in front of them,

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.830
in front of their Land
Rover, about 200 yards

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.010
in front of them, a leopard
stepped out onto the road.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.380
And she was a young
female leopard.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.470
And instead of running away
like every other leopard had

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.600
done ever that
they had seen, she

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.419
stopped in the late afternoon
light and she looked at them.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.340
She gave this little growl.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.820
And they saw she had
this one broken canine.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.950
And they watched
her for a moment.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.440
And there was this really
strong sense of, for a moment,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.730
they were allowed to see her.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.040
She granted them
this moment with her.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.894
And then she stepped off
the road and disappeared.

00:08:59.894 --> 00:09:01.560
And they drove home
together in silence.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.018
And I don't know
if you've ever had

00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:06.695
sort of a scary encounter in
a vehicle where you pull over

00:09:06.695 --> 00:09:08.070
and then everyone
just sits there

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.320
for a moment in
absolute silence.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.990
And then my father
looked at my uncle

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.120
and he said, whatever just
happened, that's my future.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.510
And I think it's
such an amazing thing

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.870
to have an encounter like that
with your destiny in life.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.630
And so for the next
about 10 or 12 years,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.440
he woke up every
morning and he teamed up

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.740
with a local tracker Shangaan
man called Elmon Mhlongo.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.160
And every day they went out
and they tracked that Leopard.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.200
And slowly, sometimes days would
go by, they didn't see her.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.960
And then they would see
her from a great distance

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.070
and she would disappear.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.111
And then they would see
her from a great distance

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.120
and she would allow
herself to be seen.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.199
And over the course
of years, they

00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:52.740
started to build
the trust where they

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.432
could get closer and closer.

00:09:54.432 --> 00:09:55.890
And eventually, it
got to the point

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.360
where they would sit
in a Land Rover here,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.401
and she would be where
you're sitting over there,

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:00.962
lying close by.

00:10:00.962 --> 00:10:02.670
And then one day, they
were watching her.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.530
And they knew she had
cubs somewhere nearby.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.281
Because they could see
that she was lactating.

00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:09.530
But they didn't think the
cubs were anywhere close by.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.380
And a cub came out of the
grass and ran up to the mother

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.400
and jumped onto her head.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.480
And there was this
very strong sense

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.380
that as they worked on the land,
as the land started to recover,

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.220
this emissary appeared
from the wild side.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.070
This leopard came out to
them and slowly allowed

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.714
herself to be seen.

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:31.880
And that leopard became
known as the mother leopard,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.720
because she went on to have
a number of litters of cubs.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.260
And all of those cubs grew up
modeling their mother's trust.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.850
Suddenly they knew that the
people here meant no harm.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.210
So they would allow
themselves to be seen.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.580
And so in the middle of
apartheid South Africa

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.580
where no one wanted
to go, suddenly word

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.380
started to get out
all over the world

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.270
that there was this
place you could

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.910
go to and see a wild leopard.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.830
And that lives in the psyche,
in the human psyche, the mystery

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.020
of it, the beauty
of it, the pull

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.090
of being able to have an
encounter with that cat.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.192
And so she became
the mother leopard

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:08.900
because she was the
mother of these cubs,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.770
but also because she gave an
incredible amount of momentum

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.360
to this place where I grew up.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.690
Suddenly it became a place
where people wanted to come.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.150
Suddenly more people
started to come.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.750
As they started to come,
an economy of wildlife

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.010
started to be established.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.070
So we established a
little village there.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.190
Local people started working
in the tourism industry.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:36.920
And we became all unified in
the protection of this place

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.700
as a means of looking
after our own families.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.280
And it was like this
relationship developed.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.730
As we cared for this place, it
really started caring for us.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:56.510
And so when I think about what
I do, it's really to tell people

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.735
that I have seen a restoration.

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:01.790
I have seen a place
where we've gone

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.980
from being at war with nature
to back in relation with it.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.570
And I have seen the
effects that that

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.050
can have on the people
who live on that land.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.310
You start to experience yourself
as belonging to a place.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.855
And it's this very
primary belonging.

00:12:17.855 --> 00:12:20.960
You know that it's important
for you to be here.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.150
And your value is
present with you

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.420
in the relationship
with the place.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.030
You know the animals
as a part of you.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.510
It's different every day.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.540
But there's this
sense of kinship.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.340
It's a very fundamental,
psychological belonging.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.240
And I think that a lot of
the anxiety that we see

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.190
and the depression that
we see in modern life

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.930
is undiagnosed homesickness
for belonging to a place,

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.260
for knowing yourself in
relation to other creatures,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.580
and for feeling
yourself as a part of.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.560
I always say that in a society
where the individual self is

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.890
disconnected from the greater
whole, the search for meaning

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.760
is reduced to how I am
doing in comparison.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.970
And that's sort of the
opposite of what you experience

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.560
when you live in wilderness.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.390
Because you know yourself
as belonging to all of this.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.100
And then the meaning
starts to change radically.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.790
The meaning becomes
about us in relation.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.260
The meaning becomes
about sharing.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.730
The meaning becomes
about being together, not

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.770
competing against.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.860
And that's a very
interesting experience

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.460
to have in the wild
animal of your own body.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.340
So that is what I grew up in.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.010
And that is what has
informed the sort of work

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.190
that I want to do and the
message that I want to spread.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.220
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Also, the game preserve

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.770
is known for the elephants you
brought back to the territory.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.400
Can you talk about how
you guys went about it?

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.110
BOYD VARTY: Yeah,
so what happened was

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.112
is that there was a fence
that ran between our reserve

00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:03.320
and the Kruger National Park.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.290
And the fence was called
a veterinary fence.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.560
But it was actually erected
by the apartheid government

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.080
to use the Kruger
National Park as a buffer

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.450
zone between Mozambique
and South Africa.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.090
The fence had absolutely no--

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.690
to put a fence between wildlife
and wildlife is madness.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.300
And a lot of animals
died that would

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.640
have moved in that area,
died against that fence.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.570
And very early on, we
wanted the elephants

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.890
to return to Londolozi.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.080
And so my father
and uncle set off

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.440
to do the first ever
live elephant relocation.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.030
And this was in the '70s.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.240
And they actually
caught elephants

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.470
in the Kruger National Park
and moved them in trucks

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.610
back into this area to
re-establish their presence.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.701
And they successfully did that.

00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:53.700
Although, there were many
mishaps along the way.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.908
They didn't have crates big
enough for the elephants.

00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:58.430
They put an elephant
in an antelope crate.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.520
And it breathed in and
the crate fell apart.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.370
And so there was all
sorts of shenanigans

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.420
in trying to move
elephants to this place.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.802
But very quickly we
realized that that was not

00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:08.510
the way to do it.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.430
The real thing to
do is to advocate

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.400
for the removal of the fence.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.700
And that is something
that, after Nelson Mandela

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.570
came to power in 1994, we
were actually able to achieve.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.210
And the fence came down.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.710
And as the fence came down,
it's this incredible thing

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.740
to go from having these few
elephants that had been brought

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.000
in, to watching this natural
rhythm of elephants flowing

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.260
back into the reserve.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.060
And going from a
couple of elephants

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.390
to, in the winter months,
1,500 elephants coming

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.210
into the reserve from
Kruger National Park,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.410
walking up the river.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.539
I mean, at certain
times in the winter,

00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:46.330
our camp is on the
river, and you come out.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.160
And every day there's elephants
down there in front of you.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.920
And it's this feeling
that they've returned

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.150
to where they belonged.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.520
And so anywhere,
and the core of it

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.460
is to return to this
more natural state

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.780
and live amongst it.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.010
Yeah, so that's
been a huge victory.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.340
And a part of what
I see is this place

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.530
having been a part
of the restoration

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.050
is that it's not conservation.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.360
And particularly,
in these times,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.330
it's not standing at the end
of any wild places we have left

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.550
and saying, please, can we
protect what we have left?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.990
It's starting to
say, no, if we start

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.060
to think about restoring, we
can actively go and reclaim,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.430
start to bring
nature back to life.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.340
But it comes out of a
psychology of restoration.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.080
It comes out of saying,
let's reach out,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.990
let's restore, let's bring back.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.660
And so some of my work
is to say it's possible.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.360
And I hope that a
movement of restoration

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.820
can start to take root all
over the world, where we start

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.080
to say, no, let's go actively
and reconnect with nature

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.510
and reclaim it.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.170
And there's sort of
two parts to that.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.100
And the one is active
restoration of wild places.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.930
But the other is to
restore ourselves,

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.290
to reconnect with a
deeper part of our self.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.329
Because what I see happening
is any type of healing that you

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.020
do from trauma, any type of
reconnecting with your being

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.420
that you do, if you
can get under all

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.150
of the patterns of
compensation and neuroses

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:28.520
that modern life gives us and
touch your own wild being,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.470
what happens is this
overwhelming feeling of enough,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.970
you know?

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.630
There's this feeling
that I am enough.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.530
This is enough.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.870
There is enough for all of us.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.420
And so some of the
work that I see

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.540
has to happen out in the
active physical space

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.770
of reclaiming wilderness.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.240
And other parts of it has
to happen inside of us.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.940
And we have to
discover what needs

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.720
to be restored in us as a part
of the restoration movement.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.340
Because if you can touch
that feeling of enough,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.110
your whole what drives
you in life changes.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:07.130
And the desire to consume and
have more and try and attain

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.490
more gives way to a
whole different way

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.440
of wanting to be
in life, a way that

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.750
is much more about sharing your
essence, feeling fulfilled,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.520
being involved in things
that are meaningful to you,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.710
that you care about.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.010
The whole value directive
changes when you

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.122
start to live from that place.

00:18:27.122 --> 00:18:29.330
So I think that's going to
be part of the restoration

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.290
movement.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.970
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Excellent, now for us

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.790
people who don't spend a
lot of time in the bush,

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.620
and for you, you're able to do
boarding school in Johannesburg

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.610
sometimes.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.090
Were there practices
that you use

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.310
when you're living in
Johannesburg to get yourself

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.476
back in touch with yourself?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.660
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, I mean, I
think all of the modalities

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.140
that we're seeing taking root
in the Western world, yoga,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.010
meditation, breath
work, that sort of stuff

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.060
is certainly doorways to it.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.730
But I think another dimension
is to live on the feeling.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:17.470
So it's kind of like your
body is a wild animal,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.930
your body knows it
has a different way

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.850
of being in the world.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.670
And it's, Mary Oliver says,
you don't have to be good.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.880
You don't have to walk on
your knees for 1,000 miles

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.671
through the desert.

00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:33.570
You just have to let the
soft animal of your body

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.290
want what it wants.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.030
So what I see, what wildness
is is getting in touch

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.132
with living on the
feeling, getting

00:19:41.132 --> 00:19:42.840
in touch with your
inner guidance system,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.850
you're inner tracker,
you're inner compass

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.280
and living on that instead of
all the shoulds and have tos.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.830
And I think we talked about
a little bit over lunch,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.110
so much of the work
that I do with people

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.180
to help them get in
touch with wildness

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.030
is, I'm doing this thing.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.650
How does it make you feel?

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.330
It makes me feel terrible.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.090
OK, then if it makes
you feel terrible,

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.250
not up here, in your
body, you might want

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.370
to think about not doing that.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.310
And the other side of that
is, what makes you feel good?

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.210
And I mean the physical
sensation of expansion,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:24.840
of energy moving, of the feeling
that makes you go like this.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.350
If you can identify the
things that bring that

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.960
into your body, that feeling
of aliveness and awakeness,

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.230
that is a wild guide.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.010
That'll help you go wild.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.460
And it'll help you live
from a different place.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.510
So most of us are so stuck in
the mental constructions that

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.190
were presented to
us by modern life,

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.710
all the things we should
do and have to do,

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.380
that we shut off
those instinctual,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.280
that part of ourselves
that just knows,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.100
the part of ourselves that
when a golden retriever runs up

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.300
to you, just loves it,
the part that just can

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.470
recognize these innate places.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.960
We shut all of that down so that
we can live up to some ideal,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.850
so that we can get through it.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.300
But to get back in touch
with the feeling, that

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.370
is your internal
guidance system, that

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.720
is your instincts that will lead
you to a different way of being

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.805
in the world.

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:21.180
So that's become
the core for me,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.700
to check in with
my body compass.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.440
And if my body compass is
giving me a strong no, you know,

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.150
we are the only
creatures in the world

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.620
who would walk up
to an elevator,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.700
see the door open, and a creepy
person is standing inside,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.460
and get in out of politeness.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.660
Animals don't do that.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.420
If they get a feeling that
there's something wrong,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.080
they trust that feeling.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.560
And so work out
what you're feeling,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.500
the sensation in your body
that says yes, work out

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.694
what that feeling is.

00:21:56.694 --> 00:21:58.110
Get in touch with
the feeling that

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.320
says no, not as a mental
construction, but as a body

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.430
sensation.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.550
And then just keep turning
towards the thing that says

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.200
yes that brings you to life.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.930
And that's going to give you
a look at what your life would

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.770
be if you were willing
to really live wildly.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.190
And that's quite an
adventure to go on.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.530
Yeah, so that's one
of my practices,

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:20.664
to live in the feeling.

00:22:20.664 --> 00:22:22.830
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Fantastic,
that's very applicable,

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.750
so thank you.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.240
Now in the '40s when apartheid
started to become formalized,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.380
there were rules
that whites couldn't

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.934
employ blacks or whatnot.

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:35.850
And I believe it was
your grandfather who took

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.700
a stance on that in the bush.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.850
Can you talk about that?

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.370
BOYD VARTY: Yeah,
I mean we grew up

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.080
in a country that
was severely divided.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.940
The apartheid regime
tore people apart.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.450
And it assigned
values to people based

00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:00.870
on their race,
which is something

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.050
that the country continues
to try and heal from.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.390
But we were lucky.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.130
Because there was
something about being

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.400
out in the wilderness
that allowed us,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.660
as a village of all
races, to be free of that.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.620
Because when you go out
into nature, when you go out

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:24.420
and track a lion together, which
is a difficult and dangerous

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.549
endeavor in an environment
that is hostile to you,

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:30.090
if you're not aware
and if you're not

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.920
willing to really be
there for each other

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.086
and connect with each other.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:42.320
The preposterousness of creating
divides via race is just,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:49.030
it's impossible to be with
someone in real life situations

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:54.220
and maintain some kind of mad
structure that segregates.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.130
And so at Londolozi
we were always

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.970
lucky to be involved
in a shared endeavor,

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.970
to be in situations that cut
us away from those regimes.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:10.810
And so we were a very
united village, always.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:16.130
And that's why when
Mandela came out of prison,

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.850
my family worked with a
guy called Enos Mabuza.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.276
And Enos was an interesting guy.

00:24:21.276 --> 00:24:22.900
He worked for the
apartheid government.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.450
But he was actually
working for the ANC.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.800
So he was placed in a position
to work out what the apartheid

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.790
government was trying to do.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.480
And at Londolozi,
he saw a village

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.290
that was united by this shared
endeavor of restoration,

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.310
of being in nature together.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.610
And he had always
said to us that this

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.370
is a place where we're
pouring the cultures together.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.260
And it's an example of what
South Africa should be.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.070
And so when Nelson Mandela was
released from prison, he came.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.710
Enos organized for him to come
and live with us at Londolozi.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.530
And to have his presence
there and to have

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.760
him advocate and
say, he actually

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.890
wrote that this was
a model, that he

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.310
hoped to see all
people living together

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.229
in harmony with each other
and the natural world.

00:25:12.229 --> 00:25:14.770
And he hoped that it would be
a model that South Africa could

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.630
build on.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.090
So I feel like some
of the work that I

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.240
do is in this idea of
the village building.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.540
And village building, one
of the core pieces of it

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.690
is what happens when we're
involved in a shared endeavor

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.710
together.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.890
And being out there
in the natural world,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.140
everywhere you looked,
there was shared endeavor.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.540
And that shared
endeavor cuts away

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.650
all of these
man-made constructs.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.610
And again, I see that part
of the expansion of that idea

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.320
is to start to think of
ourselves as humanity together

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.170
involved in this endeavor on our
planet and to put our energy,

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:01.010
as humanity, into
developing systems that

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:06.500
allow us to live well all
together on our planet

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.500
and belong to it in a
much more profound way.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.260
So again, I've
seen the microcosm.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.120
And I feel like to
think of ourselves

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:23.520
as a grand global collective
working together in that way,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.460
in harmony with
nature and each other.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.720
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So you had
mentors from the Shangaan tribe

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.500
who taught you a
lot about the bush.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.810
And you also mentioned
there was a gentleman who

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:34.979
was kind of like a rebel.

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:36.270
And he taught you how to track.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.186
Can you talk about your
relationships with him

00:26:38.186 --> 00:26:39.926
and how you learned
to track from him?

00:26:39.926 --> 00:26:41.550
BOYD VARTY: I was
extremely lucky to be

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.890
exposed to some of the
best trackers in the world

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.410
from a young age.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.530
And one of the amazing
things about the Shangaan men

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.980
who I grew up with is that
they had grown up hunting

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.750
and gathering on the land.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.980
And so their entire
psychology was so

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.660
connected with that wilderness.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.550
And to be out
there with them was

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:09.210
to see a place, to see how
a wild place talks to you.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.350
There's all these signs.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.667
The great trackers, they
know where the animals move.

00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:15.500
They know the speed at
which they're moving.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.890
They know where they drink.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.330
They know the bird calls.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.270
They can tell when a bird
is alarming at something.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.360
It's like being in--
it's like a language.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.950
The wilderness has a language.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.980
And the great trackers speak
that language so beautifully.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.220
And so I spent as much
time as I could with them.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.910
And they slowly started
to teach me that language.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.410
And as you learn
that language, it's

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.610
like when you're in
a foreign country

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.193
and you start to
pick up the odd word.

00:27:40.193 --> 00:27:42.102
And then those odd
words become sentences.

00:27:42.102 --> 00:27:43.560
And then as you
learn the language,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.740
you start to really
feel like you're

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.360
becoming a part of the place.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.050
So I was given that
opportunity to be with them.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.480
And the great
trackers are, they are

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.590
examples of living in
constant creative response.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.700
They never have a plan.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.950
And yet, they always
get onto a track

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.860
that starts to inform the
way they're going to live.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.620
They're all rogues and poets.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.470
And you can never tell them what
to do because they're always

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.670
very present in the moment.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:17.030
It's like, I will do what
this moment is asking of me,

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.450
where this track
is directing me.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.080
What the land is saying at
this moment is what I'll do.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.900
And so I was given
a different way

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.690
of thinking about living
by being with them.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.170
Instead of having all
of these goals and plans

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.830
that if you hit them,
you might be valuable,

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.810
you might have done
something worthwhile.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.360
And rather to find--

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.180
this value is
defined by external.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.700
They are much more still.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.430
And then they feel
their curiosity

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.660
attached to something.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.010
They feel an interest.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.660
They feel the moment
speaking to them.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.420
And then that drives
their actions, not out

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.220
of trying to hit
markers, but out

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.980
of this profound
connection with the way

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.050
the moment is unfolding.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.660
And so what I got from
them was a different way

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.570
of thinking about living
your life, one that

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.410
is guided from the inside as
opposed to from the outside,

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.450
one that comes out of
presence, curiosity,

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:18.960
interest in the moment, rather
than trying to derive value

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.280
based on a set of externals.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.727
And so I would say that
was the core of what

00:29:26.727 --> 00:29:27.810
being with them was about.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.250
It's also like, it's
an amazing thing

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:45.920
to be with people who just
feel so cared for by the land.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.040
They feel like so
in touch with it.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.060
And they know that everything
they need is there.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.870
So there's not the
scarcity that we

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:57.040
live with of like I got
to get enough, I got to--

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.480
They live in this
very abundant place

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.010
where it's like
they will always get

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.430
what they need from the land.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.720
It will be there.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.580
In the moment, something
will happen and we'll get it.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.860
So it's like the whole
psychology is abundant rather

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.760
than accumulative.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.080
It's like trusting all the time.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.580
When you hunt and
gather, you always

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.110
trust that you'll
get what you need.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.943
There may be a few days
where you're hungry,

00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:21.004
but you'll keep living.

00:30:21.004 --> 00:30:21.920
You'll keep surviving.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.128
If you know where to look,
if you know how to listen,

00:30:24.128 --> 00:30:26.470
it's there for you.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.370
So I think that's a really
interesting mindset, too,

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.160
that idea that, I can't remember
what movie it was in, there's

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.490
an idea that a truth and
a lie in our culture.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:42.010
The truth is that if you're out
in the cold in the wilderness,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:47.050
a bowl of soup and a blanket
will make you more comfortable.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.740
The lie is that 1,000 bowls of
soup and 1,000 more blankets

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.440
will make you a thousand
times more comfortable.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.420
And that's kind of
the core of what

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.260
I see, this sense of
always having enough.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.360
And actually we touched
on it earlier, too,

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.040
the idea that we're obsessed
with security in this culture.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.300
We are obsessed
with being secure.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.710
And in a very strange way,
that security robs us,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.660
the very thing that
we're obsessed with,

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.110
robs us of the feeling
of being alive,

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.540
the feeling of being engaged.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.010
And it's this weird paradox
we're living in at the moment.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.420
I mean, I work a
lot with men who

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.310
are looking to create the
next chapter for themselves.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.730
And one of the
things that I see is

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:39.760
they're incredibly driven
to establish security.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.240
And then at a certain
point, that security

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.900
starts to become depressing
in a very strange way.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.340
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Why?

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.890
BOYD VARTY: Because I think
that deep inside of us,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.490
we're programmed towards
certain curiosities.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.050
We're programmed
to solve problems.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.830
We're programmed
to be on the track.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.840
We're not programmed
to find the animal.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.750
We're programmed to be on the
trail, to be working it out,

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:08.450
to be trying to find it.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.320
And that curiosity
nourishes us in a lot

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.950
of ways in the core of
our nomadic wild being.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.790
And if you take that away
from us and just say, here,

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:25.690
here's 1,000 bowls of soup,
it starts to shut one down

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.860
in a very strange way.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.150
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It's like
when you cage a lion, right?

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.191
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, It's
like when you cage a lion.

00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:34.370
And too much uncertainty
is radically destabilizing.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.240
But no uncertainty
is depressing.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.010
So it's a weird paradox
that I think we're

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.620
trying to find our way in.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.520
As I was saying,
neuroses is a substitute

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.140
for genuine suffering.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.740
And sometimes like
in nature when

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.836
you are on the
track of an animal

00:32:52.836 --> 00:32:54.460
or you've been out
there for a few days

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.810
and you're having to
work it out all the time,

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.140
it's incredibly engaging.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.360
And your life feels very
full with this thing

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.140
you're trying to work out.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.860
So definitely there's a point
of exploration in modern life

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.820
there for sure.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.920
I think the very
things that we are

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.300
all desperately after are
also the things that we're

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.440
losing ourselves into.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:27.000
And I feel like the things
we've been told to want

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.549
are not necessarily turning
out to be that fulfilling.

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:32.590
And then that becomes a
very interesting journey.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.506
And it goes back to what
I was saying earlier.

00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:37.360
It's like, if you could get
out of all the things you

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.280
should want to be successful,
well, what really calls to you?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.420
What really fulfills you?

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.280
What really is meaningful?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.200
And how do you start a journey
where you begin to track that

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.180
down, where you could begin to
find that wild thing out there

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:00.790
that would actually allow you
to rest into your own value

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.875
and to your own presence

00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:06.830
So it's a very interesting thing
to go out and try and find.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.730
And it begins with
actually asking yourself

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.179
about how you feel.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.889
And I mean in a
very physical way.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.600
Getting back to that
wild sense rather than

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.760
trying to live into
the cultural model.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:25.370
Yeah, and just to watch
someone who is truly wild

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.500
and the freedom of it
and the peace of it

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.840
and the uncertainty of it.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.818
And they just rest into it.

00:34:32.818 --> 00:34:35.540
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Excellent, your family

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.679
had the ability to
adopt a lot of animals.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.834
And I believe your Uncle
John adopted a lion?

00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:40.500
BOYD VARTY: Yes.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.260
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Can you
talk about experience?

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.460
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, I
mean one of the things,

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.590
my uncle was a
documentary filmmaker.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.580
And we were raised
on the idea that

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.800
as a documentary filmmaker,
you're an observer.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.900
But the more time
he spent out there,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.070
he started to have
relationships with wild animals.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.130
He started to feel himself
much more connected to them.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.600
And so in some ways, that
very scientific view of they

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.240
are the animals and here are
the people, at some point,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.140
it has become part
of the problem.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.380
Because we think of
ourselves as separate,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.820
where really we're a part of.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.900
And so when he started to
feel himself much more deeply

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.030
connected and he started
to break out of this idea

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.360
that we're observers of nature
and conquerors of nature

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:32.240
and start to explore we
are a part of nature,

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.590
he got closer to the animals.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.650
And he interfered,
not interfered,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.410
supposedly, but he found
an abandoned lion cub

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.330
and he decided
that he would raise

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.310
it to learn about
what it would be

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.480
like to be in very close contact
with a wild animal like that.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.860
And lions are pride animals.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.170
And so they bond with,
if you raise a lion,

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.450
you become part of its pride.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:00.290
And so that was a
fascinating thing

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.930
to see that this
lioness, as she grew,

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.910
she considered the
people who were

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.330
around her, her pride, which
was fine when she was this big.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.720
But when she got
up to 250 pounds

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.970
and she wanted to come and
cuddle with you on the bed,

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:18.110
it started to become a
little bit more challenging.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:23.540
But like when you get a new
kitten and it eats your couch.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:28.160
When you get a lion, like it
ingests your entire furniture.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.279
Everything you've got.

00:36:29.279 --> 00:36:31.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Wouldn't it
bring fresh kills to the house?

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.870
BOYD VARTY: Oh yeah,
bring fresh kills

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.540
and drag them into the tent.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.420
He was living out
in a tented camp.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.630
Drag them into the tent,
feed on them on the bed.

00:36:41.256 --> 00:36:43.340
It was a wild experiment.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:49.050
And there was one instance
where he had gotten malaria.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.250
And so he was living in Zambia
in a very wild part of Zambia.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.430
They took him and they
put him in a boat.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.950
And they were taking
him to the hospital.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.910
And this lioness ran next to him
while he got put in the boat.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.410
And then as he
crossed the river,

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.050
she swam next to the boat.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.800
And then she wouldn't
leave the other side

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.841
of the bank of the river.

00:37:07.841 --> 00:37:09.780
She just sat there
waiting for him to return.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:13.190
So it was a very deep
and beautiful bond.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:18.040
And I think it again I
mean, I don't necessarily

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.710
think that everyone should
be raising wild lions.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:27.610
But as an experiment, it was a
mark of how closely connected

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.460
we can become.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.290
And yeah, it was an amazing
experiment and experience.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.090
And he also raised
two leopard cubs

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.260
and released them
back into the wild.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.340
Their mother had been
killed in a snare.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.910
And then he raised them
and he released them back

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.550
into the wild.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.870
So that was a success story.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.120
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Fascinating.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.540
Now your family decided to
take the model of conservation

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.205
in Londolozi and expand it
into another organization.

00:37:52.205 --> 00:37:53.780
Can you talk about that?

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.710
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, so what
was established at Londolozi

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.010
was built on three pillars,
care of land, care of wildlife,

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.270
care of people.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.210
And the idea being that
if you protected and built

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.970
a connection with the landscape,
thought of the animals

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:12.280
as your kin, that that place
would start to respond.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.710
People would be able to
be with wild animals.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.627
And people would come.

00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:17.168
And in doing that,
you would generate

00:38:17.168 --> 00:38:18.250
this economy of wildlife.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.840
So that was the
model that was really

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.050
established at Londolozi.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.820
And then in the early
'90s, we took that model

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.730
and we exported it all
over Southern Africa.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.040
And so we went from
being this one operation

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.990
to being 33 operations around
the Southern African continent.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.500
And it was taking that idea of
restoration and spreading it.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.310
And it continues
to do that work.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:49.150
A few days ago, we had a
guy come from the Pantanal

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:54.000
in South America who had a huge
cattle farm in the Pantanal.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.580
And for years there, they have
been at war with the jaguar.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.707
Because the jaguar
eat the cattle.

00:38:58.707 --> 00:39:00.040
And he came and he drove around.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.350
And he saw pride of lions.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.560
He saw a leopard.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.797
And I could see the
sort of cogs turning.

00:39:04.797 --> 00:39:07.130
And on about the third day,
he looked at me and he said,

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.650
this used to be a cattle ranch.

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.850
I said, yeah, this used
to be a cattle ranch.

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:13.090
And he went back to
the Pantanal and he

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.710
put about 50,000 hectares
aside as a jaguar sanctuary.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.540
And so this is the
idea of the way

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.960
that this idea of restoration
can start to travel.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.830
Once people see it, it
starts to live inside people

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.300
as a sort of idea.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.160
And then that idea can
start to spread itself.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.640
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Fascinating.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.980
Can you talk about
your experiences

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.510
when you were
learning how to drive,

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.410
at what like, seven
or eight years old,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.410
when you were chasing
wild game with your uncle?

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.519
BOYD VARTY: Oh, yes, I mean,
if you grow up in the bush,

00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:47.810
it's like growing up on a farm.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:49.730
You get to drive from the
time you're really young.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:51.646
People keep putting you
into the driver's seat

00:39:51.646 --> 00:39:54.050
and you keep crashing Land
Rovers until eventually you

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.460
know how to drive them.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.700
You peer over the sort of top.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.010
But I had one encounter
where my uncle, who

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.200
was this documentary
filmmaker, he

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.600
would make me his
driver from the time I

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.460
was about seven or eight.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.740
So we were filming
a pack of hyenas

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.870
that were feeding on a giraffe.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.880
And the one hyena pulled
off the giraffe's leg

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.640
and it started running
across the savanna.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.430
And so I started
driving the vehicle,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.260
because he was on
the back filming.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.110
And we were driving across all
of this really rough terrain.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.120
And he screamed, left.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.930
And I turned right by mistake.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.180
Because I was seven years old.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.490
And you can get your
left and rights wrong.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.070
And he was he was bracing
for the other direction.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.705
So he fell off the back.

00:40:35.705 --> 00:40:37.580
The camera landed on his head.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.450
The hyena ran off
around the corner.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.880
He was in a complete rage,
chased me around the vehicle

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.040
for awhile, while he cooled off.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.340
But that was kind of
standard procedure.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:55.910
I mean, we were always stuck in
a furrow, stuck in a rainstorm,

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.520
lost in the middle of the night.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.200
We were always, I mean it
was, trying to film leopards

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.325
is a difficult undertaking.

00:41:03.325 --> 00:41:04.702
And they move off road.

00:41:04.702 --> 00:41:06.910
And mostly what happens is
you break your Land Rover,

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:11.260
you break your camera, and
you don't see a leopard.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.650
That seems to be the standard.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.650
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Can you
talk a little bit more

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.760
about your experience
with Nelson Mandela?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.670
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, sure.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:27.310
So Mandela came on a few, he
came on a few separate trips

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.560
to Londolozi.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.790
The first one being straight
after he came out of prison.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.320
And he was in a period of rest.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.610
It was kind of a
rest and readjustment

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.620
to his sudden
global icon status.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.380
If you think, he
had gone into prison

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.820
as an unknown freedom fighter.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.750
And he came out of prison
as this global icon.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.800
And so he was in a state of
sort of adjusting to that.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.250
And he needed time
to recover and get

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.140
used to being out of prison.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.714
And so members of the
African National Congress

00:41:58.714 --> 00:42:00.130
thought that at
Londolozi he would

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.010
have the space away
from international press

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.460
and everyone who wanted
to take his picture

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:11.260
to sort of have the room
to catch his breath again.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.830
And it's true that lions
are quite a good deterrent

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.080
from people who want to come
and take pictures of you.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.680
So it was good that
he was out there.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.450
And it was an amazing time.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.420
Because I was very
young at that time.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.310
And my mother used to send me
to take him breakfast in bed.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.950
And I would take his breakfast
and put it on a tray.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.870
And we would have a
little discussion.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.360
And I didn't, at the time,
really grasp the gravity of it.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.560
And then sort of late
morning, he would go in

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.830
just in like a sort
of a sweat suit,

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.320
he would just go and
walk around the garden,

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.750
very quiet, very present.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.540
And then I would
watch TV at night.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.200
And we had this kind
of bunny, snowy TV,

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.580
you know, always adjusting the
bunny ears on it at that time.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.750
And I would see images on
TV of the same quiet man

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.720
from the garden surrounded
by hundreds and thousands

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.900
of people as the scenes
of his release from prison

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.240
were broadcast all
over the world.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.730
And it was my first encounter
with power through presence.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:23.380
He had a way of bringing
himself to every encounter where

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.610
you could feel that he was not
trying to establish himself

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.240
in some hierarchy.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.480
He had established
something in himself.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.790
And that presence would
always work for him.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:38.050
So I think the model
that we we're given

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.310
is power through dominance.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.670
And he was really the model
of power through presence,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.560
power through connection.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.375
And he was amazing.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.690
He had a manner about him where
he would humanize everyone

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:53.740
around him.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:44:00.040
And so even when he met people
who had been the oppressors,

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.410
and he was renowned for
this, he would greet them

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:03.260
in their language.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.700
He would ask them about specific
members of their family.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.430
He would reach out to
anyone, in the moment,

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:13.450
he would connect first
and then sometimes be

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.750
very hard in establishing
the ground rules.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.080
But first came this really
beautiful connection.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.510
So that was amazing.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:25.510
I saw, there was one incident
while he was staying with us.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:28.210
My uncle and him used to
have breakfast every morning.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.310
And my uncle would sit
at the head of this table

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.910
after being out making films.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:35.137
And the future president
would sit on the left.

00:44:35.137 --> 00:44:36.970
And they would sort of,
it was very relaxed.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.190
They would chat.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:41.080
And then there was a
much more official sort

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.996
of gathering, which was
happening at the camp.

00:44:42.996 --> 00:44:45.370
And a whole lot of
people from the ANC

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.870
had come in, members
of the party.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.990
And they were going to have
a very serious discussion.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.840
And my uncle was going
to the discussion.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.030
And as he walked
up to the table,

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:59.080
in an extremely rare moment
of tact for him, he realized,

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.549
I had better put
the future president

00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:02.590
at the head of the table.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.870
So he said, please,
Mr. Mandela, you must

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:06.870
sit at the head of the table.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.702
And Mandela just
grabbed him by the hand.

00:45:08.702 --> 00:45:09.535
He was very tactile.

00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:11.782
He grabbed him by the
hand and said, oh, no, I

00:45:11.782 --> 00:45:13.990
would never take your place
at the head of the table.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:19.150
And he just would
downgrade the moment

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:24.240
and always lead, but in
this very relaxed way.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.690
And between them,
he was maintaining

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.130
part of their ritual.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.010
And he was not going to throw
the way they had been doing it

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.929
out of the window to make an
appearance for everyone else

00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:37.470
at the table.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.435
He goes, no, you sit
there, I'll sit here.

00:45:40.435 --> 00:45:42.820
I'm still in charge, you
know, but in a really

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.920
humanizing and wonderful way.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.295
JORDAN THIBODEAU: It's amazing
to see such a great person

00:45:47.295 --> 00:45:49.360
like that, but then see
he's even better behind--

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.109
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, I
mean, just astounding.

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:52.690
I mean, everyone
in South Africa,

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.640
we called it Mandela magic.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.260
Everyone in South Africa had a
story of a personal encounter

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.737
with him.

00:46:00.737 --> 00:46:02.320
Everywhere you went,
people would say,

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.090
you know, it was like
he was everywhere.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.360
He went to sports events we won.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.610
And there was this
very strong feeling

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:16.140
that he raised
the entire outlook

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.790
and narrative of the country.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:23.010
If you think of that
idea of entrainment,

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.670
you've heard this idea
that if you're around,

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.420
everyone's brains
has mirror neurons.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.570
And as we interact with
people, our mirror neurons

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.730
start tapping into
their mirror neurons.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.150
We start becoming like them
in a very specific way.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:41.140
And the more present
you are, the more

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.440
you can shape other people's
mirror neurons around you.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.612
And it's a kind of
like entrainment.

00:46:46.612 --> 00:46:47.820
People sort of talk about it.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.501
I don't know whether
it's true or not.

00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:51.250
But I was very interested
when I heard it.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.800
Because there was this
overwhelming feeling

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.880
that Mandela sort of
entrained the entire country

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.600
to a better version of itself,
to a higher consciousness,

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.940
to a stronger outlook.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:08.480
And I feel like we're in
desperate need of more leaders

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:14.600
like that, who can model that
kind of heart and presence

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.287
and show us a
different way of being.

00:47:17.287 --> 00:47:19.370
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right
and that ties into ubuntu.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.036
Can you talk about
what that word means?

00:47:21.036 --> 00:47:24.260
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, I mean, ubuntu
is, he was the model of ubuntu.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.210
He was the embodiment of ubuntu.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:30.830
And ubuntu is an African value
that says, I am because of you.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.070
And we experience the
deepest parts of ourselves

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.690
through our interactions
with other people.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.580
And so one of the ways they say
it is, people are not people

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.750
without other people.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.440
And in a more
collective society,

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.100
and if you grow up in
the villages in Africa,

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.660
it is more collective.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.365
There is no--

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.030
I think of it as a we
consciousness, rather than

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.560
an I consciousness.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.340
Everything is about the
well-being of the we,

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.280
rather than this
hyper-individuality that we see

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.440
in other parts of the world.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.420
And so ubuntu is that.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.514
It is I can't be
a person, sorry,

00:48:13.514 --> 00:48:14.680
I'm smacking the microphone.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.820
I can't be a person
without you being a person.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.600
And we make each other human.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.081
We make each other, we can
only bring our humanity out

00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:26.580
in relation.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.090
And it's an idea that
just becomes more and more

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.700
important in these times.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:42.810
As we see more and more of
this kind of egoic obsession

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:49.110
with self, with self
and group, you know?

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:53.430
And it seems like we just are
forgetting how to humanize

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.170
each other in every moment.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:01.140
And so to find
your own humanity,

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.470
to be kind to yourself, to
find that part of yourself that

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:07.752
discovers itself
in something else.

00:49:07.752 --> 00:49:09.210
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
The last question

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:13.180
I have, going back to
Mandela and ubuntu.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.430
There was a riot going on
that Mandela was seeing on TV.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:21.120
And your dad had this quote
that encapsulated that.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.170
Can you talk a
little about that?

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:27.870
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, just
after independence,

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.910
there was a thing
called the CODESA talks.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.510
And the CODESA talks
were talks about how

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.940
they would have talks.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.850
So talks about how the
nationalist apartheid

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:41.460
government and the
ANC would set up

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:46.140
a framework by which they could
create the handover of power

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.340
in the country.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.050
And Mandela was staying with us.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:53.820
And in the midst of these talks,
the right wing of South Africa

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.310
drove an armored car
into the conference room

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.150
where the talks were going on.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.020
There was a huge uproar.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.140
It was like the country
was on the brink of war.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.910
And Mandela came out and he
said, he was very agitated,

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:11.870
and he said to my
father and uncle,

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.100
you will get me a
helicopter right now.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.940
I need to fly to
be with my people.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.520
And my father said to him, no.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.190
And he said, you will
get me a helicopter.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.840
I need to be with my people.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.680
And my father said,
I am your people.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.630
And if you go there, some
fool might take a shot at you.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:32.820
And I won't do that.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.150
I won't allow that.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.940
So we'll get you an airplane.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.420
And we'll fly you nearby.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.850
And then your
security can assess

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.840
whether you can go there.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.320
And he just stopped for
a moment and he went,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.227
that's a better idea.

00:50:44.227 --> 00:50:44.810
Let's do that.

00:50:47.534 --> 00:50:53.910
It was just one of those
historical moments.

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:58.120
And really, like
the force of the man

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.350
and the ability to quickly
change course, you know?

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:03.440
That's a better idea.

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.180
Let's do that No need
to assert anything

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.784
beyond that, what's best.

00:51:09.784 --> 00:51:10.950
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:11.800
BOYD VARTY: Is that the story
you were thinking about?

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.440
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Yes,
that's exactly what it was.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.930
Your dad can put another
notch in his belt,

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:18.352
argued with Nelson Mandela.

00:51:18.352 --> 00:51:21.620
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, screamed--
told Nelson Mandela no.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.934
Probably one of the few people.

00:51:22.934 --> 00:51:25.100
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Do we
have any audience questions?

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.400
If not, I'm going to go
for online questions.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.340
Can you talk about your
writing process for the book?

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.530
Did you outline,
plan extensively?

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.180
How long did it take
you to write the book?

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.480
What was your regular
practice [INAUDIBLE]??

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.220
BOYD VARTY: The
book started just

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:43.160
out of telling campfire stories.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.430
And then I met some people
who said, well, you know,

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.780
you should write those
campfire stories down.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.890
Because I wrote a
memoir in my 20s,

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.040
which is kind of funny
in its own right.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.380
But there were a lot of amazing
encounters along the way.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.840
And so first, I just
started capturing stories

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.460
and then started to sort of work
out how they fitted together.

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.330
And it was very organic.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.609
I just, when something
happened out there,

00:52:11.609 --> 00:52:13.150
I had a memory of
something happened,

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.070
I just started to
put it together.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.720
And I just wrote.

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.480
One of the great things about
how that was at that time,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.780
I just wrote out of the sheer
joy of capturing the stories,

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.280
you know?

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.613
It was like right at the time
when publishing was dying.

00:52:27.613 --> 00:52:30.380
And everyone was like, no
one's publishing anything.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.659
And I was just like, well,
these are my stories.

00:52:33.659 --> 00:52:34.700
So I wrote them all down.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:36.741
And what I discovered in
that is like stories are

00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:38.660
a kind of medicine, you know?

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:44.180
And as humans, we're
narrative creatures.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.120
We belong to certain stories.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.710
And so part of learning
to tell your own story

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:56.000
is like learning to belong
to your own life in a really

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.390
unusual way.

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:59.060
And I think it's
another reason why

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.310
we need to tell the
story of restoration.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:04.190
So that as a society,
it can become something

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.120
we start to belong to.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.140
So I just wrote for the
joy of it and compiled it.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.270
And out of writing
to that joy, I

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.530
was lucky enough to meet
an editor and someone who

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:17.600
actually knew how to
take all those stories

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.810
and put it together.

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.910
But the book, for me,
was one of those moments.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.650
I didn't consider
myself a writer.

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:27.830
I just, I felt compelled
toward something.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:31.730
And I just followed
it into a time

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.380
when there would be no
financial reward for it.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.620
No one was publishing books.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.820
It would probably
never go anywhere.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.900
And I didn't care, because I
was enjoying doing it so much.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.220
And that, I think, is
an interesting track

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.570
sometimes in life.

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:47.300
And then, of course, I had
this really crazy experience

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.520
where it did get published.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.401
Someone did pay for it.

00:53:51.401 --> 00:53:53.900
All these things that everyone
told me were impossible came.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.580
But they were not my focus.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.400
And so the learning
of that book for me

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.730
was just to live on the
feeling with no idea of what

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.290
the outcome can be.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.340
Because you can't know.

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.400
And so many of the
people I work with now

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.250
will say to me, when I know
what the next thing is, then

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:11.810
I'll make some changes.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:14.690
And I'm like, it doesn't
always work like that.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.190
Sometimes you've got to be
willing to not know and just

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.130
step out into the
unknown on little clues,

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:23.390
on little feelings.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:27.110
And sometimes an unexpected
outcome, like a book,

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.346
can come out of just enjoying
writing your campfire stories.

00:54:31.346 --> 00:54:33.470
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Can you
talk about the challenges

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.910
and triumphs you
face when trying

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.400
to protect the animals within
and beyond the wildlife

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.290
preserves?

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:41.330
BOYD VARTY: Yeah, it's ongoing.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:52.510
The challenges are
that we're losing,

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.300
we're losing more and more.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.120
I feel like as we're losing
more and more our own ability

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.330
to be natural as people,
the natural world

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:04.640
is receding away from us.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:10.790
And there's this weird thing
where, even the other day,

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:12.110
I drove down the west coast.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.390
And I drove through all
the fires from Oregon

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:15.770
into California.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.270
And that was right
at the same time

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.460
that the storm was
hitting Florida.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.260
And I kept finding
myself saying like,

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.430
man, this is what the future is
going to be like all the time,

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.050
you know, heatwaves,
fires, hurricanes.

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.360
This is what the future
is going to be like.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.451
And it's this weird, collective
denial, even in the language.

00:55:35.451 --> 00:55:36.950
Because I was like,
this is not what

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.241
the future is going to be like.

00:55:38.241 --> 00:55:39.980
This is what now is like.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.800
And one of the
biggest challenges

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.040
is how do we get out of
this collective denial

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.230
that it is upon us.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:52.160
We are in a great
ecological collapse.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:59.000
And so how do we find our way to
something positive within that?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.660
How do we start to gather up in
community as this change starts

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.680
to happen and find our way into
something more connected, more

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.790
loving, more compassionate
to ourselves, to the earth,

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.360
to community?

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.020
And I think I'm getting a little
bit away from the question,

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:21.170
but that is the big challenge.

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.180
How do we love what's
dying right now?

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.380
And some of that goes all
the way back to ourselves

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:32.360
and realizing that life is--

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.790
I used to be a radical
conservationist.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.650
And I still believe in that.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.070
But I really feel now
like the shift has

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.200
to come in human consciousness.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.860
And one of the things that
we refuse in our society

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:50.430
is we refuse to believe
that we are going to die.

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.600
We hide our old people away.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:58.220
We just, we refuse to accept
that that is coming for us.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.120
And a society that is afraid
of dying is afraid of living

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.000
and afraid of exploring what
it would actually mean to live

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.860
in a really connected way.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.880
And so some of the
ecological issues we face

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.380
are born out of
something inside of us.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.890
And I feel like we have to build
a relationship with that place,

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:23.120
all of us, collectively,
and find our way into living

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.380
a life that reflects abundance
and enough within ourselves.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:31.024
And that is going to create
the change in the environment.

00:57:31.024 --> 00:57:32.690
That is going to
change our relationship

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:33.648
with the natural world.

00:57:33.648 --> 00:57:37.340
And until then, we've just
got to love every moment

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.425
that we can, that we get
to have with a wild place.

00:57:40.425 --> 00:57:42.050
So I don't know what
it's going to look

00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:47.820
like in 20 years from
now, and to not be

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:55.590
crushed by that, to not be
overwhelmed by that feeling.

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:57.590
I don't think I got
anywhere near that question,

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:58.859
but that's what came out.

00:57:58.859 --> 00:57:59.900
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Got it.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.900
Well, thank you so much for,
first of all, writing this book

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.360
and sharing with
us your experience

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.560
and coming down here
to Google to answer

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.892
our questions here and join us.

00:58:08.892 --> 00:58:10.850
So we're going to give
you a round of applause.

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:12.308
BOYD VARTY: Oh,
thank you, so much.

00:58:12.308 --> 00:58:14.320
Great to be with you.
