00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is going to be a little trickier

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and not because it's something that you don't know how to do,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but because I'm not going to give you any pictures for it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you have a 1 m rod and it casts a 1 m shadow at noon on the summer solstice,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to know what is your latitude. You can enter your answer here in degrees north.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're going to assume we're in the northern hemisphere here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As a note, the suns rays strike the earth vertically or perpendicularly

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at 23.5 degrees N latitude on the summer solstice.
