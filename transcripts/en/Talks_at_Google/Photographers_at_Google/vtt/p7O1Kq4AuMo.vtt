00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.460
MALE SPEAKER: We can start.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
So I have the pleasure
to introduce Alexandre,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
who is coming all the way from
Germany next to the Mont Blanc.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.760
So Alexandre is a pro mountain
and adventure photographer.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.600
And so he has, I think, written
three books on photography.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.240
And yeah, he has a past
doing computer science.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.645
And yeah, Alexandre will
put on some of his work.

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:38.980
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Cool.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.010
Thanks very much.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.720
So yeah, thank you for coming.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.640
My name is Alexandre
Buisse, as you cannot see

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.255
because it's in very dark
red just above Photos from

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:47.920
the Edge.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.470
And the talk is titled
Photos from the Edge.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.810
And I do apologize
as promised for it.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.730
I'm giving the same
talk in London in a week

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.620
and they chose the title for me.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.100
So this is what I
used to be doing.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
Yeah, OK, there's
kind of a delay there.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.870
Up until about two and a half
years ago, something like that.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.710
And I managed to get out.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.180
And this is what I do now.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.200
And there is a sizable delay.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.712
There you go.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.920
Yeah, so this is now the
kind of stuff that I'm doing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.700
and I'm having a
lot more fun doing.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.730
For instance, hanging
on a fixed line

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.370
300 meters up the [INAUDIBLE]
in Verdon shooting people

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.400
rock climbing or
climbing myself.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.560
And this is going
to get annoying.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.365
There you go.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.240
Rock climbing myself.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240
So this is in Patagonia.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.600
And that's one of the big things
about the career I'm doing

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.370
is that I'm shooting
people climbing,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.690
but I also have to climb
myself and ski myself

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.770
and to paraglide in [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.500
Well most all of those
sports, I have to do myself.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770
And this is another
kind of adventure

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.970
that I'm doing, kind of
combining it altogether.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.760
Climbing up, skiing a bit
down, and then flying down.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.240
And so I'm trying to have as
many adventures as possible.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.030
This was, for instance,
paragliding off

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.540
the summit of Dent de Crolles.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.244
We were trying for Mont Blanc,
but the winds were too high

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:08.410
on the summit of Mont Blanc.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.840
Yeah, it's pretty
hardcore climbing gear.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.200
I won't get too
technical in this talk.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.190
I wasn't quite sure what
you guys were expecting.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.250
So I'm not going to be giving
maybe specific photography

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.780
advice.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500
But I'm more talking about
what the lifestyle is like

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.030
and what the shoots are like.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.250
But yeah, this is what
happens to my camera

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.790
on a fairly frequent basis.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.750
And my insurance
company really hated me.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.570
There we go.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.480
So that's, of course, the most
beautiful place in the world.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.040
And it's so much
better in Switzerland.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.900
This is, of course, Germany
with-- so Mont Blanc is--

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.290
I wonder if I can
actually point.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.700
But Mont Blanc is very close.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.025
I actually shot that in a
series of panoramic pictures

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:05.220
of about 12 different
images that I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.530
shot while flying down
from Vallee Blanche.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.690
And this is why I am
lucky enough to live.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.363
And so it's great
because Germany

00:03:14.363 --> 00:03:21.380
is a big hub for all the sports
people, all mountaineers.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.820
So I can find very easily
athletes to go shoot.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.150
And I can very easily
go on adventures myself.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.236
And the access that
you get in Germany's

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.860
unbelievable, because
you have a couple

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.345
of lifts that get
you pretty high up.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.170
That get you up here
and then another one

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.040
gets you almost at the same
altitude on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.120
side.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.959
So I can wake up in
my bed at 8:00 AM,

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.250
go take the first [INAUDIBLE],
have a full on adventure

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.490
climbing or skiing or flying,
and then be back down in time

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.780
to have some beer.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.470
And I have, as Benoit said,
I've written three books so far.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.207
So the first two, the second
one is actually an ebook.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:02.290
But the first two were
published a couple of years

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.510
ago, 2011 mostly.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.870
And they are dealing
with the technical side

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.809
of taking pictures in mountains.

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.100
And the third one was published
just a couple of months

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.675
ago in the last October.

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:18.769
I'm pleased to say
that it's actually--

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.740
the first print
run is exhausted.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.180
So it sold really well.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.090
I actually have a
copy here that you're

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.610
welcome to take a
look afterwards.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.830
And I'm going to leave
it with Benoit anyway,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.600
so you can have him.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.230
And this is new.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.100
I haven't talked to anybody
but you so far about it.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.420
It's coming soon and
it's a book for geeks.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.960
It's an ebook actually, and it's
about all the boring-ish things

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.940
that you have to do
with digital photography

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.010
and all dealing with
fonts and editing

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.640
and all that sort of
thing coming out soon.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.370
All right.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.880
So the way I think
this is going to work

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.530
is I'm going to walk you through
a couple of my recent shoots

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.780
and kind of talk about
what the clients wanted

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.750
me to do with the images,
what changes I had,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.460
and what kind of images
I managed to produce

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.830
and the stories behind them.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.649
And I'll try to
about 15, 20 minutes

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.690
for questions at the end.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.370
But please feel
free to interrupt me

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.054
if you have anything
that you want to know.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.720
So the first one is
on the Eigernordwand

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.530
and it was last August.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.130
And what happened is
that this guy, this guy.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.610
Yeah, this guy.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.020
He's called Calum
Muskett, he's not even 20,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.410
and he's an extremely talented
rock climber and alpinist

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.060
he's studying to be
a mountain guide.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.601
And I haven't actually met him
but I knew he was in the Alps,

00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:46.026
so I just sent him an
email saying basically,

00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:47.650
if you're going to
climb something cool

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.316
and you want pictures
of it, let me know

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:50.690
and I'd be happy to take it on.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.580
And I didn't hear
anything and then

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.280
I have plans to go climbing in
Germany and do whatever I do.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.024
And then I got an email
from this guy saying,

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:01.440
I'm going to be
with Dave MacLeod.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.731
We're in Grindelwald right now.

00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:05.360
We are going to try to
climb Paciencia in two days.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.100
You're welcome to
come if you want.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.020
And Paciencia is currently
the hardest shoot

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.630
on the north face of the Eiger.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.170
It has an 8a crux
pitch and it's just

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.150
ridiculously long and
involved and it has only

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.760
been climbed twice.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.540
So I said sure,
and I came along.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.910
And what you need to
know about the Eiger,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.070
beside that it's a very
big, very scary mountain,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.870
is that there is a
train that actually

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.100
goes to-- I mean, it
goes to Jungfraujoch,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.880
which is further away.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.970
But it goes through
the north face.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.110
And so this is not
quite the north face.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.420
This is the north face that's
kind of a small buttress.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.810
But you have about a third
of the way of the north face

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.100
window into the railway, and
that's called the Stollenloch.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.780
And what people can do often
is get dropped off by the train

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.650
and then exit.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.650
And you just keep
the bottom third

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.920
of the face, which is dangerous,
loose, and not very interesting

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.590
because it's low angle.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.130
And that's also where
the route starts.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.480
So we're hoping to do that.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.750
But it turns out we're not
Swiss, because I'm French

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.150
and those guys are British.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.690
And so the railway
wouldn't let us,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.525
because you have to be
Swiss to be let out.

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:13.570
It's amazing.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.620
So we had to climb
from the bottom.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.430
And those guys made two
carries up to the bivi site,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.690
to the Stollenloch.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.920
So they were fairly light.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.075
But add two pro cameras, two
big lenses, my entire bivi

00:07:27.075 --> 00:07:28.700
kit because I was
going to sleep there,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.180
and then 17 meters of
rope that I could ascend.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.760
So it's a pretty
sizable backpack.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.370
And that's the kind of
terrain that we were on.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.610
So it's not ridiculously hard.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.700
Like, we're not roped up
because you can't really

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.820
put protection in.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.960
And those guys are not
even in climbing boots.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.330
But it's still steep, loose,
and dangerous, basically.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.780
And what happened
shortly after I

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.180
took this picture is
that I broke a hand hold.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.260
And I started pitching
back and managed

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.330
to catch myself at
the last second.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.100
I kind of saw my life
flash in front of my eyes.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.060
And those guys had to come
down and throw me a rope

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.860
and help me and take my backpack
because I was too scared

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.390
to actually keep going.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.240
But anyway, we got
to the Stollenloch,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.640
into the bivi site.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.610
So that's an interesting point,
I think, with this picture.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.380
Because it is not
a good picture.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.240
It is at best a
passable picture.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.070
But it tells a story.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.044
And it kind of, if you
start from the first picture

00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:29.960
of the guy in the train
and you go all the way

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.270
to the amazing
picture, hopefully,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.030
that I capture at the end,
you can get a complete story

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.280
of what it's like to actually
climb this thing instead

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.480
of just seeing the amazing
picture and saying, yeah, cool.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.570
And then not having any
idea what's actually

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.790
involved in climbing
something that big.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.630
So I have to build
a story, and I

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.440
have to also try to capture
all those moments that are not

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.200
visually that interesting,
but that help build the story.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.970
And that's going up fixed
lines with a lot of equipment.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.420
And then, of course,
you try your best

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.290
to make it slightly
less passable

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.260
or a slightly better picture
by playing with focus

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.220
and foregrounds and
stuff like that.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.480
And it's not a picture that's
designed to stand by itself,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.620
but it helps move the
story along, hopefully.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.120
So yeah, I had spent
all that time and effort

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.050
and nearly died
trying to get there

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.320
to have the pictures
of those guys climbing

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.092
with amazing backdrop,
crazily exposed.

00:09:32.092 --> 00:09:34.550
And of course we get there and
they finally start climbing.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.400
And the fog rolls in.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.690
You have to roll with it.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.002
And in cases like
that, the route

00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:44.460
that they're climbing, because
they're actually climbing it

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.260
for real and I'm just
along for the ride.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.880
So I can't ask them to wait
half an hour for the fog

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.870
to dissipate or do that again.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.900
You can't do that.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.520
So you have to make do
with the best you have

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.080
and kind of fool with it.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.840
In that case, I
think, I hope that it

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.760
adds an atmospheric effect.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.750
And anyway, didn't
really have any choice.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.583
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:07.140
AUDIENCE: How did
you get above them?

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.510
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
So on this route,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.220
you have-- so those are
the first hard pitches,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.290
and they're 7c pitches.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.270
And they are fixed lines already
in place from other teams

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.550
that are walking on the
route just to the side of it.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.050
So it was very
lucky in that sense.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.036
Otherwise, what I would do is
that, on really hard routes

00:10:26.036 --> 00:10:28.230
like that, they usually
rehearse the moves.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.720
So they would climb
it a first time

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.870
and then carry my
rope behind them.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.530
And they wouldn't manage to
actually climb it in one go.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.000
They would have to
rest in between.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.020
Then they would fix my
rope and I would go up.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.730
And then I would
shoot them from above

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.852
while they're actually
going for the lead.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.560
And that's what happened
on the 8a pitch.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.268
AUDIENCE: But it means
technically you're

00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:49.310
doing exactly the
same that they do.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.411
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: No, because
I cannot climb that hard,

00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.950
especially with
cameras and stuff.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.290
So when they are climbing
super hard routes like that,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.070
super hard pitches
like that, I'm just

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.070
jogging on a fixed rope.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.790
I'm ascending a
rope, thankfully.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.100
So yeah, that's another
example of this image,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.270
this atmospheric
image what the fog.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.640
And that's another thing, that
you try sometimes to focus.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.889
If you can't have the wide angle
picture with the crazy exposure

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:21.680
and crazy landscape
above, then you kind of

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.300
try to zoom in and
see, try to express

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.050
what it takes to
climb at this level.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.680
And I think this is where
facial expressions are key,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.621
because you can actually
convey how steep a bowl is.

00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.620
This is actually overhanging
by like 20 degrees,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.910
but you wouldn't know it.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.210
And the holds are
always tiny, and you're

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.970
used to seeing tiny holds, so
it really doesn't bring much.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.110
But if you see somebody
making crazy grimace

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.290
and then really
showing in his face

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.640
how hard it is to
climb, then hopefully

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.287
that's how you convey the
message to the viewer.

00:11:54.287 --> 00:11:56.745
And I think personally that
this image works well for that.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.770
Right.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.440
And that's coming up.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.300
There you go.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.320
So that's another example.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.105
You won't get that picture
as cover of the catalogue

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.056
or as cover of the magazine.

00:12:13.056 --> 00:12:14.930
But this is an important
picture nonetheless,

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.100
because it tells the story of
you have to spend nights there,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.280
and you have to carry
all your stuff there,

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.780
and you have equipment
everywhere, and you're biviing,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.100
it's cold.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.790
But they're still smiling.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.908
And that's also
something that, you know,

00:12:27.908 --> 00:12:29.283
they were always
having fun and I

00:12:29.283 --> 00:12:31.199
was trying to convey
that through my pictures.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.220
And again, another
picture that hopefully

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.820
helps tell the story of this
is super, super steep and this

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.510
is hard work getting up there.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.650
Even though on its own
it's not a great picture.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:53.429
And so on this one,
things start to get real.

00:12:53.429 --> 00:12:53.970
There you go.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.315
It's a picture I'm showing
here but I didn't even

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:00.940
show it to the client,
but just to give

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.300
an idea of what it's like.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.250
And you have gear everywhere,
equipment everywhere, ropes

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.980
kind of in knots everywhere.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.530
But you spent all that time
and energy getting there.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.120
And that's when
it really starts.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.100
AUDIENCE: How much of this
was free climbed and how much

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.650
wasn't?

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.524
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Oh,
they free climbed 100%.

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:17.990
So that's the whole point.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.610
It took eight years for
this route to be free

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.836
climbed the first
time by Ueli Steck.

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:23.960
He's the one who opened it.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.010
So in that case, they had
rehearsed the pitch-- that's

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.360
the 8a pitch, the crux
pitch I had come to shoot.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.170
And I was hanging
on my fixed line.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.080
And then here, Dave
is not quite in.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.300
He's putting a route there.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.230
So I can't actually
quite see his feet.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.980
And there's a rule in
climbing photography

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.830
that you have to
see the eyes and you

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.727
have to see both hands and both
feet for the picture to work.

00:13:49.727 --> 00:13:51.560
So in that sense, the
picture doesn't really

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.669
work because you
can't see his feet.

00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:54.960
But you can still see his face.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.376
And then you have
this whole thing

00:13:56.376 --> 00:13:59.510
going on with the
background out of focus.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.920
And the background that
takes so much of the image.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.840
And so at this stage
I couldn't really

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.200
shoot a typical classical
good climbing image.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.190
So what I did was
just try to experiment

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.530
with different compositions
and to tell a different story

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.610
than just this is hard.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.580
It's up to you whether
that actually worked.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.447
Yeah.

00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:24.110
AUDIENCE: So you said imagine
the rules [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.370
I wonder is there
a rule for in which

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.867
phase of the move you shoot.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.314
Like everything attached
or just before they move?

00:14:31.314 --> 00:14:32.980
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: It
completely depends.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.010
And that's why actually
being a climber yourself

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.810
is going to help
greatly, because you'll

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.700
be able to anticipate
what's going on.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.630
No, I don't think
there's a rule.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.920
Usually if you can show
movement, it's much better.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.610
But it's often you will get
better suggestion of movement

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.200
if somebody's, for
instance, you can

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.820
see that he's readying to move.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.720
And that he's in
a position where

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.490
he's going to jump rather than
if he's actually mid-jump,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.980
sometimes it doesn't
actually look that good.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.360
But I'm not aware, at least,
of any rule about that.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.510
So yeah.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.560
Now we're getting to the image
that I had come to shoot.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.760
And here, this one
is almost there.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.010
And that's Calum at the
top of the 8a pitch.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.060
And you can see two
hands, two feet, the eyes.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.882
You can get a small
idea of the angle.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:26.840
And then you have something
really interesting.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.720
You don't even see Dave because
he's belaying below the roof.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.130
But you can see the rope because
I'm shooting very wide angle,

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.380
it gives the impression that
the rope goes on forever.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.670
And that's a 50
meter pitch already.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.340
And then you can kind of
see that the wall just

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.760
keeps on going.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.327
So I kind of really like this
picture, but this one-- yeah.

00:15:47.327 --> 00:15:50.069
AUDIENCE: So for this one you
are just pushing with your feet

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:51.440
out from the wall?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.230
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.800
I'm going to mention that.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.815
Yeah, there you go.

00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:00.930
This looks really ugly.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:05.010
I'm going to talk about that
just now, because here this

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.570
is for me the picture
from the shoot.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.190
And the clients agree.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.870
And for that actual picture,
I'm very far away from the wall,

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.910
as you can see.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.680
And this is, of course,
sometimes people

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.030
bring ladders to
push themselves away.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.752
Obviously, that
wasn't an option here.

00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:23.710
So what happened is that
this is actually crazy

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.800
overhanging, maybe 25 degrees.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.810
My rope was anchored at the top.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.030
And then I was
kicked through one

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.110
of the quickdraws on the route.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.400
The one just above the one
where he's climbing right now.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.480
And that meant that, of
course, when Dave came,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.110
he had to use that quickdraw
and keep on climbing.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.620
So I had to let go of it.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.980
And when I let go, I just
took a huge pendulum.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.250
And when I was out five or six
meters at the apex, I shot.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.220
And then what happened
is that I have the blow

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.100
back of the pendulum, and I'm
just starting to slam back,

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.910
and I'm slamming
back into Dave, who's

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.980
climbing this super hard route.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.550
So I was like that trying
to be as thin as possible.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.170
And I just barely grazed
him and then went back

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.704
from the pendulum and
did that a couple times.

00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:15.495
AUDIENCE: In that case, do
you look on the display?

00:17:15.495 --> 00:17:16.369
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: No.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.881
No, I just never
look on the display.

00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:20.589
I look on the display
when I'm back home.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.990
And that's also super important
as a climbing photographer

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.420
is to never disturb
the climbers,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.110
because they trust me
not to bother them,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.930
not to be a presence
that they will

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.804
have to spend time and energy.

00:17:36.804 --> 00:17:38.470
I mean, the worst
thing I could possibly

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.992
do beside injure them
would be to make them fall,

00:17:40.992 --> 00:17:43.200
especially when they're
climbing something that hard.

00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:47.960
Sometimes, you have to
let go of the picture.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.334
You have to not
take a picture so

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.781
that you won't be in the way.

00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:53.114
AUDIENCE: Tell us a little
bit about the technical piece

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.844
about this particular
photograph site.

00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:55.885
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: As in--

00:17:55.885 --> 00:17:56.801
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.560
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: So
this is wide angle.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.860
I like to shoot very wide.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.590
That's a Nikon D100 and
the lens is a 1635 F4,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.390
which is my go to lens
because it's fairly light.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.310
And then you can see
everything is in focus.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.180
So I was actually,
I think, at F11.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.390
And pre-focused at
about two meters

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.660
so that I don't even
have to go to focus.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.400
And I'm always shooting
in aperture priority.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.230
So in that case,
I don't even have

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.600
to put the camera
to my eye really.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.590
I mean, I usually
try to, but sometimes

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.380
there's too much
going on for me to.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.750
So I just get an idea of where
I'm framing and just shooting.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.110
And I don't fiddle
with the settings ever.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.750
AUDIENCE: How far
are you from him?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.500
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: I
think, yeah, something

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.930
like five or six
meters out of the wall.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.013
AUDIENCE: So you focus at
two, two or thereabouts.

00:18:46.013 --> 00:18:49.350
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah, because
with high bifocal distance

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.240
at F11, especially
at 16 millimeters,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.661
everything will be in focus.

00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:56.910
And sometimes, of course,
especially when I'm shooting

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.280
long, I really tried to
have shallow depth of field

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.890
and shoot at F2.8 usually
to really separate,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.200
create some separation.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.700
But when I'm shooting
wide, usually it's

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.070
very rare that you
would try to get

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.200
shallow depth of
field shooting wide.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.260
You try to get
everything in focus.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.750
And after that picture,
shortly afterwards,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.730
they took two more days to
climb and I abseilled down

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.720
and went through
the Stollenloch,

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.930
hitchhiked on the train,
and had a big rosti.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.510
There you go.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.230
So that was the first shoot.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.890
The second one actually
happened just 10 days ago.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.200
The story was, through some too
long to explain circumstances,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.360
I met the editor from
"Sports Illustrated",

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.170
which is one of the biggest
magazines in the world.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.280
In the States it's 3.5
million readership, I think.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.040
And they usually are all
about the Superbowl yesterday

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.549
and the baseball and basketball
and that kind of thing.

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:54.340
So they're not really
into adventure stuff.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.020
But the editor wanted
to give me a chance

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.390
to shoot some
adventure for them.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.120
And I suggested a
different number of things,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.920
and they decided to go
with the ice climbing

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.460
at night using big
studio flashes.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:14.070
And this is-- yup.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.310
No.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.090
There we go.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.436
So this is what my assistant was
supposed to be carrying for me.

00:20:23.436 --> 00:20:25.310
And it turned out that
there was no assistant

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.470
because one of the models
dropped out and had

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.090
to be replaced by my assistant.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.260
So I had to carry all
that garbage myself.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.692
And I'll kind of give
you an idea of my roles

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:37.400
there, because I have
the climbing stuff,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.380
I have my axes and my crampons
so that I can climb myself.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.680
I have the ice screws that I
actually gave to the athletes.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.820
I have all the stuff here
to ascend the fixed line.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.480
And here I'm not
showing the ropes.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.870
And then I have the
tripod for the camera,

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.310
and I have the tripods
for the lights.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.309
And I have the lights,
and I have the modifiers,

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:55.990
and I have the flashes, and
the cameras, and the lenses.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:01.310
So you can see, you have to have
many different roles at once.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.490
And it was extremely
challenging,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.450
because as you may be aware
of this is a terrible winter.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.060
We had very little snow
and we have even less ice.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.850
And then what little
snow we have usually

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.360
is very avalanche prone.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.080
So this was shot in Cogne in
Italy near Gran Pardiso Park.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.880
And it was very, very
challenging to find a route

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.130
that had enough
ice to be climbable

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.930
and that wasn't
threatened by avalanches.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.600
So when I'm kind of managing
to align everything and have

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.790
good weather.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.260
And this is Jen
Olson from Canada

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.130
looking at half of the climb.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.730
So that's the first
picture that I got.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.490
And here, it's
actually not night yet.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.640
It's kind of evening.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.940
There's still some light.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.480
So I'm balancing ambient
light with-- you can't really

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.390
see because this is
pretty poor quality,

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.666
but it's actually
warmer in here.

00:21:56.666 --> 00:21:58.540
And that's because I
have a light right there

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.210
that's shooting and kind
of lighting the ice.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.090
And ice, of course,
is really interesting

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.710
because it's very
translucent and it

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.200
can give very cool effects.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.720
And that's really what
I was looking for.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.490
And so here, the
climber Aurelien

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.840
is almost at the end of
the first pitch, which

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.150
is like five meters above him.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:23.080
And afterwards Jen
and myself joined him.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.710
And I started
getting the pictures

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.530
that I was looking for.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.850
And here, I was supposed
to have an assistant hold

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.030
the line somewhere.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.825
And so I had no assistant.

00:22:34.825 --> 00:22:37.200
And Aurelien was busy belaying
and she was busy climbing.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.350
So I was one hand shooting
and in the other hand holding

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.840
the line, which is actually
something like five kilos.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:52.730
So it was challenging, but in
the end it works out sometimes.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.660
And here, what I'm
not too happy about

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.160
is that this is very frontal.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.910
So the light is coming
from the same place

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.860
as the camera, which
is usually something

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.840
you're trying to avoid.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.030
But in this case, you
couldn't really avoid it.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:09.080
And you can still get
an effect of the ice.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.960
And so they finished
climbing and I came down.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.370
And here I used the
flash to illuminate

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.300
the entire waterfall,
but not enough

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.532
that you would drown
out the headlamp beam.

00:23:23.532 --> 00:23:28.142
And kind of trying to balance
the headlamp that they're

00:23:28.142 --> 00:23:29.850
using so that you can
see that it's night

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.630
and that they're actually
using headlamps but still see

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.860
the waterfall.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.920
And then they started climbing
it again the second time.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.049
And this is when it's key to
have models that are actually

00:23:43.049 --> 00:23:44.590
athletes that love
what they're doing

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.610
and that are not
complaining about you asking

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.180
them to just go back up please.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.310
And those are the pictures
that I came to shoot.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.450
So ideally, what
I'd planned for was

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.895
to have the assistant on a
fixed line top right shoot in

00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:04.912
and holding the light so that
it would go down on the climber.

00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:07.120
But that was impossible, so
I actually left the light

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.494
on the tripod at
the bottom and I

00:24:08.494 --> 00:24:10.910
used it to illuminate
the entire waterfall.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.070
But to be a lot weaker
than the headlamp beam,

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.684
so that you could really have
this island of light idea.

00:24:16.684 --> 00:24:18.600
But if you're shooting
that without the studio

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.850
strobe at the bottom, then
you're not seeing anything.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.410
You're just seeing a blob of
white, which is the headlamp.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.930
And that's another
one variation.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.584
And here again, you're also
trying to go for a story.

00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:33.000
You're also trying
to tell a story

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.420
and, again, you can't really
see but she's actually smiling.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.520
If you see the image
in print, she's smiling

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.610
and you have the headline
beam that's looking up

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.370
and you have the ice axe.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.160
And you can see, what
I'm hoping that people

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.210
can see in her eyes is that
yeah, climbing at night, ice,

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.129
this is cool.

00:24:50.129 --> 00:24:51.920
And this is actually
what she was thinking.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.140
So all good.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:25:00.134
And this is the feature
last picture that I shot.

00:25:00.134 --> 00:25:01.800
And sometimes you go
for black and white

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.780
because it looks better.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.870
And again, this is all
about the story and all

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.127
about the light, the light
going through the ice.

00:25:11.127 --> 00:25:13.710
And hopefully those images will
appear in "Sports Illustrated"

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.209
soon.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.038
There we go.

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:21.370
So now we have a little
bit of time left.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.030
So I'm going to walk you through
some of my favorite images

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.250
rather than talk about
a specific shoot.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.770
And then if we have
some time left,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.640
which I doubt I can tell you
about shooting Patagonian

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.700
Expedition races.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.960
OK.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.460
There we go.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.870
So that's a picture
I shot two years ago.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.860
I went skiing to the
top of Mont Blanc,

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.400
though we did not actually
manage to go to the summit

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.080
because my climbing
partner and girlfriend got

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.920
altitude sickness.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.440
But this is an image, that's
something I really strive for.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.840
This is a very authentic image.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.850
It was a real moment.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.250
I mean, we were
really climbing there.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.400
Nothing is staged,
nothing is set up.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.910
And she did not even
notice that I was shooting.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.860
She just kept on walking,
kept on climbing.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.110
And that's something I'm
really looking for in all I do.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.407
And of course sometimes
you have to compromise

00:26:12.407 --> 00:26:14.240
because a client expects
you to get an image

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.102
and you have to ask people
to do stuff many times.

00:26:17.102 --> 00:26:18.560
But as much as
possible, I'm trying

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.157
to really capture
authentic moments.

00:26:22.157 --> 00:26:23.990
And this image works
because of the contrast

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.920
between the blue of the snow and
the cold world of early morning

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.300
in the mountains,
high mountains.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.649
That's above 4,000
meters of attitude.

00:26:32.649 --> 00:26:35.190
And the warmth of the valley,
the valley lines at the bottom,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.690
and of the sunrise
that's coming up.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.840
And that's an
example of when you

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.890
have to compromise a little bit.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.910
Because this is
staged to an extent.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.410
This was shot for
the Petzl catalog.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.630
And they wanted to shoot some
crevasse rescue scenarios.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.370
And of course to shoot
a crevasse rescue,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.140
you have to have
somebody in a crevasse.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.150
So I kind of asked.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.390
This is Liv Sansoz who's
falling into the crevasse.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.870
And she used to be the best
woman climber in the world

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:06.850
about 15 years ago.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.800
And now she does all
sorts of crazy stuff.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.480
Base jumping, steep skiing,
paragliding, mountaineering,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.140
you name it.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.730
And I asked her to just
please go into the crevasse.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.860
And I was expecting it
to run or jump or try

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.770
to find a way to walk down.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.340
But no, she just walked
until the corners collapsed

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.910
and she fell down.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.400
So just had enough time to raise
my camera to my eye and capture

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:28.900
that.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.665
What's sad about it is that the
picture was actually never used

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:37.247
by Petzl because it's
too negative for them.

00:27:37.247 --> 00:27:38.830
I mean they used a
lot of the pictures

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.860
afterwards of us rescuing
her, but somebody

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.650
falling into a crevasse
is not something

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.520
they want to be associated with.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.310
And this one.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.120
So the picture that I shot two
minutes later of those guys

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.220
that you can kind of guess
here coming up so that they're

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.529
leading and I'm shooting
them from above.

00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:04.320
I shot exactly the same
picture, except you

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.960
don't have the rope coming up.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.420
And that was the cover of the
Patagonia catalog in the US.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.350
But I like this one better
because that's my girlfriend.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.740
And you can see how happy
she is climbing here.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.720
And here is an example of
many, many times I go out

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.640
and I do a climb,
and I bother having

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.810
my big camera, big bulky
camera, on my harness,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.470
fully accessible, and I don't
get a single good picture.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.220
That happens all the time.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.120
But sometimes it pays
off to have it available,

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.070
to have it really ready.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.100
And that was one of those cases.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.270
So we had climbed on that day
from the Grands Montets station

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:41.770
here.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.350
We had climbed
that entire ridge.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.050
And we actually bivied like
half an hour later very close

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.550
to here and then
the next morning we

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.400
went to the summit
of Aiguille Verte.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.736
And I had shot some
pictures on that day

00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:53.860
because I felt bad about
not shooting any pictures,

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.890
but that was basically
the only reason.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.641
And they were really,
really bad pictures.

00:28:57.641 --> 00:28:59.806
And then at some point, I
had just finished climbing

00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:02.020
and I was belaying and
everything lined up perfectly.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.680
The clouds, the light, the
ridge, the faces, everything.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.990
And because I had a
camera right there,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.600
I was able to take the picture.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.690
If it had been in the backpack,
this picture wouldn't exist.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:19.450
So sometimes it's size,
it's always bothersome,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.067
but sometimes it's worth it.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.380
So this is a photo that
was taken on assignment

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.937
for the German brand VAUDE
for their winter collection.

00:29:37.937 --> 00:29:40.270
And VAUDE, they have two
different kinds of assignments.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.769
They have the ones where they
know they need specific images

00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:44.990
and they hire somebody to
shoot the specific images.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.530
And then they have the
ones that they give to me,

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.050
which I'm really happy about.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.760
And that's, here's
some gear, here's

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.390
some money to pay some models,
and please go and bring

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.132
us back cool images.

00:29:55.132 --> 00:29:57.090
And it's up to me to find
the right conditions,

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.150
and to find the right climb,
and to find the models

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.510
and to find everything.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.600
And this is all about
serendipity to an extent,

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.750
because this image I had
no idea would exist up

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.980
until about five seconds
before I shot it.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.460
But it's also very challenging
because especially for clothing

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.100
brands, when you're
shooting for them, usually

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.800
they have some crazy
schedules because they

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.690
get the samples for
the winter collection.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.280
For instance, in
the case of VAUDE,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.860
they get the samples
on September 20th

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.370
and they need the workbook to
go to print on September 30th.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.520
So you have 10 days
in late September

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.400
to shoot the winter collection.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.770
And usually mountains
in September

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.160
do not look like winter.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.670
So in that case, we were lucky
and we got a storm before.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.943
If you kind of forget
about the very dry glacier

00:30:46.943 --> 00:30:50.920
in the background, you
could believe it's winter.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.170
We had to do the same the
other way around in early April

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.850
last year, which was a very,
very snowy year, shooting

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.770
the summer collection.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.920
And then you had people
skiing in deep powder

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.560
in Vallee Blanche in the
background, which is not

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.440
something you
usually do in August.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:14.810
So it's also my job to make it
look to use tricks to an extent

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.930
to try and convey the right
message about the picture

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.710
that the client wants.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.910
And in this case, we got
super lucky with the weather

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.510
as well, because
what happened here

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:31.350
is that the clouds that were
starting to roll in just

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.040
started diffusing the
sunlight a little bit,

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:38.470
and that's what gives
you the super soft light.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.620
And it is actually reflected
in freshly fallen snow.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.190
So this is like having the
world's biggest soft box just

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.094
lighting your subject.

00:31:48.094 --> 00:31:49.510
And this is not
something-- I mean

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.620
if I was trying to replicate
this, it would take a crane,

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:58.863
basically holding some studio
lights just above the frame.

00:31:58.863 --> 00:31:59.825
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:31:59.825 --> 00:32:00.787
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah.

00:32:00.787 --> 00:32:02.230
AUDIENCE: Do you
photoshop a lot?

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.330
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: No.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.830
I do very, very
little photoshopping.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.220
So that's, of course, a question
that comes back all the time.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.710
And I do.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.900
My post-processing is part
of my image creation process.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.990
So I will tune up the colors and
the contrast and all of that.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.495
But as I was saying
earlier about authenticity,

00:32:21.495 --> 00:32:24.390
I always try to not cheat.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:28.430
And of course, it's a
very personal decision.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.320
And there's a line that
I try not to cross.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.610
Basically, it's just out of
respect to myself, really.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:35.804
But no.

00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:37.720
I could show you the
original and of course it

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.634
looks a bit more dull, but
it's basically the same image.

00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:42.867
AUDIENCE: How about HDR?

00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:43.950
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: I don't.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:44.450
I don't.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.450
I used to use HDR too, because
sometimes in the mountains

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.110
you have very high
contrast, it seems.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.400
With modern sensors and
with modern software,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.650
you don't need to anymore.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.960
With especially the Nikon
D800, which this was shot with,

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.250
has such an insane
dynamic range.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.380
And with light from
the foreground,

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.490
you can recover so much
highlight and so much

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.442
shadow that you don't
need to use HDR anymore.

00:33:08.442 --> 00:33:11.720
And I'll start moving
a little bit faster.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.590
So this is one of my
very favorite images

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.690
and one that I seem to be
almost alone in really liking.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:25.415
it's very subtle and it takes
looking at it for quite a

00:33:25.415 --> 00:33:27.810
while before you start
appreciating it, I think.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.420
And also it needs
to be printed well.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.030
And I'm sorry to say this
is not the case here.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:37.690
But anyway, one of the
themes of my photography

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:43.620
often is trying to communicate
what I feel when I climb.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.197
And that's the reason
I started shooting

00:33:46.197 --> 00:33:48.280
while I was climbing while
I was in the mountains.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.630
And one of the things that
I feel very, very often

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.890
is humility in the mountains.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.160
Because you can think
you're the best climber,

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.380
you can think that you
can climb whatever.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:02.380
And then you will
have a day where

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.885
you will be reminded
that you are nothing.

00:34:04.885 --> 00:34:07.260
And that's something I'm trying
to communicate sometimes.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.239
And here, having
this looming mountain

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.850
in the mist that without
even trying just completely

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.239
overpowers the
tiny human figure.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.540
I don't know, it
really talks to me.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.540
And this is actually Ama
Dablam that's in Nepal.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.239
And this picture
that's coming up.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.600
So this picture is
straight out of camera.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.009
I have done nothing to it.

00:34:32.009 --> 00:34:33.800
The only thing is that
it was slightly dark

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.508
because my settings
were not quite right,

00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:37.872
so I just brightened
it a bit and that's it.

00:34:37.872 --> 00:34:39.080
And people do not believe me.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.371
I had even people tell me
that they could see artifacts

00:34:41.371 --> 00:34:44.440
from the CGI that I had used.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.630
But this is high altitude light
with crazy snow conditions

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.560
that you can find in the Andes.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.639
That's at 6,300
meters in altitude.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.500
And you get these kind of snow
footings and snow mushrooms

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.150
in the Andes,
especially in Peru.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.330
And this is by far my
bestselling picture.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.410
I shot that in 2009 and I've
sold more prints of it then

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.160
all of my other images combined.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.520
AUDIENCE: What's the
shutter speed here?

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:12.660
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: What's that?

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.690
AUDIENCE: What's the
shutter speed here?

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.060
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
I have no idea.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.545
This is shot at F8, because
I will shoot at F8 until--

00:35:19.545 --> 00:35:20.170
unless I have--

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.031
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:25.170
I was coming down from the
summit of the mountain.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:27.690
We had planned another route
and I was at 6,000 meters

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.290
and I was completely wasted.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.320
But I saw that
and I had to stop.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.300
I don't think the rope even
tightened because I always

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.960
try to not bother the
people that I'm roped up

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.850
with so I usually can
even while walking

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:42.600
get the camera in and out.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.940
But this is F8, ISO-2, 200
I'm guessing, because that's

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.100
the base ISO the
camera was shooting.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.850
And whatever the
shutter speed is.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.100
My guess is around 250.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.220
I don't know.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
long exposure.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.400
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
No, no, no, no.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.750
I think it's just because
it's a poor quality projector.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.810
I'm sorry.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.250
But no, this is a
fast shutter speed.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.920
All right, quickly now.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.092
So this picture, this is shot
inside a crevasse in Mer de

00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:17.810
Glace.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.300
And I was complaining
earlier on the other ice

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.380
climbing shoot about
not having an assistant.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.540
Shit, I didn't even have
somebody to belay her,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.770
so I was actually belaying
and shooting at the same time.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.610
And of course I'm
shooting wide angle.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.150
So I'm actually maybe 30, 40
centimeters from her crampons.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.570
So I'm really hoping
that she doesn't fall.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.120
And of course, this is also
a very challenging lighting

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.020
situation because the inside of
the crevasse is very, very dark

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.640
and the outside is
comparatively extremely bright.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.330
So here I had to make a decision
to let completely go details

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.474
in the highlights at
the top so that I could

00:36:56.474 --> 00:36:57.890
get all the
interesting stuff that

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.210
was going on with the
ice at the bottom.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.000
And I think this one I
really like for one reason.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.932
It's because it really
shows, and here it's

00:37:06.932 --> 00:37:09.250
a little bit too dark but
you can kind of guess.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.690
When you're ice climbing, what
you're actually standing on

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.200
is usually half percent
metal, sometimes less,

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.010
that's inside the ice on two
front points, and sometimes

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.860
one front point.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.550
And here we can really see it.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:25.050
And that's something
that often you can't.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.800
And that's enough.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.670
You know, it works.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.560
Ice works.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.840
But when you actually see
it, it makes you think a bit.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.790
Yeah, another image
I like in Verdon.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.170
Just playing with
silhouettes and trying

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:43.960
to have people build a
story around the image

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.540
and work themselves.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.510
And that's the big difference
between video and photos.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.490
In video usually you
have to be a bit more

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.410
explicit, whereas with photos,
with still photography,

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.880
you have to let people
guess and let people

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.680
build an entire back story,
and maybe front story even,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.657
about what's going on.

00:38:01.657 --> 00:38:03.990
And so here you have some
people highlining and some guy

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.740
base-jumping doing a back flip,
and some guy taking picture

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.830
and it's sunset.

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:12.280
You can't ask him
why, but not-- I

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.160
have another one
that's even more why.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.950
This is slightly new
for me, I started

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.481
shooting from my paraglider.

00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:22.480
When I discovered that I
could actually do that,

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.660
that was amazing.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.220
And this in Annecy.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.440
This one I just love
because of the light.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.880
And it's funny because it
was actually a photo shoot.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.737
This guy with the yellow wing
is a professional photographer

00:38:33.737 --> 00:38:34.820
and a good friend of mine.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.660
He's called Tristan
Shu, and he's

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.270
shooting the
designer of the wings

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.860
that both Tristan and myself
are flying in this picture.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.810
And this guy was doing
crazy acrobatics.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.350
And Tristan was shooting him.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.810
And sometimes,
yeah, sometimes it

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:55.920
works because it
just looks cool.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.730
So this is another
authentic moment on The Nose

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:02.480
that I kept in coming
down in a big storm.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.260
And here the story
is very obvious.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.480
It's cold, it's wet, and you
really don't want to be there,

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.910
but you have to keep
on going and keep on,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.050
well, descending in that case.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.590
And this is often the
case that everybody

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.860
can shoot when the
weather is good

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.480
and everything is going well.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.400
But if you keep shooting
when things really go bad,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.200
and people really
don't want to be there,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.630
then that's when you get
the good stories sometimes.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.080
And the less you want to
shoot, usually, the more

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.990
you should be shooting.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.020
But of course I always, usually
when things go bad enough,

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.170
there's a point where I have
to put the camera away and just

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.510
focus on the climbing or just
focus on getting out of there,

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.740
go into survival mode sometimes.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.040
AUDIENCE: Is your
camera waterproof?

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.915
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: It
has proven to be so far.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.780
I mean pro cameras can
take a lot of abuse.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.540
But except for the D4,
and that would be the one

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.855
DXL Canon, which
are specifically

00:40:02.855 --> 00:40:05.544
built to be waterproof,
that I still

00:40:05.544 --> 00:40:07.210
wouldn't throw in the
ocean or anything.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.890
But the other ones, will
usually withstand abuse,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.730
but sometimes they just won't.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:16.990
You can't really know why.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.490
And I had some
issues with the lens.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.656
Actually, pro lenses are
supposed to be water proof.

00:40:20.656 --> 00:40:25.290
I had some issues with fogging
inside and stuff going in.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.211
But cameras are tools, and
I'd rather destroy my camera.

00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:31.210
I will tell my insurance
company that I'd rather

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.942
destroy my camera
and get the image

00:40:32.942 --> 00:40:35.400
than not get the image because
I was worried about my gear.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.460
And this is also,
I think, important.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.040
That's actually after the climb.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.600
And that's a
direction I'm trying

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.770
to go more and more in
finding a human connection

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.353
and not just showing the really
cool move in a crazy landscape

00:40:51.353 --> 00:40:53.210
but also showing,
again, everything that

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:57.707
goes into the climb and what
it takes to do the climb.

00:40:57.707 --> 00:41:00.040
And that was after a failure,
a big failure on The Nose.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.364
And that's another case of a
picture that's just plain cool.

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:09.030
Because this guy
doesn't have any ropes,

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.275
so he's free soloing.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.645
Yeah, so, it's just
about being there

00:41:15.645 --> 00:41:19.310
and shooting the crazy guys.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.520
OK, I'll start
speeding up a bit.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.660
This is on Aiguille du Midi.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.490
And it's a very
suggestive image.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.610
And it was a snapshot.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.940
I shot that because I just
saw the mountain looking cool.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.930
And I realized when
I came back home

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:40.680
that these guys looking up,
if you have a bit more detail,

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.970
it actually looks even better.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:43.870
And that makes image.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.810
And sometimes you just
have to be a bit lucky.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.670
Another image that was shortly
before the guy descending,

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.630
descending from
The Nose super wet.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.350
So it was before we got wet.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.699
And so here, the
story, I think--

00:41:58.699 --> 00:42:00.240
the way that he's
leaning out is what

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.360
makes the image work
for me, because he's

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.939
looking at his leader
and thinking hurry up,

00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:08.230
let's get the hell out of here.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:15.760
And this image is coming up.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.100
Yeah.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.720
So again, you have to
build stories sometimes.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.540
You have to let
people build stories.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.880
And here I was
shooting highlining,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.320
and this is the guy who was free
falling earlier, Mich Kemeter.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.070
And then they started
putting a hammock on

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.780
and I was like
yeah, sure, why not.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.220
And he started relaxing on it.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.470
And then Armin came in and
started playing didgeridoo.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.980
And I was like yeah,
OK, do your thing.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.500
OK.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.680
Very, very quickly,
which is not going

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.300
to work because this thing
takes 15 seconds to-- OK,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.780
I was going to tell you about
shooting adventure racing

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.920
in Patagonia, which I've
done two years in a row.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.336
And the race doesn't
exist anymore

00:42:57.336 --> 00:42:59.660
now because it's really,
really, really crazy

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.090
to shoot down there.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:05.860
But I think maybe we should
keep some time for questions.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.490
I'll go through them
very quickly then.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.360
This is a rescue exercise.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.480
And the starts by night, so
that was the first year in 2012.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.780
And this is a six
to eight days race.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.000
They do 600 kilometers
in complete wilderness

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.160
and it's a wonder
that nobody died yet.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.220
And then kayaking.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.380
And of course penguins
because penguins.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.842
And there we go.

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.050
And they're actually running.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.920
This is 36 hours into
it and they're running.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.070
And what I had to do
was to run with them.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.014
That's the only way to get the
really good pictures, to get

00:43:44.014 --> 00:43:46.055
better pictures than just
staying at checkpoints,

00:43:46.055 --> 00:43:48.890
is to race with them.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.585
And the reality of Patagonia
is that once you start hiking

00:43:52.585 --> 00:43:55.250
in with them, you
kind of have to finish

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.570
that section with them.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.660
So I ended up, in that
case, walking 100 kilometers

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.750
in 30 hours with them in
complete wilderness, no choice,

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.020
no nothing, Which
was very interesting.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.890
So yeah.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:12.980
And then the orienteering is
the big, big problem there.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.810
That's how many
teams end up losing,

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:19.300
because the maps are terrible
and there are no landmarks

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.760
usually to orient against.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.170
Very wild terrain.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.079
Crossed that river
about 25 times maybe.

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:29.620
And this is the kind of images
that you cannot get if you are

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.522
not in with them and if
they don't trust you.

00:44:31.522 --> 00:44:33.105
And that was after
24 hours of sharing

00:44:33.105 --> 00:44:34.400
the suffering with them.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.782
They let me take the picture.

00:44:36.782 --> 00:44:38.740
Because you really want
to get to a checkpoint,

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.980
they're all smiles.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.490
Because they have like 10
checkpoints in the entire race,

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:47.570
so they can change personae
when they get there.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:49.435
Whereas that is what
this race is about.

00:44:49.435 --> 00:44:50.810
It's about the
suffering and it's

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.268
about the pushing
yourself through.

00:44:52.268 --> 00:44:53.932
And that's another one.

00:44:53.932 --> 00:44:55.640
I don't know you can
really see his face,

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.300
but he didn't look at me.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.180
And this is Patagonia,
so it looks super good.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.870
Some cool landscapes.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.990
So this is not, by far,
the worst case of it.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.950
But that's, yeah.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.000
And those guys will keep
on walking with that stuff.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.930
It's crazy.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.540
And then, yeah, suffering.

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.770
And that's Mark's
face when he was

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.039
told that they had finished.

00:45:20.039 --> 00:45:21.580
It's amazing, it's
an eight days race

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.750
and those guys finished
with 14 minutes to spare.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.330
So if they had been 14
minutes more, 15 minutes more,

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.822
they would have
been disqualified.

00:45:30.822 --> 00:45:31.655
That's pretty crazy.

00:45:31.655 --> 00:45:34.900
But they couldn't walk for
like a week afterwards.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.380
And then I tried to
go climbing for myself

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.870
and that did not-- yeah.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.290
So did a bivi and
then the next day

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:48.090
I had to come down because
150 kilometers an hour winds.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.510
That's Patagonia for you.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.590
Then I came back
last year again.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:53.470
Same thing, same deal.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:56.310
Just keep moving a bit.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.970
Shooting at night,
that's the beginning.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:02.690
And then last year,
within 24 hours,

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.030
all but three teams
had dropped out.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.120
There were, I think,
14 teams starting.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.560
Within 24 hours,
11 had dropped out.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.800
That's how tough it is.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.630
And yeah, this picture
is funny because it's

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.630
the only picture-- this
one-- I've actually

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.060
sold of that race.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.444
And, you know.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.120
Yeah.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.490
It's a bit depressing sometimes.

00:46:30.737 --> 00:46:32.570
And here I am crossing
the Hielo Continental

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.380
Sur, which is a
crazy ass glacier.

00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:38.580
And here trying to
be a photographer,

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.930
trying to have graphic elements
and showing how huge it is.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.720
They told us in
the briefing it's

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.140
going to be 11
kilometers crossed

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.030
in two hours, no crevasses.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:54.470
And we walked 29 kilometers and
some of the biggest crevasses

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.074
that I've ever seen.

00:46:56.074 --> 00:46:57.490
And those guys,
most of those guys

00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:59.350
had never worn crampons before.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:02.597
It was just, none of
them have ice screws.

00:47:02.597 --> 00:47:03.555
It was just ridiculous.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:12.070
So this is, again, trying to
be into the theme of we humans

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.590
are very small things.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.840
That we're trying to find a
crossing, having some fun.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.150
That was some of the
teams that dropped out

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:21.640
that we walked back with them.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.490
Yeah, because we already
did 29 kilometers

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.320
and then slept, and then
walked back 29 kilometers

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.887
the other way.

00:47:29.887 --> 00:47:30.970
So we had a bit more time.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.270
So we just had some fun.

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.770
And those guys are two
fellow photographers,

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.380
and I'm going to Greenland
with this guy soon.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.780
And Chris had gotten
really badly burned

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.700
after a small accident
with a jet [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.590
And he still had to walk out.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.780
Even if you get badly injured,
you still have to walk out.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.605
I mean if it's life
threatening, maybe

00:47:52.605 --> 00:47:54.480
the Navy will come and
get you by helicopter.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.710
If not you walk.

00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:02.710
And he had something like
14 hours walk on his really,

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.793
really badly injured foot.

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:07.016
Yeah.

00:48:07.016 --> 00:48:08.830
Kayaking, kayaking.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.946
AUDIENCE: So why did
they all drop out?

00:48:10.946 --> 00:48:12.820
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Too
late, usually too slow.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:14.850
AUDIENCE: So they're at
the checkpoint [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.725
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah,
there are checkpoints

00:48:16.725 --> 00:48:18.460
and they have time barriers.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.025
And yes, getting into the
water to try and get the shot.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.727
This guy.

00:48:24.727 --> 00:48:26.810
And then trying to make
the most of my time there,

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:33.720
and this guy was a big ranch
owner, some gaucho pictures.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.690
Whatever works.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.750
And then the finish line
you kind of have to get.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.000
And it's interesting because
then you get the emotion.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.210
And that's something I'm
always looking for my pictures.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.030
And I'm getting
very [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.700
Went climbing afterwards.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.540
Had some fun.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.720
Took some bad
images for clients.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.000
That's for Petzl.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.960
They want to take the headlamps,
so we shot the headlamps.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.550
There you go.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:57.440
And more headlamps.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.140
You can't really see, that's
Cerro Torre in the background.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.870
And we tried to go climbing.

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:04.615
Yeah, so that's kind
of like a sunrise.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.900
We tried to go climbing a
rock route below Cerro Torre.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:16.600
And it was 11 hours approach,
and we bailed after 10 meters

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.810
because it was too hard.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.795
I was climbing.

00:49:22.795 --> 00:49:26.540
We tried again another
time and then got

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:31.346
that picture, which is also
on the cover of the book.

00:49:31.346 --> 00:49:32.970
And same thing, I
was actually climbing

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:37.640
when I took that but I had
the camera there, accessible.

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.310
And that was at the
very end of the day

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.667
when I really wanted
to go back to the tent

00:49:41.667 --> 00:49:46.040
and sleep and not have
to abseil yet again.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.120
But didn't completely turn down
the camera and the camera brain

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.987
and got that, which I
think works really well.

00:49:53.987 --> 00:49:56.070
And sometimes you have to
take really bad pictures

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:57.020
for clients.

00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:00.240
And I was charging the
headlamp with that.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.930
And that's it.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.740
Thank you very much.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:13.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:13.154 --> 00:50:15.070
AUDIENCE: I actually
just want to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:26.075 --> 00:50:27.075
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Right.

00:50:27.075 --> 00:50:28.450
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:29.616
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah sure.

00:50:29.616 --> 00:50:32.630
So the question is basically
what are the economics of it.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.190
And whether I can make a
good living at it or not.

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:40.430
It's a very complex question
to answer because there

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.330
is no business plan
for photographers.

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.780
There's no single
way of getting money.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.150
So I get money from a
lot of different sources.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.730
One of them is assignments
where people pay me upfront

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.300
and then I bring
back the pictures.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.700
One way is spec shoots.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.400
So I go out on my
own time, I shoot,

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.170
and then I send the pictures
afterwards to the clients,

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:05.037
and usually to Patagonia and
Black Diamond and whatnot.

00:51:05.037 --> 00:51:07.620
And then they say yeah, yeah,
we like that, we can now buy it.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.692
The Eiger was like that.

00:51:08.692 --> 00:51:11.150
I paid my own money, and then
I sold the picture afterwards

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.100
to the sponsors
and to magazines.

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.360
And then I also
do fine art prints

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.390
which brings me a
fair amount of money.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:23.000
And being a photographer right
now is very, very challenging.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.260
What saves me is that not
that many people climb and not

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:28.801
that many people
do mountaineering.

00:51:28.801 --> 00:51:30.300
There are lots of
climbers who shoot

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.150
and lots of photographers
who climb a bit,

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.300
but not many people who do both
well enough that people will

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.420
actually pay you money to do it.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:43.164
And I mean there are some, and
we are three just in Germany.

00:51:43.164 --> 00:51:45.080
And there's of course
many more in Switzerland

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.540
and Germany and France.

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.260
But we are not that many.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.920
So that's kind of what saves me.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.352
And I'm making a
decent amount of money.

00:51:52.352 --> 00:51:54.310
I'm not rich by any
stretch of the imagination,

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.613
but I can sustain the
lifestyle, and that's really

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.071
what I'm [INAUDIBLE]
at the moment.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.450
Yeah.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.850
AUDIENCE: Do you see your
pictures stolen somewhere

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.111
and what do you do about that?

00:52:07.111 --> 00:52:08.110
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Right.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.193
So the question is whether
my pictures were stolen

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.260
and yes, every single day.

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.840
They get stolen a lot.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:20.260
They usually don't get stolen
too much by commercially.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.940
So people end up making
too much money from them

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.580
that I wouldn't be seeing.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.020
That happens, though.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.132
I sometimes try
to go after them.

00:52:29.132 --> 00:52:30.840
So if it's stuff like
Pinterest or Tumblr

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:35.680
or just Russian sites always
have those 25 crazy images

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.870
or 25 most clicked,
blah blah blah blah,

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:42.451
I don't even bother sending
DMCAs, because what can you do.

00:52:42.451 --> 00:52:43.950
It has happened to
me a couple times

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:45.366
that people used
them commercially

00:52:45.366 --> 00:52:47.750
and that I've managed to
get money out of it, usually

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.440
as an invoice up front.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.660
But most of the time, I
shouldn't be saying this,

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.600
but most of the
time I'm bluffing.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.160
I'm saying I'm going to
explore my legal options is

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.380
the wording I use.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.520
But my legal options,
if the guy is in Russia

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:04.370
or is in South
America is nothing.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.504
So when it happens,
the few times

00:53:06.504 --> 00:53:07.920
where I've managed
to actually get

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.586
money for pictures
that have been stolen

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:11.960
was people I had
talked to already

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.839
who had asked me for
quotes, I had sent quotes,

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:17.380
and then they said
no thanks and then

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.062
I find the images used anyway.

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.770
And then I contact
them and say, oh yeah,

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.430
it was a mistake,
blah blah blah.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:24.270
And then they've paid.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.500
But that's very rare.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.390
I don't lose money, it's just
money that I'm not earning.

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:36.000
So I try not to spend too
much time thinking about it.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.850
But yeah, it's a reality of how
the Internet works, basically.

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.290
And I use, often, reverse
searches with Google Images

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.874
to find uses.

00:53:45.874 --> 00:53:47.540
So whoever's involved
with that, thanks.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:52.880
Sorry.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.857
Yeah, go for it.

00:53:53.857 --> 00:53:55.398
AUDIENCE: How many
more images do you

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:58.707
take when you get intentionally
are good images versus those

00:53:58.707 --> 00:53:59.850
you find [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:00.850
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Right.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:05.770
So the question is about
ratio of good to bad images.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.620
It really varies.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.950
On a typical shoot,
I will shoot maybe,

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.580
I don't know, 1,000
pictures in a day.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.010
And of those I will try to
take no more than 10 to 15.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.140
And that's actually
a pretty high number.

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:23.970
I will usually narrow that down
even more to three or four.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.500
And self editing is one
of the hardest bits.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.140
But I wouldn't be able
to put a definite figure

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.350
to tell you it's 2% or it's 10%.

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:34.610
All I can tell you
is that for me,

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.060
as for every single
photographer,

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.320
even Ansel Adams
and Robert Doisneau,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.620
and whoever your
photo hero is has

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.120
tons of garbage in their files.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.464
But the trick is to just
never show it to anybody.

00:54:47.464 --> 00:54:48.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:54.099 --> 00:54:55.890
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
Especially with climbing,

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:57.810
it's different than
shooting in a studio,

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.450
because you can
only plan so much.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:04.000
Like I made very advanced plans
for the ice climbing shoot

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.740
by night thing,
and then everything

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.240
fell out right
away, pretty much.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.030
So I had to improvise.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.080
Usually when I make
plans, I do get the image

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.280
that I had planned hopefully.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.310
And then I'll try to improvise.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.700
So I don't think there's
a very big difference.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.525
Yeah.

00:55:20.525 --> 00:55:22.150
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned a few photos

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:23.620
that you sold a
lot of prints of.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.100
How do you sell the prints?

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.558
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
So the way I sell

00:55:26.558 --> 00:55:33.950
prints is the fine art world
is very weird in that value

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:37.500
is completely disconnected
from the value

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.580
of the physical
object of the print.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:44.390
So if I was selling a print
at EUR 50, people would think,

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.450
oh this print is worth EUR 50.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:50.510
If I sell the print like I
do now, I'd start at EUR 500

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:54.710
for A3, people will
automatically think,

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:56.910
oh this must be a
really good print.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.730
And of course, if
you're [INAUDIBLE],

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.510
and you start pricing
your stuff EUR 50 million,

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:04.550
people think, oh that's
because he's an amazing artist.

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:06.520
Even though the print
actually cost me the same

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.750
as if I was selling it EUR 50.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.210
So I made a conscious
decision to position myself

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.680
in the very high
end simply because I

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.950
guess I could get the
same kind of revenue

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.730
if I was selling
10 images of EUR 50

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.580
as if I was selling one
at 500, give or take.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:28.260
But it takes me a lot less
time and a lot less energy

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.120
to be dealing with images
that are on the high end.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.580
So the way, concretely,
how it works,

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.300
it's just I have a page that's
called prints on my website

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.630
and on it I say
email me for details,

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:42.190
and then I get back
to them with prices.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.437
And usually 98
percent of the people

00:56:44.437 --> 00:56:46.020
don't even reply
because it's too high

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.430
and that's just the way it is.

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:51.360
But then the 2% that reply
are the one that I actually

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.370
make money from.

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.382
But that's a very small
part of my income.

00:56:55.382 --> 00:56:57.340
I wouldn't be able to
live off fine art prints.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.092
AUDIENCE: Do you
outsource the printing?

00:56:59.092 --> 00:57:00.080
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.347
Well outsource in that I
do a lot of very big prints

00:57:04.347 --> 00:57:05.930
because usually when
people don't bold

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.880
cut your figure [INAUDIBLE]
they actually want

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.610
2 meters wide, which is going
to be EUR 2,000 or something.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.770
And then printers for
that kind of sizes

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:18.380
are very, very expensive, and
I don't have the skills as well

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.970
to make a really good print.

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:24.580
So I use PIKTO, as do many,
many French professional

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:27.400
photographers, which is a
professional lab in Paris that

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.920
prints for museums and
prints for exhibitions.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.820
So I know that the
service is really top.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:37.625
AUDIENCE: So you don't
work with agencies at all?

00:57:37.625 --> 00:57:38.500
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: No.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.360
So stock agencies, no.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.690
I Well, technically yes.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.340
But the contract has almost run
out and I will not renew it.

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.150
And I stopped submitting
stuff there ages ago.

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.270
I do work with
price agencies when

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:53.760
I get pictures like
the free soloing ones,

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.334
I had them run into
many newspapers

00:57:56.334 --> 00:57:58.750
through a press agency, because
I don't have the contacts.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.830
But stock agencies,
it's a volume game.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:05.200
And usually the stuff that sells
is the vain, generic stuff.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.640
And I try not to
shoot generic images.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:14.130
So stock is a dead
end for most people.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.760
I mean, I know some
people who make

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.520
a very good living from stock.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.210
But it's a full time job.

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:21.255
It's soul sucking,
really, because you

00:58:21.255 --> 00:58:23.380
have to spend a lot of time
keywording and shooting

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.190
bland stuff.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:30.810
It really is a full time job
and I'm not interested in that.

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.230
And I don't even shoot
the right stuff anyways.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.730
Yeah.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.188
AUDIENCE: Can you say something
about your decision process

00:58:37.188 --> 00:58:39.020
to switch careers?

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.710
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Right.

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:44.160
I hated computer science.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.005
No.

00:58:45.005 --> 00:58:46.810
So I come from the
same school as Benoit,

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:49.440
which is [INAUDIBLE] in France.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.710
And I started the
Ph.D. Well I really

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.780
hope that some people will
not watch that recording.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.215
But I started my
PhD and was starting

00:58:59.215 --> 00:59:03.680
not to like the stuff
I was studying anymore.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.920
And I basically
stopped caring about

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.880
whether my proofs
were valid or not.

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:12.910
But I finished the PhD.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.380
And I had the nicest,
kindest supervisor ever,

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.790
because he should have
kicked me out within a year.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:22.460
But he kept on with me and
I'm very grateful for that.

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.860
But I basically told myself that
I'm going to finish the PhD.

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.860
And then I'm going to
try to do something else,

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.930
because I'm not happy.

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:31.890
And something else,
the only thing

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.010
I had a chance of making money
with when I finished my PhD

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:36.170
was actually photography.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.795
So I just thought, I'm going to
be living in Germany for a year

00:59:38.795 --> 00:59:41.040
and see if I can
make it work out.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.280
And it turned out I could.

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.050
So the experiment
is ongoing and I'm

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.710
hoping that I won't come back
in five years asking for a job

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:49.444
here.

00:59:49.444 --> 00:59:49.944
Yup.

00:59:49.944 --> 00:59:52.324
AUDIENCE: But you said that
you finished with the school

00:59:52.324 --> 00:59:56.160
in 2011 and in the same
year you published a book.

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.440
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah.

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:03.300
So I did not work very much
on my PhD is the short answer.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.340
And that was actually
really key for me

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:09.100
was to be able to spend all
those three years of PhD,

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.794
really you should say I was a
semiprofessional photographer.

01:00:11.794 --> 01:00:13.710
I was not taking
assignments, but I was really

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.110
building a network of clients
and I was spending time

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:18.880
on my website and spending time
on my marketing and writing

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.920
books.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.780
And that allowed me to
jump into it by the way

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.460
and to really have
to network of clients

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.070
and to really have that
name recognition when

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.650
I had to rely on photography
solely to pay my rent.

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:34.870
Before that, I had
three years where

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.757
my rent was paid by my PhD.

01:00:37.757 --> 01:00:40.152
So yeah.

01:00:40.152 --> 01:00:41.589
Yeah.

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:43.505
AUDIENCE: So when you
go on an assignment

01:00:43.505 --> 01:00:46.423
and the conditions aren't right
or you feel like you're not

01:00:46.423 --> 01:00:49.003
taking good photos, how
do you balance the stress

01:00:49.003 --> 01:00:53.301
that you need to go
back to your employer?

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.800
ALEXANDRE BUISSE:
I mean, they trust

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.360
you to find ways
to make it work.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.120
Usually the clients,
at least the clients

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.300
I have at the moment
who are outdoor clients,

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.850
so they are climbers
and skiers themselves,

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:08.680
so they know that the conditions
sometimes aren't right.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.930
But it's my job to get
them the images back.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:18.670
And usually I try my best and I
always something to bring back.

01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:23.249
And there was one situation, one
case, the Petzl shoot actually.

01:01:23.249 --> 01:01:25.040
It was s two day shoot
and on the first day

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.789
I brought back some
images that he wanted,

01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:29.270
but it turned out that it
wouldn't work with the layout

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.853
that they had because
in the catalogue

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.710
they needed very narrow images.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.580
And none of them would work.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.520
And I was kind of in the brief,
so it was technically my fault.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.030
So I just did a re-shoot
a couple of days later

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:44.590
and I paid the models myself.

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:46.650
So whatever it takes.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.220
My job is to make
the client happy.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.595
They're trusting
me to bring them

01:01:49.595 --> 01:01:51.510
back the images
and my livelihood

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:54.110
depends on not
disappointing them.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.360
But it's extremely stressful.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.980
And for instance, the
"Sports Illustrated" shoot

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.050
was an absolute nightmare
in terms of logistics.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.830
And I did not sleep
for like a week

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.120
before that actually
happened because I was too

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.940
stressed about all the details,
everything that could go wrong.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.960
But usually, mountains
are good looking,

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.420
you're shooting
good looking people.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.947
You can bring back images.

01:02:16.947 --> 01:02:19.749
AUDIENCE: And you mentioned
that most of your income

01:02:19.749 --> 01:02:21.150
doesn't come from print.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.742
Is it from the stipends?

01:02:22.742 --> 01:02:24.950
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah, I
would say it's about 50/50.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.600
I don't have the
figures, but it's

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.500
50% assignments and 50% spec
shoots that I sell afterwards.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.180
And then I have a lot
of clients completely

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.870
unrelated to the outdoors.

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:36.860
Sometimes, actually,
quite a lot of bankers,

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.000
because mountaineering
images speak to them.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.640
You know, the whole challenging
yourself and reaching summits

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.400
and being in a rope
team, blah blah blah.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.590
So they love that stuff.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.890
And I get inquiries
very often from people

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.310
who want to buy images
and who are into finance,

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.280
or into whatever.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.599
Yeah.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:58.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:03.539
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Right.

01:03:03.539 --> 01:03:05.080
So the question is
about how to carry

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.440
the camera while I'm climbing.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.760
And it is one of the questions
I'm asked most frequently.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:16.620
There is no good solution
that's the basic of it.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.910
I use two different systems.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.920
One of them is called
a ThinkTank Skin,

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.960
and it is a belt with
pouches that you can adjust,

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.940
small bags that you can compress
when they're not in use.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.120
It's very modular.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.170
So you can just have
the one for the lights,

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:33.760
and the camera, and lenses.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.930
And I don't use backpacks
and I don't use chest straps,

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.440
because they hide my feet.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.280
And when I'm skiing or
climbing, I have to see my feet.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.810
And that stuff, I can kind
of rotate them out of the way

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:47.390
and can keep my balance
more or less right.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.720
The other system I use is from
a company called Peak Design.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.580
It's the Capture Camera Clip.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.510
And it's a small clamp
that you put on a harness

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.860
or on a backpack,
and then you can just

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.450
take the camera in or out.

01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:03.970
And both systems do not
protect the camera at all,

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:06.897
so I send my lens,
my wide angle lens,

01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:09.147
to Nikon every six months
because the front element is

01:04:09.147 --> 01:04:11.730
shattered.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.250
But as I was saying
earlier, it's a tool.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:16.720
But yeah.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.460
It's a big, bulky thing.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.730
And it's heavy, it's fragile,
and you're doing crazy stuff.

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.037
And there's no good solution.

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:28.120
There's no great solution.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.578
There are OK solutions
to carry a camera.

01:04:31.578 --> 01:04:34.560
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.800
ALEXANDRE BUISSE: Yeah, sure.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.716
Well thanks very much.

01:04:36.716 --> 01:04:39.080
And then I'm going to be here
for the evening, I guess,

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.530
if you guys want to chat
or take a look at the book.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:43.320
Thanks very much.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:05:16.717
[APPLAUSE]
