ANNOUNCER: It is my pleasure
to welcome our illustrious

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.900
speaker.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.950
And in particular, my church
pastor, Father Jack McClure

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.329
from Most Holy
Redeemer in the Castro,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.984
who will be
moderating and helping

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.150
move the conversation along.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.740
So I'm going to kick
it off for y'all.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.939
JACK MCCLURE: Thank you.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.480
Thank you, everybody,
for being here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.354
Thank you, Matthew for
coming and joining us.

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:29.520
We're looking forward to hearing
your perspectives and how

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.890
you came to them and sharing
with the group gathered here

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.330
today ways that we
all can think with you

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.560
and how our thinking might
need to change, as well,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.280
or we'll be invited to.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.740
So, as a Roman
Catholic priest, I'm

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.320
excited to listen
to how you present.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.120
Because it's an important
topic in my church, right now.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.750
And my understanding is key,
so I join with this group

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.490
here in looking forward
to your comment.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.140
So thank you for being here.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.690
Welcome.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.150
MATTHEW VINES: Well,
thank you so much.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.983
JACK MCCLURE: Tell us
about you a little bit

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:01.310
so that we all know how
you came to the positions

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.219
that you're holding,
and enlighten us.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.260
MATTHEW VINES: All right.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.370
Well, first I want to say thank
you to Raymond for inviting me

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.540
and the whole LGBT Pride
Week team for coordinating.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.735
I really appreciate that.

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:14.860
It is wonderful to be here.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.340
So you want some
of my backstory,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.250
in terms of how I
got to this point?

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.833
JACK MCCLURE: I
thought in your book--

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.550
I got to look at your book
and to read some parts of it.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.550
I thought it was very
interesting, the beginning

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.930
part, when you decided
you needed to come out,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.975
to go home and share with
your family and your parents.

00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:37.850
MATTHEW VINES: Right.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.060
So that was the fall 2009 that
I first acknowledged to myself

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.190
that I was gay.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.700
The reason why
that was difficult

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.060
was because I am from
Kansas, from Wichita, Kansas

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.300
and grew up in a conservative,
evangelical Presbyterian

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.080
church, there,
where there was just

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.620
no open conversation around
being gay or anything

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.000
other than straight.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.520
We actually had a good
friend who had grown up,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520
just a couple years older
than me in our church,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.161
was really well regarded
until he came out

00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.410
his sophomore year of college.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.700
And then it was like
he had been erased

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.290
from the memory
of the community.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530
And nobody wanted to
talk about him anymore.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.440
It was very frustrating
to witness that.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.019
But also, those
are all the sorts

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.060
of things that made it
difficult for me to accept

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060
the fact that I was gay.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.250
Because my parents would
not be OK with that.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.070
So many of our closest
family friends from church

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.890
would not be OK with that.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.490
But if you are gay,
you kind of have

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.695
to deal with it, eventually.

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:43.760
Well, you don't have to, but
it's going to eat away at you,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.530
pretty significantly,
if you don't.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.656
So it helped me a lot, going
away to Harvard for college.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.780
I think we have some-- do
we have some Harvard 2012

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.544
people in the house?

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:56.210
I know we have at
least one Harvard 2012

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.690
person in the house--
who's not raising his hand.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.190
That's OK.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.090
Yeah, so Harvard is a very, very
different place from Kansas.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.170
I don't know if
people knew that.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.530
But they're slightly different.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.840
And one of the biggest
differences-- I mean,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.400
one of these
differences is that it

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.380
was really cold and depressing.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.870
But apart from that-- I think
that's just an East Coast

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.820
thing-- there was much more
openness to LGBT students

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.840
on campus, which was awesome.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.810
And that helped me
to really experience

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.360
what life could look
like as a gay person,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.060
and be able to
actually see that it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.420
possible to have a dignified
future as a gay person.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.670
Which is something that-- we
all read the same headlines

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.212
in the newspapers about gay
rights and things like that.

00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:50.170
But the way that you
experience those headlines

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.140
is shaped very much by your
immediate family and community

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.180
context.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.680
So even though I knew that gay
marriage was being legalized

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.990
in different places, I
still had no direct examples

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.630
in my life of people who are
gay, where that did not result

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.870
in complete ostracisation,
or ostracism, or rejection,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.810
or stigma attached to them.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.029
So growing up in
the community I did,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.439
if you wanted to be a
successful, respectable person,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.980
being gay was
incompatible with that.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.000
Now, obviously, that's
just not true in so much

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.360
of the rest of the country.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.790
But not only is that
steeped in your community,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.990
it's also steeped in
your understanding of God

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.840
and of faith and
Christianity, if you grew up

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.860
in a Christian environment.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.020
So the barriers to sort
of reconsidering that

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.290
are really steep.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.010
But being at a
place like Harvard

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.270
was extremely helpful
for me in being

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.110
able to process some
of these questions.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.950
First, at an impersonal level.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.750
I joined the only
groups at Harvard

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.810
that would not be OK
with it if I came out,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.060
which were like the conservative
Christian ministries.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.720
Because that's where I found the
most continuity with my faith

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.840
community from back home.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.631
And those were some of
the best communities

00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:08.770
that I found it
school, actually.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.800
And so, the first year
that I was at school,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.764
I really sort of asking
a lot more questions

00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:14.430
to other people in
the group about-- I'm

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.920
not really sure I agree with
what this group is saying

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.336
and what the church
I'd grew up in

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.250
is saying about gay marriage.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.120
And so, we had some informal
gatherings about it.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.809
I read some.

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.100
We had some discussions that
helped me to really change

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.700
my mind on the issue.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.400
At that point, it
wasn't a total 180.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.250
I already felt, very
strongly, like there

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.280
was a-- like I couldn't accept
what I had been raised with,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.120
for just basic Christian
principles of justice

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.310
and all of those things.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.450
But I still didn't know
how to articulate that

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.667
from the Bible-based
standpoint that I grew up with.

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:50.000
And so, being able to learn
a little bit more about that

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.210
helped me to decide that I was
convinced that LGBT issues were

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.350
justice issues.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.766
And that there was something
I wanted to advocate for.

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:02.390
And it was only after that point
that, then, I could ask myself

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.420
whether or not I was gay,
which I wasn't very thrilled

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.628
about-- even though I didn't
think there was anything

00:06:06.628 --> 00:06:09.770
wrong with being gay anymore--
just because I didn't want

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.150
to deal with the potential
loss of so many relationships.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.550
So I ended up taking
a semester off school,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.060
going home, coming
out to my parents.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.770
And then just working
through the conversation

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.210
around the Bible and same-sex
relationships with them.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.975
They were not thrilled
that I was gay.

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:29.380
And they were also
totally shocked.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.884
It just wasn't within their--
very few of my friends

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:32.800
were all that shocked.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.900
But it wasn't within their-- the
realm of possibility for them,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.410
because they figured if
you raised your child well,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.014
then they're not
going to be gay.

00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:42.430
Which we know is
not how it works.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.780
JACK MCCLURE: Right.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.130
MATTHEW VINES: But that's how
a lot of Christian parents

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.620
sort of approach it or
avoid thinking about it.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.620
But they end up
changing their minds.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.940
And for my dad, in
particular, studying the Bible

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.010
and same-sex
relationships was pivotal

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.425
for him changing his mind.

00:06:56.425 --> 00:06:57.550
And so, a lot people then--

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.100
JACK MCCLURE: I like how
you did that in the book.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.530
Along that line,
what let you then

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.370
move from-- I think I gathered
that his probing and his

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.000
looking in the scriptures
with you-- see,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.400
that's a tradition that your
particular faith community

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.670
would have, not
always the tradition

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.050
that some here are a part of.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.000
So biblically based,
then you went into strive

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.970
and to delve more deeply.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.870
How did you move from that
place with your father

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.740
and you coming to
that understanding?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.140
What let you get underneath
the things that have let

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.690
you come to the conclusions?

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.950
But I think you state, very
interestingly, in your book,

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.945
how did you get there?

00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:38.820
MATTHEW VINES: Well, so
it's a couple things.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.030
One, growing up in a
Protestant evangelical home,

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.420
sola scriptura is
kind of the mantra--

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.170
JACK MCCLURE: Mhm.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.400
And say what that means.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.210
MATTHEW VINES: Only
scripture-- scripture alone

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.760
is how we learn about God and
how we discern what is true.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.360
In a sense that,
specifically, as

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.640
in opposition to
the Catholic Church,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.890
and the idea that you
figure out what's true about

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.370
scripture through
the magisterium.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.870
Which I got through
the magisterium,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.181
instead, know-- just going
back to the principles

00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:12.722
of the Reformation-- we're going
to figure it out on our own.

00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:15.240
Now, obviously that
spawned several 10s

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.510
of thousands of denominations.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.614
But it also--

00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:20.030
JACK MCCLURE: And relative to
that, that's important to us

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.960
here, from a Roman
Catholic-- or some

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.180
of your more ritualistic
celebrations of church--

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.130
would see the sacrament
as in combination

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.950
with the magisterium, is
the way we would say that.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.299
And the Protestant
tradition would

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.304
say, in scripture alone-- sola
scriptura, as you called it.

00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:41.179
MATTHEW VINES: Right.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.179
JACK MCCLURE: In
scripture alone,

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.340
and so actually, it
seems to me that we're

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.680
kind of moving toward a better
understanding, in the Roman

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.640
Catholic side, of scripture.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.380
Because we had not studied it
as people, as the people of God.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.830
Our priests had and theologians.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.730
But you got into some
of that study, which

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.230
I think has become very,
very important to you,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.060
to understand that
which is underneath some

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.160
of the scriptural texts.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.049
Is that--

00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:06.840
MATTHEW VINES: Yes.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.490
And part of the reason why that
study is possible, or possible

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.270
to be more effective
within my context,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.870
is because, theoretically,
at least, with Protestants,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.571
all you have to do
is convince someone

00:09:19.571 --> 00:09:21.320
of a different
interpretation of the text.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.760
JACK MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.520
MATTHEW VINES: And
that is all, in theory,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.855
that is required in order to
change beliefs and then change

00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:27.355
doctrines.

00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:30.860
Now, obviously, there are
natural, institutional hurdles,

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.670
as well.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.140
But they are not formal
institutional hurdles

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.650
that's anywhere like what you
have in the Catholic church.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.994
So what I end up doing
was finding every resource

00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:42.410
that I could get
my hands on about

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.979
the Bible and homosexuality.

00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:46.270
And there are two main types
of resources that I found.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.640
One were very
academic texts, that

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.870
often had a lot of
wonderful research in them,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.116
but were just quite
inaccessible for somebody who--

00:09:58.116 --> 00:09:59.490
for your average
person at church

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.060
you might want to
ask to reconsider,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.900
who has a job and four kids.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.890
You can't say, go
read this 500 page

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.020
tome that is in six languages.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.760
And then, could you let me
know what you think about it?

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.780
That's not sufficient.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.740
But there's a lot of
important things there.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.740
But I also found a lot of
more popular level literature

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.250
that was easy to read but do not
speak to people like my parents

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.894
in a way that was
going to be helpful.

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:25.310
Because it would
start off, and it

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.672
would express presuppositions
about the Bible

00:10:27.672 --> 00:10:29.130
from the very
beginning, that would

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.490
be offensive to, say, my dad.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.130
If you start off
and you say, well,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.420
the Bible says a
lot of wacky things

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.584
and we just need to take it
a little bit less seriously,

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:41.000
or if that's the impression
somebody gets in the first two

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.990
pages of your book, my dad
won't read beyond the first two

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.200
pages of your book.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.000
Because the way
that this debate has

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.780
been cast for a lot of
conservative Christians,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.160
and part of the reason why
LGBT issues remain so fraught

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.010
in a lot of the country--
especially Middle America

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.840
and the South-- is
because many Christians

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.170
have come to believe that if
they change what they think

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.620
about same sex relationships,
they're actually

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.040
going to be required to change
the entire infrastructure

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.977
for their faith.

00:11:08.977 --> 00:11:10.810
And it's not just a
question of interpreting

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.819
a select amount of
texts in the Bible,

00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:14.360
but it's a question
of whether or not

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.330
the Bible should carry the
same weight and significance

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.270
in their lives at all.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.640
And so, if I were to give
a resource to somebody

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.170
at my church that
basically indicates, change

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.200
your mind on same-sex
relationships

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.170
by taking by Bible
less seriously,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.724
that's just not going to fly.

00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.640
Because you're going to
the very heart of what

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.370
is most important to
someone's worldview

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.210
and asking them to set it aside.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.050
Some people may be willing
to do that-- not most people.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.180
And if that is all that
LGBT kids growing up

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.400
in conservative Christian
homes have at their disposal,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.332
when they're coming out, that's
not nearly sufficient for them.

00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:53.790
And so, part of
what I wanted to do

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.550
was to take a lot of-- to
synthesize a lot of the best

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.390
insights of academics
and biblical scholars,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.120
but then re-present them in both
a much more accessible form,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.820
but also, specifically, within
the theological framework

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.960
that I grew up with.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.820
So sometimes that
requires revisions.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.564
There might be somebody-- you
can have some of the-- I mean,

00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:20.230
there are scholars I
cite in my book who

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.384
are very progressive Christians,
who are atheists, agnostics.

00:12:25.384 --> 00:12:27.050
It doesn't really
matter what your faith

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.520
is in terms of how you
do historiography, right.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.780
So one of the best
historians of ancient,

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.780
what we would call,
sexuality-- even though it's

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.560
kind of anachronism--
is David Halpern, who's

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.400
not of any religion at all.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.730
But I would still happily
rely on a lot of this work

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.630
to understand a lot of the
ancient constructs and contexts

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.690
around sexuality.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:54.240
However, you can only rely
on that kind of work so far.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.630
And then you have to put
it within your own context

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.710
and make sure that you're
grounding it within principles

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.460
around scripture that
are consistent with those

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.510
of your community.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.234
So that was really what I
set out to do with my dad,

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:08.650
initially just, like, over
dinner table conversations when

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.700
I was home.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.480
Then, it turned into engaging
our church much more widely.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.380
Then, it led me to,
two years later,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.370
give an hour-long talk at a
church in Wichita, Kansas,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.420
where I'm from,
all about the Bible

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.570
and homosexuality, specifically
within that framework for more

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.600
conservative Christians.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.900
And then that talk led to
the book, "God and the Gay

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.830
Christian," which
came out last year.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.640
And so, all of it
is really designed.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.990
It's about giving
the specific language

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.200
and the specific approach
that can be persuasive

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.380
to evangelicals and to
conservative Christians.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.390
Some people are not open to
being persuaded right now.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.660
However, they're really
not my target audience.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.440
Because there are people--
they're still a minority--

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.030
but there is a
significant minority

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.430
of people in the evangelical
Christian world who

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.822
are open to being persuaded.

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:00.530
JACK MCCLURE: OK.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.290
MATTHEW VINES: And
you simply have

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.970
to give them a strong enough
biblical argument in order

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.960
to succeed.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.730
JACK MCCLURE: I think
one of the things

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.938
that I noted in your book,
that I really appreciated,

00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:09.530
is how you bring it
to the experience.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.610
How you let the lived
experience of what's happening

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.280
is what is happening within the
world of LGBT and transgendered

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.300
and gay-- the whole
population-- I

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.770
think you give good examples
of how they have experienced

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.810
that separation.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.919
And I think you
addressed that, too.

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:28.710
MATTHEW VINES: Yes.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.251
There are a couple
things about that.

00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:31.940
I think that experience
matters a lot.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.980
But especially
when you're talking

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.930
to conservative
Christians, it's important

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.720
that you don't present
experience as somehow

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.100
overriding scripture.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.800
Because we all
know that there are

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.090
a lot of really heart rending
stories that LGBT people have,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:55.710
about how they've been
treated by families, churches,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.390
society at large.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.830
However, a lot of
conservative Christians

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.350
have a kind of
built-in resistance

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.820
to listening to those stories,
when the stories are presented

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.360
in opposition to scripture,
even if not explicitly.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.540
Part the reason why many
conservative Christians,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.640
you might send them,
like, if you have friends

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.920
who are evangelical or just
on the more-- who are not,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840
what I would call, are
not LGBT affirming.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.530
And then you might
send them a really

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.060
heartwarming "It
gets better" video.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.830
And then they watch
it, and it really

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.510
doesn't seem to
have reached them.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.470
It doesn't seem to
have engaged them.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.511
One reason why it doesn't
reach them, many times,

00:15:36.511 --> 00:15:41.964
is because there is this kind of
wall built up that they filter

00:15:41.964 --> 00:15:43.005
things like that through.

00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:47.230
And that wall is this biblical
interpretation that says,

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.840
this experience, in order for
me to accept its legitimacy

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.540
in a meaningful enough way to
make you rethink what I think,

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.850
is in conflict with this core
aspect of my world-view, which

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.830
is the Bible.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.685
And so, what I'm trying to do,
when I talk about experience,

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:04.570
is specifically
talk about why it

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.432
doesn't have to be in conflict.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.140
And so, at the very
beginning of my book,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.340
I talk about how, in
a sermon on the mount,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:16.150
in the book of Matthew,
Jesus offers his followers

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.430
a kind of test for how to
discern false prophets.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.970
And he says, by their fruits
you will recognize them.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.150
A good tree bears good fruit,
and a bad tree bears bad fruit.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.130
And a good tree
cannot bear bad fruit,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.430
and a bad tree cannot
bear good fruit.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.490
And the Bible talks about
what the fruit of the Spirit

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.530
looks like, in the
book of Galatians.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.730
So love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness,

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.770
faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.610
those kinds of things,
those are the types

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.780
of traits that we see in many
same-sex relationships, today.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.470
Conversely, when LGBT people
are rejected by their churches,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.680
by their families,
that doesn't lead

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.410
to the fruit of the Spirit,
as the Bible describes it.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.780
It leads to profound
devastation, isolation, harm,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.890
pain, suffering.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.349
And so that is kind
of a better way,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.750
I've found, to approach
the experience argument,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.849
is to put it in the context
of Jesus' own teachings.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.810
And say, according to
Jesus' own teachings,

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.400
if we're seeing bad fruit, then
that's coming from a bad tree.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.380
And so, if the teaching that all
same-sex relationships are sin

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.069
is producing bad
fruit, the teaching

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.150
itself may be a bad tree.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.200
And so, that doesn't mean
that alone solves the issue,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.060
but it helps to open
the door for people

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.720
to maybe be more
willing to reconsider.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.370
But then you still
have to convince them

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.370
of how to read the main
biblical texts that

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.630
refer to same-sex relations.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.530
That's doubtful.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.905
JACK MCCLURE: And isn't that
what your father showed you,

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.070
in his experience?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.680
You came home-- in the telling
the story-- you came home,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.690
and it upset both
of them, the way

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.240
you explained it in your book.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.020
But in the final
analysis, they loved you.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.620
And in their experience,
that changed--

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.960
that had to change
their perspective on,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.020
what does it mean
to have a gay son?

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.750
What does it mean to
have that member be

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.646
in my family, and he's mine?

00:18:13.646 --> 00:18:14.520
MATTHEW VINES: Right.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.103
Well, they didn't
have any perspective

00:18:16.103 --> 00:18:18.650
on having a gay son before,
because that wasn't within what

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.733
they thought was possible.

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:22.590
But for my dad, I would say
that me coming out to him

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.340
changed his heart.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.410
But his mind did not
change until we did

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.890
an in-depth study of scripture.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.348
JACK MCCLURE: And
he would not have

00:18:32.348 --> 00:18:34.990
been open to that investigation
without that experience.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.870
MATTHEW VINES: Right.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.660
And so, experience
is very important.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.534
But also, rarely
is it sufficient--

00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:41.450
JACK MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.210
MATTHEW VINES:
--for people coming

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.919
from more conservative
faith backgrounds.

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:45.376
JACK MCCLURE: And
I think that what

00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:47.910
we have in our population,
that's here with us today is,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.550
a deeper understanding, a better
understanding of how people

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:58.020
are people, different as we are,
variances are more-- we talked

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.110
at lunch, people from
all over, when you start

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.370
bringing different
perspectives and views,

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.980
changes the experience.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.850
And as you have
friends who are gay,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.547
and as you have family members
that are gay and lesbian,

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:11.005
and all of that,
I think, then, you

00:19:11.005 --> 00:19:12.720
would take a different approach.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.670
Your research is really timely,
in terms of the conversation

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.570
that's happening.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.090
Because you went
under it from not just

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.980
an academic point
of view, but it

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.700
seems to me that you
tried to also look

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.090
at the culture behind
it, in addition

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.660
to just a literal academic
part-- which, of culture, is

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.170
extremely important.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.010
Would you share a
little bit about how

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.576
that formed your thinking?

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:37.200
MATTHEW VINES: Well,
part of-- and this

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.241
may not be the exact
question that you're asking.

00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:41.170
So tell me if I'm
going off-track, here.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:45.160
But part of the cultural
analysis, for me,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.950
is about how to take a message
and really put it into action.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.830
So how do you actually get
into-- if it is possible,

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.810
and I do think it is
possible-- so my dad, right,

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.890
it's kind of like what I was
seeking to fashion was, like,

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:04.380
almost a key to unlock the
door to changing his mind.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.670
And relationships are a
critical piece of that.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.390
But the scriptural argument
is equally critical.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.310
And so, it's like the book
is the scriptural argument.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.600
But then the question is,
from a cultural standpoint,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.910
even once you have that,
there's still the question of,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.680
how do you actually
put that into practice

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.037
to affect widespread change?

00:20:23.037 --> 00:20:24.620
And so, that's really
what I'm seeking

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.070
to do through the nonprofit
organization that I run.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.570
JACK MCCLURE: And
the name of it is?

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.710
MATTHEW VINES: It's called
the Reaffirmation Project,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.940
and I started it a
couple years ago.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.740
We run conferences around
the country for Christians,

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.470
what we call LGBT
affirming Christians

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.950
in non-affirming contexts.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.110
And it's specifically
designed to give them

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.470
the Bible based
tools that they need

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.280
to empower them to
become vocal advocates

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.290
for the LGBT community
in their churches.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.960
So we just did a big conference
in Atlanta, a week and a half

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.580
ago.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.640
We had several hundred
people come from mostly

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.817
across the South.

00:20:57.817 --> 00:20:59.400
And the goal through
these conferences

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.460
is about training and equipping.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.240
So because there are what I
call "silent sympathizers,"

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.720
in churches of almost all kinds,
no matter how conservative,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.590
a minority people who
feel the sense of conflict

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:12.050
about their church's posture.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.990
But the main reason
why they don't so

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.307
give voice to their sense
of internal conflict

00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:18.890
is because they don't
know how to talk

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.240
about the Bible and
same-sex relationships

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.710
in a way that will
even potentially

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.930
be persuasive to other
people in their church.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.130
And so, what we worked
to do is to identify

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.910
those silent sympathizers,
and then to equip them,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:32.430
to give them the
messages that they need.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.020
And it doesn't make it easy.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.920
It doesn't make
them-- that does not

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.436
produce success with everyone.

00:21:37.436 --> 00:21:38.810
It probably only
produces success

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.020
in a minority of people.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.390
But really, that's all you need.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.556
Because in a church, like
the one that I grew up in,

00:21:43.556 --> 00:21:47.010
of 2,000 people, not a single
person, before I came out,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.010
had been willing to say
publicly that they did not

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.822
believe that same-sex
relationships were sinful.

00:21:52.822 --> 00:21:55.280
And once I came out, we found
out that some of our friends,

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.030
privately, did not believe
that same-sex relationships are

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.932
wrong.

00:21:58.932 --> 00:22:00.890
But they would not give
voice to that publicly,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.680
because the pressure not
to do so was so great,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.490
and they didn't know how to
really speak to people's core

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.100
concerns about that.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.730
So that's really our goal,
then, through the Reformation

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.660
Project.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.460
We know we have--

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.710
JACK MCCLURE: It seems like
it's an opportunity, then,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.910
for people to give voice
to their own thoughts

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.640
and their own experiences.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.290
So that's a very important part
of unloosing, understanding,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.140
I think, about their difference.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.800
I think we're seeing
that in religions,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.660
certainly from a Roman
Catholic point of view.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.142
I am very interested
in how we're

00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:36.600
going to interface with our
Protestant brothers and sisters

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.130
to finally become unified.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.050
The research that
you did, and the part

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:44.580
that I found so interesting
and intriguing with what

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.494
you were looking at
is, you not only looked

00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:47.660
at the culture of that time.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.150
Now, you're trying to bring it
to the culture at this time.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.650
I thought that was significant.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.580
You gave an example of how
some things have been forbidden

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.610
in "Old Testament" and they're
not, in our understanding,

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.530
today.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.660
Would that help any
clarity, bring clarity,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.800
do you think, to the people
about how texts can be used?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.300
I think it's important for them
to understand that from you.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.300
MATTHEW VINES: OK, yeah.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.820
So part of the cultural
argument that I make,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.450
in terms of interpreting texts,
specifically ancient texts,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.190
requires a broader understanding
of ancient concepts

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.840
and constructions of
what we call sexuality.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.990
JACK MCCLURE: Or any kind
of given communication.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.400
For instance-- and this will
be really strange-- but today,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.570
it's hard for us not
to imagine people

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.410
being able to read and write.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.680
And having access
to pencil and paper,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.100
with the computerization that
we have, it's almost instant.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.120
But when we look back,
we realize just how much

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.060
they relied on auditory, and
listening, and telling stories.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.880
And how those stories then
became part of scripture.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.810
And what caused that.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.790
I thought that the way you
presented your information

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.950
about that was very telling.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.570
Because it opened up
that something that

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:04.180
was extremely important to be
taboo with them at that time

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.980
was hygiene related perhaps,
or related other things.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.160
And we don't see
it that way today.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.160
We see difference, we see
a different understanding.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.350
You presented those
kind of understandings,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:19.366
for me, when you reinterpreted--
not reinterpreted.

00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:20.740
What's the language
that you use?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.024
You re-con-- the text.

00:24:22.024 --> 00:24:23.690
MATTHEW VINES: Well,
I mean, I certainly

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.390
am arguing for a
reinterpretation.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:30.740
But I wouldn't place that
agency primarily on me.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.750
Because part of my
goal with the book

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.210
was not actually to be making
any original arguments,

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.700
as odd as that may sound.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.340
Because what I'm trying to do is
to synthesize and to popularize

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.780
the best of the arguments
and insights that

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:50.180
have been pioneered,
debated, vetted, and refined

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.630
by people with far
greater expertise

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.536
in a lot of particular fields
than I could possibly have.

00:24:55.536 --> 00:24:57.410
JACK MCCLURE: You looked
very widely, though.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.320
MATTHEW VINES: Very widely.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.730
JACK MCCLURE: Yes.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.563
MATTHEW VINES: And so
that's why my goal is,

00:25:00.563 --> 00:25:02.000
I didn't want to--
if I was going

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.480
to be making an argument that
actually hadn't been made

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.600
and challenged and then
supported again and further

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.730
refined, I didn't want
to make that argument,

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.270
because that argument would
be likely to fall apart.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.890
So with all the
arguments that I make

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.690
and all the historical
analyses, interpretations,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.110
I don't want any of them
to be original to me.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.950
So in that sense, like, I am
arguing for a reinterpretation.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.640
But I'm also wanting
to argue-- I'm also

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.760
wanting to point people toward
the scholars, and the writers,

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.810
and theologians who
I think have maybe

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.820
done the best work on this
particular nook, right,

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.436
in this particular cranny,
all these particular aspects.

00:25:41.436 --> 00:25:42.810
And then, bring
them all together

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.654
into a more cohesive whole.

00:25:44.654 --> 00:25:46.570
JACK MCCLURE: Was it
evident to you, somewhere

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.930
along the line of your
research and your reading

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.390
and looking and talking with
your dad and looking forward,

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:57.220
did it become evident to you,
sometime, that you said aha,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.680
this is different than
what I had thought?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.300
How did that come to you?

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.852
I would be very interested,
if you could pinpoint it.

00:26:05.852 --> 00:26:06.560
It might be hard.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.000
MATTHEW VINES: Yeah.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.680
I mean, there are
a couple of things,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.480
and a couple of specific texts,
that I'm happy to go into.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.510
And then, if anybody
has questions

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.854
we'd be happy to
take them that point.

00:26:15.854 --> 00:26:17.270
So think about it
if you have any.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.510
JACK MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.090
MATTHEW VINES: So one
text is this famous text

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.420
from the "Old Testament"
about the destruction of Sodom

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.360
and Gomorrah, which is no
longer really at the forefront

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.770
of the conversation anymore.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.010
But it's remarkable how
many Christians still

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.370
associate Sodom and
Gomorrah with gayness.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.300
So, when I asked my
dad in high school

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.300
why we were against
gay rights-- because I

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.050
knew that we were, but I wasn't
really sure why-- he just

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.430
sat me down, opened his
Bible to Genesis, Chapter 19,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.180
and read to me this
story where God

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.080
sends two angels, in the form
of men, into the city of Sodom.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.390
The men of Sodom attempt or
threaten to rape the angels.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.715
And God then destroys the
city with fire and brimstone.

00:27:00.715 --> 00:27:02.840
And so, because these men
were threatening to rape,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.250
at least what appeared
to be, other men, my dad

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.760
said, well, these men
wanted to have sex with men.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.110
God destroyed them for it.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.786
That's why we're
against gay rights.

00:27:11.786 --> 00:27:14.160
That does not make my dad
sound like a very sophisticated

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160
person.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.010
But in fact, he really is.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.790
He just wasn't on this
topic, because he didn't

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.120
know any openly gay people.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.050
He had never been forced to
think very deeply about it.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.480
But when I came out to him, that
was the first text that he went

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.320
back to, and he
sort of said, hm, I

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.410
may not as much as I thought
I knew about this subject.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.160
Because this text,
now, looking at it

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.340
in the light of a broader
understanding of gay people,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.480
that is so different from
the type of relationship

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.339
that you, Matthew, want, right?

00:27:48.339 --> 00:27:50.380
Like, we're talking about
a threatened gang rape.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:50.640
JACK MCCLURE: Mhm.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.400
MATTHEW VINES: And for anybody
who knows any gay people,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.280
these distinctions are
incredibly obvious.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.350
But if you don't know any gay
people, and you just know,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.870
well, I know
homosexuality is a sin.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.345
I know that's because
of stuff in the Bible.

00:28:02.345 --> 00:28:03.720
I know people
bring up this text,

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.940
so there must be connection.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.860
Then you go into the text
searching for the connection.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.510
And even though
it's quite tenuous,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.926
you don't worry
about it too much.

00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:12.440
Because that's just the
way it's supposed to be.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.000
So for my dad, recognizing
that that text was

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.330
about a very different thing.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.830
And then also-- and as I go
into much more depth in the book

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.070
about the history of
interpretation of the Sodom

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.010
story, how for
the first, really,

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.500
2,000 years of that story's
existence-- of course,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.530
it dates back probably
to about 1400 BC,

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.710
at least in the oral
tradition-- it was not

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.390
understood by the Israelites
and the ancient Jews

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.560
to be about same sex anything.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.290
And then the 20 other
references to Sodom and Gomorrah

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.450
in the rest of the Bible do
not refer to same-sex behavior

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.480
as part of the sin
of Sodom, but are

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.390
quite explicit that
the sin of Sodom

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.140
has to do with
arrogance and apathy

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.547
toward the poor,
oppression, inhospitality,

00:28:53.547 --> 00:28:54.630
all sorts of those things.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.740
So for my dad, that really
was a door opener for him

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.552
in going back to some
of these other texts.

00:29:00.552 --> 00:29:02.010
Because he figured,
if I could have

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.660
been mistaken about
this text, then it's

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.190
possible I've been mistaken
about the other texts.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.120
And there's another
really important text

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.850
in the "New Testament,"
by the Apostle Paul,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:19.240
in Romans Chapter I, where
Paul describes and condemns

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.140
lustful, same-sex behavior.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.510
He talks about how-- without
going into all the detail--

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.170
he talks about how
women exchanged natural

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:31.160
for unnatural relations, and
men abandoned natural relations

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.540
with women, became inflamed
with lust, one for another,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.120
and committed indecent
acts with other men.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.320
And I remember
just sitting down.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.800
For a lot of
evangelicals, that text

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.730
is perhaps the
most important one,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.550
in terms of what would be
a stumbling block for them

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.485
for reconsidering.

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:49.860
I just remember
telling my dad, I

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.100
was like, Dad-- like, over
our dinner table one night--

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.299
like, these people are
consumed with their lusts.

00:29:57.299 --> 00:29:59.090
It specifically is
talking about people who

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.150
are just, like, lust-filled.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:05.100
And I was like, that is
not my goal or my vision

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.070
for my future, right.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.040
Like, I want to have
a relationship that's

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.970
like the relationship
you have with Mom, that's

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.460
a stable, long-term
relationship with the basis

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.050
of a home and a family.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:23.910
I was just, like, to me, these
are really different issues.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.089
And that text is a
very complicated text.

00:30:27.089 --> 00:30:29.130
So there's a lot more the
could be said about it.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:33.220
But for my dad, just recognizing
that distinction, you're right,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.070
he was saying.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.240
This is explicitly
talking about people who

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.400
were consumed with lustfulness.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.050
And he just never
really considered

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.770
that it's possible that there
are same-sex relationships that

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.040
don't fit into that paradigm.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.940
JACK MCCLURE: Mhm.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.170
MATTHEW VINES: I know that
can sound very ignorant.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.120
I mean, in a sense,
because it is ignorant.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.220
But it's not
necessarily hateful.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.400
Like, a lot of people
assume that Christians

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.650
who are against same-sex
marriage must be,

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.860
like, terribly bigoted,
hateful people.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.600
And you can always
find some examples

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.970
of truly hateful people.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:06.803
JACK MCCLURE: Right.

00:31:06.803 --> 00:31:08.900
MATTHEW VINES: But in the
main, that's not true.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.090
It's like, my dad never had
any malice toward anyone.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.646
It doesn't mean
that he was right.

00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:15.020
It doesn't mean
that his position

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.120
was accurate or helpful.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.270
It's inaccurate and
does harm to people.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.345
But if you start with a posture
of anger toward the harm

00:31:25.345 --> 00:31:28.660
that people's beliefs do, then
you put them on the defensive.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.910
Because then they typically
feel like their characters

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.200
being maligned.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.220
And so, I find it
much more helpful

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.880
to start a posture
of relationship,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.120
of genuine affection or
respect for the person,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.920
especially if you know them.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.660
And respect for their
heart and their motives.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.270
But then, within
that context, really

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.170
earnestly asking them
to look more critically

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.720
at the consequences
of their beliefs.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.303
And say, even though
I know you're not

00:31:54.303 --> 00:31:56.790
coming from a place
of wanting to do harm,

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.530
these beliefs, they still have
this harmful impact on my life.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.260
And so, would you be willing
to look at this a bit

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.210
more closely with me?

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.070
I found that to be vastly more
effective than an approach

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.310
to just sort of
assumes that everybody

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.050
who's against gay
marriage is hateful.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:16.430
It's much more effective not to
try to ascribe a single motive

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.340
to a very wide group of people.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.950
But instead to meet
people on their own terms

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.320
in the context of
relationship and community.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.120
And then focus on the impact,
rather than the intention.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.255
So that's sort of a--

00:32:30.255 --> 00:32:31.130
JACK MCCLURE: Thanks.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.260
MATTHEW VINES: Yeah.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.530
JACK MCCLURE: Questions?

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.122
Yes?

00:32:34.122 --> 00:32:35.830
AUDIENCE: I was kind
of interested to see

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:40.740
what your experience in your
discussions with other people,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.170
those that you say that have
the Bible in high regard,

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.630
and in terms of the
discussions that you've

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.400
with them to kind of see
things in a different light.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.470
Because from my
experience, talking

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:59.540
with these so-called "Bible
thumpers," quote, unquote,

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.020
I think a lot of
passages and scriptures

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:09.680
are cherry picked to
formulate their belief system.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.000
And so, if you then provide
them with other passages that

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.370
aren't taken as seriously, like
polyester or so forth-- wearing

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.500
polyester-- then it's
like, oh that's pish posh.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.340
So I'm just kind of
curious to see what-- like,

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.480
what your experience
with talking

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.230
to other people about that.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.960
MATTHEW VINES: So I think
part of my experience,

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.280
part of what's
helped me, is I feel

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.920
like I have a pretty
strong understanding of why

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.280
those Christians
who disagree with me

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.880
believe what they believe.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.650
And that is rare,
in their experience.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.584
So I don't know if you've
seen-- you may have,

00:33:53.584 --> 00:33:55.250
I'm sure some people
here have-- there's

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.240
a famous clip from "The West
Wing," from probably 2007,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.070
where the president
on "The West Wing"

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.280
gets into this debate with this
conservative radio host about,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.340
you say that homosexuality
is an abomination.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.810
Then he goes and he lists
all these other things

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.535
from the "Old
Testament" about, oh,

00:34:10.535 --> 00:34:12.889
but do you sell your daughter
into slavery, et cetera.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.739
And there's, like, a mic drop
at the end-- not literally.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.190
And that clip has had
millions of views.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.690
And a lot of people
just assume, oh,

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.440
like, such a hypocrisy
for Christians

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.710
to wear polyester but to be
against same-sex relationships.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:32.620
But that's really not the
heart of the theological issue

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.480
for most Christians.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.710
So it is true that
the book of Leviticus

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:39.590
prohibits male, same-sex sex.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.840
And of course, it also
prohibits a ton of other things

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.520
that Christians
don't follow anymore.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.949
But that's not really
hypocrisy, because Christians

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.993
who are being more
informed about it

00:34:49.993 --> 00:34:51.659
are not going to
ground their opposition

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.000
to same-sex relationships
primarily in Leviticus

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.210
or in the "Old Testament."

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.800
Because the "New
Testament" talks

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.240
extensively about how Jesus
fulfilled the "Old Testament"

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.030
law.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.680
And Jesus says, not
one jot or tittle

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.140
will fall away from the law.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.510
But the way that the "New
Testament" authors interpret

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.140
that is in the context
of the "Old Testament"

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.490
law no longer
having force, longer

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.380
applying to God's people,
under the New Covenant,

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.160
in the same way that it did
to the ancient Israelites.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.500
So most Christians who are being
more thoughtful about it would

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.930
ground their opposition to
same-sex relationships in "New

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.220
Testament" texts that are
part of the New Covenant,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.910
or in sort of a
broader-- what they say

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.740
is a broader narrative
arc, within scripture,

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.810
from the Genesis
creation texts, then

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.950
through to how the
"New Testament,"

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.570
they believe, interprets
or uses those texts.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.420
So in that sense, yeah.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.680
Part of what I'm trying
to do is to persuade

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.080
conservative Christians to
rethink their interpretation.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.680
Another part of what
I'm trying to do

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.320
is to persuade more
progressive Christians

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.670
to make better arguments
when they're in conversations

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.080
with conservative Christians.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.980
And so, I don't think, if
your argument to somebody

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.350
is, why are you
against gay marriage

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.230
when you're not
against polyester?

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.680
I've seen that argument persuade
people about 0% of the time.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.410
Because it doesn't
demonstrate an awareness

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.390
of why they actually believe
what they believe, right.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.350
So you're kind of just
working around the edges.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.660
What's much more
interesting, though,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.800
is that same
principle-- it's not

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.340
say that there is no
inconsistency in how things are

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.339
being applied, but you
have to be really careful

00:36:30.339 --> 00:36:31.580
how you approach that.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:35.780
So, much more interesting
text than the polyester texts,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.830
or than any of the
prohibitions in Leviticus,

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:45.030
is from 1 Corinthians, Chapter
11, Versus 14 and 15, where

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.390
it specifically says, Do
you not know that nature

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.150
itself teaches that for
a man to have long hair

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.810
is a disgrace to him, but
for a woman to have long hair

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.800
is to her glory?

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.510
The reason why this
is so fascinating

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.880
is because the text
of Romans 1, which

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.420
is the longest "New
Testament" text,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.600
or longest biblical text
referring to same-sex behavior,

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.190
uses two of the very
same Greek words-- words

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.660
for nature and for disgrace.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:12.619
That's phusis and [? atomia. ?]
And in the Romans 1,

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:14.160
a lot of conservative
Christians want

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.460
to say that those words about
what goes against nature

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.570
refer to what they call
the "creational order."

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.300
Or something that
was established

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.720
at the very beginning in
Genesis 1 and 2 and, therefore,

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.630
something that is normative
for Christians today.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.066
But ask them how they
interpret 1 Corinthians 11,

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:33.690
and most Christians
today will tell you

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.740
that they think
nature in that text

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.530
refers to social
custom or convention.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.300
And that what makes
it disgraceful

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.450
has to do with what the given
cultural norms of the day are.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.570
And I happen to agree with
them in 1 Corinthians 11.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.630
The term "nature" has
a really wide range

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:53.320
of potential uses
in ancient Greek,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.980
and in a lot of contemporaneous
texts, extra-biblical texts,

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.696
and within the
biblical canon itself.

00:38:00.696 --> 00:38:02.320
What that means,
though, is, if they're

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.890
willing to read those very same
terms in the "New Testament"

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.850
in a way that is culturally
conditioned and confined,

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:12.560
then that's a much better
text to use for saying, well,

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.990
why didn't you read
Romans 1 the same way?

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.330
Because it's actually
operating within the world

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:19.610
that they're operating within.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:23.010
So it's much better to make
sure you know what they believe

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.790
their strongest arguments to be,
or their most important texts

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.340
to be going into it.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.780
And then focus on
texts and arguments

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.550
that are relevant
to those things.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.010
So that's part of
what's actually

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.680
made a lot of my conversations
really good and effective,

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.450
is because a lot of
evangelicals have never

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.460
been engaged on their own terms
in a really meaningful way

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.400
before, on this topic.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.450
And so, all that they've ever--
the only sort of paradigm

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.750
that they've had is
a combat paradigm

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.820
of, like, the secular
LGBT activists

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.740
versus the faithful
conservative Christians.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.660
And so, it's very easy,
then, to people-- for them

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.140
to just sort of stay entrenched
in their belief system.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.125
And say, look, our
whole belief system

00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:03.583
is under attack by
people who think

00:39:03.583 --> 00:39:07.580
that the whole idea of God
and religion is stupid.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.290
And so, that way
it's much more of a,

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.350
we're keeping our community,
we're keeping our identity

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.840
and our values
intact and preserved.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.690
But the conversation
shifts radically

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.170
when you actually have a
member of the community who

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.840
shares all those
core beliefs, who

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.990
cares about the community, who
has relationships with people

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.360
in the community, who
is simply asking people

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.900
to reconsider their
interpretation

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.770
of a select amount of texts.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.580
Not to reconsider the
importance of the Bible,

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.700
the importance of
God or their faith.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.450
That's just a very
different conversation.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.600
As you actually have the
privilege, as I've had,

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.680
of being able to take
the time to really do

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.270
your homework before you go
into those conversations,

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.790
a lot of people are just--
it's unprecedented for a lot

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:50.960
of people.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.200
And not for the
majority-- at least,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.860
not initially-- but
for a minority, those

00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.020
types of arguments can
change their minds.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.770
And all you need is a
minority, especially

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:01.978
within the evangelical world.

00:40:01.978 --> 00:40:04.310
But what does that
word mean, right?

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:07.550
It's about spreading
the good news.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.930
So evangelicals love to let
people know what they believe.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.750
And so, if you can change what
they believe about a topic,

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.894
it's awesome.

00:40:15.894 --> 00:40:17.560
Because then they're
going to let, like,

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.790
1,000 people know about
their new belief about it.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:25.690
So that's part of the-- Yeah
it's not easy, it's not fast.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.780
But it's definitely
possible and worthwhile.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.160
MATTHEW VINES: Great question.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.460
Thanks.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.270
AUDIENCE: I really
appreciate what

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:38.510
you're trying to do in engaging
conservative evangelicals.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.750
And it's really
encouraging to hear

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:46.210
a lesson, or more than
theologically superficial,

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.720
like Leviticus.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.450
And that's really great.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:54.140
In terms of furthering
the dialogue,

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.910
James White has offered to
debate with you several times.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:00.387
I was curious what the reasons
are that that hasn't happened?

00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:01.220
MATTHEW VINES: Yeah.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.050
So when I posted
my initial talk,

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.020
three years ago, there was
a Southern Baptist minister

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:13.170
in Phoenix who recorded
a four-hour rebuttal,

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.545
podcast rebuttal, to my talk.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.920
So here's what I would say.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.302
I When I'm thinking
about Christians

00:41:23.302 --> 00:41:24.760
who disagree with
me on this topic,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.106
they lie along a spectrum.

00:41:26.106 --> 00:41:27.730
Or rather, Christians
who don't vocally

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.160
agree with me on this topic,
they lie along a spectrum.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.570
You have a minority
of people who

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.830
are silent sympathizers, who may
not fully agree with me-- who

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.590
may, may not-- but
those are the people who

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.737
really, if you reach them
with these arguments,

00:41:39.737 --> 00:41:41.070
it's like you've liberated them.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:46.290
And they finally, like, feel
free to express their beliefs,

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.520
and they can become really
passionate advocates.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.910
Then there are a lot of
people in the middle-- I'd

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.890
say the majority of people in
the middle-- who passively hold

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.770
negative beliefs, what I would
call non-affirming beliefs,

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.010
about same-sex relationships.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.110
And who truly
believe those things,

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.920
but don't think about
it a ton, would never

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.503
write a letter to
the editor about it,

00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:06.880
would never call up a
radio show about it.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.570
That's where my dad was.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.620
Then you have a
substantial minority

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.180
of people who I
would say are deeply

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.189
entrenched and passionate
about their opposition.

00:42:16.189 --> 00:42:18.480
And those people tend to be
the most established people

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.580
in any given church
community, especially

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.290
the more conservative churches.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.470
They tend to make institutional
change very difficult,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.350
because they will
threaten to pull

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.050
their financial
giving from a church,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.770
if it shifts at
all on the topic.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.014
And so, what I'm trying
to do-- and they also

00:42:34.014 --> 00:42:35.680
give the impression,
to a lot of people,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.420
that everyone in the community
not only shares their belief,

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.050
but also shares that
passion with which

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.190
they hold their belief.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.189
Because no one else is
actually saying anything,

00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:46.020
so they kind of
have the megaphone.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.320
When I'm engaging
people in this topic,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.000
I am most interested in
engaging the people who

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.150
are the silent sympathizers
and the people in the middle.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.760
Because most people who are
in that place of entrenched

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:04.820
passion to opposition
cannot be reached right now.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.750
I try never to write
people often entirely,

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.850
but I do postpone people.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.850
And I will postpone
engagement with some people,

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.220
because the way that they think
and talk about these topics

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:22.610
is so unhelpful and so devoid
of any kind of relational care

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:26.080
or understanding, that
they're just not really worth

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:26.990
my energy.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.150
So James White, in
his talk, I mean,

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:34.980
he compared being gay to
wanting to have sex with dogs,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.840
and things that are so
absurd and so offensive.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.330
And he was so
passionate about it,

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.240
and saw no reason-- talked
about comparisons to pedophilia,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:51.420
and said that only 1% of gay
people actually want monogamy.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.272
I don't know where he
got that statistic.

00:43:54.272 --> 00:43:57.680
And I mean, it was a highly
vitriolic four hours.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.440
And honestly, that's
not worth my time.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.610
Because there are so many people
who are worth my time and who

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:05.370
are thoughtful and kind.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:08.860
And there are some people
who are truly vitriolic

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.010
and who are not kind,
are not compassionate.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.550
And my time is
worth so much more

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.640
than wasting it, going down
into a gutter with people

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.744
who want to compare me to people
who want to have sex with dogs.

00:44:22.744 --> 00:44:24.160
So that's the
reason why I haven't

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.130
engaged James White, because
he's not worth engaging.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.860
But there are many people
who are worth engaging.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.210
So Tim Keller is a pastor from
New York, a pretty well-known

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:38.930
pastor, evangelical pastor,
who I've learned a lot from.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.650
I think he's a great
writer and preacher.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.100
He just reviewed my
book a couple weeks ago.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.190
And I didn't really-- I mean,
it was a negative review,

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.160
which wasn't surprising,
because I know what

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.650
he thinks about this topic.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.480
But I really
appreciated that he did,

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.340
that he reviewed my book
with a tone of civility.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:04.030
He didn't say horrendous
things about gay people.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.010
And he was focusing on
my actual arguments,

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.940
and in a way that was a
lot more level-headed.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:15.211
So that allowed me-- I
wrote a response to it

00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:17.335
about things that I agreed
with and a lot of things

00:45:17.335 --> 00:45:19.585
that I didn't agree with,
and thought that he actually

00:45:19.585 --> 00:45:21.740
misrepresented in my book.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.955
But through that
process, that is

00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:27.370
what opens the door to
genuine conversation.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.000
It doesn't mean he's going to
agree with me anytime soon.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.150
But I want to focus on people
who are engaging thoughtfully.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:37.390
And there are enough of
them, I can spend all my time

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.100
doing that.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.820
AUDIENCE: My question
is specifically

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.000
referring to your arguments
using Matthew 7, verses 15

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.340
through 20 on false prophets
and good fruit versus bad fruit.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.510
I in particular find that
argument very compelling.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.552
Do you think that same
argument could also

00:45:53.552 --> 00:45:55.010
be used to, perhaps,
get the church

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:58.240
to reexamine its traditional
stances on things like woman's

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.130
rules in the church and
other social equality

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.170
issues for which there may be
other silent sympathizers--

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.810
such as gender roles--
seeing as how, traditionally,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.320
these teachings may have had a
bit more of a negative impact

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.150
on those members of the
congregation who would like

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.210
to voices those opinions?

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.760
And do you think
that can be done

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.300
in the way that presents a
theological framework that

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.220
is also, as you said,
persuasive to evangelicals?

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.000
MATTHEW VINES: That's
a good question.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:32.690
I think that that type
of experience argument

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.540
certainly played a key role
in Christians reevaluating

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.830
their beliefs about slavery.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.410
Because a lot of
Christians, today,

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.910
will try to say, oh,
slavery in the first century

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:47.210
Rome was so different than
slavery in 19 century America.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:48.540
And there are some differences.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.650
Slavery, 19 century
America was race-based.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:54.060
And it was not, in the same
way, in the first century.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.890
But slavery in the first
century Rome was brutal.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:58.790
I mean, this is not
like, a benign form

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:01.956
of actually voluntary
servitude for seven years,

00:47:01.956 --> 00:47:03.830
and then you get to go
on and live your life.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:04.830
That's not what it was.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.510
And there's ample
historical evidence

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.570
showing how horrific slavery in
the biblical era actually was.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.770
So while there are
some differences,

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.620
they're not really--
they don't really

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:19.650
get to the core of what we find
abhorrent about slavery, today.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:24.560
So it's not like what slavery
was changed in a radical way.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.980
But more Christians became
more empathetic to the cries

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.610
of the oppressed.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:35.120
And from a Christian
standpoint, that

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.560
looking at the narrative
arc of scripture,

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.460
so much of which does
focus on the liberation

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:45.820
of captives, freedom
for the oppressed,

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.390
the kind of radical
dignity that should

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:54.290
be bestowed upon every person
within a Judeo-Christian

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:55.000
worldview.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.750
Not just upon,
like, kings, right?

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:01.090
But that all people are created
equally in the image of God.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:03.970
That should have
these implications

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.140
for how we think
about and how much we

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.240
care about listening to
marginalized and oppressed

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.190
voices.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.470
Unfortunately, that's
not often been reflected

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:13.990
in the history of the Church.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.210
But when the
abolitionist movement

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.990
began to gain traction
in the Church,

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:24.580
especially in the 19
century, listening-- I mean,

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.280
that type of experience, people
pleading for other people

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.530
to simply look
others in the eyes

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.400
and really consider
their struggles,

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.040
was a big part of that.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.580
In terms of women's roles--
but at the same time,

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.100
it's never a
sufficient part of it.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.800
I think that there should
always-- I kind of am torn.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:47.020
Because on the one hand, I
think there should generally

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:51.990
be a bias in favor of
tradition, in the sense

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.581
that, from a
Christian standpoint,

00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:56.330
even though we know
that the tradition got

00:48:56.330 --> 00:49:00.180
a number of important things
wrong-- slavery, heliocentrism,

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.670
the subjugation of
women, anti-semitism--

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.170
the vast majority of things
that Christians recite, like,

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.530
every Sunday in
the creeds, those

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.820
are all part of the
Christian tradition.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.820
The core things that we believe
about Christian orthodoxy,

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.400
about the trinity, about God,
about Jesus, about Holy Spirit,

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.230
these are all
traditional beliefs.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.690
And the idea of, if you always
have a bias against tradition,

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:28.670
it's exhausting at one level
to be constantly throwing up

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.980
in the air all these things.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.260
But also, there can be a
presumptuousness to it,

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.790
there can be an arrogance to it.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:35.320
Not always.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.300
But there can be, just
assuming that there is not

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.160
great wisdom in-- not just
a generation before you--

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.770
but in generation, after
generation, after generation,

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.530
and all of the wisdom that can
be accumulated through that.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.780
However, at the
same time, I also

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.330
feel like there should be a
bias in favor of the oppressed.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:56.180
And those two things
do clash, right?

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.050
Because a bias in
favor of tradition that

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:04.160
has no qualifications is
also a bias in favor of well,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.850
straight, cisgender,
land-owning white men.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.050
Right?

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:12.280
And so, how do you
make that balance?

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.550
There's can be a
tendency, then, looking

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.050
at so much of the harm and
oppression it's caused, then,

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.520
to just swing against
tradition entirely.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.520
And while I'm sympathetic
to why people do that,

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:25.957
I think that can lead to, well--

00:50:25.957 --> 00:50:27.540
JACK MCCLURE: Another
set of problems.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.956
MATTHEW VINES:
Yeah, it just leads

00:50:28.956 --> 00:50:32.040
to an entirely
different set of issues

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.390
that I'm not really sure
are the key to liberation

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:35.792
for oppressed peoples.

00:50:35.792 --> 00:50:37.875
So it's kind of like holding
those things tension.

00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:39.440
So I would say, like,
I think they experience

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.610
paradigm matters a lot.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.020
But because I think that
tradition matters a lot,

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.280
because I think
that scripture has

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.010
to be-- because I think that
the authority of scripture

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:49.170
matters a lot.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:51.460
You kind of have to hold
those things in tension.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.250
So with something
like women's roles,

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.450
you can definitely make
the case from experience.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:57.450
I mean, this is what we
see in the book of Acts,

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:03.950
where they say, look, we know
that you don't think Gentiles

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:05.360
can be part of God's people.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.710
But we see the
fruit-- we see them.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:09.680
We see the fruit of
the spirit, right.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.690
And we see that they have
the spirit at work in them.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:18.770
Therefore, they can be part
of the Christian community.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.060
So that was a pretty
experienced-based argument.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.035
And so people, certainly, you
can make that type of argument

00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:25.200
about saying, look, we
see women who are serving

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.199
in leadership positions.

00:51:26.199 --> 00:51:30.290
We see all these gift that they
are offering to the church.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:33.190
We see their ministries
being blessed, or something.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.300
At the same time,
you want to buttress

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:36.790
that, you want to
supplement that

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.600
with making a scriptural
case, as well,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.290
for, here is where
we see movement

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:45.920
in scripture toward women
occupying more leadership

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.610
positions, or toward greater
equality in roles for men

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.900
women, those sorts of things.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.832
So I think it's
like a both, and.

00:51:53.832 --> 00:51:55.290
AUDIENCE: This is
a little bit more

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:57.104
of sort of a personal question.

00:51:57.104 --> 00:51:59.020
So you can decide how
personal you want to be.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.820
But for me, one
of the challenges

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.780
of being gay and
Christian, I spent

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.230
a lot of time kind
of reconciling

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.260
how I could be both.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.340
And I wish I had had
your book 10 years ago.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.219
But now, one of the
things that I actually

00:52:09.219 --> 00:52:10.760
shared with my pastor
a few weeks ago

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.090
was struggling with how to
be gay and Christian in 2015,

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.150
in San Francisco.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:18.140
And so, there's so many
cultural norms around sexuality,

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:18.970
for example.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.670
And it's sort of a gay
stereotype where you have sex,

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.340
and then you go
on the first date.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.410
And so, how do you think
about other teachings

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:30.000
around sexuality, around
how we express that.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.550
And how do you kind of live
a godly, Christian life

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.410
in the context of a culture
that is highly sexualized?

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:41.810
MATTHEW VINES: Yeah, that's
a really good question.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.510
I would say my
first answer to it

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.270
is, the way that I approach that
is that it's really sensitive.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:50.040
And so, I am always--
especially issues

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.630
around sex and
sexual ethics, when

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:56.550
you are talking about a
community of people that

00:52:56.550 --> 00:53:02.200
has been rejected by
the church, there just

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.250
has to be so much sensitivity
around that and a lot of grace

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.830
around that.

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:13.870
I think that really conservative
Christians, in particular,

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.710
if they want to say all same-sex
relationships are wrong,

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:20.380
and they want to offer no
support for LGBT people living

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.860
out hope for their
relational future--

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:27.530
a romantic future or
family-- then what

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.750
place do they really have to
criticize people who they think

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.440
aren't living in a sufficiently
chased way, or something.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.230
Because it's like, look,
you're offering people nothing.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:39.970
And then just going
to condemn them

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:43.820
when they're just trying to
find their own way in the world.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.030
So I'm very sympathetic to that.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.850
At the same time,
I think that that's

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.480
a totally non-ideal situation.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.040
Ideally, you shouldn't
have millions

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:57.750
of gay kids being rejected by
their Christian families, all

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.130
of the world, in
the name of Jesus.

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:03.100
And then made two loath
themselves and loath

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.552
their sexuality, and
then seek to swing

00:54:05.552 --> 00:54:07.010
the pendulum in
the other direction

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.387
by totally embracing
every potential aspect

00:54:09.387 --> 00:54:11.470
of your sexuality you could
conceive of for, like,

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.490
five years and then
getting tired of it.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.480
And then swinging it back
to the middle, right.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.320
That's not really ideal.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.580
So what I'm trying
to do is twofold.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.110
One is the pastoral
lens, which is

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:23.060
about how much grace and
sensitivity you have to have.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.140
And you just can't
preach at people.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:27.045
You have to listen.

00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:28.420
You have to build
a relationship.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.660
You have to be willing to
learn and grow from people.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.190
But that's the pastoral lens.

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:36.450
Then there's also this kind of
theological or doctrinal lens,

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:38.510
which is the
question of, ideally,

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:40.480
what should the
church be teaching?

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.760
And even though there has to be
a whole lot of space and grace

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.660
in the midst of recovering
from, really, the church's

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:52.900
sins against the
LGBT community, what

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.730
would be the theological ideal?

00:54:55.730 --> 00:55:00.110
And so, the ideal that I
present-- and so, basically, I

00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.460
grew up being taught
that sex is for marriage.

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.580
And I never really had
an issue with that.

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:09.774
So from when I-- when I learned
about sex-- however old I was.

00:55:09.774 --> 00:55:10.690
I don't even remember.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:11.800
I was just, like, all right.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.633
That's something I'll
do when I get married.

00:55:13.633 --> 00:55:16.272
It's going to be great, and
never really thought about it.

00:55:16.272 --> 00:55:17.980
I mean, not that I
didn't think about it.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.060
I'm saying I never
thought about-- that

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.120
was never a source of
stress for me, or anything.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.640
That was something
I wanted to do.

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.279
And it was just a part
of who I wanted to be

00:55:27.279 --> 00:55:28.320
and how I wanted to live.

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.430
And so, when I realized that I
was gay, I was just like, well,

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:35.357
I don't really want to
radically change who I am.

00:55:35.357 --> 00:55:36.940
I don't think being
gay should require

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.282
you to overturn value systems
that are important to you.

00:55:41.282 --> 00:55:42.740
And so, I was like,
well, honestly,

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.870
I just want to live
in the same way

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.530
that I would if I
hadn't been gay.

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:50.310
Is there the same
support for it?

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:51.940
Not really.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.170
But that's what
I'm always seeking

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.840
to live into-- oftentimes
in Christian theology,

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.130
there's this conversation around
the already and the not yet,

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:02.100
right, around eschatology.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.970
And that's like the
end times theology.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.130
But also just the
question of, we're

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.230
living into this
new creation that's

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:12.660
been inaugurated by Jesus
in which all things will

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.820
be redeemed, and all
things will be made new.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.940
But we're not there yet.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.110
And so there's that tension.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:19.810
But I think we need
some people who

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:23.200
are seeking to live
into the not-yet,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.810
or seeking to live
into-- seeking

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:29.650
to bring more of the
not-yet into the already.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:32.920
In the sense of,
if I want churches

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.940
to be creating the
support system for people

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.755
like me to be able to pursue
a relationship in a family

00:56:39.755 --> 00:56:43.060
in the same way that we thought
we could back when we didn't

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:45.800
realize we were gay,
then we're going

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:50.000
to need some people who are
just living into-- living

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.040
in the anticipation of that.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.780
And so, that's why that is
still how I want to live.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.020
And I think that there are
good theological reasons

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:02.340
for that being and ideal that
I sort of discuss in the book.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.980
And I hope that by--
and I know there

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.072
are a number of gay Christians
who feel the same way.

00:57:09.072 --> 00:57:11.530
But there are plenty of people
who don't feel the same way.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:13.104
And other gay
Christians-- or maybe

00:57:13.104 --> 00:57:15.270
did feel the same, feel
it's practically impossible,

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.210
or something.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.790
And so, that's why
people-- I just

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.730
feel like there's been enough
of a kind of shame-based culture

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.840
around these topics that I'm
much more interested in saying,

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.960
look-- especially for people
who are LGBT Christians.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.820
I think people
should do their best.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.090
Strive to do your best.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:35.590
Do the best that you can.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:40.740
And that's going to look
different for different people.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.490
Our goal is to be
modeling and showing,

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:47.899
like, this is what really
positive, meaningful

00:57:47.899 --> 00:57:49.440
same-sex relationships
can look like.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.559
And so, I want people
to do their best

00:57:51.559 --> 00:57:52.600
to seek to live that out.

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.916
But sometimes people's
relationships will fail,

00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:56.790
or they're going to
really bad relationships.

00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:59.800
And there's no need for people
to feel like overwhelming shame

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.400
about that.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.875
I just think it is helpful when
we have some gay Christians who

00:58:05.875 --> 00:58:08.807
have enough support, or
are just able to live more

00:58:08.807 --> 00:58:09.890
into anticipation of that.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:11.431
To be able to model
for people, like,

00:58:11.431 --> 00:58:13.190
this is what an option could be.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:17.160
And then to be able to present
that model in a much more non

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.240
in-your-face, non
you-must-do-this or we're going

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.930
to bang a hammer
over your head way.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:26.954
But I would have just loved to
have seen actual role models

00:58:26.954 --> 00:58:28.120
doing that, when I came out.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.620
To say, I knew
that's what I wanted,

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.100
but I couldn't find anybody
who's doing that, right.

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:36.690
And so, it's still
kind of a tiny niche.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:39.870
But that's at least how
I'm seeking to approach it.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:41.440
But I also think
that there has to be

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:46.770
a lot of grace in
light of how much harm

00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:51.527
the church has directly
done on these very topics.

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:53.110
AUDIENCE: Have you
had much experience

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.780
talking with Christians who are
not evangelicals, or perhaps

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.030
from traditions that are
far away from your own?

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:01.055
Maybe Christians from
the orthodox tradition

00:59:01.055 --> 00:59:03.390
or far afield from your own?

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:05.780
And is there any difference
in the sorts of conversations

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:07.167
you have with them?

00:59:07.167 --> 00:59:09.000
MATTHEW VINES: There
is a lot of difference.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.940
And so, most of the
conversations I have

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:15.290
will kind of be
in my wheelhouse.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:20.450
Theologically, I try not to
overstep my bounds, too much.

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:25.000
So I'm much more interested
in a meeting-- for instance,

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.080
when it comes to Catholics, I'm
much more interested in meeting

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.080
other LGBT Catholics
who are interested in

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.610
and who care about
reforming their church,

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:39.144
and helping equip them with--
I mean, the scriptures are not

00:59:39.144 --> 00:59:41.310
identical, of course, for
Catholics and Protestants.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:43.440
But on this issue,
the scriptural issues

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.420
are pretty much the same.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.880
Of course, Catholics
have additional layers

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:53.190
of theological discourse
around all issues.

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:54.950
So there are important
areas of overlap.

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.991
So I'm interested in
building those relationships

00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:59.410
and helping to equip
people in those contexts

00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:02.137
with a lot of the scriptural
resources that they need.

01:00:02.137 --> 01:00:03.720
But then, they're
really going to have

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.320
to be the ones who take that
and run with it-- in terms

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.870
of tailoring it to their
specific environment

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.710
and denomination or theological
context, adding to it,

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.770
refining it, adapting it.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:18.950
So I am rarely going
to be the person

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.800
having-- in terms of a lot of
the conversations that I have,

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.680
it's mostly going to be with
Protestant evangelical pastors

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.810
and leaders.

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:32.260
And once you get
to other contexts--

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:36.540
I don't want to be trying
to represent people

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.920
when I know that there
are other people who

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.350
know a lot more about their
particular context than I do.

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:43.320
So that's why I want to be just
building those relationships,

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.740
seeking to equip and empower
to the extent that I can,

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.430
to the extent that
it makes sense.

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:51.920
But then, letting LGBT
Catholics or LGBT Orthodox

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.864
Christians really take
the initiative on that.

01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:57.530
And so, then, the
last thing I would say

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:01.460
is, that is a lot of what we do
with the Reformation Project,

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.380
is bringing people from a
wide variety of backgrounds,

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:09.440
equip them with these scriptural
resources and arguments.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.030
But then allow that
and seek to help them

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.349
and empower them, as
they are the best people

01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:15.515
in their particular context.

01:01:15.515 --> 01:01:17.390
So we're doing a conference.

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.660
Our next big conference is
in Kansas City, November 5

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:20.243
through the 7.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.880
And we're doing one in
LA, actually, next year.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.630
So if you're interested,
you can follow us

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.882
on Facebook or Twitter.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.340
You can sign up
for the conferences

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.005
at reformationproject.org.

01:01:29.005 --> 01:01:31.320
Or if you can't go but you
know family or friends you

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.480
think would benefit from
it, you should send them.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.310
Because it's really
sort of a great melting

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:39.180
pot of traditions.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.860
And even though
the dominant group

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.740
there would still probably
be evangelical Protestants.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.198
Of course, we have Catholics
and Orthodox Christians there,

01:01:45.198 --> 01:01:48.980
as well, who can really enrich
our understandings, too.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.900
JACK MCCLURE: Thanks
for that question.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.240
Thank you for being
with us today.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.590
I really appreciate the
integrity of the bring

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:58.850
to the conversation, because
you're open to other ideas,

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.675
instead of being here to kind
of forcing anything on anybody.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:04.050
I appreciate that,
and especially

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.040
from a perspective that's a
little different, in terms

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.750
of our trying to understand.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:11.340
But I think every
congregation, everybody

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.420
is really coming together
in real interesting ways.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:16.136
At least we're
having a discussion.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:18.260
And I appreciate that you
want a discussion and not

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.405
an argument or a
fisticuffs, you know.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.280
MATTHEW VINES: Right.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.280
JACK MCCLURE: Thanks very
much for bringing that

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.250
to the conversation.

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:27.230
And with you, I am appreciative.

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:28.420
Aren't you, as well?

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.420
So, thank you.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:29.920
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.070
MATTHEW VINES: Well,
thank you so much.
