00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Before we get into the reasons why his work is so important--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's take a minute to try to put ourselves in Newton's shoes

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and imagine what his life was like.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, here we are, leaning against an apple tree reading one of our favorite books,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and all around us things are happening.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Apples are falling off trees. Rocks are rolling down mountains.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And as nature unfolds around it, we probably never really stop to ask what's happening.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We just take it for granted.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we want to think about something profound, maybe we look at the moon or the stars or the sun.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Surely, the motions of these perfect celestial bodies are somehow more perfect

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or different than the motions of commonplace items like apples and rocks.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I'm going to ask you a question.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What do the motions of stars and apples have in common?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Do they have nothing in common at all? Are they totally distinct and separate?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Or are these motions completely identical?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Or are they somehow different but governed by the same set of laws?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Which means that the same rules which affect how an apple falls to the ground

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
also affect how the earth orbits the sun or the moon orbits the earth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I haven't taught you this yet, so I don't expect you to know the answer,

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but I do want to get you thinking. Choose what you think is the best answer.
