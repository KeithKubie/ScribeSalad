00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.900
Cultural mining describes the process by which the most valuable parts of culture

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.760
by which we understand the arts, humanities and philosophy

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.500
are recovered and made useful for our own times.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.260
In cultural mining the pratical sides of culture

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.180
are carefully extracted, cleaned, blasted and remolded

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.860
and then used to manufacture the mental tools that we need to navigate contemporary life.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.480
It's been a historic problem that hugely valuable cultural insights

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.100
have often been lodged within highly unappealing material far below ground.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.180
It's been dark and cramped in the corridors of culture

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.940
and hardly anyone other than certain accredited experts

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.080
have been tempted to visit.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.500
The material has been like metal: in all, entirely impractical in its raw state.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
For culture to be useful to us

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.940
it needs to go through a process of refinement:

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.400
you have to separate cultural insight from a lot of surronding material.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.940
Like in gold mining, only a very small portion of what had originally been dug out

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.180
will ever be usable to make the finished precious item that our society needs:

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.380
good ideas.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.120
it's around this process of refinement that  the big difference between the school of life and standard universities becomes apparent.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.940
We're very grateful to these universities for digging the mine shards and keeping open the tunnels,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.120
but we have a different project.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.180
We're interested in the extraction and utilisation of the material on the surface

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.860
rather than its preservation and interpretation below ground.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.860
The idea of cultural mining is new and still feels a little weird,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.900
but it has a critical role to play in our world,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.300
because at present lots of people don't, sadly, believe that culture has anything much to offer them.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300
This isn't heir fault of course:

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.760
when you look at the raw material form in which culture is generally laid out before us

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.440
no wonder most people don't bother, but that's a huge pity.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.320
We've started doing the mining deep in the cultural ground

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.940
to help us meet the multiple confusions and anxieties of our own times.
