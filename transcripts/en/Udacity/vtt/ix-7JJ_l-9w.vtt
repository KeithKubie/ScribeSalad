00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To see, let's make an extreme example of an institute that only asked one person.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, it's kind of chance. A is a bit more likely than B.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They will be forced to say that all voters will either vote A or all voters would vote B,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
depending on the outcome of this one question.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this case because they encountered someone saying A,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the probability for anybody else voting A will be 1.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Would you trust this company that only asked one person? Of course not.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The more data that's sampled, assuming that the sample is fair and independent, the more trust you have,

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and more trust means a smaller confidence interval.
