00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:01.629
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.183
Today we're gonna talk
about a class of auxiliary,

00:00:04.183 --> 00:00:07.271
or helper verbs, called the modal verbs.

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:09.268
These are verbs that
have special properties

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:10.801
and help other verbs.

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.191
But what is modality?

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.377
My fellow grammarian,
I am so glad you asked.

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:18.790
Modality is when we use
these verbs to express

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.813
conditions on stuff.

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:22.555
So we can use these verbs
to determine if something

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.084
is likely to happen, or
certain to have happened.

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:27.593
Whether or not something is possible,

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:30.937
or whether or not we have
the ability to do something.

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:34.025
Whether or not we have the
permission to do something.

00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:35.464
And whether or not we have the obligation

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:39.226
or requirement or need to do something.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:41.989
You already know all of
these verbs, I promise you.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.102
You just didn't know this name for them.

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:45.565
Let's meet the modals.

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:47.097
Roll call, here we go.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:51.323
May, might, must, can,

00:00:51.323 --> 00:00:54.514
could, shall, should,

00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:57.341
will, would.

00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.535
Those are the modals.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:00.579
So here's what modal verbs can do.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.783
Thing number one, they
agree with everything.

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:05.896
So you can take any one of these modals

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:08.798
and you can use any subject in the world

00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:11.375
and it's not gonna change, right?

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.279
You take a word like talk, for instance,

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:14.394
and you would say I talk,

00:01:14.394 --> 00:01:18.504
Diane talks.

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:19.279
Right, you add the s.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.205
But any subject in any
sentence is going to take

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:23.923
the modal verb the same way.

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:25.246
Let me show you.

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:26.709
I can do it, you can do it,

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.288
she can do it, they can do it,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.681
we can do it.

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:30.912
It's all the same.

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:33.690
They agree with everything.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.406
Something else that modals
do is actually something

00:01:39.406 --> 00:01:40.822
that they don't do.

00:01:40.822 --> 00:01:42.773
They don't have a to form,

00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.421
this is what we call the infinitive.

00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:48.043
So there's no such thing as to may,

00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:49.599
or to could.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.481
That just doesn't exist.

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.452
So modals don't have infinitives.

00:01:54.452 --> 00:01:56.983
You can't say I want to should.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.815
That is an illegal operation in English.

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.510
It is ungrammatical.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.414
It doesn't matter what
version of English you speak,

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:08.026
across all varieties of
English you cannot to should.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.649
And finally, a thing
that modal verbs can do

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.693
is indicate modality.

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:15.177
Which, like we said,
establishes conditions.

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.638
So let's take a look at some examples.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.007
So the word must, right?

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.893
We can use the word must
in a couple different ways.

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:28.583
So, if you imagine a
detective looking up from some

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.021
tracks, some muddy
bootprints on the floor,

00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.554
with her magnifying glass.

00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:36.687
She looks up and she says
"He must have gone that way!"

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:40.913
That detective is using must
to express a likelihood,

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:41.981
a high likelihood.

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:43.908
This must have happened.

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:45.765
But if you're at an amusement park

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.435
and the roller coaster you
want to ride has a height

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.595
requirement, the sign probably says

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:54.403
"You must be this tall to
ride the Doom-Coaster."

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:57.421
This is like a necessary condition.

00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.115
By a similar token, if
you enter someone's house

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:02.158
and they demand that
you take off your shoes,

00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:05.928
they would say "You
must remove your shoes."

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:10.786
Similarly with may, we
can use may to express

00:03:10.786 --> 00:03:14.199
a possibility, like saying "It may rain."

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.475
That's something that
could possibly happen.

00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:18.263
Or to give someone permission, like

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.874
"You may enter."

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:26.872
You can use a word like
can to express ability.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:30.215
You could say "I can eat
ten pounds of broccoli!"

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.280
And that's expressing your
ability to do a thing.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.324
We also use modal verbs
like this to talk about

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:37.947
conditions, or stuff that
isn't going to happen

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:39.758
or maybe could happen.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:42.591
And so, for example, in
this sentence, we would say

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:46.347
"I would make the bed, but I'm tired."

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:50.509
Because the possibility
exists, however remote,

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.063
that the bed would be made by me,

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:56.523
but I don't feel like it.

00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:58.844
So I'm using would to offer an excuse,

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:01.491
I'm saying this could possibly
happen, this would happen,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.999
except for this one other problem,

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.344
which is that I'm sleepy.

00:04:06.344 --> 00:04:08.504
You can also use modal
verbs to give advice

00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:12.010
to someone, as in "You shouldn't do that."

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.675
And something that is special to will,

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.834
and, to a lesser extent, shall,

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.388
is that they can form the future.

00:04:19.388 --> 00:04:21.431
Shall used to be a lot more popular,

00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.637
and it still is in British
English, but less so

00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:25.588
in standard American.

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:28.211
So would say "He will
win the competition."

00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.253
Or "He shall win the competition."

00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:33.784
And use of this modal verb will, or shall,

00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:35.920
indicates that that thing
that you're talking about

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.706
is happening in the future.

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:40.424
These verbs are very powerful.

00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:42.653
You should learn how to use them

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:46.090
and in fact if you can
complete the exercises,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.503
then you will master these tricky verbs.

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:50.803
You can learn anything.

00:04:50.803 --> 00:04:52.052
David out.
