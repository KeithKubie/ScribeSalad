00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.430
In the following polynomial,
identify the terms along

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.640
with the coefficient and
exponent of each term.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.590
So the terms are just
the things being added up

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.470
in this polynomial.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.180
So the terms here-- let
me write the terms here.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.760
The first term is 3x squared.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.290
The second term it's being
added to negative 8x.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.490
You might say, hey
wait, isn't it minus 8x?

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.989
And you could just
view that as it's

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.470
being added to negative 8x.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.940
So negative 8x is
the second term.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.410
And then the third
term here is 7.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.050
It's called a polynomial.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.460
Poly, it has many terms.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.610
Or you could view each
term as a monomial,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.390
as a polynomial with
only one term in it.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.007
So those are the terms.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.590
Now let's think about
the coefficients

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.830
of each of the terms.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.720
The coefficient is what's
multiplying the power of x

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.960
or what's multiplying in
the x part of the term.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.900
So over here, the x
part is x squared.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.815
That's being multiplied by 3.

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:05.180
So 3 is the coefficient
on the first term.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.460
On the second term, we have
negative 8 multiplying x.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.710
And we want to be clear, the
coefficient isn't just 8.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.490
It's a negative 8.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.600
It's negative 8
that's multiplying x.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.700
So that's the coefficient
right over here.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.270
And here you might
say, hey wait,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.580
nothing is multiplying x here.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.430
I just have a 7.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.540
There is no x.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.460
7 isn't being multiplied by x.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.560
But you can think of this as 7
being multiplied by x to the 0

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.310
because we know that x to the
zeroth power is equal to 1.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.890
So we would even call
this constant, the 7,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
this would be the
coefficient on 7x to the 0.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.660
So you could view
this as a coefficient.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.105
So this is also a coefficient.

00:01:49.105 --> 00:01:53.393
So let me make it clear, these
three things are coefficients.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.030
Now the last part, they
want us to identify

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.420
the exponent of each term.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.180
So the exponent of
this first term is 2.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.120
It's being raised
to the second power.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.160
The exponent of the second
term, remember, negative 8x, x

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.810
is the same thing as
x to the first power.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.920
So the exponent here is 1.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.520
And then on this last
term, we already said,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.230
7 is the same thing
as 7x to the 0.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.560
So the exponent here on the
constant term on 7 is 0.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.780
So these things right over
here, those are our exponents.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.190
And we are done.
