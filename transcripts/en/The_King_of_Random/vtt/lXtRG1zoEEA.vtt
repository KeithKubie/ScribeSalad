00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.200
(Playing with some tissues)

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.509
I Did it! Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop. Today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.970
We're gonna be building a weapon that is quick, fun, easy,

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.509
and safe to use indoors. The supplies for this are super easy,

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.220
And there's a good chance you already have them lying around your house somewhere.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.040
Weâ€™ll need two toilet paper rolls a pencil two rubber bands and some large marshmallows

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:32.000
We also have some tape and we're gonna use some of that for the build and some of it for decoration

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.200
Let's get started the first step is to take one of our cardboard tubes and with a pair of scissors

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.520
Cut it lengthwise now what we want to do is roll the tube a little bit tighter over on itself

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.480
We want to make the tubes small enough that a marshmallow can no longer fit down inside now with a piece of tape

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.910
Let's close our cardboard tube all along the seam

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.609
Our tube is now closed and taped shut

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.719
But it often tries to sort of pull away from the tape so to try and keep that from happening

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.868
Let's also take a little bit of tape on just the ends and tape that on the inside that should hold it together more securely

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.680
With the tube all taped up we now want to put two holes into the sides of it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.749
Just large enough that we can fit the pencil through you can use a hole punch a drill or a knife to make those holes

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.880
There's our first now. Let's make the second hole directly across from that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.340
Now we want to fit our pencil through one side of the hole and out the other however

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.420
We have kind of a bit more pencil than we need right here, so let's just trim this down

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
I'm gonna try and make it about

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080
That long so that's going to be about cutting it in half

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139
I'm kidding you don't need a chop saw to cut a pencil

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.169
Let's see how well we can get her a pencil with this pair of pliers

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.529
That was pretty easy let's see if we can use our exacto knife

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.990
I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.600
Don't think I'm gonna be able to slice all the way through but I bet I can score the wood pretty well by rolling it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
And then just snap it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.510
That worked great see if we can get anywhere with scissors

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
Ha even scissors works

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.339
So there you go you do not have to use a chop saw to cut your pencil in half

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.790
We're gonna use this one. Just because all right so now

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.559
Let's get the pencil to fit through both sides of the hole so it's attached to our cardboard tube

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.179
There we go our pencils nice and secure

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.419
We now want to take our second tube and cut two notches into the top of it before we do that though

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.929
Let's run a layer of tape around there to give it a little bit of extra strength

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.270
I'm just gonna make two slits not even a centimeter long

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.550
About one centimeter apart just like that and they're gonna be on opposite sides of the tube

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.489
So we've got two little slits on this side now. Let's go to the opposite side and put two slits there as well now

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.809
Now we take our larger tube and place it over the top of our smaller tube

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.060
And then we'll need two rubber bands of the same size we want to fit our rubber bands around the notches

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
We just cut in the top of the tube

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.919
Now let's stretch our rubber bands down underneath the pencil and at this point we have a working marshmallow shooter

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.500
Load up our little confectionery treat drawback and fire

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.900
There is the very basic version of this marshmallow shooter. It works fairly well

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.600
It launches the marshmallows quite nicely. It's easy to carry around

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.019
It's easy to make it's very lightweight a lot of good things about it

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.389
But I think there are still a few improvements that can be made

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.309
To me the hardest part of this design is that it's kind of tricky to get a good grip on it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.580
I guess you can try and use two fingers to pull back on the pencil

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.069
But if you have smaller hands that can be harder

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.179
And it's just a little awkward because you'll probably end up pulling you on one side more than the other

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.039
So I want to use some tape to make a tab that lets us pull straight back from the middle of the pencil

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.139
Let's start by taking the rubber bands off for just a second now. Let's tear off a strip of tape

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.459
That's a few inches long

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.929
but narrow enough that it can fit inside the smaller tube took my gloves off because

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.389
Anything with tape while you're wearing gloves is a pain

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.139
So let's take about an inch of this tape and feed it down into the tube and then

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Secure it to the side of the pencil

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.070
now we can rotate the pencil and it should bring the side of our tape back up we can now pull it through and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.740
stick the two sides together

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.579
Alright now we can reassemble our shooter and

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.709
We have a much more convenient pull tab to draw back on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.750
(Wee) I wonder if I can get a shot where it hits the lens

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.199
Cameraman is taking all kinds of abuse right now

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.589
I'll count that that marshmallow shooter works pretty well and our upgrade of the pull handle

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.910
I think makes a big difference

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.880
But I still want to try upgrading one more time and that's to a larger size so instead of using toilet paper tubes

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.399
Paper towel tubes. These are a lot longer

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.780
We've got some longer rubber bands, and I'm hoping we can get more of a long distance shooter

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.559
But the process will be just the same, so we'll start by cutting one of these tubes lengthwise

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.029
We attach the rubber bands to the notches of the top, and then we stretch them down over the pencil below

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.199
Now we have a marshmallow shooter with a lot longer draw

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.919
Let's do the same process we did before to add the little pull tab on the back and then decorate this a little bit

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.179
Just to make this pull-tab a little bit easier to hold on to let's cut off a small piece of pencil and then wrap tape

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.850
Around it that should give us something that we can grip more easily

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.090
There we go

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.290
Look like a sniper

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.779
One on one shot two on the next shot. I don't think I can take the top three nope

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.309
With your marshmallow launchers built it's time to have fun set up some targets knock over some cups shoot your friends. It's just marshmallows

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.250
They're not really gonna hurt much

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.429
This is a quick and easy build and like I said before there's a good chance you already have all the materials at your house

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.220
Already if not they're cheap and easy to get your hands on

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.549
