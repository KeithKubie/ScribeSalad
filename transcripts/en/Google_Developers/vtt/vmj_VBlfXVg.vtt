LACY CARUTHERS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.280
Welcome to the Women Techmakers
Give Back series,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.340
episode two.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880
Today we're excited to have
Jennifer Pahlka here with us

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.870
in studio, the founder
and executive

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.980
director of Code for America.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.680
And before we turn it over to
Jen, let me quickly introduce

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.850
myself and my host, Chris.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.090
I'm Lacy Caruthers.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.770
I'm on the Google Giving team.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970
And our focus is on identifying
and supporting

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.260
innovative nonprofits that
are using technology

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.850
to change the world.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.810
And I've been at Google for
about six years, working

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.510
across a variety of our energy
and sustainability, as well as

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.760
our giving efforts.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.820
And I'm joined today by Chris
DiBona, my co-host.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.460
CHRIS DIBONA: Hi, I'm Chris.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.950
I look after open source for the
company, and I've helped

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.640
out the Giving Team
now and then over

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.620
last couple of years.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.230
I started at Google in 2004,
which I guess we're telling

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.670
people, and I'm just
happy to be here.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.530
I've known Jen since Gov
2.0, but we'll talk

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.250
about that, I'm sure.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.360
LACY CARUTHERS: Great, so now
we'll turn it over to Jen to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.630
introduce yourself.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.630
JEN PAHLKA: I'm so glad to be
here, thank you guys so much.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.863
I always love coming
down to Google.

00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:37.440
I've been looking forward
to this all week.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.650
So I founded this organization
called Code for America.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.880
And we call ourselves a
Peace Corps for geeks.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.940
I have a background, as Chris
alluded to, in tech media.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.830
And it was through this Gov 2.0
work, where I originally

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.820
met Chris, that I became
inspired by the notion that

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.510
geeks can really do something to
fix our country right now.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.040
There's a really high need
for it, and we're at this

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.420
interesting moment where there's
a real opportunity to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.420
do something.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.850
A lot of conditions
that have been

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.190
holding us back are changing.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.110
And so I created
this program--

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.360
well, we actually do a number
of things now-- but the main

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.020
thing that we do is a
servicier program.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.010
And so we get very talented
developers and designers--

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940
in fact one in our just
past year is from

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.480
Google, Michelle Lee--

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.750
to take a year off.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.190
And what they do is they work
very closely with city

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.870
governments around
the country.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.680
And they're building apps,
they're showing them lean

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.630
startup processes, they're
showing them modern tools, but

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.920
what they're really doing is
solving problems for cities

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.020
and showing how things can be
done, showing what's possible

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.210
with modern technology.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.460
And all sorts of amazing things
happen when you really

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.155
deeply engage with people who
are living in a little bit of

00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:55.980
a different technological
world right now.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.730
Giving them the exposure to how
a startup would solve a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.230
problem, how the tech industry
would solve a problem, and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.350
letting them understand that
they can do that themselves.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.790
So we have just had a fantastic
time in our first

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.910
couple of years trying out this
model and seeing what

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.220
happens when you put geeks
together with government.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.030
LACY CARUTHERS: So tell us about
some of the projects

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.800
that your fellows
have worked on.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.930
JEN PAHLKA: So this
year we actually

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.030
worked with eight cities.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.660
It's our second year,
I should say.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.733
We started out at our first
year, 2011, we worked with

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:31.380
three cities and pretty quickly
scaled up to eight.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.530
I'll talk about one example--
and I think we can pull it up

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.840
there, if you want to go to
the Blight Status app.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.610
We were asked to come
to New Orleans.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.290
We sent a team of four
fellows there.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.050
And the problem there, which is
not surprising to a lot of

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.000
people, that they wanted us
to work on is blight.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.820
Blight's actually a problem
around the country.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.430
It's not just Hurricane
Katrina.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.340
That's what most people
think of.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.490
But as our populations change in
cities where there had been

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.210
manufacturing and people have
left, you have a real issue.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.610
It affects the economic
development.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.470
It affects the quality of life
for people in neighborhoods.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.370
So the mayor of New Orleans had
asked the CIO there, why

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.300
can't I just pull up on my
laptop, or my device when I'm

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.630
walking around the city, what's
going on with these

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.149
properties that are obviously
blighted?

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.959
We don't know if they've been
inspected, if they've been

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.160
reported, if there's
been a hearing.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.240
And there wasn't a way to get
that data available to people.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.720
Now, there are huge numbers
of people in

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.180
New Orleans who spend--

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.100
really, you would be shocked--
enormous amounts of time

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.050
tracking these things, and
going after City Hall and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.150
saying, what's going on here?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.620
But there was no unified
view of the data

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.330
around these things.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.650
And so the CIO said to the
mayor, well, it's going to

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.830
take us three years and probably
millions of dollars

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.190
to upgrade all of our systems in
order to be able to have a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.180
view of that data.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.310
CHRIS DIBONA: Or tens of
millions of dollars.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.600
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, he
didn't say number.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.070
But if you're talking about
three years of government

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.670
development, it's pretty
expensive.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.820
It tends to be a lot
more expensive

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.080
in the public sector.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.350
So we had this wonderful woman,
Denise Ross, who said,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.560
you know what, let's see if the
Code for America Fellows

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.540
can do something about this.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.420
So they applied to the program
the previous year, and we sent

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.780
fellows down there this
recent February.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.990
They did about 100 interviews
in one month down there, and

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.190
not just people in City Hall.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.520
They're talking to these
activists in the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.280
neighborhoods, they're talking
to librarians,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.580
they're talking to cops.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.030
They really get an amazing view
from all perspectives of

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.060
the problem.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.950
They came back to San Francisco,
and in six weeks

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.220
they had an early version of
what you're seeing here, this

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.680
Blight Status.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.940
They got all the data.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.120
It wasn't that hard for them.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.890
The hardest part was actually
getting the data.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.430
They unified it.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.510
You can now type in any address
in New Orleans, and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.405
you get back whether it's been
reported, inspected, if

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:48.420
there's been a hearing, if it's
scheduled for demolition,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.720
and if so, when.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.780
And that doesn't seem like the
most difficult project in the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.660
world, but convincing the people
in City Hall to give

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.180
you the data is difficult.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.030
Normalizing all this data
that's in ridiculously

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.850
different formats.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.170
Some of them were spreadsheets,
some of them are

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.735
ledgers, some of them were
government databases that they

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.552
had been using.

00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:14.800
But it was a lot of work that's
not all technical work,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.140
but the impact was enormous.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.560
When they rolled this out in
New Orleans, they told the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.510
fellows, you have fundamentally
changed the

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.210
conversation in New
Orleans right now.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.560
We've gone from this defensive
City Hall and angry citizens

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.140
to two groups that are now
working together towards a

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.300
common goal.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.140
And it's just been amazing.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.370
And the CIO was very happy.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.970
He stood up onstage at our
summit, and he said, I'm so

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.130
glad I was wrong about this.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.690
Yes, they still need to upgrade
their systems, but

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.930
that's not an excuse not to
provide accurate data to

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.680
citizens, and to provide it.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.770
And I think what's unique about
this when you look at

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.080
these interfaces is that most
government software doesn't

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.490
have interfaces like this.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.740
So we call these interfaces to
government that are simple,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.660
beautiful, and easy to use.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.960
And that's part of a message,
not just to the developer

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.710
community and the government
community, but to citizens.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.805
You should expect to have
interfaces to government that

00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:13.650
are simple, beautiful,
and easy to use.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.940
And society really fundamentally
changes we have

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.275
those interfaces.

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:18.590
CHRIS DIBONA: I think you might
have mentioned this at

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.170
the summit, but was this made
generalizable for another

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.890
city, like say, a Detroit,
Or pick another

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.700
blight-stricken city?

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.180
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, this one in
particular is a little bit

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.715
hard to generalize, because
every city has their own mess

00:07:34.715 --> 00:07:37.080
of data on the back end.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.800
But all the apps that the
fellows built are open source,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.330
so some of them you can just
pretty easily re-implement.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.130
And maybe we could talk about
Adopt-a-Hydrant, which is an

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.840
example of that.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.380
Others will require a fair
amount to work on the part of

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.320
the city to reuse it.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.920
But everything is built with the
intention that we're not

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.640
going to solve a problem only
one city has, because we want

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.010
to see cities adopt a really new
model, where they're not

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.330
just going to vendors and
saying, build this at high

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.920
cost to taxpayers.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.080
But how can we shop from each
other's closets, how can we

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.050
use the solutions that have
been already implemented?

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.280
And in fact, the New Orleans
team, I'm so

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.090
proud of these guys.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.870
They are one of the three teams
that coming out of this

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.080
year, at the end of 2012,
who are going through an

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.100
incubator with us.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.650
They are taking this-- they
already have a contract with

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.990
the city of New Orleans to
continue working on it.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.220
They've got other cities
interested, so they're taking

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.659
it and making it, really
a commercial product.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.789
And they just didn't want to
stop doing what they were

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.600
doing, so they're going to
get paid to do it now.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.494
CHRIS DIBONA: That's great.

00:08:44.494 --> 00:08:46.570
LACY CARUTHERS: Yeah,
that's great.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.690
So you spent a great majority
of your career in the games

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.600
industry, and then later
running Web 2.0.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.950
So tell us about how your career
evolved, and how you

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.430
ended up launching Code
for America, and what

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.320
sparked that change?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.050
CHRIS DIBONA: How did you
come to be you, Jen?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.220
JEN PAHLKA: Extremely
accidentally.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.480
I have the craziest career path,
because I came into San

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.400
Francisco after college to
work in nonprofits, and I

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.770
hated them.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.110
And now I run one,
so go figure.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:20.130
Yeah I took a job working,
actually first, initially on a

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.090
software development conference
back in 1994, with

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.550
really no technical
understanding at all.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.041
I had no idea what anybody was
talking about for the first

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:30.780
several months on the job.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.940
And I had been traveling
around Southeast Asia.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.210
I needed a job, and
they hired me.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.231
It was like no interest
in the subject.

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:44.850
But I had gone from this
top-down structure in the

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.700
nonprofit, which not so much
fun, to landing very

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.330
accidentally in first the
software development world,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.570
which was more interesting,
and then the world of game

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.890
developers, circa 1995.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.460
And as much as I was lost, I was
finally so happy, because

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:07.070
it was this crazy, creative,
incredibly smart community of

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.580
people who were doing things
that people really didn't

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.040
largely understand them, or the
general populace didn't

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.480
understand, soft of right before
games broke out to be

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.730
really mainstream.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:21.670
And I think that what ties that
to what I'm doing now is

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.800
it was such a transformative
time for me to understand what

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.340
the technology world was.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.600
I had been an American Studies
major in college, and

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.860
technology was something I felt
like I didn't understand.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.780
And it was really the people,
and the creativity, and the

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.180
magic of development that just
completely enraptured me.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.600
I had an amazing time.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.270
That conference was very small
when we started it, and when I

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.830
left it was, I think,
12,000 people.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.440
But it really just gave
me a love for what

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.940
developers can do.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.350
And that carried on.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.160
Then I left that.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.670
After I had my kid I came back
and was working on Web 2.0,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.090
and it was the same thing.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.800
2005, Web 2.0 was just
when all of this

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.240
amazing stuff was happening.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.000
And you really felt like you
were at the center of

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.750
something that was being
created, that was

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.100
transforming the world.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.540
And that really led into,
I think, this

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.980
notion that the talent--

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.380
not just the talent, but
I think the spirit--

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.840
of those communities had a lot
to offer this system that we

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.200
all rely on, called
government.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.030
Which just needs--

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.630
government has many amazing,
wonderful people

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.812
as you know, Chris.

00:11:34.812 --> 00:11:37.930
But it's just stuck in a lot of
old ways, and it needs to

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.220
be a creative force, not
just a stagnant,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.910
bureaucratic force.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.270
So I think that really
informed this

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.880
idea of Code for America.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.080
CHRIS DIBONA: One of the really
refreshing things I

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.190
found about Code for America is,
you didn't go into cities

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.930
and governments and say,
you're all broken.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.610
You didn't go in and, we're
going to fix it.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.880
You were like, hey,
how can we help?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.535
What would be something that
would be really useful?

00:11:57.535 --> 00:12:00.950
And I think your first
year was kind of

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.500
figuring out that process.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.520
Would you like to talk
more about that?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.440
Because I know it was a really
tricky time for you guys.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.450
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah it
was great, though.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.920
It was in some ways
the best year.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.850
Definitely one thing we found
is that I think we were so

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:19.580
lucky to get that particular
class of fellows that year.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.890
There was just something
about them.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.680
And you had to be pretty brave
to do the program.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.510
We had no track record.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.860
It was not clear that we would
be able to pay people.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.520
CHRIS DIBONA: Because our
donation income until after

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.350
that first year, right?

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.850
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah,
that's right.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.860
I was very month-to-month.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.260
And the first month, we started
with three cities,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.410
Boston, DC--

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.240
oh, sorry, four.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.520
So it was Boston, Philadelphia,
and Seattle, but

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.750
originally there was a fourth.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.770
We had a fourth team that was
deployed to Washington, DC.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.840
And what happened is, we got
our signed contract there

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.600
right before Fenty lost
the election, and

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.030
Mayor Gray came in.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.510
And we were talking to
the new people--

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.390
actually, it was the
old people who

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.100
hadn't been fired yet.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.820
And they said, no,
no, it's fine.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.950
Send the fellows, send
the fellows.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:13.550
It will be fine.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.990
The fellows show up on the
first day of work in DC.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.760
They get their badges, and they
get assigned seats, and

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.040
they're getting walked around
the office in the way that

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.780
people do on their first day.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.100
And they are about to go to
lunch, and the general counsel

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.500
comes over with security,
and they escort

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.750
them from the building.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.590
CHRIS DIBONA: Welcome to DC.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.670
JEN PAHLKA: We had a reasonable
idea that this

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.800
might happen, just
from the signals.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.970
So, actually, they went to
Clay Johnson's place.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.370
I said, don't worry, I've
got a place for you.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.390
Actually they called in for
their first check-in meeting

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.140
with me, and it was very
clear they were not

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.010
calling from an office.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.760
I said, where are you?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.610
They're like, we're in the
National Portrait Gallery.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.840
It was cold out on the street.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.910
So lots of chaos the first year,
but to actually answer

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.520
your question--

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.832
CHRIS DIBONA: What ever
happened to that team?

00:13:59.832 --> 00:14:01.170
I've got to figure that out.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.000
JEN PAHLKA: They worked on the
Civic Commons Project, which

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.710
we now call the CFA Commons,
which is really a way that you

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.510
can see a lot of these civic
technology projects, see where

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.620
they're in use, and be able to
get a sense of what's working

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.320
where in terms of mostly
open source civic tech.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.330
But to get back to the thing,
those fellows were amazingly

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.880
emotionally intelligent, and
they were humble, and they

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.080
were curious, and
they were kind.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.020
And so I think when people heard
about the idea-- and we

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.920
had this video that we used to
promote Code for America the

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.940
very first year that had Mark
Zuckerberg, and Caterina Fake,

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.230
and Biz Stone in it.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.580
And I think people thought we
were going to be like, hi,

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.030
we're here from the cool part
of the internet, and we're

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.915
going to fix you.

00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:46.260
CHRIS DIBONA: We're going
to make you cool too.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.117
JEN PAHLKA: We're going
to make you cool

00:14:47.117 --> 00:14:48.365
too, because we know--

00:14:48.365 --> 00:14:49.255
CHRIS DIBONA: --we're going
to sprinkle cool on you.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:50.595
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, we
know how it's done.

00:14:50.595 --> 00:14:51.135
And the fellowship--

00:14:51.135 --> 00:14:53.165
CHRIS DIBONA: --boring,
old government people.

00:14:53.165 --> 00:14:55.820
JEN PAHLKA: --They were so nice,
and they were disarming.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.580
And I think--

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.530
not [? to slag ?] on
consultants, but I think in

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.170
government, they're so used to
having McKinsey and other

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.190
consulting companies come
in, and be like,

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.210
OK, we've got a process.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:06.860
We know what we're going on.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.670
And these guys came in, they
were like, hi, we're so

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.770
excited to be here.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.780
Could I help you do anything?

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.630
And it set the tone of a real
collaboration from the

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.145
beginning, so thank God.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.270
LACY CARUTHERS: So for those
folks that are tuning into

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.890
this and are interested in being
a fellow at Code for

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.580
America, what types of folks
are you looking for?

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.970
JEN PAHLKA: That's
a great question.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.330
So the name is Code for America,
but really about 2/3

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.600
of our fellows code, somewhere
between 1/2 and 2/3.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.020
We're also looking for great
designers, graphic designers,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.160
user experience designers.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.880
CHRIS DIBONA: Your women
participation for the fellows

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.830
was actually pretty amazing last
year, when [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.230
JEN PAHLKA: Last year, we had 26
fellows overall, and 12 of

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.310
them were women, so just one
shy of half, which is good.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:00.450
And a number of them actually
were engineers, and a number

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.530
of various flavors
of designer.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:07.360
And we actually really have a
very diverse group of fellows.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.030
So some of them have some
technical skills but their

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.050
background is city
planning or law.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.445
And what you really have to
show is a high degree of

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:23.640
skill, the emotional
intelligence to do a job like

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.970
this, and passion.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.370
We want people who really,
really care about what we're

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:29.990
trying to do.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.526
And when you pay a very small
stipend for a year, and you're

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.350
supposed to live in San
Francisco, you really only get

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.492
people who are passionate
about it.

00:16:38.492 --> 00:16:41.040
So it's a little bit of
a filtering thing.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.310
But we'll be opening up--

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.800
our current class is 28 fellows
that they'll be

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.950
starting January 3.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.105
But we'll start recruiting
again for 2014 soon.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:57.180
And if anybody out there is
interested, we can always hook

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.490
you up with fellows who've
done the program.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.250
They can tell you really
honestly what it was like.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.190
And they've all been really
positive about it.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.274
Two years in a row now,
basically every single fellow

00:17:09.274 --> 00:17:13.869
has said, this was hard, it
wasn't everything I expected,

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.490
but I would totally
do it again.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.230
And they grew, and they made
great friends, and they

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.910
learned something.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.069
So we're very pleased.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.510
LACY CARUTHERS: And so in
addition to the fellows

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.349
program, you guys also have a
civic start up accelerator.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.850
So tell us more about
that program.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.780
JEN PAHLKA: Yes, thanks
to google.org.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.190
So one of the things we see is
that the fellows go into the

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:39.140
cities, and they're exposing
people in government to things

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:46.800
like cloud-based applications,
and services that cost a lot

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.120
less than what these guys are
used to paying, have much

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.820
better interfaces.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.740
And what happens is--

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.030
and also I would say in
sort of a hacker way.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.520
What happens is we create
a lot of demand.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.150
Then they go look at the tool
set they currently have, and

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.280
they go, wow, why are we paying
so much for this, and

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.560
couldn't we start to buy things
in a different way?

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.920
And there is now something of
an ecosystem in the civic

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.160
space that you would
call 2.0 or--

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.870
I don't know what the
right term is there.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.240
But there's not enough, right.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.890
There need to be more smart
entrepreneurs, and developers,

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.650
and hackers, and designers that
say, I'm not just going

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.590
to go try to do my Facebook
killer, or whatever.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.830
I'm going to solve a real
problem for our country, for

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.850
government, for citizens,
whatever, and offer these

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.540
kinds of services targeted
at the real needs

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.160
the government has.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.710
So if we're going to succeed in
our mission long-term, we

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.230
have to build that ecosystem.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.310
And we wanted to pick some
companies that were already

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.110
trying to do this.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.550
We sent out a call for
applications, and everyone

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.010
said, there's no such thing
as a civic startup.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.250
Who's going to apply?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:56.700
Except you guys.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.750
You were great.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.290
We had 235 companies apply
for the accelerator.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.070
CHRIS DIBONA: How
big were they?

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.440
JEN PAHLKA: It really varied
all over the map.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.590
We chose seven of them, and they
were all pretty small.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.150
But they ranged from Mind
Mixer, which already has

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.100
something like 250 city
government clients, to

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.710
Recovers.org, very early stage,
fantastic application

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.410
that's been in the media a lot,
because they were able to

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.640
respond to Hurricane Sandy.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.620
They help communities organize
online for all the aid that's

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.450
coming in after a disaster,
and they were in very high

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.070
demand at the end of October.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.370
So these companies are
just fantastic.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.860
And it's a real market.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.660
There's an enormous amount
of money in this market.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.560
We're spending something like
$172 billion a year.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.440
CHRIS DIBONA: You personally?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.880
JEN PAHLKA: Yes, us together
personally.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.070
Taxpayers are.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:06.090
And for a point of comparison,
the video game business is now

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.620
about 10 to 15 billion.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.900
So this is giant.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.500
I'm not saying you should
go take a piece of a

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.130
$172 billion market.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.700
I'm saying we should be cutting
that number in half.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.270
But that's still a big business,
and it's doing

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.740
something to make your
country better.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.450
CHRIS DIBONA: Great.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.150
So speaking of mentorship and
the mentorship you guys

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.490
provide in your accelerator,
going to your personal

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.240
background, who have been your
role models and your heroes as

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.230
you've come on this path
as a woman in tech?

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.860
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, it's been
interesting because I'm a

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.970
woman in tech, but I'm not
really a developer.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.895
I have--

00:20:45.895 --> 00:20:47.470
CHRIS DIBONA: So you
hate developers?

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.388
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, I
hate developers, I

00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:50.160
can't say that on here.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.240
No, I feel really strongly
that we need to fix this

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.270
problem of fewer women
in the industry.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.330
I'm not answering your
question, but

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.710
I'll get back to it.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.900
My niece came out to spend the
summer at Code for America two

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.890
years ago, and I was like,
she'll hang out with all these

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.190
developers for the summer, and
she'll get the coding bug.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.403
And I want that for her, because
I see the kind of life

00:21:13.403 --> 00:21:15.230
you can have, the kind of
things that you can do.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.540
And I think increasingly
it's about access to

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.060
power in this country.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.490
So I really think it's
important, and I'm connected

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.130
to a lot of those efforts.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.360
And I just want to see more
role models for women in

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.650
technology.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.620
My role models have been
like my parents.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.720
I'm sorry to say it.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.345
But you know, you grow
up and you--

00:21:35.345 --> 00:21:36.170
CHRIS DIBONA: I'm sure they're
not sorry to hear it.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:36.670
JEN PAHLKA: Hi, Mom.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.850
Hi, Dad.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.280
My dad's a teacher and my mom's
a nurse midwife, and

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.050
they both--

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.910
I think later in life,
you realize how

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.080
they've influenced you.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.180
They both care deeply
about those systems.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.750
Our health care system has to
work for us to live well in

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.850
this country.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.430
Our education system
has to work.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.880
Both of those are
deeply broken.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.120
And they're the kind of people
who worked way harder than

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.580
anyone expected them to work,
because they cared so much

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.300
about doing the right thing.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.150
And I think as I've thought
about it later, this turn into

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.940
government, which seemed really
unlikely for me, had to

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.630
do with growing up in a
household of people who cared

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.210
about the public sector.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:29.860
But in the tech world, I think
Sheryl Sandberg's done a lot

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:33.400
to forward this conversation
and to say really specific,

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.750
brave things about women
in the workplace.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.280
And I'm just really impressed
with that.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.460
But she's not the only one.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.540
I think there's a lot of people
who are standing up and

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.040
saying, I'm happy to have
this honest dialogue

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.290
about women in tech.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.950
LACY CARUTHERS: To those young
people, especially young women

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.800
that are interested in pursuing
this path, what would

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.290
your advice be to them?

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.380
JEN PAHLKA: I think that
what I would say is--

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.670
so I just sort of set up this
whole big thing about how

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.920
there need to be more women in
tech-- but the truth is, if

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.240
you're not coming in it from a
place of just really feeding

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.780
your own passions, it's
not the right thing.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.660
I think it's, tap into what
really jazzes you about what

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.190
you're doing.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.760
Any I think a lot
of women get--

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.040
the government technology space,
I think, can be great

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.320
for women for a lot
of reasons.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.070
But one is that I see women
really wanting to solve a

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.120
particular problem.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.890
It's not just tech
for tech's sake.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.780
And that's a place where you can
do it really clearly, and

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.820
people come tell you, you've
had an impact on my life

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.090
because of this application
that you put up.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.170
But I think it's sort of own
your own and career path, own

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.300
your own passions.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.720
Own what you want to do in tech,
and that'll be the best

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.415
role model for others
in the end.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.200
CHRIS DIBONA: So when you go
to a city, and you talk to

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.187
them, do you go in and say,
I'm going to do this to

00:24:03.187 --> 00:24:07.370
Detroit, I'm going to do
this to [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.594
And then do you find yourself
disappointed, do you find

00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:11.664
yourself energized?

00:24:11.664 --> 00:24:13.770
What happens when you have
those first discussions?

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.770
Especially in the first year,
were your hopes and thoughts

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.990
just dashed upon the rocks
and then recover?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.870
What happens?

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.340
JEN PAHLKA: We don't really
go in and tell them

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.020
what we want to to.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.087
CHRIS DIBONA: But in the back
of your mind, you have this

00:24:25.087 --> 00:24:28.778
idea of a digital city,
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:30.660
How did that hit [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.930
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, I've always
had a couple applications in

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.730
my mind that I'd like to
have built, and we're

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.700
just not there yet.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.930
I mean it's early stages in this
industry, and I would say

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.200
in this movement.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.360
So more important than building
any one thing that

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.240
might be the thing you think
will get everybody on board

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.430
with reporting issues in your
city, or being involved with

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:59.030
civic life is just, again,
showing what's possible,

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.790
offering new models to
approach problems in.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.170
So if we come in and say
we want to do this,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.270
they don't own it.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.450
They have to say, we're starting
to get that there

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.060
might be a different way to
solve this problem than the

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.880
way we've solved
it in the past.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.240
Can you help us prove
that point?

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.630
And it's very responsive.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.780
In fact, I talked about New
Orleans, where they knew

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.060
really clearly, this
is the problem.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.690
Clearly the biggest thing
in the city, clearly an

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.540
opportunity where tech can be
a small intervention that

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.740
changes the conversation.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.740
But we went into Honolulu.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.860
They said, we don't care
what the fellows do.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.670
We pushed them, what's
their area?

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.040
Can you give us schools,
what is it?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.850
We don't care.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.020
Have them come and spend a lot
of time talking to people, and

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.470
they can tell us what they want
to do during the year.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.200
And we were a little nervous
about that, but the folks in

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.860
City Hall in Honolulu
were fantastic.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.400
And they ended up doing this
amazing project that actually

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.270
just won an interaction
design award.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.120
I think we pulled up a
screenshot of this too.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.750
It's called Honolulu Answers.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.740
I'll tell that story.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.860
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, do.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.760
Interesting one.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.790
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.360
So, by way, I love Honolulu.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.850
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, that's a
rough place to have to work.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.710
JEN PAHLKA: It really
is, I know.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.930
I was supposed to visit all of
the cities last February, and

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.570
I ended up visiting
just Honolulu.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.090
CHRIS DIBONA: We won't tell
anyone [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.190
JEN PAHLKA: I know.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.350
It was really great.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.480
One thing is you think of it
as Hawaii, like beaches.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.390
It's a real city.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.550
It's giant.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.390
It has traffic problems.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.600
We're talking about a real
American city, but on a beach.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.830
And it's beautiful.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.360
So the fellows went to Honolulu,
and one of the

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.320
things I heard consistently from
everyone-- and I'm not

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.200
just talking about people
outside of government being

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.830
critical, but people
in government--

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.690
was that the website, not
really serving citizens.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.320
And if you look at Honolulu.gov,
you'll see.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.580
And it's still up there.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.180
It's just not the information
that you want.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.370
And what they did is they went,
and they looked at the

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.180
search logs.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.820
And they said, when people come
to Honolulu.gov, what are

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.330
they trying to do?

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.780
And the top search result, for
instance, was driver's

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.640
license, which doesn't make
sense to those of us that live

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.470
in a state where the state
handles driver's licences.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.505
In Honolulu, the city does--

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:23.960
or it's actually a
city and county.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.780
So they type driver's license
into Honolulu.gov, and you get

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.580
back about 25 different
pages of information

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.060
about driver's licenses.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.820
Never do you get back a page
that tells you how to get a

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.690
driver's license.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.460
But there's a lot of
information, a lot of words.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.370
So what they did was they ripped
off an interface that's

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.330
starting to be popular now in
government that the UK has

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.380
done and Utah.gov has done,
which is basically a big,

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.200
beautiful background screen
and a search box.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.240
So instead of tyring to push a
bunch of information, what is

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.260
it you're trying to do?

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.560
And they created custom content
for those top 10

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.570
searches, driver's license
and the other ones.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.250
So it's a simple, beautiful,
easy-to-use interface that

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.990
actually does what you
want it to do.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.470
But then they had the problem
of how are they going to

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.200
create the rest of
the content.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.310
And they held something that's
not a hackathon.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.200
They held something called a
write-a-thon, first ever

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.180
write-a-thon.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.510
They got 60 people
in Honolulu--

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.930
citizens, people in government,
across the board--

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.580
to come together
on a Saturday.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.960
And they put all the next set of
questions up on the board,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.770
and people came and took them
down and wrote clear, plain

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.570
language answers to the next
50 most commonly asked

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.020
questions in Honolulu.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.760
And they continue to do that.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.660
And so, basically, it's now
growing on it's own as a

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:51.870
replacement to Honolulu.gov that
is, frankly, just a lot

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.280
better at actually serving
citizens needs.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.720
And we had no idea that's what
they were going to do.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.420
And it worked out great.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.620
CHRIS DIBONA: That's terrific.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.140
One thing that was really
interesting to me is the first

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.820
year you had the Hydrant app,
and then you said it's

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.650
migrated into a whole new kind
of app for a different city,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.660
with I think is really
exciting.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.100
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, that story was
amazing, and it's part of

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.830
the Honolulu story, too.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.540
2011, our first year,
one of the fellows--

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.880
we sent all these fellows
to Boston in the

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.730
winter which was--

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.470
CHRIS DIBONA: That's
dedication.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.180
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, and they were
mostly from California,

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.200
and didn't have warm coats,
and they also didn't have

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.930
ties, and they were
in City Hall.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.180
There are some of the things
we learned the first year.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.900
That also happened to be the
year of Snowpocalypse, so they

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.915
were in City Hall--

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:42.520
CHRIS DIBONA: Don't they have
those every year now?

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.840
JEN PAHLKA: No, there was no
snow last year, hardly any.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.780
And there's not that much this
year either, which you'll hear

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.770
is actually a bummer for us.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.660
We needed more snow
to test the app.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.540
So they're in City Hall when
everybody's talking about

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.790
trying to plow the streets.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.520
The dialogue in City Hall
becomes all about what streets

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.350
are plowed.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.610
And what they realized is, when
you plow a street and the

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.120
snow gets pushed up to the
side, it covers the fire

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.340
hydrants so that you can't find
them or use them in the

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.270
event of an emergency.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.970
Very little thing, but Eric
Michaels-Ober, one of the

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.610
fellows, said, well,
let's just see.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.140
I'm going to write a very quick
little app that will let

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.430
you adopt a fire hydrant.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.480
Because people are
on the street.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.040
They're shoveling out
the sidewalks in

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.810
front of their houses.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.250
Why don't they take the extra
step and shovel out the fire

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.570
hydrant, so that it's available
if their house

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.760
catches on fire?

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.280
Sort of trivial app that didn't
get used that first

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.212
year, because they took a month
to roll it out, and then

00:30:37.212 --> 00:30:38.660
it wasn't showing anymore.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.250
But a great concept.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:44.560
And then when we had the second
set of cities, our 2012

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.260
cities, come visit us that fall
in preparation for being

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.680
in the program the next year,
our great partner, this guy,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.430
Forest Frizzell, in the IT
department in Honolulu tells

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.130
me, oh, I was poking around in
your GitHub account, and I

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.350
found this thing called
Adopt-A-Hydrant, and I'm going

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.850
to use it in Honolulu.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.110
And we're like, not
a lot of snow.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.540
CHRIS DIBONA: It doesn't
snow here.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.190
Sanddrifts after a big surf?

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.470
JEN PAHLKA: A little strange.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.720
And he said no, I'm
re-purposing it as

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.070
Adopt-a-Siren.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.790
And people steal the batteries
out of these tsunami

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.710
sirens on the beach.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.180
Also big public hazard.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.970
You need to know if there's
a tsunami coming to hit.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.190
And so that was the
first reuse of it,

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.530
which I think was brilliant.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.080
No one had said to him,
here's this thing; you

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.050
could use it for this.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.260
He just got it and did it, and
now a bunch of the sirens are

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.430
adopted in Honolulu,
which is great.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.840
But I think it's in about
eight of nine

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.070
cities right now already.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.090
So Oakland where I live
just rolled it out as

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.250
Adopt-a-Storm-Drain.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.600
If you think about it, why are
we spending a lot of money

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.140
having crews go around
and clear the leaves

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.020
out of storm drains?

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.140
I live a couple doors
down from the storm

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.500
drain on our block.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.530
And if it gets stuck with
leaves, I can pull the leaves

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.010
out just as well as a
municipal worker.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.372
So I've adopted the storm
drain on my street.

00:32:02.372 --> 00:32:04.686
CHRIS DIBONA: Do you ever have
anyone accuse you of trying to

00:32:04.686 --> 00:32:06.123
subvert the authority of the

00:32:06.123 --> 00:32:08.040
government with these projects?

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.720
JEN PAHLKA: No.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.550
Actually, no.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.280
But I will say it's a little
weird to put your hand in a

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.980
storm drain.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.830
I'm getting over it, but
you're like, ew.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.210
CHRIS DIBONA: Have you ever
gone inside them and

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.002
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:19.002 --> 00:32:20.887
JEN PAHLKA: No, no, they're
just like this, you can't.

00:32:20.887 --> 00:32:24.150
CHRIS DIBONA: No the
aboveground part.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.150
Especially rainy cities,
there's substantial

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.150
aboveground spaces.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:27.650
It's fun.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:28.450
JEN PAHLKA: No, I haven't.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.030
I'll put that on
the life list.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.838
CHRIS DIBONA: Don't do that,
just for the record.

00:32:30.838 --> 00:32:32.650
We are not endorsing that.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.181
JEN PAHLKA: OK, so you want
everyone else not to do it,

00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:37.060
but you want me to do it?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.070
CHRIS DIBONA: No, I want
no one to do it.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.750
JEN PAHLKA: OK, I wont.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.560
CHRIS DIBONA: But it's
interesting.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.610
JEN PAHLKA: Anyway, so you can--
and by the way, this is

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.050
an app that's pretty easy to
stand up in other cities.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.420
And one of the other programs
that we have is called this

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.730
brigade, which basically means
that you don't have to take a

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.450
year off and come work with us
to Code for America or do

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:58.390
civic apps.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.190
You could, right now, wherever
you live, go to your city

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.400
government and say, hey, can
I stand up this thing?

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.680
Give me the locations of all the
park benches or whatever.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.570
And I'll stand this up for
you, and then we'll get

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.070
citizens to start
lending a hand.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.040
And just do it.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040
It's not that hard.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.830
LACY CARUTHERS: Well I was just
going to ask, what have

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.240
you seen after--

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.050
I know you've just had a couple
of years of fellows,

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.690
but what have you seen
after the fellows

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.690
have left these cities?

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.030
Are they leaving some
kind of legacy?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:29.060
Have you seen the programs
continue once they've gone?

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.620
JEN PAHLKA: It's a
good question.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.540
That really is the point of
the program, is that if we

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.220
come in and do magic and
then leave, what's--

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.420
really, why?

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.710
So increasingly we're figuring
out what are those changes

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.090
that mean that there's
a long-lasting

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.130
difference in a city.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.480
And I think there's
a bunch of signals

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.510
that things have changed.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.770
And there's no indicator on the
wall that you can look at

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.152
that says, culture change in
government now 25% complete.

00:33:58.152 --> 00:34:00.076
Well done.

00:34:00.076 --> 00:34:01.600
But you can see--

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.980
like in Honolulu, Honolulu
Answers is a Rails app, so

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.420
they taught the staff Rails.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.960
That's not something you see
that often, but there's a

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.429
bunch of developers who
actually do Rails now.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:20.170
You see things like policies
being changed generally around

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.250
openness, open data,
open government.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.400
You see people who had been
previously marginalized now

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.330
having the limelight, having
more power, getting

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.219
promotions, getting
more resources.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.420
That's really common.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.989
Because they go, oh,
that who was--

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:34.744
LACY CARUTHERS: That's
what you do, yeah.

00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:36.130
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, that guy who
was saying all these crazy

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:36.969
things that we didn't
understand?

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:42.620
Now we understand what he or
she was saying, and we get

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.830
that this could be valuable.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.650
And that's great, because
you really want it

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.370
to come from inside.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:52.040
You want to take all that
internal, great spirit.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.639
And people who work in
City Hall, they're

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.889
also regular people.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.270
I mean, they have
Android phones.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.790
They know--

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.490
CHRIS DIBONA: That's madness.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.600
JEN PAHLKA: They
know how it is.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.540
CHRIS DIBONA: I've
seen [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.230
JEN PAHLKA: Exactly.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.880
It's not like that.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.290
CHRIS DIBONA: I was [INAUDIBLE]
for a while, yeah.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.030
JEN PAHLKA: You were what?

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.210
Yeah that's right,
that's right.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.680
Even the people in government
will eventually start to say

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.580
bad things about bureaucracy.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.620
But, really, it's
not immutable.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.240
It really isn't.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.780
It takes people who care
and see something

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.500
better to change it.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.920
And we see that.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.545
It's really, really gratifying
and exciting.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.360
LACY CARUTHERS: So one thing--
just shifting gears a little

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.120
bit-- that my team thinks a lot
about and has seen on the

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.680
giving side is a huge
opportunity for nonprofits to

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.070
really leverage technology and
integrate it into the work

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.760
that they're doing.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.290
And so I think you guys
are a great example.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.790
You're not only innovating
within the government space,

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.650
but also within the
nonprofit space.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.420
So could you just talk a
little bit about your

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.300
experience there and what you
have seen from the inside of

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.910
that sector, and if there
is an emerging

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:03.950
trend in that space?

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.850
JEN PAHLKA: Of the
nonprofit sector?

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.930
LACY CARUTHERS: Of the nonprofit
sector using and

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.710
taking advantage of technology
in better ways.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.100
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.380
I don't know that I've seen
that much of the nonprofit

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:15.810
sector now.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.370
I really spend a lot of
time in government.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:22.980
And I'll tell you what I want
out of the nonprofit sector,

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.110
is fewer emails.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:31.750
I think sending a bunch of
emails advocating for things

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.220
is useful, and there's a lot
of stuff that's going on.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.470
But ultimately, technology can
do something a lot more

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.830
fundamental, a lot
more powerful.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.000
And I think that there is a fair
amount of the nonprofit

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.980
sector that's stuck in the, we
lobby and we educate, and we

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.080
used to send enormous amounts
of direct mail, and now we

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.940
send enormous amounts
of email.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.100
And one of the things I think
that set us apart--

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.760
and you were kind to say this
when you first looked at us--

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.170
is we write real code that does
something other than send

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.670
you an email.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.840
And I think all nonprofits
should start looking at what

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.510
they can do and get beyond this
notion of engagement,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.480
where engagement means
they clicked on

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.690
the link in the email.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.460
I had one guy come to me last
year and say he wanted to do a

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.740
Code for America for nonprofits,
to try to get them

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.380
to think more innovatively
about government.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.390
And I would say--

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.160
he didn't do it.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:28.970
Someone else should.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:29.150
Take it up.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.430
It's a great opportunity.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.040
There needs to be more
true innovation,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.010
not like better MailChimp.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.440
CHRIS DIBONA: We've run some
hackathons for nonprofits, and

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.340
it's always really surprising
how underdeveloped

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.900
their system is.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.710
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, and
it's unfortunate,

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.850
because they also see--

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.980
when you talk to a lot of
nonprofits about technology,

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.290
they're coming at you with,
like, our server doesn't work.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.730
They're really at a very
operational level around it,

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:05.390
and you kind of want to go, I
totally hear you, but we need

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.120
to get these basic needs met
so you can move forward.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.390
And it's a resource issue.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.080
We need to resource
them better.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.300
LACY CARUTHERS: So I think
we have time for

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.550
about one more question.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.845
Any burning questions, Chris?

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:19.160
Let's see, last one.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.250
I guess maybe just concluding
with any final words you have

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.580
to share with, as a woman in
tech, given that this is the

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.360
Women Techmakers series.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.960
Maybe some of the best advice
that you've ever gotten,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.690
that's helped you
in your career.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.150
JEN PAHLKA: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.130
I think I was supposed to have
a good answer for this.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.250
LACY CARUTHERS: Or just
final parting words.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.030
JEN PAHLKA: I think the best
advice I would give is that

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.400
you get a lot of advice,
and it all conflicts.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.460
And in the end--

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.375
LACY CARUTHERS: You get
asked about it a lot?

00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:56.750
JEN PAHLKA: In the end, if you
close your ears off, you're

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.070
doing yourself a great
disservice.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.180
But if you try to take it all,
you will become psychotic.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:10.990
And I actually think that people
from outside the tech

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.380
industry often look at me as,
oh, you're a woman in tech.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.890
Let's talk about that.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:19.810
And my response to them is tech
is actually, yes, I get

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.200
that there is a real
gender divide here.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.720
But is actually a pretty--

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.550
most parts of the tech industry
that I see are pretty

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.440
open and welcoming to women.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:37.270
And I do think it's important to
talk about the places where

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.300
the industry becomes
very unfriendly.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.940
And I don't think people get
what they're doing, and I

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.420
think a little education can
help them when they're being

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.740
very off-putting.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.490
But I think it's also important
to talk about the

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.070
places that are incredibly
supportive.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.480
Code for America is,
I think, a pretty

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.980
supportive place for women.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.670
We've talked about issues
that have come up

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.300
from time to time.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.175
But there are great
opportunities.

00:40:01.175 --> 00:40:05.450
And I think if we frame this as
a place where you're going

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:09.390
to be fighting through a jungle
all the time to get any

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.120
respect, not only does
that not help us,

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.040
but you know what?

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.270
I worked in the media industry
for a long time.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.990
I've worked in a bunch
of industries.

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.850
Sexism is not unique to
the tech industry.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.740
Has anyone been anywhere
else lately?

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.900
So I don't think it's
particularly that

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.580
must worse in tech.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:36.090
And I think there's a lot of
opportunity, and I think I

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.900
would like women to
see it as fun.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.420
LACY CARUTHERS: Great.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.600
Well, thank you so much for
joining us today, Jen.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.000
That was really fascinating.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.840
Thanks for sharing.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.132
CHRIS DIBONA: Before you go, you
should tell us the URL and

00:40:46.132 --> 00:40:47.750
where people can
find your code.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.260
Because someone asked
about that.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.770
LACY CARUTHERS: URL, yes.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:55.300
We're at codeforamerica.org,
and we would love

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.160
to see you all there.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.460
Signal your interest in being
a fellow, or in getting your

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.900
city on board with our program,
or contributing to

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.320
our annual campaign.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.420
And then if you would like to
look at some of our code--

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.370
CHRIS DIBONA: Which is
all open source.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.460
JEN PAHLKA: Which is all
open-- we have too many

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:10.920
[? repodes. ?]

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.480
That's the feedback we're
going to get.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.910
We're going to be cleaning up
this December, which is
