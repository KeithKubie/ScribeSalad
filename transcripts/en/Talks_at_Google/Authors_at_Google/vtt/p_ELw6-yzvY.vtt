[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.380
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
So Chris and I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.850
got to know each
other because we

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.760
serve on the board of
GiveDirectly together.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.006
But he's done so many
amazing things in his life.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.130
One of the best parts of
Google.org is that you get

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.440
to meet people around the
world who are really digging

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.237
in, in the arena, fighting to
make the world a better place .

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:28.570
And Chris has done that in
so many different initiatives

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.850
in so many different levels.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.600
Google.org is working
together with him

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.470
on the Economic
Security Project.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.760
And Andrew Dunkleman here in
the front row and Florian, also

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.920
here-- is Mahmood here.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
Our economic opportunity leaders
are charting Google's path

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.210
as we support some
of their work.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.340
So if you have questions, also
look for Andrew at the end.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.400
But I thought it would
be helpful to start

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.590
with a little bit of
Chris's background,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.900
for those of you
who don't know him.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.710
So you may know that he was
one of the original co-founders

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.480
of Facebook.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.000
He was the Head of New Media
for the 2008 Obama campaign

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.660
and the former owner
of "The New Republic".

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.180
But these days what
propels him most

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.760
is his work on rethinking
the social safety net

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.800
to give everyone a fair shot.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.820
So I hope everyone was able
to get a copy of their book.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.590
I was telling Chris,
true story, that Andrew

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.610
bought this book for me.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.830
And I put it on my
nightstand and I

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.690
knew I needed to get to it
and read it before this.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.330
And of course I was
going to do that.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.070
But when I actually opened
it up and started reading it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.550
on the BART, I missed my
BART stop because it is

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.430
so well written, so thoughtful.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.930
CHRIS HUGHES: Which is like the
best compliment you can ever

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.424
give an author, for the record.

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:51.840
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
I mean, I have

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.940
a background in econometrics,
and let me tell you,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.250
most of the books I
can put down easily

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.570
and I always make my stop.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.090
But this is a phenomenally
well-written, interesting,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.250
personal, thoughtful,
data-driven book, so highly

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.750
recommended.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.124
We have copies
here for Googlers.

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:09.137
CHRIS HUGHES: Thank you.

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:11.220
JACQUELLINE FULLER: But
Chris, why don't we start,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.410
because your personal
history, your narrative

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
does really inform a lot of your
thoughts and a lot of the book.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.740
So maybe just give
us some highlights

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.990
from your story,
your personal story.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.330
CHRIS HUGHES: Happily.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.510
So in many ways the
book is a reflection

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.770
of my own personal story.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.290
And that leads up to why I
believe a lot of the things

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.390
I talk about all the time.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.650
So I grew up in a little town
called Hickory, North Carolina.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.490
It's at the foothills of
the Appalachian Mountains.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.400
And my mom was a
public-school teacher.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080
She taught high-school math.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.590
And my dad was a
traveling paper salesman,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.260
sort of the middleman
between the big companies

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
that manufactured the paper
and small-town printers.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.330
And we had a just
typical sort of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.640
small-town, middle-class life.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.140
I went to public schools.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.312
And I was an only child.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:07.770
My parents were a
little bit older.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.380
It was very bucolic.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.960
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Wasn't
it literally like the town

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.220
that Mayberry was built on?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.180
CHRIS HUGHES: My dad was
born in Mount Airy, which is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.590
the setting for Mayberry, yes.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.350
And he grew up as the son of
the groundskeeper for a golf

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.020
course.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.140
So that was his trajectory.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.030
So I ended up applying
to a boarding school.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690
I googled best high school--
well, actually at the time

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.070
it was Yahoo search.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.782
This was like the late '90s.

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:42.240
JACQUELLINE FULLER: A long time
ago folks, a long time ago.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.060
CHRIS HUGHES: Yes.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.832
I looked up the best high school
in America, ended up applying.

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:50.790
I got financial aid to
go to a boarding school.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.886
And then from there,
got into Harvard,

00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:55.260
got financial aid,
a scholarship,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.500
to go there And got to
know Mark Zuckerberg

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.940
a little bit our freshman year
and then ended up roommates

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.410
with him sophomore year.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.050
We started Facebook
and the Facebook story

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.170
is somewhat well known.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.460
And the rocket ship took off.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.740
So my life, though, changed
dramatically in the years

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.459
after Facebook.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.640
I worked for three years
there doing communications,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.079
marketing, and product.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.830
But I wrote the book because
for three years worth of work,

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.590
I got a boatload of money.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.570
When Facebook went public,
it was nearly half a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.130
billion dollars.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.980
And that is nothing
but a lucky break.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.230
I mean, there's nothing else--

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.500
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Your take of
it was half a billion dollars--

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.935
CHRIS HUGHES: Yes.

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:43.250
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
--just to be clear, yeah.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.041
CHRIS HUGHES: Yes,
Facebook's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.790
But it was a lucky break.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.530
And so I wrote the book
because initially I thought

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.960
that my case was really unique.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.050
And I have come to believe
that my case is, in many ways,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.330
extreme, but it's
actually not that unique,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.040
that a small group of people
are consistently getting lucky

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.990
while everybody else has a
hard time making ends meet.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.230
It's not to say a hundred people
are working hard but only 1%

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.160
is doing really well.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.710
And that is a specific
decision that we

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.140
have made in our economy
to structure it that way.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.840
And we do really have
the power to change it.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640
So that's where
the book came from.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.520
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I thought
that your whole view on luck

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.570
was very interesting.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.650
So I thought I'd read just
a little bit from the book

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.925
when you talk about this.

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.650
You say that, "Saying
people get lucky

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.440
is not a denial that they
work hard and deserve

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.826
positive outcomes.

00:05:40.826 --> 00:05:42.200
It is a way of
acknowledging that

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.470
in a winner-take-all economy,
small chance encounters like

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.500
who you sit next to it at dinner
or who your college roommate is

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.162
have a more significant impact
than they have ever had before.

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:54.620
And in some cases the collection
of these small differences

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.681
can add up to create
immense fortunes."

00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.430
You know, I worked at
the Gates Foundation

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.860
before coming to Google,
and Bill Gates also--

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.662
I was always struck by how
he said when people said,

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.120
what's the reason
for your success,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.220
and he would say number
one would be luck, that I

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.400
lived in a privileged family.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.900
I was able to go to a school
where I had access to computers

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.890
in a time that was--

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.500
so recognizing
hard work, but also

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.270
recognizing the place of luck.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.920
And it seems like,
for a lot of folks,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.512
we don't want to have
that conversation.

00:06:21.512 --> 00:06:22.970
CHRIS HUGHES: I
think that's right.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.260
I think that we
often divvy it up.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.070
We say some people over
here, they get lucky.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.946
Like that guy Chris who
roomed with Mark Zuckerberg,

00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:34.070
he's one of the lucky ones.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.230
Over here we've got the
people who work hard.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.240
Mark Zuckerberg, he
worked very hard.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.180
And never the twain shall meet.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.280
I think in reality almost
always the two people

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.690
are both working hard--

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.780
when we look at success,
are both working hard

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.890
and are fortunate.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.970
I think Fortune 500 CEOs,
as I say in the book,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.490
are some of the hardest-working
people out there,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.220
but they are benefiting from
an economy that provides

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.660
some disproportionate rewards.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.840
The janitors who work in those
buildings or in a building

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.500
like this are also
working very, very hard,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.340
but the way that we've
structured our economy

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.930
means that--

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.000
quite literally we know
from the economic data--

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.810
they haven't gotten a meaningful
wage boost in decades,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.010
in nearly 40 years.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.700
So one of the reasons that
I wanted to write the book

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.710
was to try to dispel
this notion of luck

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.930
being something that is
just one or two people,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.090
but instead there's
a kind of fortune

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.835
that the economy is providing
to a small number of people

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:45.335
while everybody else is having
a hard time making ends meet.

00:07:45.335 --> 00:07:46.918
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Well, why don't we

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:49.280
go right into your policy
prescription for this?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.120
So you have an idea about
expanding the Earned Income Tax

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.700
Credit so that every
working American who

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.570
lives in a household earning
less than $50,000 a year

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.880
could receive a guaranteed
income of at least $500

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.990
a month.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.070
So we're at this moment.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.700
Economy's humming along.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.450
Unemployment's at
an all-time low.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.150
This would be creating
a whole new entitlement

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.880
at a time when we're talking
about entitlement reform.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.630
So why this and why now?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.780
CHRIS HUGHES: Well,
the numbers, I think,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.760
don't tell the whole story.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.630
The stock market
is at record highs.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.500
Unemployment is
near record lows.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.067
But economic opportunity is
also at a near record low.

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:39.150
So what do I mean by that?

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.169
I mean a sense that the people
who do well for themselves

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.330
will be able to pay their
bills and their kids

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.730
might do a little
bit better than they.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.790
The median wages
have not meaningfully

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.960
budged in 40 years, and the
cost of living is up by 30%.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.850
And it's not just
in the Bay Area

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.730
or in New York where we
have all of these insane

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.046
challenges with housing
and transportation

00:09:01.046 --> 00:09:02.750
and health care, child care.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.970
It's across the board,
across the country.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:05.930
Wages are flat.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.400
Life is more expensive.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.550
People feel like they
can't make ends meet.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.660
And Donald Trump was obviously
elected for a whole host

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.170
of complex, interwoven reasons.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.200
But I think one of the
things his election has done

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.360
is been a wake-up
call, that people

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.950
on the left and the right
feel like the economy is not

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.390
working for them
and that we have

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.080
to do something differently.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.520
So in my view, sometimes
the best solution

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.400
is the simplest, cash.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.140
Cold hard money put
in the hands of people

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.310
who need it provides more
economic opportunity,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.760
we know from the
evidence, and is

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:57.329
remarkably efficient in
offering that opportunity.

00:09:57.329 --> 00:09:59.120
And it can be the kind
of thing that we do.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.640
So we can talk a little bit
about the Earned Income Tax

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.820
Credit and the frameworks,
but at the end of the day what

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.010
I'm interested in is embracing
the dignity and the freedom

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.059
that I think everybody should
have to be able to figure out

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.600
what they want to
do with their time,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.890
what they want to invest in.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.660
And cash is unlike any other
intervention in that it doesn't

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.920
say, you go here at this time.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.240
You've got to go to
that government office

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.452
to fill out these programs.

00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:28.910
We'll give you
these SNAP benefits,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.130
but don't buy any fish
with it or all these kind

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.270
of crazy restrictions.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.380
Instead, cash says you are the
master of your own destiny.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.180
And I think it's a fundamentally
respectful way of empowering

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.740
people that we also happen
to know works very well.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.240
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Well, let's
dive into that a little bit.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.860
We bonded on
GiveDirectly's board.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:55.100
So Google.org has invested
in GiveDirectly as well.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.780
We're big believers in
direct cash assistance,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.020
especially in
developing countries.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.360
What's the evidence
base that in a place

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.710
like the United States
that this kind of aid

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.600
is going to be the
most effective?

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.720
CHRIS HUGHES: So I came
to this whole issue

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.050
actually from the
perspective of philanthropy,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.380
through the GiveDirectly lens.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.954
And specifically
after Facebook's IPO,

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:22.370
my husband and I
made a commitment

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:27.210
to give away the vast majority
of our wealth in our lifetime.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.430
And so we faced
this big challenge.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.950
But one of the biggest
first motivating questions

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.810
is, how do we get the
most bang for the buck?

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:38.910
Yes, it's a lot of money--

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.495
JACQUELLINE FULLER: If
you're going to give it away,

00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:40.260
you want to give it away well.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.150
CHRIS HUGHES: --however, if
you're going to give it away,

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.620
you want to give it away well.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.570
And in some sense it was
overwhelming without that kind

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.310
of heuristic.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.410
I'm sure some people in this
audience or on the livestream

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.750
have experienced
something similar where

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.880
there is no shortage of causes.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.089
I mean, we could go through
a whole list of things

00:11:58.089 --> 00:11:58.880
that we care about.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.430
But one way of narrowing
it down is like, OK,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.490
well if we care about poverty
and economic opportunity,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.390
what's the most
efficient way to help?

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.370
And I went through the
international door,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.290
initially through GiveDirectly.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.370
And I have a whole chapter
in the book about a journey

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.700
that I took to check out
several different programs.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.970
And I really came to believe
that cash, dollar for dollar,

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.310
is more effective
internationally.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.250
There are well over
200 studies that have

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.540
looked at the power of cash.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.460
There's a great
synthesis of all of them

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.050
in an Overseas
Development Institute

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.900
report that got put out last
year, which is fantastic,

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.950
shows that health educations
improve, education improves.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.960
Not to say we still don't
need hospitals and schools.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.630
However, on balance,
I think we should

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.140
be asking if we're
going to invest you know

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.220
a dollar in a hospital,
might it be better

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.590
to provide that dollar
in cash for people

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.585
to be able to go and
find the health resources

00:13:07.585 --> 00:13:08.210
that they need?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.730
So I came in through
the international door,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.350
became convinced
by the evidence,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.417
and then took a
step back and said,

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:15.500
well, this works in Kenya.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.390
Why can't it work here?

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:22.520
And in the US, there is less
evidence but still significant

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.390
amounts.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.800
We have a small guaranteed
income in Alaska.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.710
The Eastern Band of
Cherokee have one.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.020
And then majorly there's the
Earned Income Tax Credit.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.480
We have the largest
cash-transfer program

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.180
in the world.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.390
And we know quite a lot
about what happens when

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.010
you provide people with money.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:45.410
So I really came to see it
as the most effective way

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.230
to provide economic
opportunity, in a time when

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.800
a lot of other people, mind you,
are coming to the issue of UBI

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.620
more from the frame of
artificial intelligence

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.530
and automation and
self-driving cars and rise

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.210
of the robots, which is
a different door off--

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.030
it can take you to a very
similar kind of solution,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.359
but it's a different way in.

00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:07.400
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.440
So what's unique
about your proposal

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.050
as well is that whereas
a lot of UBI advocates

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.200
are just saying everyone
gets this amount regardless,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.860
you believe in having
a work element to this.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.050
So why don't you
just speak to that.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.600
Why do you think
work's important?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.835
Why would you weave that in?

00:14:24.835 --> 00:14:26.210
CHRIS HUGHES: So
a lot of this is

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:31.040
grounded in the context
in which I grew up.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.430
In the world I grew up, everyone
was working in some way,

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.100
and people wanted to work.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.000
Now it was often in
the formal economy.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.090
It was sometimes not.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:48.150
So I believe that
people in America--

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.620
the people at least
that I've met,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.590
and the empirical evidence
I think also shows this--

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.585
want to be of purpose to
themselves, their families,

00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:56.460
or their communities.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.360
This is just like a
fundamental belief of mine,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.100
that there is a myth out there
that people just want to--

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.890
I mean, particularly the
welfare queen, right?

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.580
This is the Reagan idea
that all these people,

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.440
they just want to
live on the dole.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:19.210
If people have enough money,
they're just going to hang out.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.180
And I don't see that.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.080
And I think psychological
evidence shows that people

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.530
want to be of purpose.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.890
They want to be in touch
with their communities.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.610
I think there's an
immense evidence

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.080
base that shows that people
want to be of purpose.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.680
So my view is if you are
working, whether it's

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.550
in a traditional job or
an untraditional one,

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.170
you shouldn't live in poverty.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.369
Sounds so obvious, right,
I know, but it's not true.

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:47.660
It's not true in America today.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.560
JACQUELLINE FULLER: By
untraditional you also

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.500
include caregiving, which
I think disproportionately

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.420
impacts women around the world.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.270
And in the US as well
women do the largest share

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.820
of childcare, but then
also elder care as well.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.240
And a lot of times that sets
back their economic situation.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.490
And so I think one of
the interesting things

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.220
about your proposal is that you
would equally value caregiving.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.011
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah.

00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:15.095
I think specifically we should
say if you're at home taking

00:16:15.095 --> 00:16:17.220
care of young kids, we
should recognize what you're

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.810
doing is the work that it is.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:24.090
If you have a dependent
over 70 who you're primarily

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:24.842
responsible for--

00:16:24.842 --> 00:16:26.550
I mean, we have so
much evidence to show,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.145
as baby boomers grow
older, people are literally

00:16:29.145 --> 00:16:31.520
dropping out of the workforce
to be able to stay at home,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.978
because it's cheaper
for them to do

00:16:32.978 --> 00:16:36.180
that than stay in the workforce
and pay for nursing-home fees.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.904
So that is a kind of
work which, right now,

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:40.320
our government
does not recognize.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.650
You've got to go to Burger
King and get a minimum-wage job

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:44.650
and then you're working.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.070
But if you're taking care of
your aging parent at home,

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.910
that doesn't count.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.890
I think that's wrong headed.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.060
I also think education is work.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.810
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Yeah, being a student.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.462
CHRIS HUGHES: So
being a student is--

00:16:58.462 --> 00:17:01.560
I was on financial aid.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.540
It's always hard to do
the counterfactuals,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.450
but I didn't drop out
of school to go work

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.329
on Facebook full time.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:15.108
I didn't even really
have that as an option.

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:17.430
It wasn't like I was going
to move out to Palo Alto

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.659
and work at Starbucks during
the day and then at night--

00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:22.200
I mean, people do,
but that was not--

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.940
I was going to--

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.940
I liked college.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.859
I liked the opportunities.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.710
So I decided to stay in school.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.960
But I think a lot
of college students

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.360
today already have
a guaranteed income.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.110
It's just--

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.690
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Mom and dad.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.360
CHRIS HUGHES: --provided
by mom and dad, exactly.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.080
And there are a lot
of people who don't.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.770
And so that is how structural
classism and the racism

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.720
that overlaps with
that I think do

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.700
get passed down
generation by generation

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.720
when some people
don't have to work.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.053
They can just focus on their
grades and get good grades,

00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:53.610
get a good job, et cetera.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.370
So I think we should take,
to get to your question,

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.330
I think we should take a very
broad definition of work,

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.490
not the kind of cynical
work requirements

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.700
that end up cropping up in a
lot of political discussions

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.670
but instead say, if
you're doing something

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.690
for your family or
your community--

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.310
which I think is
effectively everyone--

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.614
then you shouldn't
live in poverty.

00:18:16.614 --> 00:18:18.780
JACQUELLINE FULLER: You
touched on just a minute ago

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.170
how a lot of folks, especially
from sort of Silicon Valley,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.220
are coming UBI through
the lens of fear

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.880
around evolving nature
of work, automation, rise

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.500
of the robots, whatnot.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.280
But that's not your perspective.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.660
That's not the doorway
through which you walk

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.920
to get to a guaranteed income.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.120
CHRIS HUGHES: It
makes sense to me

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.274
why people are
extremely concerned

00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:50.190
about artificial
intelligence and the changing

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.370
nature of work.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.110
I'm just focused on
the here and now today.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.820
And we already know that
automation and globalization

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.670
have torn jobs apart in America.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:08.100
In the past decade according
to Princeton economists,

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.070
94% of the jobs that
have been created

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.750
have been part time,
contract, or temporary.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.760
So in other words they've
been fundamentally unstable.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.330
So yes, there is work, and
yes unemployment is low.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.490
However, if people don't have
fundamental economic stability

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.090
in their lives, they
live on the brink.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.870
And we know a lot from
psychological evidence

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.739
about the stress that that
introduces, which we can talk

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.030
more about if it's of interest.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:46.320
So I'm very much inspired
by the idea of a UBI

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.230
that provides everybody--

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.240
I mean, not just people who
are making $50,000 or less

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.900
but everybody the kind
of financial security

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.640
that they deserve.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.160
I mean particularly
in a world where

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.810
there's mass technical
unemployment, that, I think,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:10.200
is something very
serious to think through.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.840
I just don't want us to
hang out and wait for 2040.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.680
I think we need to
make a down payment.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.250
We can and should make
a down payment today

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.190
in modernizing the
Earned Income Tax Credit,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.147
making it monthly, creating
a kind of guaranteed income

00:20:26.147 --> 00:20:26.980
for a lot of people.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.830
And then if and when jobs
are wiped out wholesale,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.390
then we have a
framework in place.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.140
And it's much easier, just
like with Social Security,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.660
it started small and then
got expanded over time.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.400
Similar idea, let's start in a
more modest way than a true UBI

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.930
and build over time as
the challenges arise.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.680
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I
want to just pick up

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.810
on something you just mentioned,
which was the immense stress

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.550
and strain that
comes from living

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.180
from paycheck to paycheck and
at the margins financially.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.670
If you don't mind, I'll
just read some of the data

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.810
that you put in your book.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.840
So there is an experiment
done where there were

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.420
poor and well-off participants.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.060
And they scored equally
well on an intelligence test

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.410
beforehand.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.210
And then they were
asked what they

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.490
would do if they had
to deal with $300

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:23.190
of unexpected expenses, and
then given an intelligence test.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:28.160
And it stayed about the same.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.000
Then they changed and
said, OK, well how

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.320
about if you had $3,000
in unexpected expenses?

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.880
And the IQ for the
well-off participants

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.560
didn't drop in the next test,
but for the poor participants

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.610
it dropped 15%, just because
if you think about their brain

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.800
having been primed and
immediately just needing

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.750
to deal with that
stress and that anxiety

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.110
and thinking about it even
in just a theoretical way

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.780
and how much that
affected their decisions.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.610
I was telling Chris
beforehand, there's

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.010
a book that's been making
its rounds around Google.org

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:10.530
and the Grow with Google teams
called "White Working Class"

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.380
by Joan Williams, which is
a great complement, I think,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.050
to this book because
just taking us

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.962
through some of the realities
of class and structure.

00:22:19.962 --> 00:22:21.420
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah,
and while we're

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.420
in the business of recommending
other books, the other book

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.880
that is on this topic too that--

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.470
well, this one, but
I was going to say

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.350
it's another book called
"Scarcity" by Sendhil

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:37.800
Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir
who have written-- it's

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.770
an incredibly
well-documented book.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.660
I chose this one study to cite
in my book from their book,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.660
but it's full of stuff--

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.950
I mean, they go through--

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.400
specifically it studies
the effect of scarcity

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.440
on the brain in
decision-making power.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.090
They make some
positive arguments.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.394
When we have scarce time,
it can be good for us.

00:22:57.394 --> 00:22:59.310
If you only have 10
minutes left in a meeting,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.710
everybody all of a sudden
zeros in if there's still

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.010
stuff to get done and
puts everything aside.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:12.350
But it's often very
destructive to the brain too.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.040
And they look at the
study that I cite,

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.539
which is in a New Jersey mall,
but they go to the developing

00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:18.780
world too and what
it's like in the period

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.160
before harvest for people
who are living hand

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.120
to mouth and then
the period after.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.100
So consistently what I think,
taking a step back, what we see

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:37.150
is that poverty actually has
a physical effect on the body

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.770
and a very real effect
on the brain as well.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.520
There are some folks out there
who are studying, specifically

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.290
for children who are
raised in poverty,

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.160
there is some reason to believe
that the brains are actually

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.450
wired differently
than for families

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.710
who are not in poverty.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:04.870
So we tend to think, well, poor
people, why can't they just--

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.820
when I say we, many people
tend to think poor people,

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.400
why can't they
just figure it out?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.360
Why can't they just--

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.530
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Why
don't they just go to school?

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.610
CHRIS HUGHES: Why don't
just go to school?

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:12.882
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Why don't they

00:24:12.882 --> 00:24:14.048
just invest in their future?

00:24:14.048 --> 00:24:16.720
CHRIS HUGHES: I did it, so
they should be able to do that.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.470
And there are
fundamental, I think,

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.495
questions about, OK,
with what resources?

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:25.930
To go back to school
let's say, you've

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.780
got to be able to pay
$1,000 for the tuition

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.206
at a community college.

00:24:30.206 --> 00:24:32.830
You've got to be able to make up
for the lost hours for the job

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:33.580
that you don't have.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:33.980
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
You have to get there.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.870
CHRIS HUGHES: You've got
to be able to get there

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.119
with gas money and you've
got to figure out childcare.

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:39.580
Which by the way, the
costs are skyrocketing.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.954
And so it's like
well, clearly people

00:24:41.954 --> 00:24:43.120
should just be in education.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.370
That's not to mention
that when you show up

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.387
for class at 7:00 PM, which
is connecting to the point,

00:24:48.387 --> 00:24:50.470
psychologically there's
every evidence to believe,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.190
because you have been juggling
8 million things all day,

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.390
you actually may be--

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.670
you know, we all
know our moments

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.952
and our days when our mental
bandwidth is less and so much

00:25:01.952 --> 00:25:03.160
of it's already been used up.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.070
So it's so easy to say,
well, people should just

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.500
be able to take advantage
of opportunities.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.650
But I think we have to have
a little bit more of a--

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.230
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
So your argument is--

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.660
CHRIS HUGHES: --nuts and bolts
conversation about how it work.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.710
JACQUELLINE FULLER: --giving
folks at least enough

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.134
of a floor to stand on--

00:25:16.134 --> 00:25:17.050
CHRIS HUGHES: Exactly.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.090
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
--to help them.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:22.064
So stepping back a bit, and
I'm going to ask just a few

00:25:22.064 --> 00:25:23.980
more questions and then
we're going to open up

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.240
the mic for live question.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.270
And I think we have some
on the Dory as well,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.870
but the Dory is not working yet.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.354
But we'll get there.

00:25:31.354 --> 00:25:32.770
All right, so
stepping back a bit,

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.840
so last year was defined
by a growing "techlash".

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.270
So as a tech founder
yourself and someone

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.450
who thinks a lot about
inequality, what do you think

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.640
is the role of tech
companies like Google?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.090
CHRIS HUGHES: Top line I
think that the skepticism

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.480
about the role of companies
like Google or Facebook

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.670
is going to be healthy
in the long term.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.740
I think it's overdue.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.610
We've talked a lot
about the opportunities

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.390
that companies like this
one and Facebook provide,

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.660
which has been important
and constructive.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.870
We have not talked enough
about the responsibilities

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:15.610
that companies like
Google and Facebook have.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.795
And I think that there
are responsibilities

00:26:18.795 --> 00:26:21.622
that it's possible to talk
about at the company level,

00:26:21.622 --> 00:26:23.080
and then there are
responsibilities

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.070
that it's possible to talk about
at the level of individuals

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.790
and leadership.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.980
So Facebook in particular is
going through in the first set,

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:39.070
on the company side, although
Google too, to some extent,

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:44.780
on making sure people hear
people that they disagree with.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.460
Don't just log on and have
the filter bubble problem.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.450
Certainly make sure
that there's room

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:57.680
for healthy debate of
political kinds of issues,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.917
that it's not just about
entertainment and ads.

00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:04.750
And definitely make
sure that foreign powers

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.110
can't hack our elections.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.450
Wherever you fall and
however you interpret

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.600
what happened in 2016,
everybody I think

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.690
should agree that there is
an immense responsibility

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.290
on the part of companies to
make sure that nothing like that

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.410
happens again, and on
the part of government.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.230
Which to be honest, in some ways
I worry more about government

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.870
because I'm not, unfortunately,
convinced our elections

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.560
are as secure as we think.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.500
But the companies, I think,
are owning that responsibility.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.090
Then on that level
of individuals--

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.800
and just speaking
on economic issues--

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.060
that's where I think we
all have a responsibility

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.450
to talk about the way
the economy is working

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.640
and the opportunities
that people

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.490
like the ones in this room have
and what that does or doesn't

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.990
mean for the people
who make your lives,

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.080
our lives all possible.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.230
So it's fun to talk
about a UBI in 2040,

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.700
and I want to do that more.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.315
But let's not forget that--

00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:11.940
and not just on the
guaranteed income--

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.270
guaranteed income, health care
for all, higher minimum wage.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.730
Let's just not forget
that these things matter

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.757
immensely in the here and now.

00:28:21.757 --> 00:28:23.340
And with that comes
the responsibility

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.660
for all of us to figure out.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.060
We all have different
ways of engaging,

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.677
but I think we all
need to be more.

00:28:29.677 --> 00:28:31.093
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
All right, I'm

00:28:31.093 --> 00:28:32.400
going to ask one last question.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.500
Then we'll open it up,
if folks want to start

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.000
moving towards the mic.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.760
So switching topics, I think
one of my favorite parts

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.200
about the book was your
incredibly humble and honest

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.084
discussion about your experience
at "The New Republic".

00:28:47.084 --> 00:28:49.250
I know you were hoping I
was going to bring that up.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.530
CHRIS HUGHES: I'd love to.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.430
I think it's important to talk
about failures and successes

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.930
alike.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.513
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
If you could just,

00:28:54.513 --> 00:28:56.650
for folks who don't
know the summary,

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.440
maybe just tell a little
bit about that experience,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.880
and then also how it's tied to
this very pragmatic approach

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.460
that you just talked about,
the here and now, taking

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.640
positive steps forward.

00:29:08.565 --> 00:29:11.190
CHRIS HUGHES: So after Facebook
I went and worked for President

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.550
Obama for a couple years
on the '08 campaign.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:21.090
Then in 2012 I ended
up buying a magazine

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:28.830
called "The New Republic",
for multiple reasons.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.950
The most important one
was I really believe

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.500
in the power of journalism
to not just hold

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.190
the people in power accountable
but to create a more civilized

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.110
educated discourse
in our country,

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.420
and specifically the
kinds of journalism

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.150
that "The New Republic"
had historically done.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.370
Those of you who might not
know "The New Republic"--

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.610
some of you might-- but it's
sort of in the category of "New

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:54.074
Yorker" or "Economist", these
kinds of magazines that--

00:29:54.074 --> 00:29:55.740
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Long-thought pieces.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.740
CHRIS HUGHES: Long-m form
journalism, thoughtful pieces.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.290
"New Republic" always had a
little bit more of an edge,

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.370
but it was a kind of journalism
that I wanted and continue

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:10.290
to want to try to support,
and I think particularly

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.550
in a time of
transition, needed it.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.760
I did come in guns
blazing though.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.680
So after Facebook and Obama--

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.305
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
I think a lot of us

00:30:18.305 --> 00:30:19.530
have that tendency maybe.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.696
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah, probably
in rooms like this one.

00:30:21.696 --> 00:30:25.260
I wanted to figure
out not just how

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.590
to bring the journalism to new
audiences of millions, tens

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.020
of millions, but also how to
find a sustainable business

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.460
model right for long-form,
highbrow kind of journalism.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.800
So we hired a lot of people.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.760
I invested a lot of money,
millions of dollars.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.590
We got bigger offices, and we
just did all of these things.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.705
Whatever you think we were
doing with the big ambitions,

00:30:51.705 --> 00:30:54.510
we were probably doing.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.830
And then over the
course of several years,

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.352
we weren't getting any traction.

00:31:01.352 --> 00:31:02.310
We weren't selling ads.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.350
I talk a little bit
in the book about what

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:05.225
we were trying to do.

00:31:05.225 --> 00:31:07.630
The subscription numbers,
they bounced up a little bit.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:14.490
But we were hitting
a wall in many ways.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:20.760
And my own desire to broaden the
audience of "The New Republic",

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.930
I had a hard time
communicating how

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.180
we were going to do that and
hold onto the values that

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.846
made it special.

00:31:25.846 --> 00:31:27.930
So anyway, what
ended up happening is

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.800
I learned the hard way that
"The New Republic" had always

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.710
been a small print magazine with
a circulation of about 35,000.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.110
It had never turned a profit.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.840
I think once in the '80s it
did and they bought pizza

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.390
and then it wasn't
a profit anymore.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.830
So it had always effectively
been a nonprofit dressed up

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.510
as a company.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.780
And you know, it
was OK that it was

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.190
for a small, select audience.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:58.320
It wasn't going to reach
tens of millions of people

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.170
and be the next
"New York Times".

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:06.540
So I learned that, in
some ways the hard way.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.850
And I talk a little
bit about in the book,

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.650
I wish that we had made
much more modest investments

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.770
and really starting from
a very different place.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.300
So the reason all of this is
relevant to the work I do now

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.930
is because I think before
"The New Republic" experience

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:28.530
I would have been of the
type to say, UBI or bust.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:30.570
You know, it's got to
be go big, go home.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.845
You've got to like really--

00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:33.390
JACQUELLINE FULLER: We call
those moonshots around here.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.410
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:39.970
And clearly I'm still very
much inspired by that idea.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.820
Those values are the reason
why I work on what I work on.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:49.090
However, I have no issues in
having a more modest approach,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:53.560
because I think that embracing
$500 a month for everybody

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:59.050
who makes $50,000 or less is
not necessarily the end goal.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.010
It is an important
place to start.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.280
There's been a couple
articles that say, oh, this

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.960
is too modest.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.940
Here I'm a follower rather
than a leader on the issue.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:19.930
And if creating a space to
try something modest is--

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.270
in my view, that's
exactly where I

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.430
want to be is building
that bridge, if you will,

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:28.150
to the future
rather than letting

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:34.390
the ideal make the
short-term gains impossible.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.657
So that's how it's relevant
to work I'm doing now.

00:33:38.657 --> 00:33:40.990
JACQUELLINE FULLER: All right,
let's take our questions.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.260
Do you want to share your
name with your question?

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.350
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.420
My name's Max.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.166
Thanks for coming.

00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:49.540
So it seems like
your plan really

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.200
focuses on the national
version of the EITC.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.200
A lot of states, including
California, have EITCs as well.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.817
And we expanded ours recently.

00:33:58.817 --> 00:34:01.150
Few people know actually that
San Francisco and New York

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:01.660
also--

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.643
New York City-- also
have very small EITCs.

00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:07.082
San Francisco's has
been cut in the past.

00:34:07.082 --> 00:34:08.540
And I think there's
an opportunity.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.797
We have a mayor election and a
general election in November.

00:34:11.797 --> 00:34:13.630
I'm curious if you think
there's opportunity

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.630
to advance those kind of
problems on a more local level

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.589
as well.

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:19.630
CHRIS HUGHES: Absolutely.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.250
It's a short answer.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.790
I do talk a lot about a
national policy in the book.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:29.440
And it's only been six months
since I finished the book.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.679
But I would, if I can rewrite
the book in real time,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.719
I would spend more time with
the kinds of near-term things

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.550
that can be done,
because I definitely

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.280
don't want people
to think we've got

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.840
to just go national or go home.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.980
So there are EITCs,
earned income tax credits,

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.592
in the states.

00:34:48.592 --> 00:34:50.800
And by the way, even though
it's called a tax credit,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.920
the way that's experienced
is people just get cash.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.920
Tens of millions of Americans
just get a check in the mail.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.480
And it's because
it's refundable,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.972
which means that it's lived as
a kind of annual influx of cash.

00:35:03.972 --> 00:35:05.680
So in the book I make
the case for making

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.440
it monthly, the bigger
definition of work,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.957
and also making
it flat so people

00:35:09.957 --> 00:35:11.040
know what they're getting.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.922
Right now it's
very hard to know.

00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:14.380
You can get different
amounts where

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.796
you live, the size
of your family,

00:35:15.796 --> 00:35:17.350
how much money you
made, et cetera.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:21.320
So there's a lot to be
done in the short term.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.550
So cities absolutely
can lead the way--

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:29.260
San Francisco, New York,
Mayor Michael Tubbs,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.150
who is in Stockton, California.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.660
If you guys don't know
this guy, go google him,

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.140
because he's the youngest mayor
of a major city in the United

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:39.640
States.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.590
And he's 27 now.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.360
He is a phenomenal leader.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.380
He is running a
demonstration with the group

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.750
that I co-run, Economic
Security Project,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:53.980
to provide a guaranteed
income to people there.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.220
We invite more people to talk
about what's going on there,

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.716
love to go to Stockton together.

00:35:58.716 --> 00:35:59.590
There's so much work.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.180
So really if people
are interested in that,

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.096
I'd love to talk more.

00:36:02.096 --> 00:36:05.110
JACQUELLINE FULLER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.120
CHRIS HUGHES: Y Combinator
is doing a study.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.370
So there's a lot
on the city level,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.050
and there's a lot
of state level too.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.030
EITCs do exist at a state level.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.940
I think the key is not
just making them bigger--

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.090
sure, that's important--
but really modernizing them.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:23.320
So the key challenge I think
in the gig economy of today

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.890
is the fundamental
instability of income.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.580
And so providing it monthly,
even if it's only a couple

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:35.200
hundred dollars, can,
in my conversations,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.377
really provide
important stability.

00:36:38.377 --> 00:36:40.210
So there's work to be
done at a state level,

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.840
and then in the long term
at the federal level too.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.570
But there's no shortage of
places to roll up our sleeves

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.310
and get going.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:47.899
Thanks.

00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:50.440
JACQUELLINE FULLER: All right,
from the Dory, So in your book

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.300
you recognize that
philanthropy alone can't

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.555
support a guaranteed income.

00:36:53.555 --> 00:36:55.930
Quote, "All of the money that
billionaires have committed

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.430
through the Giving
Pledge would only

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.969
fund a guaranteed income
for a single year."

00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:02.010
So what's the most helpful
role that philanthropy

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.260
can play to advance this idea?

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.009
CHRIS HUGHES: Philanthropy
can do so much.

00:37:05.009 --> 00:37:06.610
So it's important
to say, it's not

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.620
like we can fund the guaranteed
income through philanthropy.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.360
So I make that
point in the book.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.400
But there is a real need
for more philanthropy

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.320
in this space.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.480
A lot of people talk about UBI.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.630
And I've been working on
this for several years now,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:28.700
and there's a lot of talk
and a lot of interest.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.060
There's not as much
money as you would think.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.329
Fortunately Google.org
is helping us,

00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:34.870
not necessarily, I
think, through UBI

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.670
but thinking through
the way the EITC

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:40.150
can adapt to the
future of work today.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.240
But I think that we
need a lot more people

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.560
to invest in this space.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.260
So for instance, we have
a match out for Stockton

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.140
where we funded the beginnings
of the guaranteed income pilot

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:54.640
there.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.070
There is a lot more funding
there that is required.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:59.500
We need research.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.420
You know, I'm not an economist.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.930
I do love economics, but we
need think tanks thinking

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:06.560
through how to do this.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.440
We need to talk about,
there are other ways

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.398
to attack this problem.

00:38:09.398 --> 00:38:12.160
You could put a tax on carbon
and distribute the revenue

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.480
as a dividend.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.976
You could think about a
financial transaction tax.

00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:17.350
You could think
about all kinds--

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.020
So there's so much
need for philanthropy

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.260
to catalyze and develop
the conversation.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.320
And part of what
I do every day is

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.940
to talk with people who
are interested about this,

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.810
to move it.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:36.340
It's just not the way that we
can fund it in the long term.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.000
Literally if you took all
the money from the Giving

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.800
Pledge combined, it would fund
a guaranteed income for a year,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.730
and then be gone.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.195
So powerful--
however, public policy

00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:49.570
has to be the
long-term solution.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.570
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Focus
on the catalytic work.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.594
Let the government--

00:38:52.594 --> 00:38:54.010
CHRIS HUGHES:
There's no other way

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.078
the numbers add up without it.

00:38:56.078 --> 00:38:57.910
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Great.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.260
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your talk.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.140
You defended the
work requirement

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.390
a little bit ago
early on in the talk

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.940
by saying that
people want to work.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.470
If they want to work, why
have a work requirement?

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.470
CHRIS HUGHES: I think,
well, a couple of things.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.760
So the way work requirements
as a phrase is used

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.310
is usually somewhat
cynically to try

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.432
to throw people off of rolls.

00:39:22.432 --> 00:39:24.640
I'm much more interested in
expanding the definition.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.990
I have found in my own work,
in my own work and economics

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:33.280
community project, people don't
understand the idea of cash

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.550
unless it's in some kind
of symbiotic context.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.610
So by that I mean--

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.600
I'll take my parents
as a good example.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.897
Like my dad, particularly
in the early days,

00:39:43.897 --> 00:39:44.980
he's like, I don't get it.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.690
You just get cash?

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.310
Why do I get it?

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.210
Where does it come from?

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.840
Is it going to keep
coming or does it run out?

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.840
And am I going to have
to pay for it eventually?

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:01.690
And my dad's a pretty smart
guy, and it just conceptually

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:02.480
didn't make sense.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.030
Similarly, I've been
in North Carolina,

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.910
in Mississippi, and in
California and Alaska,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.170
all across the country.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:15.430
And people really
struggle to understand

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.040
the idea of just manna
from heaven, cash

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.290
that comes from the clouds.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.590
However, if you say
you are struggling

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:27.760
to make ends meet in
some way and you deserve

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.440
to have economic
opportunity and cash

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.250
can provide that, you go from
having a group where it's

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.950
furrowed eyebrows,
confusion, I don't get it,

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.520
I don't support it, to
people being like, yeah,

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.480
that is fundamentally what
the American dream is about.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.340
So in my view, the
conversation about work

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:54.010
is really a way to recognize
what everyone is already doing

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:58.180
and a way to invite people into
understanding why we should not

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.970
have poverty in
the United States

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.430
or why we should provide
economic opportunity

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.340
through cash.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:09.580
And in my own experience, it
has moved the needle so much

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:15.100
and made the whole idea of
cash much more understandable

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.730
and approachable.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.240
And so I think it's really
an asset for those of us

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.494
who believe in the power of
cash to use in the long term.

00:41:22.494 --> 00:41:23.410
AUDIENCE: So politics.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:24.140
Thank you.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.580
CHRIS HUGHES: Say it again?

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.020
AUDIENCE: I said, so politics.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.800
CHRIS HUGHES: No.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.700
No, wait, come back, because
that's not what I'm saying.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.070
AUDIENCE: Well I mean--

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:30.910
CHRIS HUGHES: No,
no, conceptually--

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.159
AUDIENCE: --as opposed to a
negative income tax, which

00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:36.542
I think is as easy
to explain but you

00:41:36.542 --> 00:41:37.750
have a harder time defending.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.027
And when you get into
the work requirement

00:41:40.027 --> 00:41:41.485
you have to deal
with, what is work

00:41:41.485 --> 00:41:45.940
and how do you get all of
those untraditional jobs

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.000
like caregiving
to be recognized?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.500
And if you skip over that, you
don't have to deal with that.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.840
So you're taking on
a logistic, and I

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.390
guess you're arguing that it
has some explanatory power

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.190
to do that.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:57.606
CHRIS HUGHES: No,
well two things.

00:41:57.606 --> 00:42:02.590
I think there's
conceptual clarity.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.630
I mean, politics is
one route, and that

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.980
is sort of what's sitting--

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.010
that's not actually so much
what I'm interested in.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.650
I would challenge
you to ask people--

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:17.210
I was in a public housing
outside of Jackson, Mississippi

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.030
two weeks ago.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:25.000
And ask people what they
think of a UBI or cash.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.432
It's such a foreign concept.

00:42:28.432 --> 00:42:29.890
Whereas if you talk
about a monthly

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.210
earned income tax credit--

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.940
many of them were single moms--
that recognizes what they were

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.530
doing--

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.390
I'm not there to sell
the idea to them.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.000
I was there to be in
conversation to figure out

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.840
if it could be useful.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.330
It makes a conceptual clarity
that opens the opportunity

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:50.420
to have the dialogue with
people in the first place,

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:56.097
not market it as a
kind of political idea.

00:42:56.097 --> 00:42:56.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.805
CHRIS HUGHES: Thanks.

00:42:59.396 --> 00:43:00.520
AUDIENCE: I'm David Bourne.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.270
I work in consumer
hardware sustainability

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.330
with my colleague Anna.

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.322
So I've, I think,
personally come

00:43:06.322 --> 00:43:08.530
to largely the same conclusion
you have about the way

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.770
to proceed on this issue.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.070
But I wanted to ask
you about, is there

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:14.366
room to evaluate
the role of what

00:43:14.366 --> 00:43:15.490
it means to be an employer?

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.020
What is truly a contract?

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.760
What should be an employee?

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.900
What's core versus context?

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.480
Even at Google I think we all
sit next to a bunch of TVCs

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.510
and we wonder, oh, I thought
they were an employee.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.450
So is there room to
redefine the role of what

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.510
it means to be an
employer and avoid some

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.210
of the instability you talked
about with the contracting gig

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.970
economy?

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.200
CHRIS HUGHES: I think so.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.970
There's an important
conversation

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.700
to be had about what's
the relationship

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.770
between an employer
and employee.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:51.570
When is contracting
really contracting?

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.580
When does it not smell--

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.730
not smell exactly-- right,
like when is the relationship

00:43:56.730 --> 00:44:00.430
actually really different?

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.320
I'm very interested in the
expanded definition of work,

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.770
though, that brings in so many
of these people who aren't even

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.250
in contracting relationships.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.730
So for me it's like
if you're on payroll

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.320
or if you're part
of the gig economy

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.810
or if you're doing some kind
of work that isn't recognized,

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:21.570
then that shouldn't
be all recognized

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:25.180
as a kind of work of sorts.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.430
It's the way we talk about it.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:31.950
So in terms of the opportunity
to redefine that relationship,

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.560
I think that's an important
thing that we need to do too,

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.631
but it's a little bit
out of area of expertise.

00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:41.880
JACQUELLINE FULLER: We'll
do a quick one from the Dory

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.280
and then we'll get yours.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.190
So here's a question
about the phaseout.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.250
So your program
would give $6,000

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.950
a year to people earning
a little bit less

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:56.490
than $50,000 and $0 to
people earning $50,001.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.000
First of all, is that right?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.830
And then are you concerned
about work disincentives

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:01.830
arising from this cliff?

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:02.680
CHRIS HUGHES: No.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.180
With all of these things we
have to have some kind of cliff.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.840
So cliff is the
policy term so that

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:12.210
when you don't have this
weird perversion of employers

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.040
paying $50,001 or $49,000.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.930
So we worked with the Institute
for Taxation and Economic

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.750
Policy to think through
all of these numbers.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.390
And one of the key things is
figuring out exactly where

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:25.980
does that cliff begin?

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.100
Does it begin at $48,000?

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.320
Does it begin at $47,000?

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.630
Does it begin further on down
and how far down does it go?

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.680
So the numbers that I had for
the book are, in many ways,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.920
a first kind of
provocative attempt

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.930
to get the conversation started.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.810
And then one of the things
that, thanks to the support

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.680
of Google.org, that Economic
Security Project is doing

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.380
is literally answering this
exact kind of question.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.960
How steep should the cliff be?

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.390
Had this idea of
moving $50,000 around

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.910
so it's different in
California versus Mississippi,

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.290
for instance.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.940
How would you factor
in cost of living?

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.690
There are a lot of even more
granular technical kinds

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.320
of questions.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.950
But my hope with the book
was to invite more people

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.480
into the conversation
so we can have

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.160
more minds thinking about it.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.920
But I do think $50,000
is not, by any means,

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.320
an arbitrary kind of number.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.615
It's very much where
I think we can afford

00:46:25.615 --> 00:46:27.240
and I think it captures
a lot of people

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.850
who are in the lower-middle
class right now

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.360
who technically aren't in
poverty under the statistics

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.227
but who often can dip into
it and then dip out of it.

00:46:38.227 --> 00:46:40.560
JACQUELLINE FULLER: And you
can fix the marriage penalty

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.755
that way too.

00:46:41.755 --> 00:46:43.380
CHRIS HUGHES: Well
the marriage penalty

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.450
is a big question, right?

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.210
One of the things that I
really believe in strongly

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.110
and one of the virtues of
a UBI and the conversation

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.960
is that every adult gets it.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.950
And we add all these UBI
experiments in the '70s,

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.510
and there was a sense
that in one of them,

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.990
in the Seattle experiments,
that divorce rates went up.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.530
And at the time it made
people skeptical of it.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:17.539
But now from our
vantage point a lot

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:19.330
of people, particularly
women, say well no,

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.940
that's indicative of a
sense that people could

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.610
exit relationships they
really didn't want to be in,

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.530
because they knew that
on the other side of it

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:27.310
they would have some
financial security.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:29.018
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Yeah, some stability.

00:47:29.018 --> 00:47:31.520
CHRIS HUGHES: So I do
think that this should

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.350
be on a per capita basis,
on a per-person basis

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:39.160
to really embrace the
individual freedom for people

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.750
to be able to deal with.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.050
We have all kinds of marriage
penalties and allowances

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.000
in the tax code now.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.210
And this would, when and
if we get to a moment

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:53.847
when this is being actually
implemented at a federal level,

00:47:53.847 --> 00:47:55.680
then I think we have
to think about how it's

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.888
going to interact with those.

00:47:56.888 --> 00:47:58.720
But the fundamental
value that I do

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.980
think is important to hold on
to is that everybody gets it.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.880
It's recognizable.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.810
It's the same amount.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.690
And you have it
even if you decide

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:12.778
you want to leave a
relationship that isn't working.

00:48:12.778 --> 00:48:14.325
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Krishna.

00:48:14.325 --> 00:48:16.440
Sorry, I haven't
read the book yet.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.280
You probably have
the answer there.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.430
What is the international
comparison for this?

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:27.720
Is there any developed countries
that have something like UBI,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.539
and how are they raising
money in terms of taxation,

00:48:31.539 --> 00:48:33.330
and how are they
distributing the money, is

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.100
the right initial comparison.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.000
CHRIS HUGHES: So there are a lot
of countries thinking about it,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.770
but no country that really
has a long-term guaranteed

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:45.600
income for now.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.460
But we're in a moment.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.590
This idea is old.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.102
It's been around
hundreds of years.

00:48:50.102 --> 00:48:52.560
But it tends to come in these
patterns where lots of people

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.840
pay attention to it and then it
fades and then it comes back.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.860
We're in one of these.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.230
We're on the upswing.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.780
Finland has a big experiment.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.160
Ontario up in Canada has
an enormous $100 million,

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.030
the biggest one.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.380
GiveDirectly is running
a pilot in Kenya.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:17.070
The idea is being explored
in a really serious way.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:21.870
But it's still on the
forefront of where we are.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.370
So the short answer
to your question

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:26.010
is no, no country right now.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.550
Iran has a small one that was
established, but inflation

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.240
has taken it so far
that it's minimized it

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.440
so significantly that
it doesn't really--

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.740
AUDIENCE: How about Alaska
with their oil checks

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.210
or something, dividends?

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:46.970
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah, up in
Alaska we have something close.

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.879
There's a guaranteed check.

00:49:49.879 --> 00:49:51.420
It's not so much a
guaranteed income.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.160
Every year every Alaskan
gets $1,500, which is huge.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:00.241
If you have a family of
four, every Alaskan--

00:50:00.241 --> 00:50:01.740
if you have a family
of four, you're

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:05.370
getting a check in October
of $6,000 every year.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.120
So if you think
about median incomes,

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.570
that's a boost of about 10%.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.070
So imagine whatever you make,
getting an extra check of 10%.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:16.560
It's meaningful.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:20.670
And we know some about
what people do with it.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.406
We certainly know
that people love it.

00:50:23.406 --> 00:50:26.970
They don't have an income
tax or a sales tax up there.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.750
Alaskans would rather pay a
sales tax by a factor of two

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:33.600
to one than see their
Permanent Fund dividend--

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.600
that's what it's called--

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.300
disappear.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.020
So it's very powerful.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.729
It was started by a Republican
governor 40 years ago.

00:50:42.729 --> 00:50:44.520
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
It's funded out of oil.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.478
CHRIS HUGHES: It's funded
out of oil royalties.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.789
It's a fantastic
reference point.

00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:55.080
JACQUELLINE FULLER: And no
one thinks of it as welfare.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.955
They just think about
it as their entitlement

00:50:56.955 --> 00:50:58.110
because they are Alaskans.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.730
CHRIS HUGHES: Yeah, it's
a common inheritance.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:00.229
They do.

00:51:00.229 --> 00:51:02.271
Yeah, that's right.

00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:08.569
It's something that everyone
gets and everyone is due.

00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:10.860
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Maybe
we'll take our last question,

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.940
and then Chris might have a few
minutes afterwards for folks.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:13.692
CHRIS HUGHES: Sure, happily.

00:51:13.692 --> 00:51:15.066
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Garrett.

00:51:15.066 --> 00:51:16.840
Thanks for speaking today.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:22.200
The question I had was for
someone that's been successful

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.977
with Facebook, a lot
of folks might say,

00:51:23.977 --> 00:51:26.310
great, this person must know
what they're talking about.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.680
Let's listen to them and
let's hear what sort of policy

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.990
recommendations they have--

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:36.730
and your experience with
the Obama administration.

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.290
The question I have is
how, as a white male

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:46.530
would you, in the United
States, fold in or at least

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.150
overcome some of
that blindnesses

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:51.810
that you would have
to being in that role?

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.790
I mean, certainly you
can make recommendations.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:55.610
You can say, let's
be the academic here.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.657
Let's look at the data.

00:51:56.657 --> 00:51:58.490
But I've also heard
this morning that you've

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.990
talked a lot about I believe
this, I believe that.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:03.840
Those beliefs come
from somewhere.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.240
How do you overcome that
in making those policy

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.462
recommendations when so
many people are listening?

00:52:09.462 --> 00:52:11.670
CHRIS HUGHES: Well I don't
think you ever overcome it

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:15.210
in the sense that we all have
our subjective experiences.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:22.860
And mine, the color of my
skin offers a privilege, which

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.720
we have to be honest about.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.830
Certainly my economic
perspective offers a privilege.

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:29.430
I grew up in a
different setting,

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.540
but it very much does now.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.590
I think the fact that I'm gay
gives me different goggles

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:36.600
to think about the world
and, to some extent,

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.730
about economic issues.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.640
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:46.262
it's only through dialogue and
it's only through the people

00:52:46.262 --> 00:52:48.720
that we support, particularly
through the Economic Security

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.220
Project-- we invest
millions of dollars

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.240
into leaders who
are out there who

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.420
teach me every day from
their perspectives.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.340
And Mayor Tubbs is a
good example of one.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.550
I was mentioning him earlier.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:07.650
He's African American from
a city that is very diverse.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.366
It has not been historically
led by African-American people.

00:53:12.366 --> 00:53:18.200
And the people who are potential
beneficiaries of the program

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.190
come from all different
walks of life,

00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.100
all different races, all
different kinds of backgrounds.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.570
So I think that the
racial dimension

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:29.390
of the economic
injustice in particular

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.850
is so often overlooked.

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:35.940
I mean, 96% of the 1% are white.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:40.700
And if you look at the people
who make $50,000 or less,

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.330
it is significantly more
people of color in that group

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.750
than if you look at the
population as a whole because

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:54.830
of the inherited structures
of racism and classism

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:55.470
in our country.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:59.000
So I think that
without acknowledging

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.960
the importance of the
intersectionality of all

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.110
of these conversations,
none of this

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.640
is ever going to move forward.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.136
Because fundamentally
there's a question,

00:54:07.136 --> 00:54:09.260
I think, at the root of so
much of this work, which

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:13.040
is can you trust people
to be the masters

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.120
of their own destiny?

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.940
And that question
itself is so wrapped up

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.930
with the history of
racism in our country

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:23.510
that we have to have this
conversation ourselves.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:27.440
So I'm up here today and in
general as a spokesperson

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.510
for nobody except myself.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:34.700
And I hope we can cultivate a
group of leaders and conveners

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.560
of these kinds of
conversations who

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.480
come from every walk of life.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:42.230
Because without that, we're
never going to be successful,

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.890
I think, in providing
financial security

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.260
to people who need it most.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.510
JACQUELLINE FULLER: All
right, well let's thank Chris.

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.360
I want to say, he
has a lot of things

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.730
that he could do with
his time and his money,

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.210
and I really respect
that he has decided

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:04.770
to try to make America just
a little bit more equal.

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.140
So let's think Chris Hughes.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.140
CHRIS HUGHES: Thank you.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.690
