00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:05.100
3...2...1.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.567
Narrator: TORY, GRANT,
AND KARI HAVE FOUND THAT

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:10.801
TRYING TO CLOUT YOUR WAY OUT
OF A CASKET "KILL BILL" STYLE

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.567
AIN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:15.667
BUT AS A POTENTIAL FINAL NAIL
IN THIS MYTH'S COFFIN,

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.901
THERE'S ONE LAST PART TO TEST.

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.567
NOW, WE'VE BUSTED
THE PART OF THE MYTH

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:21.200
WHERE YOU CAN PUNCH THROUGH
A CASKET.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.100
BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA
TEST THE PART OF THE MYTH

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.834
THAT IF YOU DID
BUST THROUGH THE CASKET,

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.534
COULD YOU DIG
THROUGH SIX FEET OF DIRT?

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:29.667
SO WHAT I NEED TO DO IS, I NEED
TO RECONFIGURE THIS RIG HERE

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.467
SO THAT WE CAN GET INSIDE OF IT

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.367
AND SAFELY
TRY TO DIG OUR WAY OUT.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.200
Narrator: NOW, IF THE MOVIE
HEROINE WAS SUPERHUMAN

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.567
OR THE COFFIN LID
RIDDLED WITH WOODWORM,

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:41.801
MAYBE SHE COULD HAVE
PUNCHED THROUGH.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.100
AND IF SO,
COULD SHE THEN HAVE ESCAPED?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.367
TO FIND OUT,

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.267
TORY REPLACES THE CASKET LID
WITH A SLIDING HATCH

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:51.634
TO HOLD BACK THE DIRT ABOVE.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.868
ALL RIGHT,
SO THIS IS THE TRAPDOOR.

00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:55.567
IT'S GONNA OPEN LIKE THAT,

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.300
AND THEN WE'LL START
DIGGING OUR WAY OUT.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.267
Narrator: HE'S ALSO BUILT
AN ACRYLIC CASKET,

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:02.567
WITH A SPECIALLY DESIGNED
ESCAPE HATCH

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.601
THAT'S ALL READY
FOR A TRIAL RUN.

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:07.300
SO, THE NEW CASKET'S IN PLACE,
AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO RIGHT NOW

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.467
IS JUST TEST THE TRAPDOOR
AND SEE IF IT'S WORKING.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.367
OHH!

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.467
IT WORKS.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.267
AND I'M OUT SAFELY.

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.033
Narrator:
WELL...SORT OF SAFELY.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:23.534
AAH.
BETTER THAN...DYING.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:26.234
Narrator: MEANWHILE,
GRANT'S GOT THE DIRT ON DIRT.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.901
SO DIRT WEIGHS BETWEEN
65 AND 88 POUNDS PER CUBIC FOOT,

00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.801
AND WE KNOW FROM OUR
"BURIED IN THE SAND" EXPERIMENT

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.734
THAT THOSE TYPES OF PRESSURES
ON YOUR CHEST CAVITY

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.100
CAN GET VERY DANGEROUS
VERY QUICK.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.934
NOW, TRADITIONALLY, CASKETS ARE
BURIED SIX FEET UNDER DIRT.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.067
BUT, FOR SAFETY, WE'RE GONNA
START OUT WITH JUST TWO FEET.

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:46.934
Narrator:
BUT EVEN ONLY TWO FEET UNDER,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.400
KARI, FOR ONE, IS SURE
TORY'S DIGGING HIS OWN GRAVE.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.434
I HAVE A FEELING
THE COFFIN'S GONNA FILL UP

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.667
AND PIN HIM BEFORE HE'S ABLE TO
DIG HIS WAY OUT.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.367
Narrator: SO, PEPPED UP
BY KARI'S CONFIDENCE,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.501
TORY PUTS ON
AN ANTI-CRUSH SUIT...

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.334
THIS OUGHT TO STOP THE DIRT
FROM COMPRESSING MY LUNGS.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:03.934
Narrator:
...AND MOST IMPORTANT,

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:05.634
A FIRE-BRIGADE
BREATHING APPARATUS.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.601
ONE PANICKED LOOK LATER,
AND IT'S "GO" TIME.

00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.033
BE CAREFUL IN THERE.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.968
Narrator: TORY CAREFULLY
SLIDES HIS WAY INTO THE COFFIN

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:20.200
AS HE PREPARES TO LITERALLY
PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.734
YOU READY?
I'M READY.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:23.667
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
OPEN THE DOOR SLOWLY.

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.834
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS SEEMS LIKE A HORRIBLE IDEA.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:28.934
Narrator:
TORY'S BURIAL RITUAL BEGINS.

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:30.367
KARI RELEASES THE TRAPDOOR,

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:34.934
EXACTLY AS IF HE'D BEEN ABLE TO
PUNCH A HOLE IN THAT COFFIN LID.

00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:38.334
THE TRICKLE OF DIRT
BEGINS TO FALL IN ON HIM.

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:40.267
OH, THIS IS FREAKY.

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.133
OKAY, KEEP GOING.
YEAH, KEEP GOING.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.901
Narrator:
KARI OPENS IT WIDER,

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.801
AND IT RAPIDLY
BECOMES AN AVALANCHE,

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.300
AND IT'S PANIC STATIONS BELOW.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.300
[BLEEP]

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.734
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
STOP! STOP!

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:57.467
I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.067
I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:00.667
I'M ALL RIGHT.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.067
Narrator: THE TWO FEET OF DIRT
HAS CAVED IN ON HIM,

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:04.200
BUT THERE'S A BONUS.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.534
IT'S OPENED UP
A RABBIT HOLE ABOVE.

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.000
DAYLIGHT! WHOO!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.934
Narrator:
BUT STILL TRAPPED,

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:16.701
HE PUSHES THE DIRT
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE COFFIN,

00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:19.834
WRIGGLES, AND THEN
SCRAPES HIS WAY UPRIGHT,

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:21.167
AND WITH A MASSIVE EFFORT,

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.434
ACTUALLY TRIUMPHS
IN TUNNELING HIS WAY OUT.

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.534
AHH!

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:29.534
I'M ALIVE!

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.234
Narrator: TORY'S PROVED
THAT AT TWO FEET UNDER,

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.567
ASSUMING YOU COULD
OPEN THE COFFIN LID,

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:37.400
ESCAPE IS JUST CONCEIVABLE.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.234
BUT THE MYTH CALLS FOR
A NORMAL BURIAL.

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:44.534
NOW, OUR NEXT SETUP IS GONNA BE
UNDER THE FULL SIX FEET OF DIRT.

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:46.367
Narrator:
YEP, YOU HEARD RIGHT, FOLKS --

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:49.834
GRANT IS GOING TO BE BURIED
A FULL SIX FEET UNDER.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:53.267
BUT, SO HE DOESN'T DIE,
HIS PLAN IS TO SIT UP,

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:55.267
NOT LIE DOWN, IN THE COFFIN.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.300
OKAY, LET'S PAUSE
FOR KARI'S PREDICTION.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.968
AT FOUR FEET,
IT'S ALL GONNA COLLAPSE DOWN

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:02.767
AND COMPLETELY GO PEAR-SHAPED.

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:05.000
OKAY, KARI,
GO AHEAD.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.868
Narrator: KARI AT LAST
"DISHES THE DIRT" ON GRANT.

00:04:07.868 --> 00:04:09.701
KEEP GOING.

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:13.133
Narrator: THOUSANDS OF POUNDS
OF SOIL SLITHER SOUTH.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:15.367
OKAY, STOP! STOP!

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:18.267
Narrator:
...AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
GRANT'S BURIED TO THE NECK,

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:19.567
UNABLE TO MOVE,

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.834
AT LEAST UNTIL THE RIG BREAKS
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.801
IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT
IF GRANT HAD BEEN LYING DOWN,

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:26.834
HE'D BE DEAD.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:30.234
WELL, I GUESS
THAT WORKED WELL.

00:04:30.234 --> 00:04:33.234
YEAH, I THINK
THAT PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP.

00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:35.767
Narrator:
THE AIR TUNNEL THAT TORY USED

00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:37.667
NEVER OPENED UP FOR GRANT,

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.467
AND THAT MEANT
ESCAPE WAS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
