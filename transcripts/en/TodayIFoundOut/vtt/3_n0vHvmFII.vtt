00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.230
Ivory has been producing their uniquely floating
soap for the well over a century now and in

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.410
that time they’ve become one of the most
popular soap brands in the world.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.980
For many years, the company has maintained
that the discovery of its trademark floating

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.710
soap was a complete accident, but exactly
how true is this?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.919
For those of you who aren’t familiar with
Ivory brand soap, in a nutshell its two key

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:34.020
selling points are that it is incredibly pure
(99.44% pure) and that it floats, making it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.309
superior to all other kinds of soap because
you don’t need to grope around on the bottom

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.089
of the bath to find it.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.019
These two traits have made Ivory soap one
of the most popular and enduring brands and

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.149
both features have been played up to by the
company itself in its advertising for almost

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.710
as long as it has existed.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.041
If anyone is curious about why Ivory soap
floats, the soap is produced in such a way

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:04.089
as to ensure air is whipped into the soap
mixture before it sets; as a result, the final

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.440
product contains numerous tiny air bubbles
which work together to make the soap ever

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.450
so slightly less dense than water, allowing
it to float.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.100
These air bubbles also serve a dual function
of making the soap produce a more consistent

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.670
and bubbly lather when used, another fact
the company has historically drawn attention

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.110
to in its advertising.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.289
Something you can easily see for yourself
by popping a bar of Ivory into your microwave;

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.590
you know, for science.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.330
As for how this discovery came about, for
over a century, Ivory has insisted that the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.049
invention of floating soap was a happy accident
that occurred as a result of an unnamed employee

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.979
accidentally leaving a batch of soap mixture
to mix for too long while he was on his lunch

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.979
break.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.979
The story continues that when the employee
returned and realised his mistake, he reasoned

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.280
that since nothing new had been added to the
mixture, there was no reason to throw out

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
the batch.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.329
In some versions of the story, the employee
told his manager about the mistake, who came

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.549
to the same conclusion.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.990
In both versions of the story, the mixture
was then sent to be set and cut into bars

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.539
at which point it was promptly forgotten about.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.320
That was until a few weeks later when orders
began flooding in for “floating soap”

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.230
which confused the workers at Ivory who had
no idea such a product existed, let alone

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.380
that they sold it.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.730
After receiving dozens of orders for this
mythical product, the company conducted an

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.930
internal investigation until the tainted batch
was found, at which point they came to the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.450
realization that the extra mixing must have
added air to the mixture, making the soap

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.780
light enough to float.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.010
While this may sound a little too convenient,
there are well documented cases of such happy

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.010
accidents happening.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.680
For example, artificial sweetener was discovered
because a researcher ate a sandwich after

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.569
forgetting to wash his hands; Super Glue was
invented by accident, not once, but twice;

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.620
the Slinky was originally supposed to be used
as a tension spring in horsepower meters in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.890
battleships before the inventor accidentally
knocked one off his desk… the list of famous

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.050
accidental inventions goes on and on and on.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.939
And as Ivory has insisted that that’s how
it happened for 12 decades or so, case closed

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:02.939
right?

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.879
Not exactly.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.920
Perhaps the first tip-off should have been
the “unnamed employee.”

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.099
These sorts of stories that are vague on specifics
on names and dates while overly detailed and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.670
elaborate on the rest often tend to be false
or wildly exaggerated.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.370
But the nail in the coffin came in 2004, when
this accidental floating soap origin story

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.150
was officially debunked.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.060
In a strange twist, it just so happened to
be debunked by one of Ivory’s own archivists

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.239
while they were researching for a book about
the history of Proctor &amp; Gamble Co (the company

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.670
that owns Ivory).

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.459
According to the archivist, a notebook from
1863 was found, in which a chemist working

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.560
for P&amp;G nonchalantly noted, “I made floating
soap today.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.250
I think we’ll make all of our stock that
way.”

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.129
But here’s the weirdest part, the chemist
who made that discovery was none other than

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.640
James Gamble, the son of the man who co-founded
the company, James Gamble Sr.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.060
Yet, somehow, the fact that he invented one
of the company’s most famous and enduring

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.360
products was forgotten about for over a century.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.750
Although Gamble discovered the process to
make soap float way back in 1863 and seemingly

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.177
had plans to “make all our stock that way”,
the idea was shelved for quite some time,

00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:07.177
further demonstrating that the eventual launch
was purposeful, not accidental.

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:11.290
The first bar of Ivory floating soap sold
to consumers happened in 1879, advertised

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.290
from the beginning as the soap that floats.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.000
In 1923, Ivory hired legendary PR man Edward
Bernays to advertise their brand.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.550
After being hired, Bernays convinced them
to given thousands of free bars of soap to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.539
schools so children could carve them into
sculptures.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.479
As a result, soap carving became a big thing,
leading to an increase in both sales and brand

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.479
awareness.

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.920
In 2001, the company intentionally released
just over a thousand bars of their soap which

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.340
wouldn’t float and offered a share of a
$250,000 prize to anyone who could find one.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.820
As far as we could find, none of the sinking
bars were ever turned in, presumably reflecting

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.100
the fact that most people shower these days
so wouldn’t otherwise notice unless they

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.050
made an effort to check.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.600
Sales, nonetheless, increased by a good margin
thanks to this ad campaign.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.669
In 1994, researchers asked a bunch of children
to taste test some soap- you know, for science-

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.370
and discovered that Ivory soap tasted the
least disgusting overall, which is something

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:28.300
we guess.
