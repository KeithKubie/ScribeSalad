it wants to be so I think it might be
 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.780
it wants to be so I think it might be
and that's like the ultimate

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790
and that's like the ultimate
 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.630
and that's like the ultimate
vulnerability because it's whatever you

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640
vulnerability because it's whatever you
 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.850
vulnerability because it's whatever you
want it's whatever serves the joke it's

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860

what makes it so cool and makes it so
 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.100
what makes it so cool and makes it so
imagine it is that there is no one

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
imagine it is that there is no one

continuity with the vulnerability is

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200
continuity with the vulnerability is
 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.260
continuity with the vulnerability is
just however he or she wants to do it

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270
just however he or she wants to do it

like that but your skin and everything
 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.520
like that but your skin and everything
is totally fine so the mass is actually

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530
is totally fine so the mass is actually
 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.720
is totally fine so the mass is actually
just the face or it's the whole body

then it's I mean it only visually it
 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.420
then it's I mean it only visually it
just takes over the face usually but

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430
just takes over the face usually but
 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.590
just takes over the face usually but
even then that's not true because they

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600
even then that's not true because they
 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.480
even then that's not true because they
can like suddenly you know give you see

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200
and neither of them are getting anywhere
 

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.900
and neither of them are getting anywhere
they might lead a little bit but I mean

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:23.910
they might lead a little bit but I mean
 

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.850
they might lead a little bit but I mean
just none of them are ever being taken

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860
just none of them are ever being taken
 

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.500

out and I think that kind of battle is

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.510
out and I think that kind of battle is
 

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.660
out and I think that kind of battle is
much more interesting when you do find a

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:29.670
much more interesting when you do find a
 

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.460
much more interesting when you do find a
tower person who is invulnerable and for

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:31.470
tower person who is invulnerable and for
 

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.260
tower person who is invulnerable and for
like a completely different reason and

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:33.270
like a completely different reason and
 

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.030
like a completely different reason and
the fight thing is there's no reason for

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040
the fight thing is there's no reason for
 

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.440
the fight thing is there's no reason for
them to be fighting after a while

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.450
them to be fighting after a while
 

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.630
them to be fighting after a while
there's just they realize they could be

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:38.640

escaping maybe the cops are coming or

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.350
escaping maybe the cops are coming or
 

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.480
escaping maybe the cops are coming or
something but they just keep going cuz

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.490
something but they just keep going cuz
 

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.470
something but they just keep going cuz
it's that we're pride issue it

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480
it's that we're pride issue it
 

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.569
it's that we're pride issue it
pride at least to insanity and I think

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:45.579
pride at least to insanity and I think
 

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:47.430
pride at least to insanity and I think
that is so cool when because I don't

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440
that is so cool when because I don't
 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.170
that is so cool when because I don't

in the comics I think he is just sort of
 

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:53.069
in the comics I think he is just sort of
his own entity which is cool but I think

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079
his own entity which is cool but I think
 

00:13:53.079 --> 00:13:54.030
his own entity which is cool but I think
it makes for a much more interesting

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040
it makes for a much more interesting
 

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.420
it makes for a much more interesting
battle when someone else can't die as

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:57.430

Walter comes back there's never really a
 

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.660
Walter comes back there's never really a
clear winner and I just think that's the

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:06.670
clear winner and I just think that's the
 

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.949
clear winner and I just think that's the
