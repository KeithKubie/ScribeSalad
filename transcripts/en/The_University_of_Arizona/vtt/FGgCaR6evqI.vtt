[MARCHING BAND]

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:09.210
 All right, Bobby, I'm
so glad you're here today.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.876
I want you to take a
look at this setup.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.190
We're so excited at what's
going on with homecoming.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.140
This is an effort
that requires probably

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.645
nine months to put together.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.270
 I believe it.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.940
 We've got students, we've
got alumni volunteers,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.100
and we've got staff
that make this happen.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.230
And probably at some point
this afternoon, we'll

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.810
have upwards of 50,000
people on the mall,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.700
and it's going to be a
very exciting afternoon.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.840
 Hopefully they all go in the
stadium so we fill the stadium.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.725
 I hope so!

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:34.850
It's going to be important.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.460
 Because it's open
season, for one night,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.760
on duck hunting tonight.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.500
 Absolutely.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.300
 So I think it's
going to be good.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.700
We've got a parade that
we rode in last year.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.170
It's my second homecoming.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.790
MELINDA BURKE: That's right.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.123
You're an hold hand at this now.

00:00:47.123 --> 00:00:48.950
 I hit my stride,
and I'm really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.420
loving the spirit of
everyone coming back.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.310
At the alumni
luncheon yesterday,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.910
where you presented me with a
check from the class of 1968--

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.867
which was a great
year, great music.

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:00.450
 Great music.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.545
 Great things happening on--

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:01.800
 That's right.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.341
That's right.

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.910
 --university campuses
all over the country.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.360
And then the alumna
of the year--

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.440
I felt so inadequate and so
humble by sitting in the room

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.070
and hearing what all of
our great former students

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.222
are doing out in the world.

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:19.180
So you should be happy.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.120
 It is amazing,
the kind of impact

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.620
our alumni are
making in the world.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.828
ROBERT C. ROBBINS: And what
about the alumni network?

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:27.540
You've done an incredible
job, for the last year,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.210
of getting the alumni
network ready to go.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 We are getting a virtual
alumni community ready to go.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
In January of 2019, we'll
be launching the Bear Down

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.420
Network, which will be
an alumni community that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.090
will allow alumni around
the globe to connect,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.060
with a business directory,
a mentoring platform, job

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.990
opportunities.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.300
It will put networking
at our alumni fingertips.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.650
 But I'm not an alum.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.211
Could I get in some special way?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:51.710
 You can.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.085
We are not going
to keep you out.

00:01:53.085 --> 00:01:53.800
Not by any means.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.258
In fact, if you're an alum,
you can be part of the network.

00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:58.830
But also, if you're a parent,
a student, or a donor,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.186
a friend of the
University of Arizona.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.060
So it's going to be a
very vibrant community.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.559
 I love it.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:06.894
[MARCHING BAND]

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.960
 Getting the
pipeline of students

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.830
ready to come to the U of
A today is so important,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.110
and will be for the future.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.130
But I think we've got
to start at your age.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.130
We want you to be
a future wildcat

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.110
and be thinking about
what you want to do.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.080
 I'm going to do that.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.538
ROBERT C. ROBBINS: What do you
want to do when you grow up?

00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:34.600
 I want to be a singer, an
animal helper, a TV host--

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.780
 I think this is
the place for you,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.616
because we can get you ready.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.330
 Yay!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.950
ROBERT C. ROBBINS: Yes.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.140
Why don't you look and
tell them, Bear Down?

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.880
 Bear down!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.470
 There we go.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.930
All right.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.430
 (ALL) Bear Down!

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.630
Go cats!
