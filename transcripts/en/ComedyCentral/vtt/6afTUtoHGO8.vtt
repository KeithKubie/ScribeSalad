00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.860
- Alright, so this is a
crazy story about my dad.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.340
9/11 happened, when I was
a senior in high school,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.030
old boy Catholic high school,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.970
and my mom worked in
the World Trade Center,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.450
so I didn't know what happened to her,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.290
I was worried, you know, was she okay?

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.070
I started to cry, hysterical,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.780
because I thought my mother was dead.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.620
This kid, Frank, starts laughing at me,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.810
while I'm crying, about my mother.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.743
So I broke a chair over his head.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.147
That was bad, so my teacher was like,

00:00:27.147 --> 00:00:29.022
you're gonna get thrown out of school.

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:29.890
To old boy Catholic high school,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.640
that's a rule, you can't break
chairs over people's heads.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.810
So, I called my dad.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.950
Dad, yeah, I just got
expelled from school,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.270
I broke a chair over some kid's head.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.800
- Alright, I'll be there in ten minutes.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.830
- I was like, you live 45 minutes away,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.623
in Staten Island, there's
no way you're going

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:45.456
to be here in ten minutes.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:48.340
12 minutes later, somehow,
this guy shows up,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.459
with the New York Yankees batting jacket,

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:53.200
shorts, flip flops,
holding a cup of coffee,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.610
I was like, this is insane.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.340
So he walks into school,
he's like, alright,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.330
I need a meeting with the principal.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.310
- You can't just get a
meeting with the principal.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.919
- He's like...

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:04.215
- Get me a meeting with the principal.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:05.420
- Two minutes later we're
in the principal's office,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.190
it's me, my dad, Brother Rob.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.943
He says, Brother Rob, what happened?

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:13.300
- Well, your son broke a
chair over someone's head.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.290
- And my dad's like-

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.730
- Yeah, but he thought
his mother was dead,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.390
the kid got emotional, there's got

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.530
to be something we can do.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.947
- And he goes-

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.160
- What part of no don't you understand?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.120
- Come on, there's go to
be something we can do.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.340
We're two grown men.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.960
- Are you some kind of idiot?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.130
- I was like, oh, that was bad,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.330
shouldn't have said that, he goes-

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.200
- Chrissy, go stand by the door.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.033
- I was like, what?

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.023
- Stand in front of the door!

00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:35.910
- Okay.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.330
So my dad says, look-

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.720
- I'm going to give you two options.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.720
The second one you're
really not gonna like.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.420
Option one, we figure
out how to get my kid

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.830
back in school diplomatically.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.400
Option two, this is going to suck for you,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.134
I come over there and break
both your freakin' kneecaps.

00:01:51.134 --> 00:01:51.967
(gasps)

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:53.650
Now, you're going to think
I heard that in a movie,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.120
I'm the guy they write the movie about.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.440
I don't care, I will
call the cops right now

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.530
and tell them where I
live, what my birthday is,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.660
social security number.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.800
- He goes, 'cause guess what?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.430
I'd rather go to jail
for the rest of my life,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.110
- Than have you throw
my kid out of school,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.840
and have to listen to his
mother's freakin' mouth!

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.450
The choice is yours.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.750
Chrissy, put one minute on the clock.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.970
- What?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.850
- One minute, on the clock, do it!

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.802
(clock ticking)

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.635
- Okay, so we're going to throw him

00:02:17.635 --> 00:02:19.680
off the basketball team,
and he'll have detention

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.210
before and after class
the whole school year.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.870
- I'm glad we could see eye to eye.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.300
- Wait, dad, just break his kneecaps,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.510
I don't want to get thrown off the team.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.750
My dad's like shut up,
you almost killed a kid,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.910
you've got to pay.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.743
(cries)

00:02:30.743 --> 00:02:31.880
You know, I didn't get expelled though,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.610
and you know, my dad and Brother Rob,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.220
actually became pretty good friends.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220
I'm pretty sure Brother
Rob works for my dad,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770
I've seen him making deliveries

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.310
at sketchy areas of Brooklyn
that I know my dad frequents,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.159
so yeah, that's my dad, he's a great guy,

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.360
and if he kisses you on the cheek,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.993
you're probably getting
whacked, so, sorry.
