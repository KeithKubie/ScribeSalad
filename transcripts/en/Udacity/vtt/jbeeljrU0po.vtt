00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see whether you can come up with an invariant check of function yourself.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As an example, we're going to use zip code.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The zip code is what you need to address a letter to a specific address.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The zip code is a number or in some countries a sequence of numbers and letters

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that identifies a specific region in some country.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For our example, we're going to use American zip codes,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which in their most basic form are five digits,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and those five digits go from five zero to five nine

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that is each of the five digits is between zero and nine.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, here's a zip code class.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Again, we have a constructor, which takes the zip code

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is a string consisting out of five digits.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We set zip, internal zip attribute to the string--again, five digits.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We also have a method to retrieve the zip code again as a string

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and now we need to come up with an appropriate representation checker

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
invariant checker that checks whether the state is okay.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We could, for instance, start with making sure that the length of the zip code is precisely five.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, go and complete the invariant checker such that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the content of the string is also checked

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
such as that each of the digits is between zero and nine -- over to you.
