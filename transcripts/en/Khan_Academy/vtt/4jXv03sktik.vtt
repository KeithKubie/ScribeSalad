00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.010
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the story
of a young man teaching

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.610
math to the world.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.540
NewsHour correspondent
Spencer Michels reports.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.631
SALMAN KHAN: So this is
a quadratic equation,

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:11.130
essentially.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.250
We're trying to
find the zeros of--

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.010
SPENCER MICHELS: This
disembodied voice

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.610
is heard every day by tens
of thousands of students

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.300
struggling with math, both in
the US and around the world.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.550
33-year-old Salman Khan
recently quit his job

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.160
as a hedge fund analyst
to devote himself

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.400
to an unpaid job teaching
math on the internet.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.910
SALMAN KHAN: Welcome to the
presentation on basic addition.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.794
These are cancers,
or cancer cells.

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:43.210
There's the investors and the
mortgage-backed securities--

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.570
SPENCER MICHELS: He has
posted 1,200 lessons

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.640
on YouTube, which appear
on an electronic blackboard

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.870
and range in subject
from basic addition

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.310
and advanced calculus
to science and finance.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.452
And they are free.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.160
SALMAN KHAN: Introduction
to trigonometry

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.110
is where I teach people
about the trig functions.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.250
This is one of the
more popular videos.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.490
This has 179,000 views.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.630
And this is just what sine,
cosine, and tangent are.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.130
SPENCER MICHELS: Kahn lives
in California's Silicon Valley

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.520
with his wife, a rheumatologist
in training at Stanford,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.880
and their new baby.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.230
He got the idea for Khan
Academy four years ago

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.820
when he taught a
young cousin how

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.500
to convert kilograms to grams.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.040
Many American students
have trouble with math,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.690
and studies show they lag behind
their counterparts in Asia

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.330
and Europe in both
math and science.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.610
With Khan's help, his
cousin got good at math,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.880
and he eventually
had a new career

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.340
tapping into anxieties
around the world.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.420
Now he records his lessons
from a converted closet

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.260
in the back of his bedroom.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.662
He never goes on camera.

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:52.120
SALMAN KHAN: It kind of feels
like the voice in their head.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.865
You're looking at it.

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.910
It kind of feels like someone's
over your shoulder talking

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.250
in your ear, as
opposed to someone

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.910
at a blackboard that's
distant from you.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.076
SPENCER MICHELS: Although
he is not the first person

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.690
to teach on the internet,
his simple operation

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.550
has attracted more eyeballs
than most universities' sites.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.520
For Khan, teaching math
and science and finance

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.050
is just the beginning.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.430
He's ready to expand
his YouTube site

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.659
to include whatever
strikes his fancy.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.200
SALMAN KHAN: I want
to do everything.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.950
I want to do history.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.825
I want to do grammar.

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.677
I want to do literally
every subject.

00:02:20.677 --> 00:02:23.010
SPENCER MICHELS: So far,
except for a little advertising

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.430
revenue, he is donating
his time and equipment.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.570
It's a one-man
operation, but it's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.420
gotten so big he expects
to start soliciting

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.760
outside support to keep
his academy growing.
