00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.604
Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property,
deprived of personal rights,

00:00:11.604 --> 00:00:14.454
has occurred in many forms 
throughout the world.

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:20.119
But one institution stands out for
both its global scale and its lasting legacy.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.018
The Atlantic slave trade,

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:25.680
occurring from the late 15th
to the mid 19th century

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.433
and spanning three continents,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.910
forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans
to the Americas.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.187
The impact it would leave affected
not only these slaves

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:36.512
and their descendants,

00:00:36.512 --> 00:00:40.652
but the economies and histories
of large parts of the world.

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:43.870
There had been centuries of contact
between Europe and Africa

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.754
via the Mediterranean.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.090
But the Atlantic slave trade 
began in the late 1400s

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.658
with Portuguese colonies in West Africa,

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:55.182
and Spanish settlement 
of the Americas shortly after.

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:59.777
The crops grown in the new colonies,
sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton,

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:01.335
were labor intensive,

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:04.056
and there were not enough settlers 
or indentured servants

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:06.387
to cultivate all the new land.

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:10.954
American Natives were enslaved, 
but many died from new diseases,

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:12.925
while others effectively resisted.

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:15.845
And so to meet the massive 
demand for labor,

00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:18.436
the Europeans looked to Africa.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:22.060
African slavery had existed 
for centuries in various forms.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.069
Some slaves were indentured servants,

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.446
with a limited term 
and the chance to buy one's freedom.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.761
Others were more like European serfs.

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.250
In some societies, slaves could 
be part of a master's family,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.785
own land, and even rise 
to positions of power.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.692
But when white captains came offering 
manufactured goods,

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:42.158
weapons, and rum for slaves,

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:46.239
African kings and merchants 
had little reason to hesitate.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.515
They viewed the people they sold 
not as fellow Africans

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:55.881
but criminals, debtors, 
or prisoners of war from rival tribes.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.052
By selling them, kings enriched 
their own realms,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.959
and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.773
African kingdoms prospered 
from the slave trade,

00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:09.361
but meeting the European's massive demand
created intense competition.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.971
Slavery replaced other criminal sentences,

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:15.091
and capturing slaves 
became a motivation for war,

00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.163
rather than its result.

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:19.319
To defend themselves from slave raids,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.949
neighboring kingdoms 
needed European firearms,

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.845
which they also bought with slaves.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.389
The slave trade had become an arms race,

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.258
altering societies and economies 
across the continent.

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:35.334
As for the slaves themselves,
they faced unimaginable brutality.

00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.000
After being marched 
to slave forts on the coast,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.146
shaved to prevent lice, and branded,

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:44.161
they were loaded onto ships 
bound for the Americas.

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.901
About 20% of them 
would never see land again.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.807
Most captains of the day 
were tight packers,

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:53.998
cramming as many men 
as possible below deck.

00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:57.565
While the lack of sanitation 
caused many to die of disease,

00:02:57.565 --> 00:03:00.161
and others were thrown 
overboard for being sick,

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.752
or as discipline,

00:03:01.752 --> 00:03:05.950
the captain's ensured their profits 
by cutting off slave's ears

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.073
as proof of purchase.

00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:11.304
Some captives took matters 
into their own hands.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.113
Many inland Africans 
had never seen whites before,

00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:16.628
and thought them to be cannibals,

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:20.482
constantly taking people away 
and returning for more.

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:23.988
Afraid of being eaten, 
or just to avoid further suffering,

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:27.267
they committed suicide 
or starved themselves,

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:31.400
believing that in death,
their souls would return home.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.086
Those who survived 
were completley dehumanized,

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:36.005
treated as mere cargo.

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:39.956
Women and children were kept above deck
and abused by the crew,

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:42.474
while the men were made to perform dances

00:03:42.474 --> 00:03:46.960
in order to keep them exercised 
and curb rebellion.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.735
What happened to those Africans 
who reached the New World

00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:53.177
and how the legacy of slavery 
still affects their descendants today

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:54.939
is fairly well known.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.433
But what is not often discussed

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:01.454
is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade
had on Africa's future.

00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:05.492
Not only did the continent lose
tens of millions of its able-bodied population,

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:08.536
but because most of the slaves 
taken were men,

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.888
the long-term demographic 
effect was even greater.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:15.727
When the slave trade was finally 
outlawed in the Americas and Europe,

00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:20.346
the African kingdoms whose economies 
it had come to dominate collapsed,

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:23.716
leaving them open 
to conquest and colonization.

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:27.265
And the increased competition 
and influx of European weapons

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:31.703
fueled warfare and instability 
that continues to this day.

00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:36.393
The Atlantic slave trade also contributed
to the development of racist ideology.

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:40.239
Most African slavery had no deeper reason
than legal punishment

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:41.997
or intertribal warfare,

00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:44.881
but the Europeans 
who preached a universal religion,

00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:48.537
and who had long ago 
outlawed enslaving fellow Christians,

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:50.924
needed justification for a practice

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:55.131
so obviously at odds 
with their ideals of equality.

00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:58.649
So they claimed that 
Africans were biologically inferior

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:00.588
and destined to be slaves,

00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:03.188
making great efforts 
to justify this theory.

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:07.343
Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas
acquired a racial basis,

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:10.497
making it impossible for slaves 
and their future descendants

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:13.628
to attain equal status in society.

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:14.774
In all of these ways,

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:18.574
the Atlantic slave trade 
was an injustice on a massive scale

00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:21.996
whose impact has continued 
long after its abolition.
