00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.720
THIS IS THE SHIT!!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.220
So it starts off like,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.920
“That copter was taken down years ago!”

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.160
*copter noises*

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.100
And then they’re like, “Get out of the copter or we’ll shoot!”

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.940
And then he’s like

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.760
*transforming noises*

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.740
And it’s a Transformer, you know, it’s just—it’s so cool!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.240
And he’s just like

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760
*shooting fools up*

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.960
And everyone’s like, AH! AH! AH!

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.460
(Monkey!)

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.600
And there’s this kid, you know, he’s trying to get laid, and so he buys this car.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.920
And it’s like the coolest car in the world! It, like, knows how to pick up chicks!

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.900
How can a car know how to pick up chicks?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.080
So he’s driving around, and he picks up this hot chick and stuff,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.000
the car’s doing, like, all the work, I don’t know how it does it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.480
And then there’s this lame line, you know,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.860
“There’s more to you than meets the eye,”

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.420
and everyone, *annoyed groaning*, you know, ok.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.440
But then the car is like, *transforming noises* and it’s a Transformer too!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.240
And he’s sending out this signal from his stomach, like the Bat-signal, I don’t know what that’s about.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.840
And then there’s this little robot that kinda sounds like a Gremlin.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.340
*Gremlin chittering*

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.320
And they’re just like, “DIE, BITCH!”

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.300
*gunfire*

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.080
And then these asteroids are like *whoosh*!

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.620
Boom. Boom. Boom.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.420
And the kid’s like, “50 years from now, you may look back, and you’ll wish you got in that car.”

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.320
It’s like “aww”, you know? (More like "bleh")

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.160
And then a truck comes in, and it’s OPTIMUS PRIME!

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.620
HOLY FUCK! OPTIMUS PRIME IS IN THIS MOVIE!!

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.140
And of course, he goes, *transforming* and it’s OPTIMUS PRIME! GODDAMN!!

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.520
And he’s got the same voice and everything!

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.880
And he’s HUGE! He’s like gi-fucking-gantic!

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.020
And the good guys are the Autobots, and they kick ass!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.240
And one of ‘em’s a Hummer! I’m totally buying a Hummer today!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120
And then there’s the DECEPTICONS.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.120
You got like a tank,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.400
you got like a *sudden jumpcut* airplane,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.680
you got like a police car.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.020
I always knew police were evil, I knew it, I had a feeling!

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.820
And they’re like, “We gotta stop Megatron!”

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.700
And Megatron is like fucking HUGE!

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.560
He’s like this huge… big… GRR!

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.100
And there’s a huge battle in the city, and you just wouldn’t believe it! Everything’s there!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.840
*gun fire*

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.720
*copter noises*

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.240
Boom! AH! Boom! AH!

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.240
And all the people are like,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.700
AAAAHHH! AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.380
And then they’re like, “Protect the Cube!”

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.260
*plane*

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.060
*gun fire*

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.140
And the girl’s like, “Whatever happens today, I’m glad I stepped in that car.”

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.040
And everyone’s like, "ugh", I mean, *sobbing*

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.700
And then they’re like, “It’s just you and me, Megatron!”

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.920
Boom! *grunting* Boom! You bitch! Boom!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.160
*explosion*

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.420
AH! AH! AH!

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.840
Ugh! Oomph! Mmph!

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.480
*girly scream*

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.100
Ugh!

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.600
Boom!

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.100
Oomph!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Boom!

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.100
Ugh!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.600
Boom!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.200
*Michael Bay's ego*

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.340
And then it’s like, “If any Autobots are listening, there is more than meets the eye.”

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.080
And then it was like, “The End”, and everyone’s like,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.560
“WHOO! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!!!”

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.100
…So it was good.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.620
*thud*

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.740
