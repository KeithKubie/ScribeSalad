00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.465
- [Instructor] So we're
given a series here,

00:00:01.465 --> 00:00:03.026
and they say, "What series should we use

00:00:03.026 --> 00:00:04.994
"in the limit comparison test?"

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:07.379
Let me underline that,
"The limit comparison test,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.559
"in order to determine
whether S converges?"

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.088
So let's just remind ourselves

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:13.979
about the limit comparison test.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.490
If we say, if we say
that we have two series,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.429
and I'll just use this notation, a sub-n,

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.179
and then another series, b sub-n.

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:29.953
And we know that a sub-n
and b sub-n are greater than

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.120
or equal to zero for all n,
for all n, if we know this,

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.152
then if, then if the limit
as n approaches infinity of

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:49.321
a sub-n over b sub-n is equal
to some positive constant.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.110
So zero is less than that
constant is less than infinity,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.943
then either both converge,
then both converge,

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:03.680
both converge, both converge,

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.911
or both diverge, both diverge.

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:13.316
And it really makes a lot of
sense, because it's saying,

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:16.555
look, as we get into our
really large values of n,

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.230
as we go really far out
there in terms of the terms,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.759
if our behavior starts to look
the same, then it makes sense

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.310
that both these series
would converge or diverge,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.262
and we have an introductory
vizio, (chuckles)

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:30.515
we have an introductory video
on this in another video.

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.081
So let's think about what,
if we say that this is our

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.582
a sub-n, if we say that this
is a sub-n right over here,

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.604
what is a series that we
can really compare to?

00:01:40.604 --> 00:01:45.119
That seems to have the same
behavior as n gets really large?

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.603
Well this one just
seems to gets unbounded.

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:49.581
This one doesn't look that similar.

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.814
Has a three to the n minus
one in the denominator,

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:54.716
but the numerator doesn't behave the same.

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:56.541
This one over here is interesting

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:58.316
because we could write this,

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:02.433
the is the same as a sum
n equals one to infinity.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.426
We could write this is two
to the n over three to the n,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.689
and these are very similar.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.368
The only difference between
this and this is that

00:02:10.368 --> 00:02:12.705
in the denominator here, or
in the denominator up here

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:14.841
we have a minus one, and down here

00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.738
we don't have that minus one,

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:19.054
and so it makes sense given
that that's just a constant,

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:23.063
that as n gets very large, that
these might behave the same.

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:24.202
So let's try it out.

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.952
Let's find the limit,

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:30.705
and we also know that the a
sub-n's and the b sub-n's,

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:33.275
if we say that this over here is b sub-n,

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:37.932
we say that's b sub-n, that
this is going to be positive,

00:02:37.932 --> 00:02:39.997
or this is going to be
greater than or equal to zero

00:02:39.997 --> 00:02:42.779
for n equals one, two,
three, so for any values

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.176
this is going to be greater
than or equal to zero,

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:48.454
and the same thing right over here.

00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:50.119
It's gonna be greater
than or equal to zero

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:51.999
for all of the n's that we care about.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.907
So we meet these first
constraints, and so let's find

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.435
the limit as n approaches
infinity of a sub-n,

00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.654
which is, I'll write in that red color,

00:03:00.654 --> 00:03:04.821
which is two to the nth power
over three to the n minus one

00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:11.345
over b sub-n, over two to the
nth over three to the nth.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.855
So let me actually do a little

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.539
algebraic manipulation right over here.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.735
This is going to to be the same thing as

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.485
two to the nth over
three to the n minus one,

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.499
times three to the n, over two the n.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.646
Divide the numerator and the denominators

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:34.034
by two to the n, those cancel out,

00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:38.438
and so this will give
us, this will give us

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:42.506
three to the n over
three to the n minus one.

00:03:42.506 --> 00:03:44.366
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:46.167
by three to the n, and that'll give us

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:49.750
one over one minus one
over three to the n.

00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:53.896
So we could say this is
the same thing as the limit

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:58.063
as n approaches infinity
of one over one minus one,

00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:01.537
over three to the n.

00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:03.360
Well what's this going to be equal to?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.149
Well as that approaches
infinity, this thing,

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:07.416
one over three to the n,
that's just gonna go to zero.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:10.994
So this is, this whole thing
is just going to approach one.

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.330
And one is clearly
between zero and infinity,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.003
so the destinies of these
two series are tied.

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:21.286
They either both converge
or they both diverge.

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:25.315
So this is a good one to use
a limit comparison test with,

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:26.177
and so let's think about it.

00:04:26.177 --> 00:04:29.809
Do they either both converge,
or do they both diverge?

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.541
Well this is a geometric
series, our common ratio here

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.336
is less than one, so this
is going to converge,

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:38.750
this is going to converge.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.217
And because this one converges, by the

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:45.031
limit comparison test, our
original series S converges.

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.281
Converges, and we are done.
