00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.348
 Anna played 5 golf games 

00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:04.559
 and its lowest score is 80. 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.425
 The results of the first 4 games and the lowest game 

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.589
 are shown in the following dot diagram. 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.720
 We see this here. 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.328
 Its lowest score is 80, 

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:16.789
 as she scored 90 once, 92 once, 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.426
 94 once and 96 once. 

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:22.286
 They found that Ana violated some rules when she noted 

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:25.385
 80, so this result - I guess it's a fraud attempt - has not helped her 

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.684
 and will be removed from the data set. 

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.631
 They took this out 80. 

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.810
 We only have the results of the other 4 games. 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.286
 How will the removal of the lowest result affect? 

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.025
 Median and Median? 

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.564
 Let's actually think about the median first. 

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.528
 The median is the average number. 

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:44.741
 Here, when she had 5 data points, 

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:46.947
 the average data point will be that, 

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.130
 where we have 2 left and 2 right. 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.857
 So the median here will be 92. 

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:57.479
 The median is 92. 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.372
 And what is the median after they have removed it? 

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.100
 You now have only 4 data points. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.463
 When you try to find the median 

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:03.926
 of an even number of numbers, 

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:05.817
 you look at the middle two numbers. 

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.811
 These are 92 and 94. 

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:10.529
 And then you get their average. 

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.934
 You go midway between them to find the median. 

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:15.981
 So the median here will be ... 

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.572
 Let me write it a bit clearer. 

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:18.754
 The median here will be 

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:22.088
 half between 92 and 94, which is 93. 

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:26.865
 So the median is 93. 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.980
 The median is 93. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.180
 Therefore, remove the point with the lowest score 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.272
 in this case increases the median. 

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:37.910
 So the median - I'll write it down here. 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.263
 The median grew slightly. 

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.693
 The median is growing. 

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.638
 But what will happen? 

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.677
 with the mean value? 

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.535
 One of the approaches without having to do 

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.965
 any calculations, is to get the number, 

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:57.275
 which is lower than the current average, 

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:59.098
 I have not calculated the current average value. 

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.268
 But if you remove it, the average value will rise. 

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:04.182
 The average value will rise. 

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:05.691
 I hope this gives you some idea. 

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.814
 If you remove a number that is greater than the average, 

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:11.959
 then the average will be reduced, 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.010
 because you will not have that big number anymore. 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.420
 If you remove a number that is lower than the average, 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.283
 then you will not have that small number, 

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.590
 which will reduce the average and so the average will increase. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.638
 But let's check this mathematically. 

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.986
 Let's calculate the average value here. 

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:30.550
 We will collect 80, plus 90, 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.247
 plus 92 plus 94 plus 96. 

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:38.859
 These are our data points. 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.581
 And this gives us: 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 6 is 12. 

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.801
 And then we have 1 plus 8 is 9, and that is, 

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.798
 this is 9 and then we have another 9, 

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.237
 another 9, another 9, another 9. 

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.385
 In essence, here are 5 nines. 

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:59.644
 So this will be 452. 

00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:03.292
 This is the sum of the results of these 5 games. 

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:05.730
 Then we divide it into the number of games we have. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.588
 So this will be 452 divided by 5. 

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:13.839
 452 divided by 5 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.875
 will give us ... 5 is contained, 

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.564
 it does not fit in 4, it is contained in 45 nine times. 

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:23.127
 9 by 5 is 45, subtract, get 0, 

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:24.459
 Download the pair below. 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.628
 5 is contained in 2 zero times, 0 in 5 is, 

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.845
 0 by 5 is 0, subtract. 

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:34.043
 You have 2 left, so you can say that the average value here, 

00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:38.837
 the average value here is 90 and 2/5. 

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.057
 No 9 and 2/5, but 90 and 2/5. 

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:46.230
 So the average value is somewhere here. 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.943
 This is the average value of these data points there. 

00:03:49.943 --> 00:03:53.295
 And if we remove this, what will be the average value? 

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.996
 Here we will only have 90 plus 92, 

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:03.075
 plus 94, plus 96, we collect them together. 

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.937
 Let's see 2 plus 4, plus 6 is 12. 

00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:10.087
 And then we collect those, and we get 37. 

00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:13.045
 372 divided into 4 because I now have 

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.007
 4 data points rather than 5. 

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.853
 4 is contained in ... Let me do it 

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.370
 where you can see it. 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.203
 4 is contained in 372, 

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:25.141
 is contained in 37 nine times. 

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:28.368
 9 by 4 is 36, you get, you get 1. 

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:31.139
 We take the couple down, it is exactly three times. 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.256
 3 in 4 is 12. 

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:34.544
 There is no remnant. 

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.379
 So median and average value here 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.997
 are both, this is also the average value. 

00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:41.529
 The average value here is also 93. 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.820
 You see that the median, 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.676
 the median rose from 92 to 93, it grew. 

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.321
 The average value was 90 and 2/5 to 93. 

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.589
 So the average value grew more than the median. 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.433
 Both grew, but the average grew more. 

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.515
 It makes sense because that number was 

00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:00.828
 at a great distance below all those here. 

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:02.349
 You can imagine that if you remove it, 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.235
 the average will increase a lot. 

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:05.891
 But let's see which of these answers 

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:07.955
 are what we have just described. 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.541
 Both the average and the median will decrease, no. 

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:14.734
 Both the average and the median will decrease, no. 

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:16.932
 Both, the average and the median will rise, 

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:19.927
 but the average will grow more than the median. 

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:23.155
 That's what we saw. 

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:26.957
 The average value was 90 and 2/5 or 90.4, 

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.776
 rose from 90.4 or 90 and 2/5 from 93. 

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:33.411
 And then the median rose by only 1. 

00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:35.732
 Here is the right answer.
