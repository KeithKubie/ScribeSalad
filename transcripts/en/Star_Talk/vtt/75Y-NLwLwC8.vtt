00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.019
this is Startalk in the film arrival
where they got a linguist and a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
theoretical physicist and they no no no
it's not how you play this no no you'll

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.320
be a linguist to aliens all right but a
cultural linguist to aliens I'm sorry

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.310
nor do you bring the theoretical
physicist I'm sure he's a smart guy but

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.960
we got aliens here please so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.980
I would bring a cryptographer who specializes in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.129
decoding messages and I'd bring an
astrobiologist, of course. That's what I

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.290
would bring. And so you would first set
up a common vocabulary but you would do

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.420
so by referencing things that you know
we would have in common and that would

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.039
be science. That would be science.
 You might show a lightning spark, you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.760
know, what do you call this? You know they
would have seen it because it's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
moving electrons, and they took a ship to
get here. They must know something about

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.549
electricity, okay? You don't show them an
apple and say "we call this an apple."

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.159
What do you call it? "We don't have apples,
I don't know what the hell you're holding up."

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.369
So we would show maybe the periodic table of elements.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.490
The organization of that chart
is surely universal. Literally universal.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.590
right if you like this please remember
everything that we do can be found
