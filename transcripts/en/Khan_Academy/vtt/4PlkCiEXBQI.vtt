00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.610
Let's think about how or
what 1/2 times 5 represents.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.600
So one way to think about it is
that this could be five 1/2's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.370
added together.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.050
So you could view this
as 1/2 plus 1/2 plus 1/2

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.520
plus 1/2 plus 1/2, which is the
same thing as 1 plus 1 plus 1

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.753
plus 1 plus 1, over 2,
which is equal to 5/2.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.900
The other way to
think about this

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.695
is that you start with 5 things.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.960
So let's say, that's 1 thing.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
Let me copy and paste that
so they all look the same.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.930
So then let me paste it.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.340
So that's 2 things.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.890
That's 3 things.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.970
That's 4 things.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.500
And that's 5 things.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.850
So the other way to think about
it is you start with 5 things,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.880
and you take 1/2 of them.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.070
So what would be 1/2 of this?

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.180
Well, let's see.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.290
You have 5 things, so you
would get-- 5 divided by 2

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.610
would be 2 and 1/2.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.630
So you would get this far.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.450
Let me make it like this.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630
So you would get this one.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.260
You would get this one.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.210
And you would get this one.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.200
Now, is this the
same thing as 5/2?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.980
Well, what happens if we
divide each of these wholes

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.900
into halves?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.350
So let's do that.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.080
So if we just multiplied-- so
we just divide each of these

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.330
into 2.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.670
So instead of having 5
wholes, we now have 10 halves.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.100
How many of those halves
have we filled in?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.790
Well, we have filled
in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.986
So this is also equal to 5/2.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.480
So far we just did it
thinking about what

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.760
multiplication actually means.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.937
But if you said, well,
how did I compute this?

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:11.562
Well, the way you
could think about it,

00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:13.450
and multiplying
fractions is actually

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.820
straightforward from
that point of view,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.550
is as long as you can express
both of them as fractions,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.410
and 5 we already know is
the same thing as 5 ones,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.925
so this we can just
multiply times 5/1.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.570
So now that I've expressed
both of them as fractions,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.960
I can just multiply
the numerator.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.560
So 1 times 5 over 2 times 1.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.860
And what's that
going to be equal to?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.700
Well, 1 times 5 is 5.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.120
2 times 1 is 2.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.675
So once again, we get 5/2.
