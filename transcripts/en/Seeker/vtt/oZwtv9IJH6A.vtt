00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.030
It’s a squeamish subject, but we all need
blood...and a lot of it.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.470
In fact, every three seconds, someone in the
U.S. needs it.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.720
Whether it’s for having a baby, undergoing
surgery, treatments for cancer, or chronic

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.640
medical conditions like anemia, blood saves
millions of lives annually.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.859
But the catch is – we can only get it from
each other.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.019
Which is why very altruistic people in the
world donate blood.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.199
Some 6.8 million people in the U.S. alone
donate every year.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.199
But where does all this blood go after it
leaves your body?

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.749
Does it go to the patient down the street?

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.270
How about another city?

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.330
Let’s start at the post-donation stage.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.910
First, test tubes of your blood get sent to
a lab to identify any infectious diseases

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.140
and blood type.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.560
At the same time, your pint of blood, or unit
as it’s called, goes in a giant spinning

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.690
centrifuge where it’s separated into three
different components; red blood cells, platelets,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.690
plasma.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.960
And each of these have a designated function.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.920
Red blood cells are what give your blood its
color and contain a protein called hemoglobin

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.750
which help it transport oxygen and carbon
dioxide to and from your lungs.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.409
This is what’s given to patients undergoing
surgery or those with low blood cell count,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.649
like anemia.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.049
Platelets are fragments of other cells and
they help your blood coagulate properly.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.530
They’re commonly used for cancer patients
whose platelets have been affected from chemotherapy.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.600
And finally plasma, a yellowish liquid that’s
a mixture of water, salt, and enzymes–but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.890
also antibodies, clotting factors, and proteins.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.700
While plasma’s primary function is to be
the literal liquid that shuffles cells throughout

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.819
your body, it can be broken down one step
further.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.590
The proteins, and antibodies can be extracted
and concentrated into therapies for rare chronic

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.590
conditions.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.630
The next step is storing all this collected
good stuff.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.409
Each of these components are actually stored
for different amounts of time in varying temperatures.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.450
Platelets can last up to 3 days, red blood
cells last up to 42 days, and plasma can last

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.859
up to a full year frozen .
So platelets and red blood cells are usually

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.619
used within the country they were collected
from – but plasma, since it can be stored

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.200
for so long and is in such high demand globally,
is the one that gets shipped overseas.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.270
If someone from the U.S. donated today, their
plasma could be sent to places like Australia,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.920
Canada, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
It’s something we don’t think about, but
plasma is a huge global market and the U.S.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.520
is one of the major exporters.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.020
And that’s because they’re one of the
only countries to pay donors specifically

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.080
for their plasma.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.431
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau,
plasma, vaccines, and blood exports in 2017

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.780
were valued at about 20 billion dollars.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.880
Dr. Robert Slomin, a global economist at University
of Sydney, estimates that 80% of the world

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.819
market is receiving plasma from someplace
outside its country of origin.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.099
SLONIM: For many countries for a very long
time have not been able to collect enough

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.939
plasma for its needs the US has a paid system
and it's through private blood banks.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.280
It's basically the world's supplier of plasma.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.490
For example in Australia about 50% of all
plasma products that are provided by the hospitals,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.260
that enter the market here, are coming from
paid donors from the US.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.260
There’s a monetary incentive for plasma
donations because it’s a lengthy process

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.720
and can be uncomfortable.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.480
SLONIM: So you can donate plasma much more
regularly but it's a much more involved process.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.239
The needle in typically is in the 40 to 45
minutes.

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.920
What they'll do as the needle goes in, they'll
extract your whole blood.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.909
They then put it through a centrifuge process
and they are separating out your red cells

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.750
and the platelets from the plasma.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.340
They keep the plasma they put everything back
in to you.Very few countries seem to be self-sufficient

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.450
in plasma.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.829
The only way they've done it is by having
these private blood banks that collect plasma.

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.900
But this is where things get, sticky.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.390
Giving a paid incentive like that is controversial.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.050
The demand for blood and plasma is so high
that economists some people argue it can’t

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.049
be sustained with just selfless virtue.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.239
But the World Health Organization some find
the ethics of paid donations complicated and

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.209
there have been concerns with people lying
about their health in order to get paid.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.870
Based on his research in the field though,
Dr. Slomin believes in giving a payment that’s

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.000
not directly cash, like a tshirt or a gift
card.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.430
And they’ve seen positive increases.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.890
SLONIM: If you offer some form of compensation,
what happens?"In Italy they offered you a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.299
paid days leave if you were a blood donor.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.019
This program ran for two years and they found
a 40% increase in the blood supply in the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.780
communities that were offering this paid days
leave.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.499
Which was really pretty powerful.

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:27.570
Right now, with the need for blood so high,
the best method might be to tap into our natural

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.039
altruism.
