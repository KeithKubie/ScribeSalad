00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.740
What's your favorite doughnut and why?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.900
My favorite is the maple bar. It's not so sweet, it's caramel, they're soft.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.540
It's just one of my favorite thing [of] all time, all-time favorite.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.400
The doughnut shop business is Susan Lim’s life.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.300
Her Orange County, California, doughnut shop is just one of many that sprinkle the U.S.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.260
Combined, those stores and producers make 10 billion doughnuts annually.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
Every single doughnut I would took a bite and then throw away.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.180
I took a bite because I want to see the flavor of each and every one of them.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
Baked into the backstory of this shop’s glazed, dipped and twisted pastries is a detailed

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.920
– and sometimes painful – history about Cambodian refugees.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.440
See, this doughnut shop isn’t just Lim’s life. It also gave her family a new chance at life

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.920
after fleeing war-torn Cambodia in the 1970s.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.640
My mother’s story makes me feel really proud and honestly very empowered.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:14.480
My family’s background is so rich and so straight out of a movie. Like, these things don’t happen to everyday people.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
Lim’s experience is only one of many similar stories from Cambodian refugees who

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.940
settled in southern California and then opened doughnut shops as a way to survive and thrive in the U.S.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.400
Hey, fam. I’m Imaeyen. And this Sunday we’re actually doing a story idea that you guys pitched to us.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.120
We’re looking at why there are so many Cambodian-owned doughnut shops in Southern California.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
"Hi Amanda."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.280
Susan Lim says doughnuts have been very sweet to her.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520
Definitely [the] American dream to have a business.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.120
It’s the American dream just to do anything here.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.900
America has opened up doors to many refugees like myself.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.800
Lim bought this doughnut shop from her parents after they retired in 2004.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.400
She’d spent years learning up close about the family’s business, because she started working in it as a teenager.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.540
But before her family acquired more than a dozen doughnuts shops in southern California, they were literally just trying to survive.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.480
When you talk about things like that it kind of brings back memories. The suffering. The starving.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.600
Lim’s native Cambodia was thrust into war when communist and anti-communist forces battled

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.820
for the nation’s postcolonial future, according to professor Richard Kim.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.260
The war was an actually an extension of the Vietnam War, which consumed Indochina.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.120
All of it rolled up into the Cold War, which was an ideological struggle about the spread of communism.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.080
The brutal war lasted for most of the 1970s but the conditions it ignited had been years in the making.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.160
It’s the result of decades of colonial rule under the French.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:03.600
And in the power vacuum that was left in the ousting of the king in 1970 power struggles emerged over who had the right to rule Cambodia.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.080
Kim says the U.S. wasn’t allowed to step foot in Cambodia because it had been declared neutral ground.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.200
Instead the United States conducted an aerial bombing campaign that failed in its objective to destroy the supply line that was the Ho Chi Minh trail.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.800
The bombing killed Cambodians and devastated the land.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.440
This bombing devastated Cambodia and Laos. And this is probably one reason also why the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.840
Khmer Rouge were able to mobilize support from the peasants of Cambodia to win

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.940
the civil war because many of them turned to more radical ideology as a result of the massive bombing.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.340
Khmer Rouge would go on to rule Cambodia with tortuous tactics and cruelty, including what’s become known as the Cambodian killing fields.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.420
They were sites were people were murdered, sometimes clubbed to death to save bullets.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.000
And a key moment during the war was when Khmer Rouge conquered the capital city of Phnom Penh in 1975.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.860
They basically tried to exterminate the educated class.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.540
And Lim says her father was one of the people who was targeted. Here’s how he managed to escape a deadly fate.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:15.140
My parents survived by pretending to be dumb -- to be not educated -- to be farmers, not educators, not teachers.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.760
That’s why they left them alone and not kill them.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600
Her parents used their home as a haven for their children during the war.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.240
The Lim kids couldn’t go to school. Life was just about surviving the daily stressors of war.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.240
I still remember a little bit about it: being hungry; being starving. No food, no water.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:45.300
I honestly don’t know how we survived during the war. You have to wanna live in order to survive. You have to fight. It’s not a matter of choice.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.440
In 1979, the family decided to try and escape the horrors surrounding them. Lim was only about 12 years old.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.400
Like other families, the Lims paid a man to help guide them to Thailand’s border.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.980
Lim’s family walked for four days and three nights amid bombing remnants alongside hundreds of others seeking reprieve and refuge.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:12.680
They really didn't take much. I mean we only brought maybe a few clothes to change, some food, a little bit of money.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:24.960
There’s not much to carry because there’s so many people trying to get out of the city -- on foot, no cars. We basically walked miles and miles and miles.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.740
Her family made it out to a refugee camp in Thailand, but many others wouldn’t or couldn’t.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.920
Lim’s infant brother is among the war’s casualties. He essentially starved to death.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.540
Cambodian civil war would kill at least 1.5 million people, but the real toll could be up to 2 million.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.920
And even the bit of freedom Lim found in the refugee camp wasn’t a break from her suffering.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.060
In some ways, it was a reminder of what she and her family had lost and lacked.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:06:02.820
They were watching this lady bought candy for her children and my mom looks at me and she couldn’t afford it. And I just feel bad for my brothers.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.320
Lim’s family spent a few months in the Thai refugee camp before her uncle Ted Ngoy sponsored them to come to the U.S.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.240
That’s how she ended up here in southern California.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.960
She says her family was among the earliest Cambodian refugees to the region.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.620
Lim didn’t speak English and the transition was difficult.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.940
America, where is America? Didn’t know where and when we got to LAX it was so weird.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.600
Big tall people. White people. You know, you’d never seen white people.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.860
Her family arrived to an America deeply divided about accepting refugees.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.940
One Harris poll taken in May 1975 found that 37% of Americans were in favor of accepting the refugees. 49% opposed it, and 14% weren’t sure.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.480
49% opposed it, and 14% weren’t sure.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:01.920
Even President Jimmy Carter essentially refused entry to 40,000 Cambodian refugees before later taking a more humane approach to the conflict’s victims.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.260
This was America’s climate when Lim’s family moved in with her uncle and began working at his doughnut shop.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.900
My uncle, he’s the king of the doughnut. His name is Ted Ngoy.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.100
Ngoy employed Lim’s parents, teaching them the trade.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.480
In fact, the very first night Lim’s family arrived in California, Ngoy took her parents to make doughnuts with him.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:29.540
Without him helping us, recruiting us, I don’t know where most Cambodians would be, including my family.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.240
Ngoy continued to sponsor other Cambodian refugees, hiring them; teaching them about the doughnut shop business.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:44.620
The many Cambodians who own doughnut shops are Ngoy’s legacy as are the pink boxes that have become synonymous with southern California stores.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:51.660
Lim’s daughter Amanda Lim Tang says her great uncle chose the pink boxes because they were the least expensive alternative.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.120
I honestly could see myself running this and I would hate for this to not be a part of people’s lives anymore.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:04.560
Tang is running parallel to her grandparents’ path. They worked for Ngoy for three to five years before eventually saving enough money to buy their own store.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.860
That store became two, and then three – and eventually more than a dozen.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.200
Susan Lim says her family’s story is an example of the American Dream.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:19.240
She hopes at least one of her five children will one day join the business – but only after getting a college education,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.500
which she says she was unable to do because she had to help her family.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:29.800
Susan Lim’s family is just one of the more than 2 million people who fled the region between the 1970s and 1990s.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.440
The United States took in more than 1.52 million of them.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.440
Some refugees landed here in Long Beach, California in a place that's today known as Cambodia town.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.440
It's filled with businesses owned by Cambodians.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.940
And now, some of those people – including those refugees who arrived as children or were born in refugee camps –

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.580
are being repatriated to a nation they’ve never really known.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.940
The U.S. and Cambodia signed a memorandum in 2002 that said an average of 35 people would be deported annually.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.740
And that was true until 2016. That's when the Cambodian government told the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.220
that it would no longer accept deportees until it had a chance to review the issue.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.280
The agreement allows the U.S. to repatriate Cambodians who've committed a crime - even if that crime is a misdemeanor -

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.800
and even if they're married to U.S. citizens.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.180
By 2017, more than 500 Cambodians had been deported as part of the agreement.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.320
And in the first week of April 2018, the U.S. deported the largest group of Cambodians ever.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.940
Immigration officials sent back more than 40 people to Cambodia.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.300
Lim says she doesn’t personally know anyone who’s been affected by the deportations.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.080
And what she wants is the legacy of Cambodian doughnut shop owners to continue.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.220
What I like most about working here is meeting my customers, my clients.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.960
Talk to them. Wait on them. Make them happy. That’s why I’m here.
