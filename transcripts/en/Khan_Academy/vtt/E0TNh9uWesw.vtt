00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.750
 

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.090
We're told that K is the
midpoint of segment, JL.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.960
So that tells us
that segment JK is

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.550
going to be congruent
to segment KL,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.390
that they're going to be
the exact same length.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.120
And they tell us that segment
JK is equal to 8x minus 8.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.250
So this distance right over
here is equal to 8x minus 8.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.410
And then they tell
us that segment KL

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.430
is equal to 7x minus 6, that its
length is equal to 7x minus 6.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.310
So this length right
over here is 7x minus 6.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.350
Because K is the
midpoint, we know

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.460
that this length must
be equal to this length.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.390
So to find JL, we just need
to find the whole length.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.027
We defined what x is.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:47.610
If we know what x
is, then we're going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.776
to know what this length
is and what this length is.

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:51.410
And we could either
double one of them

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.570
or add them together to find the
length of the entire segment.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.612
So first, let's figure out x.

00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:58.820
And the best way to figure
out x is based on the fact

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:09.540
that we know that 8x minus
8 is equal to 7x minus 6.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.040
And I just want to reemphasize,
how do we know that?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.470
Well, they told us that
K is the midpoint of JL.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.970
This is the midpoint,
which tells us

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.130
that this distance is equal to
this distance, or 8x minus 8

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.280
is equal to 7x minus 6.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.440
Now, to figure out
x, we just have

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.250
to do a little bit of algebra.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.610
So let's see what we can
do to simplify things.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.694
So if we want to get all
the x terms on one side--

00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:35.151
let's say we're going to get
it on the left side-- we could

00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:36.875
subtract 7x from both sides.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.310
So let's do that.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
Let's subtract 7x
from both sides.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.120
And if we want to get all of
the constant terms on one side,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.160
well, let's add 8
to both sides so

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.690
that we don't have this
negative 8 right over here.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.800
So let's add 8 to
both sides, and let's

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.000
see what we are left with.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.620
On the left-hand side, you
don't have an 8 anymore,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.050
and 8x minus 7x is just an x.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.280
And that's going to be equal
to-- on the right-hand side,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760
you don't have any 7x's anymore.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.810
And negative 6 plus 8 is just 2.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.130
So we get x is equal to 2.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.390
But we're not done yet.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.680
They didn't say solve for x.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.490
They said find JL.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.270
So JL is just going to
be the sum of JK and KL,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.520
or since K is the midpoint,
it would just be double JK

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.440
or double KL.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.170
So let's figure out either way.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.060
So now we can figure out that
JK, the length of segment JK,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.370
is equal to 8 times 2 minus 8.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.960
 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.460
We know that x is 2 now.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.960
So this is equal to--
well, this is 16 minus 8.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.264
This right over here
is just equal to 8.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:50.680
And if we wanted
to figure out JL,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.570
we know that this is halfway,
so that this must be 8 as well.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.600
And the length of the entire
thing, the length of JL

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.187
must be 16.

00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:01.270
And if you wanted to spend
extra time to make sure

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.300
that all of the
math is consistent,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.790
you could put 2 into
this right over here.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.570
And 7 times 2 is
14 minus 6 is 8.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.130
So, once again, you can
verify from another direction

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.390
that this length of
segment KL is also 8.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.727
8 plus 8 is 16.

00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:18.227
