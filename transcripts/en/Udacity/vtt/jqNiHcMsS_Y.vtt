00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For this question, I'd like you to calculate the time the data spends at routers

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
on its trip between two points.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The trace route we're going to take is between me here in Birmingham, England,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and Mid Sweden University.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, because I'm using Windows my tracer route is "tracert"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
instead of the whole word "traceroute," which was what Dave used on the Mac

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and also on Linux.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This trace route doesn't go directly to Sweden.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It actually goes via The Netherlands and Denmark.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There we have NL Netherlands, DK Denmark, SE Sweden.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Finally it's at Mid Sweden University, and it takes about 75 milliseconds,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we're going to use that value.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Traceroute--and remember that that's the round trip time from Birmingham, England,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to Sundsvall in Sweden-takes 75 millisends.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, in order to do this calculation, we're going to need to know the distance.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So the one way distance from Birmingham to Sundsvall--now this isn't a direct distance.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's the distance via The Netherlands and Denmark just like the traceroute took.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's about 2,500 km.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What you're also going to need to know is the speed of light.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's what we take the speed the data travels at in optical fiber.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's about two-thirds the speed of light, which is 200,000 km/sec.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's the speed that you're going to need for the data between the routers.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
What I would like to know is what is the total time spent at the routers.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
If you'd like to enter your answer in the box here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
One more thing you might need to know is that there are 1,000 milliseconds in 1 second,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and please make sure that you're answer is given in milliseconds.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You can give it to the nearest whole number or any number of decimal places that you like.
