"This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new G Flex 2,from LG. Life¹s Good.”

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:06.480
Imagine popping a pill and feeling full. Sound
too futuristic? Well it might not be far off.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.340
Hey there, Julia here for DNews. Researchers
at the Salk Institute created a fake meal,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.500
while it’s no Three Course Dinner gum, this
pill will reportedly leave you feeling as

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.949
full as if you just ate a chicken dinner.
The pill works by tricking your gut into releasing

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.590
the same hormones as a full meal.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.750
While there are lots of different hormones
that regulate appetite, Ghrelin is called

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.579
‘’the hunger hormone.” When the stomach
is empty ghrelin is secreted, when its stretched,

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.900
its stopped. Leptin, on the other hand, is
the satiety hormone. It uses the same receptor

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.010
in the brain as ghrelin. Leptin is released
when the level of fat stored in the body reaches

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.649
a certain level and tells you to stop eating.
Some studies of mice unable to make leptin

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.329
resulted in increased appetite and obesity.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.330
The Salk researchers say this new pill works
by activating a hormone receptor found in

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.000
the gut. When activated it tells the body
to burn calories and produce less glucose.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.629
but unlike other diet pills, this pill can
change fat content from white fat to healthier

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.950
brown fat. and it’s activated in the gut
and not throughout the bloodstream, avoiding

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.799
pesky side effects. other types of diet pills
reduce hunger indirectly, some work in the

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.859
brain to produce a fight or flight response
which reduces hunger.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.880
So can this new pill trick our body into thinking
it’s full? While this study was only in

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.939
mice, and not all pills or trials have the
same effect in humans, you can still trick

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810
your body into feeling full with less food.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.049
Changing the portions on your plate matters.
One study had subjects eat soup - one group

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.200
had a normal bowl, but the subjects who ate
from a bowl equipped with a hidden re-filling

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.380
device, consumed a whopping 73 percent more
than their peers. Changing what types of food

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.249
you eat can change how full you feel. By far
protein is the way to go if you want to feel

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.271
full for longer. While high fat foods fill
you up fast, they also burn fast. Protein

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:54.609
rich foods like meat, take more work to be
broken down in the gut and leave you feeling

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.179
full for longer. Your speed of eating can
also affect how much you eat. The full feeling

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.549
doesn’t kick in until about 20 minutes after
we eat. So if you eat fast, you’re likely

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.520
to consume more calories because you don’t
feel full yet.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.110
So diet and exercise are the most effective
ways of curbing weight gain for now. As we

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.049
like to say on DNews, “more research is
needed.”

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.350
So what tricks do you use to make yourself
feel full?
