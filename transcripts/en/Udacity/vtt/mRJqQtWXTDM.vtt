00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.150
So we have so far, developed a diagram that has some classes or components,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.720
some operations, and, and attributes which correspond to the percepts.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.120
That's the easy part really in doing the analysis.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.340
The hard part is dealing with the relationships. These are the relationships

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.510
among the components. In a UML analysis model, you should be concerned with

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.210
three types of relationships. Associations, aggregations, and generalizations.
