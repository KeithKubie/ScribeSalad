00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.910
There's a few key aspect when thinking
about pie.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.290
Typically you want to have a really nice
and flaky crust

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.780
that's made with wheat flour and some type of fat. Here we have some

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.290
butter that we're going to use for the crust. So we'll just 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.130
cut that up. I like to put this in the freezer to
let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes, you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.210
don't want to freeze completely but you
do want it to be nice and cold.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.560
This is where phase transitions become
very important because

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.829
the type of fat that's typically used in
pie is something that

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.010
melts at a higher temperatures so we can work with our hands

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.100
and it's a solid material, which will
then

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.210
melt once the pie is baked. The water will
start to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.859
convert into steam, which can cause
expansion

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.659
of these little pockets and gives rise to a
flaky crust.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.899
So now we're going to prepare our flour
base.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.940
Add a little bit of salt -- this is mostly for
the flavor.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.459
Once you have your ice cold butter or fat,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.789
coat it with the flour and into very

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:10.610
small pea-sized pieces. So water,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.119
ice water is commonly added. You only
need a few tablespoons...

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.369
the flour contains a lot of
carbohydrates, but it also contains the

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.329
proteins which is

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.979
extremely important for the texture and
structure

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.990
bread products. In the pie however we
don't want there to be

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.049
extremely dense network of these
proteins

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.020
because that would result in a very
dense and not very flaky crust.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.299
Rather these chunks of fat will help
prevent

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.479
some of the formation and the binding of
these proteins together into a tight network.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.159
And you can also as has been

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.999
explored, you can add and alcohol such as vodka to pie crust as well.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.479
While water will help these proteins
connect to each other

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.420
the vodka can help prevent the formation
of gluten protein networks

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.999
and aids in making flaky crust. 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.789
this will also have come together into
very nice

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.929
ball of your pie dough.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.580
I've always loved food and it was one of
my childhood hobbies and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.800
when I was a postdoc started to
realize

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.020
how food could actually be a powerful
way to communicate science

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.430
to a broader audience. There is so much
science in everyday life and that if we

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.290
can draw so many people in to learn
about food

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.989
we can highlight some of the examples and ways in which

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.989
science helps us to better understand
our food.
