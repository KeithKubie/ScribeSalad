TODD KEPELMAN: Hello, I/O live.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.980
Todd Kepelman here.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.380
And I am joined
with Abe Haskins,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.401
who is a Developer Programs
Engineer on the Firebase team.

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:22.900
Hi, Abe.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.820
ABE HASKINS: Hi, Todd.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.160
TODD KEPELMAN: So, what is
this exciting game that we see

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.420
going on behind us right here?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.880
ABE HASKINS: This
is AppShip 2018.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.460
This is a Firebase-powered,
multiplayer, arcade, spaceship,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.600
thrilling game.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.767
TODD KEPELMAN: Extravaganza.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.100
ABE HASKINS: Extravaganza, yeah.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.950
It's a phenomenon.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.240
TODD KEPELMAN: That's
what I was thinking.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.120
So how is this game
making use of Firebase?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.650
ABE HASKINS: So we
started weeks ago

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.010
when we generated thousands
of custom rocket ships,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.650
that we turned into sprites,
which we turned into cards,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.772
which we got printed.

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:55.980
We did that all with Cloud
Functions and other Google

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.030
technologies.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.650
And then once we
had those printed,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.710
we built scanners that can
scan the codes using the new ML

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.120
kit from Firebase.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220
Then we made a game,
which received updates

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.530
from the scanner using
real-time database.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.290
Once you're in the game, it
loaded your actual sprites

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.404
from cloud storage for Firebase.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.070
And once you're in
the game doing stuff,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.400
it shoots out analytics to
Google Analytics for Firebase.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.470
So it's all Firebase,
through and through.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.553
TODD KEPELMAN: Yeah, I
noticed every attendee here

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:23.730
is getting a AppShip.io
card, each one

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.230
with a unique rocket on it.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.180
Did you design all
these rockets by hand?

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.880
ABE HASKINS: I basically did.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.580
We made a tool that
allowed you to go

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.920
and mass produce rockets
by picking and choosing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.001
parts that went together.

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.250
TODD KEPELMAN: This is mine,
with my custom spaceship.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.930
And basically, when
you scan it in,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.870
at these scanners over there,
everybody just sort of has

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.029
their own spaceship
magically appear in the game.

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.070
And so that's all being
powered through Firebase?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.590
ABE HASKINS: It's all being
powered through Firebase.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.965
Like I said, we used Cloud
Functions to actually generate

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.850
the sprites, generate the cards,
and we have the cards printed,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.890
and we connected all
the cloud storage.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.810
Real time database,
so we're writing back

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.680
when you scan it it.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.180
We have history
on all the cards.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.840
TODD KEPELMAN: So,
there's a lot that's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.390
been going on with Firebase.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.800
What for you, what are your
highlights of the things that

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.009
have been happening with
Firebase over the last year?

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.675
ABE HASKINS: Well, I
personally normally

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.650
work on Cloud FireStart,
so I was super excited

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.014
that we got to launch that.

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:13.680
But we also have
performance monitoring,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.054
for keeping your
eye on your app,

00:02:15.054 --> 00:02:17.460
we have A/B testing for
trying out new things.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.850
We have ML kit, which
is obviously a huge--

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.800
everything about ML is
exciting and awesome.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.080
I'm glad I got to use
it a little bit here.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.920
Basically, all that.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.504
We have so much cool
stuff coming out.

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:28.545
TODD KEPELMAN: Excellent.

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:30.240
Well, I'll have to
check out more of it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.660
after I play a little
AppShip.io and, I don't know,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.800
kick your butt in it.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.091
All right, let's give it a try.

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.344
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.820
TODD KEPELMAN: So every
attendee at I/O this year

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.100
has a unique AppShip.io
card that they can get here

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.820
at the Firebase Booth Dome.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.470
And every card has a
unique rocket design on it.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.950
So when you scan this QR code
at one of these scanners,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.111
my special rocket will
appear on screen there.

00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:03.610
That's me.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.478
