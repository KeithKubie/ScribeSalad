00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.370
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.070
This is an incredible
place with lots

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.670
of great stuff being
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.660
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.960
what would it would like
to come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080
meet up with a Googler, and
have coffee with them, just chat

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.120
about what they do, how they
do it, and why they do it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.001
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.780
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Here's the message.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.570
Would you like to
join me for coffee?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.644
ANDREW BRENNER: Reply.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:32.060
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Say your message.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.935
ANDREW BRENNER: Sure.

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:33.685
I'll pick you up.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.060
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sending message.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:38.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'm getting my coffee

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.010
to go today with a Googler who
always seems to be on the go.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.446
Andrew Brenner is from the
Android automotive team,

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.320
and they work on the
coolest possible things.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.611
And it looks like he's taking
me there in his cool car.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.650
Should we take a look?

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.482
Nice wheels, man!

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:52.440
ANDREW BRENNER: Hop in.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.356
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:53.940
What is this?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.890
ANDREW BRENNER:
This is Android Auto

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.220
running in this Hyundai Sonata.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.370
LAURENCE MORONEY:
What does it do?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.670
ANDREW BRENNER:
Let's go get coffee.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.878
Press it right on the screen.

00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:02.880
We'll navigate using
Google Maps and get coffee.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.879
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sweet!

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.440
ANDREW BRENNER: So this is
my Google Now cards, but only

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.480
the ones that are
appropriate when I'm driving.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.340
So since I know that
we have an appointment

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.810
to get coffee right now,
I'm going to press this,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.740
and we're going to
launch Google Maps.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.050
And now Google Maps
is navigating me

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.080
on my car screen using the
car's GPS, which is much more

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.845
accurate, as we
go and get coffee.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's even
got traffic conditions.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.060
I can see the yellow there.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.200
Sweet.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.490
ANDREW BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880
So it will tell us the estimate
of the time that we're going.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.760
LAURENCE MORONEY:
This is allowing

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.240
you to keep your
eyes on the road

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.920
and keep your hands on
the steering wheel, right?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.255
ANDREW BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:34.930
And Google Maps is updating
me where to go next,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.210
and it's the same voice
instructions and interface

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.770
that you're really kind of
used to from your phone.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.310
Now, this isn't a device
that's within the car itself.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.342
This is your phone being
extended into the car,

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:48.550
and it's the car [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.692
ANDREW BRENNER: That's right.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.733
So we have some software
that's on the car itself

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:53.480
to let the car talk with
the phone in this new way.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.950
And so with the
software, the phone's

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.430
able to broadcast through
a wire, a USB cable.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.100
So we also have other apps,
too, like Google Music.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.530
So here's Play Music.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.615
And I can hit Play, and
I'm now playing music

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:08.942
through my car speakers
while I'm navigating.

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:09.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.430
ANDREW BRENNER: So you'll see
when the next turn comes up,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.890
it will show that on the screen.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.950
If you go back to navigation
and do all sorts of cool things

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.160
there.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: Outstanding.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.080
Nice.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900
ANDREW BRENNER: Now, I have some
other tricks we have here, too.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.150
You want to see some of those?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.800
Bring them on.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000
We've not only gotten
the GPS from the car,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.060
but we also have some
of the car buttons.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.710
So there's one
button in particular

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.126
we thought was
really interesting,

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:32.670
which is the steering
wheel button.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.210
When I press the steering
wheel button and speak into it,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.950
I can talk to Google, and we
can ask Google lots of things,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.620
such as, how tall
is Stephen Colbert?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.650
AUTOMATED VOICE: Stephen Colbert
is 5 feet 10 and 1/2 inches,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.085
or 1.79 meters tall.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.710
ANDREW BRENNER: Pretty
accurate, right?

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.570
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's from Google.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.507
It's got to be right.

00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.340
ANDREW BRENNER: So
there's some other things

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.450
we can ask it, too, like, what's
my next appointment, right?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.080
Let's try that.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.400
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.442
ANDREW BRENNER: What's
my next appointment?

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:02.150
AUTOMATED VOICE: Your
next calendar entry

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.460
is today at 4:00 PM.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.596
The title is Android
Automotive Monthly Update.

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:09.720
ANDREW BRENNER: And I can
do other things, as well.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.960
I can also control
Google applications.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.460
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Now, one of things

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.960
I remember hearing was that,
before you joined Google,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.129
you'd actually, like,
hacked up your own car

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.170
and put a tablet into it.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.086
ANDREW BRENNER: I did.

00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:21.710
Long before I got
this role at Google,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.420
I was really interested in this.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.370
So I hated the navigation
system that was in my car.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.370
So I went one day, and I ripped
it out, and I took a Nexus 7,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.860
and it fit in the opening.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.920
So I basically put it in there.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.720
And then I spent a lot
of time figuring out

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.850
how to do programming
to make the Nexus 7

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.247
act as if it was a car stereo.

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:42.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: What kind
of weird, funny, crazy stuff

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.610
happened while you were working?

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.110
ANDREW BRENNER: When we
first got something working

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.700
in a car, the first time,
we need to kind of test

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.720
our builds everyday
to see the stability,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.561
to see if they worked,
see the integration

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.810
with Google Apps and services.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: So you've got
to drive somewhere important?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.680
ANDREW BRENNER: I had to
drive somewhere important, so

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.280
what better thing to do than to
drive to get donuts every day?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.832
So I would pile into the
car with the engineers,

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:03.790
and some of them would
have their laptops open,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.500
and we would say, navigate
to the donut shop using

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.249
Voice and other methods, such
as putting it in Google Now.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.040
And we would go to the
donut shop every day

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.910
and see what the quality
was in the build.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.701
And, of course, we
would have to get, like,

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.760
about three dozen
donuts on the way back,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.216
and the person in the
donut shop thought

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:22.215
we were absolutely nuts,
because every day there

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:25.237
would be these engineers showing
up with their laptops open,

00:04:25.237 --> 00:04:27.070
and we would order lots
of donuts and leave.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what
happened to all the donuts?

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.540
ANDREW BRENNER: They
got ingested and put

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.300
into the product with love.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.540
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's why
it's such a sweet product.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.748
ANDREW BRENNER: That's right.

00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:36.292
Absolutely.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:38.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: This isn't
a closed system in a car

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.708
that only the car manufacturers
could put apps on it.

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:43.270
It's Android, so developers,
can put apps on it themselves.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.550
ANDREW BRENNER: Yeah.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.430
So what we want to
do is to really bring

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.160
developers along for the ride
with this whole thing, right--

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.810
LAURENCE MORONEY:
No pun intended.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.601
ANDREW BRENNER: No pun
intended, of course.

00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:53.516
So we looked at the use cases
that people do in their car.

00:04:53.516 --> 00:04:55.432
Like, what do people
actually do in their car?

00:04:55.432 --> 00:04:57.710
And the two things
that highlighted to us

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.910
that third party developers
would be looking at right away

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.530
are playing music and
being able to get messages

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.200
from third party applications.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.670
So you can use APIs
that we're releasing

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.290
to be able to create
an application that

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.770
can send messages that come
through onto a car screen.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.520
It reads the message
to you just like we

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.200
showed at the beginning
of this video,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.720
and then you can
reply via voice.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.110
And that gets sent back to the
person using the app that's

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.780
on the phone that the
developer creates.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.490
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, if I'm a
developer, and I created that,

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.279
how do I get that in
the hands of users?

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.570
ANDREW BRENNER: So we're
going to have a process that's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.310
coming soon with
the Play Store where

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.570
you can submit your app to
the Play Store and publish it,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.519
and it will be able to
be on people's phones,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.810
and they just download it
through the normal Play Store

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.100
channel.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.005
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So an app for my car

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:42.045
is just like any other app.

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:43.180
It's like downloading
Flappy Bird.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.570
It's like downloading whatever.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.180
ANDREW BRENNER: That's right.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.000
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it's
going to work on my car.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.150
ANDREW BRENNER: It's
just on your phone.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.190
But, of course, we're
not enabling Flappy Birds

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.725
right now.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:52.350
Maybe when you're
parked in the future,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.920
but no games right now
when you're driving.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.940
Sure.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.395
But it's easy as that to get
an app, though, into my car.

00:05:57.395 --> 00:05:58.520
ANDREW BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.090
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's awesome.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.256
ANDREW BRENNER: Because
it's actually on your phone.

00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:03.840
Think of this as a screen
that's attached to your phone,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.700
as if you attached your
laptop to an external monitor.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.430
That's basically what
you're doing here.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
obviously the car screen

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.070
is a little bit different,
and not everybody has access

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.844
to a car so they could
start developing.

00:06:14.844 --> 00:06:16.260
As a dev, I need
to be testing it.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.630
Is there some kind of
emulation environment?

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.060
ANDREW BRENNER: On the site
that we'll have a link to,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.070
there's also an SDK emulator,
as well, for both messaging

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.010
and for media.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.870
So you don't need to buy a
car in order to test your app,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.500
and you're able to test and
see how the app will run.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.840
And make sure you follow our
Android UX guidelines for Auto

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.450
before you submit
your app to us.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.240
ANDREW BRENNER: We want to
make sure everything is set up

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.120
in a good way for
users in the car

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.410
so there's nothing unexpected
when they should be driving.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.110
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So I'm a developer.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.900
I can download this SDK today.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.800
I could read the
guidelines today.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.920
I can get the emulator today.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.980
There's no reason why
I can't extend my app

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.200
to make it a fabulous
car app, as well as

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.360
a phone app or a wear app
or that kind of thing.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.120
So why shouldn't I
just get started?

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.662
I think it's just
the greatest thing.

00:07:03.662 --> 00:07:04.536
ANDREW BRENNER: Yeah.

00:07:04.536 --> 00:07:05.950
I think you should
put in the key

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.580
and get started
and start driving

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.310
your app to Android Auto.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Let's hit
that accelerator, and off we go.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.290
ANDREW BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.430
We use all the puns we can.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.510
ANDREW BRENNER: All right.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.701
You want to get going?

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.200
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Sounds good to me.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.283
ANDREW BRENNER: All right.

00:07:17.283 --> 00:07:18.180
Sounds good.

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: So we've
gotten our coffee now.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.478
Thanks for joining me
for coffee today, Andrew.

00:07:27.478 --> 00:07:28.980
And we've see all
these great things

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.580
that developers can do it within
the car using Android Auto.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.140
But how can a
developer get started?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.859
How can they just
really get building

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:38.150
these kind of really cool
apps that you've shown today?

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.733
ANDREW BRENNER: If
you're a developer,

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:42.270
you can go to
developer.android.com today

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.580
and download our STK for Auto.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.330
And the documentation
will help you

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.380
to develop awesome,
great car apps.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.130
And we're really looking
forward to seeing

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.049
what you come up with.

00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:53.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thanks for
spending some time with us

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.700
today, and thanks for
sharing a coffee with me.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.460
And for everybody
else who's watching,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.626
we're going to be doing
lots more episodes like this

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:00.780
of "Coffee with a Googler."

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.970
If there's any Googlers you'd
like to talk to, contact us

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.420
on our G+ page, and we'd
love to put them in front

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.050
of the camera.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.890
Thanks again, and happy coffee.
