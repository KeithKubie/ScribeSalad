00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.330
NARRATOR: In 1933, Adolf
Hitler rose to power

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.290
and began consolidating
Germany's military, political,

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.670
and economic institutions
under the control

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.170
of his Nazi party apparatus.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.210
For years, Wernher
von Braun avoided

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.670
becoming a member
of the Nazi party,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.210
but on November 12, 1937, he was
commanded to join, and did so.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.920
To hear him tell it, he was--

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.380
had no choice, that
he-- it was either

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.500
do that or face the same fate
as everyone else who disobeyed

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.580
the Nazis, certain death.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.040
Von Braun didn't think the Nazi
movement was the way to go,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.710
but it was a means to an
end to develop his rockets.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.670
NARRATOR: In 1944, with the
help of additional funding from

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.580
the German government, von
Braun launched the 45-foot,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.080
27,000-pound A4, later
rechristened the V2,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.830
or Vengeance Weapon.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.250
ROBERT PEARLMAN:
The V2 rocket was

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.210
a one-stage liquid-fueled
rocket that was not

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.750
comparable to any other
rocket at the time,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.460
because there weren't
other rockets at the time.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120
You had rockets in development.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.040
What von Braun was
able to do with the V2

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.790
was combine the theory with
the practical application,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.920
and develop the first rocket
ever to be able to reach space.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.250
NARRATOR: How was von
Braun able to advance

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.460
Germany's rocket program so
far in just a few short years?

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.620
Was it due to a desperate
nation supplying him

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.080
with massive amounts
of money and material?

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.460
Or could there be
another reason?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.500
On July 1, 1935, Hitler's SS
commander, Heinrich Himmler,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.670
established Ahnenerbe, an elite
Nazi institute that purported

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.920
to research the cultural
and archaeological history

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.500
of the Germans.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.080
However, its true purpose
proved far more bizarre.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.580
MIKE BARA: Ahnenerbe
was based on the idea

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.120
that the Aryan race was
the most directly descended

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.750
from ancient,
perhaps alien, gods.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.500
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Part of their job

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.170
was to literally go all over the
world looking for special cult

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.420
artifacts, things like
the Ark of the Covenant

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.830
and the Holy Grail.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.170
MIKE BARA: Von Braun became
closely associated with them

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.710
through his association with the
SS and with Heinrich Himmler.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.290
And one of the main reasons
for that was that they felt

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.540
like rocketry was
almost an arcane secret,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.790
a sort of black magic
that would enable

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.620
them to dominate the world.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.380
NARRATOR: As World War II
broke out across Europe,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.500
Ahnenerbe expanded its research
into secret weapons programs,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.460
and Himmler tapped von Braun
as its technical director

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.540
at Germany's
large-scale experimental

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.380
research facility at Peenem nde
in northwest Germany.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.790
It was during these
next several years

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.040
that von Braun advanced
the science of propulsion,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.000
aerodynamics, and rocket
guidance systems beyond what

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.880
anyone had thought possible.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.420
DAVID CHILDRESS: You
have to ask yourself,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.580
where would they have gotten
that kind of knowledge

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.250
so quickly?

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.920
One of the possible reasons
is that the Ahnenerbe,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.880
with their researchers, had
actually discovered technology

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.250
through some of
their expeditions

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.040
to find ancient relics,
and their search, really,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.750
for ancient technology.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.000
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the Ahnenerbe

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.250
discovered artifacts
that helped them

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.580
advance their weapons research?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.000
Some ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the Nazis did,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.580
in fact, recover something.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.830
Not from the ancient world, but
from an extraterrestrial one.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.920
A multicolored orb of light
was seen in the sky in 1937

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.790
in southwestern Poland.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.250
And by all accounts,
this was a UFO sighting.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.790
But it's a lot more than that.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.960
This orb actually
crashed into the ground.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.620
NARRATOR: According to the
account, when investigators

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.120
reached the
suspected crash site,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.120
they found a strange
disk-shaped object.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.750
Nazi officials are said to
have taken the damaged craft

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.750
to a nearby secure facility,
where it was examined

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.620
by Germany's top
aeronautical experts,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.790
including Wernher von Braun.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.620
While no remains of any
alleged UFOs survived the war,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.210
German engineers
did develop a series

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.830
of revolutionary
aircraft, including

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.420
the first rocket-powered jet
fighter, the first stealth

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.170
bomber, and even
anti-gravity-powered

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.830
saucer-shaped vehicles.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.830
From what we're
able to glean today,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.460
Nazi technology at the
end of World War II

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.830
was so advanced that
they had things that are

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.500
still science fiction today.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.460
Anti-gravity, beam
weapons, flying

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.420
saucers, flying
triangles, things that

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.420
are still kept secret today.
