recently at Google i/o 2013 we gave a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
recently at Google i/o 2013 we gave a
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.550
recently at Google i/o 2013 we gave a
talk called a moving experience which

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
talk called a moving experience which
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.519
talk called a moving experience which
was about various animation techniques

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529
was about various animation techniques
 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.830
was about various animation techniques
and capabilities the Android platform

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
and capabilities the Android platform
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.109
and capabilities the Android platform
and a lot of these techniques centered

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
and a lot of these techniques centered
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700
and a lot of these techniques centered
around some of the principles of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
around some of the principles of
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.849
around some of the principles of
animation that early cartoon animators

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
animation that early cartoon animators
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620
animation that early cartoon animators
came up with and I want to talk about a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
came up with and I want to talk about a
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720
came up with and I want to talk about a
couple of those briefly today one is

anticipation and the other is over

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
anticipation and the other is over
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.389
anticipation and the other is over
shooting or follow-through and these

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
shooting or follow-through and these
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.740
shooting or follow-through and these
techniques along with a host of other

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
techniques along with a host of other
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.040
techniques along with a host of other
techniques are used to help the users in

techniques are used to help the users in
their case the viewers of these cartoons

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
their case the viewers of these cartoons
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600
their case the viewers of these cartoons
very quickly understand what was going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
very quickly understand what was going
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.560
very quickly understand what was going
on in the screen they had very few

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
on in the screen they had very few
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020
on in the screen they had very few
frames to work with sometimes 24 frames

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
frames to work with sometimes 24 frames
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.139
frames to work with sometimes 24 frames
a second or actually more like 12 frames

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
a second or actually more like 12 frames
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939
a second or actually more like 12 frames
a second maybe even eight six or eight

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
a second maybe even eight six or eight
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860
a second maybe even eight six or eight
frames a second so there wasn't a lot of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
frames a second so there wasn't a lot of
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.240
frames a second so there wasn't a lot of
time in any particular second to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
time in any particular second to
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069
time in any particular second to
understand the action I mean the actions

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
understand the action I mean the actions
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.500
understand the action I mean the actions
would would happen really quickly and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
would would happen really quickly and
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660
would would happen really quickly and

the viewer as possible so that they
could really clue into what was going on

could really clue into what was going on
but we have the same problems to some

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
but we have the same problems to some
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090
but we have the same problems to some
extent in user interfaces where you

extent in user interfaces where you
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.070
extent in user interfaces where you
really need the users to understand

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
really need the users to understand
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480
really need the users to understand
what's going on in your application if

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
what's going on in your application if
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760
what's going on in your application if
many confusing things are happening if

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
many confusing things are happening if
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679
many confusing things are happening if
you're replacing entire screens with

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
you're replacing entire screens with
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.940
you're replacing entire screens with

if the workflow is really complicated as
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.539
if the workflow is really complicated as
you go from activity to activity or

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
you go from activity to activity or
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609
you go from activity to activity or
screen to screen or viewed a few then

how is the user supposed to not get lost
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840
how is the user supposed to not get lost
in your application what you really want

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
in your application what you really want
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969
in your application what you really want
them to do is complete be completely

locked into the flow that you imagine

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
locked into the flow that you imagine
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.749
locked into the flow that you imagine
for your application so that they

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
for your application so that they
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399
for your application so that they
understand that flow as well as you did

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
understand that flow as well as you did
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.170
understand that flow as well as you did
when you wrote that incredibly complex

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
when you wrote that incredibly complex
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389
when you wrote that incredibly complex
UI well if you can use some of the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
UI well if you can use some of the
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.410
UI well if you can use some of the
techniques that they came up with

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
techniques that they came up with
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450
techniques that they came up with
cartoons then maybe you can help the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
cartoons then maybe you can help the
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999
cartoons then maybe you can help the
users understand the interactions that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
users understand the interactions that
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859
users understand the interactions that
they're having with your application as

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
they're having with your application as
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870
they're having with your application as
well and help them understand and be

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
well and help them understand and be
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.350
well and help them understand and be
more productive with your application

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360
more productive with your application
 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.690
more productive with your application
the same time so it's sometimes a little

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700
the same time so it's sometimes a little
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.310
the same time so it's sometimes a little
bit of a stretch between these cartoony

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320
bit of a stretch between these cartoony
 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.070
bit of a stretch between these cartoony
effects and maybe the effects that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
effects and maybe the effects that
 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.330
effects and maybe the effects that
you're looking for in your application

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
you're looking for in your application
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.520
you're looking for in your application
but it is possible to sort of connect

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
but it is possible to sort of connect
 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.840
but it is possible to sort of connect
these dots and say okay given this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850
these dots and say okay given this
 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.760
these dots and say okay given this
technique what they were going for how

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
technique what they were going for how
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620
technique what they were going for how
could we actually apply that technique

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630
could we actually apply that technique
 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.570
could we actually apply that technique
if maybe not make it quite as cartoony

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580
if maybe not make it quite as cartoony
 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.210
if maybe not make it quite as cartoony
in the business context anyway let's see

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
in the business context anyway let's see
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.610
in the business context anyway let's see
the actual demo so we have a demo here

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
the actual demo so we have a demo here
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350
the actual demo so we have a demo here
called live button if you click the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
called live button if you click the
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.220
called live button if you click the
button the button interacts so there's a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
button the button interacts so there's a
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.840
button the button interacts so there's a
couple of different interesting elements

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850
couple of different interesting elements
 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.000
couple of different interesting elements
to this one is the anticipation where

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010
to this one is the anticipation where
 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.260
to this one is the anticipation where
when you click on the button it gets

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
when you click on the button it gets
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.050
when you click on the button it gets
smaller and when you release the button

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
smaller and when you release the button
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.000
smaller and when you release the button
it doesn't just return to its previous

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
it doesn't just return to its previous
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.100
it doesn't just return to its previous
state but it overshoots that and swings

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
state but it overshoots that and swings
 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.440
state but it overshoots that and swings
back so this is the anticipation as it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
back so this is the anticipation as it
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.720
back so this is the anticipation as it
presses in and then it's the overshoot

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
presses in and then it's the overshoot
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970
presses in and then it's the overshoot
as it actually comes back not just to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980
as it actually comes back not just to
 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.380
as it actually comes back not just to
its original position that actually

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
its original position that actually
 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.479
its original position that actually
passed it there's some interesting

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
passed it there's some interesting
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.060
passed it there's some interesting
aspects to this one is that it makes the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070
aspects to this one is that it makes the
 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160
aspects to this one is that it makes the
objects feel more organic and natural

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170
objects feel more organic and natural
 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.830
objects feel more organic and natural
and it also makes them more engaging in

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
and it also makes them more engaging in
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.050
and it also makes them more engaging in
general I saw techniques specifically

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
general I saw techniques specifically
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.510
general I saw techniques specifically
like this on a game console years ago

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520
like this on a game console years ago
 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.729
like this on a game console years ago
and whether the buttons were pressed in

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
and whether the buttons were pressed in
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.050
and whether the buttons were pressed in
when you clicked on them or actually

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
when you clicked on them or actually
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.250
when you clicked on them or actually
popped out when you clicked on them

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
popped out when you clicked on them
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.140
popped out when you clicked on them
actually that interaction didn't matter

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150
actually that interaction didn't matter
 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.729
actually that interaction didn't matter
what I noticed was that the buttons

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
what I noticed was that the buttons
 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.289
what I noticed was that the buttons
themselves were much more engaging and

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
themselves were much more engaging and
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.000
themselves were much more engaging and
this was really important in the game

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010
this was really important in the game
 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.130
this was really important in the game
context where you really want the whole

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140
context where you really want the whole
 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.960
context where you really want the whole
experience to be more fun and engaging

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
experience to be more fun and engaging
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.539
experience to be more fun and engaging
to begin with and it helps the user feel

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549
to begin with and it helps the user feel
 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.009
to begin with and it helps the user feel
like they're really interacting with the

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019
like they're really interacting with the
 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.780
like they're really interacting with the
machine in the game instead of just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790
machine in the game instead of just
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.330
machine in the game instead of just
clicking buttons in a user interface so

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
clicking buttons in a user interface so
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130
clicking buttons in a user interface so
the way to get these effects is very

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140
the way to get these effects is very
 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.250
the way to get these effects is very
simple we'll see some more complex

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
simple we'll see some more complex
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.180
simple we'll see some more complex
applications these techniques and other

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190
applications these techniques and other
 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.759
applications these techniques and other
demos but in this particular application

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
demos but in this particular application
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.910
demos but in this particular application
it's very simple I'm not actually

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
it's very simple I'm not actually
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.380
it's very simple I'm not actually
handling click events here all I'm doing

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390
handling click events here all I'm doing
 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.080
handling click events here all I'm doing
is tracking up-and-down events and then

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090
is tracking up-and-down events and then
 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.970
is tracking up-and-down events and then
making the button look differently I'm

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980
making the button look differently I'm
 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.820
making the button look differently I'm
letting the superclass actually track

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830
letting the superclass actually track
 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.110
letting the superclass actually track
track the the clicks and the motion

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120
track the the clicks and the motion
 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.310
track the the clicks and the motion
events because I don't care about that

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320
events because I don't care about that
 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.020
events because I don't care about that
all I care about is make the button

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
all I care about is make the button
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.390
all I care about is make the button
smaller and make the button larger to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400
smaller and make the button larger to
 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.729
smaller and make the button larger to
overshoot so we make it smaller by

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739
overshoot so we make it smaller by
 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.590
overshoot so we make it smaller by
grabbing a view property animator on the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600
grabbing a view property animator on the
 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.479
grabbing a view property animator on the
button so we say click my button dot

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
button so we say click my button dot
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.240
button so we say click my button dot
animates we set the interpolator to this

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250
animates we set the interpolator to this
 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.860
animates we set the interpolator to this
decelerate err which is decel

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
decelerate err which is decel
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.259
decelerate err which is decel
interpolator decelerate interpolator

that we defined above this means that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
that we defined above this means that
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.320
that we defined above this means that
we're going to start fast when they

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330
we're going to start fast when they
 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.280
we're going to start fast when they
click on it and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290
click on it and
 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.690
click on it and
slow down toward the end and it's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700
slow down toward the end and it's
 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.890
slow down toward the end and it's
important to start fast because you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900
important to start fast because you
 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.420
important to start fast because you
don't want them to hit the button and

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430
don't want them to hit the button and
 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.250
don't want them to hit the button and
then get this sluggish feeling as it

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260
then get this sluggish feeling as it
 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.990
then get this sluggish feeling as it
accelerates into an animation instead

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000
accelerates into an animation instead
 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.450
accelerates into an animation instead
you want it to start really quickly and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
you want it to start really quickly and
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.090
you want it to start really quickly and
possibly slow down at the ends but the

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100
possibly slow down at the ends but the
 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.790
possibly slow down at the ends but the
the main element you want is actually to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800
the main element you want is actually to
 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.170
the main element you want is actually to
you wanted to start really quickly and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
you wanted to start really quickly and
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.490
you wanted to start really quickly and
you want it to be a very short duration

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
you want it to be a very short duration
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.190
you want it to be a very short duration
as well so we use a decelerate er here

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200
as well so we use a decelerate er here
 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.610
as well so we use a decelerate er here
and notice that I actually change the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620
and notice that I actually change the
 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.630
and notice that I actually change the
duration of the view property animator

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640
duration of the view property animator
 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.820
duration of the view property animator
to 200 instead of its default 300

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
to 200 instead of its default 300
 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.260
to 200 instead of its default 300
because I wanted the animation to be

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270
because I wanted the animation to be
 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.450
because I wanted the animation to be
very quick so we set the decelerate er

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
very quick so we set the decelerate er
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.100
very quick so we set the decelerate er
and then we simply scaled the button so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110
and then we simply scaled the button so
 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.450
and then we simply scaled the button so
we're going to animate that scale make

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460
we're going to animate that scale make
 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.430
we're going to animate that scale make
the button smaller as the user presses

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440
the button smaller as the user presses
 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.170
the button smaller as the user presses
on it and then when they release we're

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
on it and then when they release we're
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.220
on it and then when they release we're
just going to do the same thing in

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230
just going to do the same thing in
 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.560
just going to do the same thing in
Reverse we're going to set scale X and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570
Reverse we're going to set scale X and
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.470
Reverse we're going to set scale X and
scale Y animate those back to one except

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480
scale Y animate those back to one except
 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.570
scale Y animate those back to one except
instead of just animating the back to

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
instead of just animating the back to
 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.620
instead of just animating the back to
where they started we're going to use

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630
where they started we're going to use
 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.360
where they started we're going to use
this overshoot interpolator that we

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370
this overshoot interpolator that we
 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.400
this overshoot interpolator that we
defined above so it'll actually animate

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410
defined above so it'll actually animate
 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.470
defined above so it'll actually animate
past one and then back to sort of give

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480
past one and then back to sort of give
 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.850
past one and then back to sort of give
that organic feeling of actually

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860
that organic feeling of actually
 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.460
that organic feeling of actually
bouncing back out then finally settling

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470
bouncing back out then finally settling
 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.010
bouncing back out then finally settling
into its final position anticipation and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020
