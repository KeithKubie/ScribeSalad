00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.350
Now on problem 37.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.160
And they say what is the
value of xy minus yz.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.330
Statement one says,
y is equal to 2.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.640
Well, that by itself
doesn't help us.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.690
That just tells us
2x minus 2z.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.500
So if you don't know what x and
z are you can't figure out

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.520
what this whole thing is if you
just know y is equal to 2.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.180
So that alone doesn't help.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.633
Statement two is x minus
z is equal to 5.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740
Now this is interesting because
this expression, we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.710
can factor out the y.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.680
What happens if we factor
y out of both of these

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.180
expressions?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.320
I'm going to just rewrite it.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.920
xy minus zy-- I just switched
the y and z-- that equals x

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.700
minus z times y.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.490
Well, we can figure
out x minus z from

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.920
statement number two.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.760
x minus z, this is equal 5.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.340
And we know what y is equal
to from statement one.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.690
So y is equal to 2.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.070
So we can definitely figure it
out as long as we have both

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.450
statements and we can show
that the answer is

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.570
y is equal to 2.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.330
So the answer is,
2 times 5 is 10.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.190
But we didn't have
to figure it out.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.960
We just have to know that we
could figure it out if we had

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.170
both of these data points.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.720
One by themselves, you wouldn't
be able to solve it.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.720
So the answer is C.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.610
Both statements together
are sufficient but

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.480
neither alone is.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.060
Problem 38.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.950
OK, they drew us a picture.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.470
Let me see if I can draw that
same picture, looks like some

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.970
type of device.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.065
So it looks like that and then
they have the other end, and

00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:50.530
the other end looks like that.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.390
There are these handles,
or something

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.130
that looks like handles.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.211
I haven't read the
problem yet.

00:01:55.211 --> 00:02:01.490
So they say will the first
10 volumes of a 20 volume

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.420
encyclopedia fit upright in
the book rack shown above?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.210
So this is a book rack.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.630
So I guess the books get
stacked that way.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.960
And they labeled this right
here, this dimension is x.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.510
And they're saying, will the
first 10 volumes of a 20

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.730
volume encyclopedia
fit upright in the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.790
book rack shown above?

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.900
So essentially I'm going to
put the first 10 in there.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
So the first statement they say,
is that x is equal to 50

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.800
centimeters.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.460
Well, that doesn't help me
because I don't know how big

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.060
the first 10 volumes of
the encyclopedia are.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.640
If each of them are, at least
the first 10 are, less than 5

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.860
centimeters each or on average
less than 5 centimeters, then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.690
maybe I could fit them.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.780
But one by itself
doesn't help me.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.700
Two: 12 of the volumes have
an average thickness of 5

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.950
centimeters.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.910
Well, that doesn't help me
either because remember,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.950
they're saying will the first
10 volumes of a 20 volume

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.080
encyclopedia?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.370
Maybe the 12 that have an
average thickness of 5

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.040
centimeters, maybe those are the
volumes 8 through 20 and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.410
maybe volumes 1 through 7 have
an average thickness of 50

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.990
centimeters each or 5 million
centimeters each.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.550
So even both of these conditions
combined don't help

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.950
me know if I can definitely fit
the first 10 volumes of

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.080
the 20 volume encyclopedia.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.500
So that is E.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.940
Both statements together are
still not sufficient.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.370
Problem 39.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.430
A circular tub-- OK, so
they've drawn this

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.090
circular-looking tub.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.670
So the top looks like that.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.780
And then there's two sides.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.950
Let's me see how well I can
construct what they've drawn.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.820
And the bottom looks something
like that.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.170
And then they shade in a
little area, a strip

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.050
of this, like that.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.920
And they say a circular tub has
a painted band around its

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.870
circumference as show above.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.920
So this is the painted band
around its circumference.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.125
What is the surface area
of the painted band?

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.230
And they tell us that
the height of the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.910
painted band is x.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.780
So in order to essentially know
the surface area, you'd

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.370
have to know the height, which
is x, times the circumference

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.750
of the circle, which would
be the length.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.680
So if you knew the height times
circumference of the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.170
circle, you'd be able to
know the surface area.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.860
So they tell us, the first
statement, x is equal to 0.5,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.640
whatever, meters.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.380
So this is in meters.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.080
0.5 meters, so that alone
doesn't help us.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.570
We have to be able to figure out
the circumference of this

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.000
tub in order to really be able
to figure out the surface area

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.670
because the circumference times
this height will be the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.480
service area.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.180
Point two: they say the height
of the tub is one meter.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.440
So they're telling us that
this is one meter.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.250
Well that doesn't help us.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.910
That still doesn't tell us how
far around the tub goes.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.780
If they had given us the
diameter or the radius or the

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.830
circumference then we could've
used our basic geometry to

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.980
figure out the circumference.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.540
But they didn't.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.360
So either way-- it's a one meter
height-- both of these

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.600
combined still do not allow us
to figure out the surface area

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.060
of this green band.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.800
E again.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.000
Problem 40.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.470
What is the value
of integer n?

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.950
And n as an integer.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:45.310
So statement number one: they
tell us that n times n plus 1

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.770
is equal to 6.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.250
Now we should already be able
to figure this out because n

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.210
is an integer, n plus
1 is an integer.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.970
So what are the factorizations
of 6?

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.010
You could have 1 times 6.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.810
But that doesn't fit n
and n plus 1, right?

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.730
This is n and n plus 5.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.550
You have 2 times 3,
which work, right.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.280
If 2 is n, n plus 1 is
3 and they equal 6.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.880
So let me circle that.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.050
And then what other
factorizations?

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.550
You don't have any other--
these are all

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.950
of the factors 6.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.280
So just looking at the first
statement, you know that n has

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.140
to be equal to 2.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.470
This is the only integer
where this is true.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.810
Actually, let me take
a step back.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.330
No, what if n is negative?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.370
Because I was assuming it's a
positive integer but they

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.915
didn't say it's a positive
integer, so let

00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:38.980
me think about that.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:46.100
If I did minus 3 times minus
2, that also equals 6 and

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.660
these are both integers.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.600
OK, so this isn't enough.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.190
Because in this case, n could
be-- this would be n and this

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.740
is would be n plus 1-- so n is
either equal to 2 or n is

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.240
equal to minus 3.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.200
That's a little tricky.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.390
The intuition is to just assume
that n is positive but

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.000
it doesn't have to
be positive.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.720
So n could be 2 or
minus 3 here.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.820
That's a tricky one.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.490
So that one by itself does not
help us solve the problem.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.580
The second part of it, point
two it says, 2 to the 2n is

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.195
equal to 16.

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:23.900
And whenever you have these
in the SAT or the GMAT or

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.910
anything, whenever you have a
variable in the exponent, your

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.250
goal really is to just get
everything in the same base.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.950
So we could write the left-hand
side the same.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.740
So that's 2 to the 2n.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.920
And how do we write 16
with the base 2?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.560
Well, 16 is just 2 to
the fourth, right?

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.700
And so we get 2n
is equal to 4.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.860
n is equal to 2.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:00.100
So this statement alone is
enough to figure it out.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.460
This statement alone is not.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.250
So the answer is B.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.960
Statement two alone
is sufficient.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.040
40 is B.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.760
And this was tricky because one,
you think that 1n alone

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.910
is sufficient but it is
ambiguous because and n could

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.720
be minus 3.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.800
41.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.060
OK.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.530
They've drawn a bunch of,
if I see this right, a

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.972
bunch of-- two lines.

00:08:30.972 --> 00:08:33.530
Let's see if I can draw this.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.490
So a line and then there's
a bunch of circles.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:49.965
One circle, two circles
they have, and

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:51.215
then they keep going.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.858
Three circles, and
then one more.

00:08:58.858 --> 00:09:00.920
It's going to be right there.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.830
Four circles.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.590
I think that's about right.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.120
And they say essentially that
the circles just keep

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.580
going on and on.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.000
That's what I think the
drawing implies.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.810
They say the inside of a
rectangular carton is 48

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:31.210
centimeters long, 32 centimeters
wide and 15

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.460
centimeters high.

00:09:36.796 --> 00:09:37.210
OK.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.320
So that's the inside.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.460
Kind of from the other wall.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.390
This is the floor of the inside
of the container and

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.980
then there would be
another up here.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.460
But I think you get the idea.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.360
The carton is filled to capacity
with k identical

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.290
cylindrical cans of fruit that
stand upright in rows and

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.270
columns as indicated in
the figure above.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.450
OK.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.350
So this is like a
top view of it.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.440
So we could say that this side
up here, this is 48 and then

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.130
this is 32.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.810
So we don't care so much about
the height, I think.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.980
So, let's see, the carton is
filled to capacity with k

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.040
identical cylindrical cans of
fruit that stand upright in

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.380
rows and columns as indicated
in figure above.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.170
If the cans are 15 centimeters
high-- OK, so each of the cans

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.910
are exactly 15 centimeters
high.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.990
So they literally are exactly
as high as the carton.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.050
If the cans are 15 centimeters
high, what is the value of k?

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.040
So we have to figure out how
many of these cans will fit in

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.440
this area essentially?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.520
And then they tell us point
number one: each of the cans

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.850
have a radius of
4 centimeters.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.350
Radius is 4 centimeters.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.370
Well, if we know that each of
them have a radius of 4

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:51.220
centimeters then we know exactly
how much square area

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.240
each of these circles will take
up, assuming that they're

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.680
packed exactly like
this, right?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.300
Because if you think about it,
what is this area right here?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.040
Well, there's a bunch of
were different ways you

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.930
could think about it.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.650
The easiest is that if the
radius is 4 centimeters, that

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.870
the diameter right here
is 8 centimeters.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.500
So if this is 8 and you have a
48 length, you can only do 6

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.320
of these, right?

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.190
6 times 8 is 48.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.120
So you can only do 6 that way.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.970
And then if the diameter is 8
this way and this length is

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.720
32, you can only
do 4 this way.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.010
So statement number one, alone,
is enough to figure out

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.590
how many you can put.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.720
It would actually
be 4 times 6.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.600
You could put 24, k would be 24
cans that you could fit in.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.210
So statement one, alone,
is enough.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.280
Now what does statement
two tell us?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.830
6 of the cans sit exactly
along the

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.565
length of the carton.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.020
So they're telling us that these
cans, there's 6 cans

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.940
that fit right along the length,
which we figured out

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.230
from statement number one.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.140
But that also gives you the same
information as statement

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.580
number one.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.420
Because you know that these
are cylindrical cans.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.295
I think it's a safe assumption
to say that these are circles.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.260
Yeah.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.860
A cylinder, you're assuming
that the tops are circles.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.700
So if you say that 6 can fit
that way, then you know that

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.090
the diameter of each of them is
8 centimeters and then you

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.620
can make the same argument
that the diameter's 8

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.650
centimeters to say that 4 can
fit the other way down.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:30.080
So two, alone, is also
sufficient by itself.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.360
So the answer is,
what is that, C?

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.030
Both statements-- no D, each
statement, alone, is

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.420
sufficient.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.270
See you in the next video.
