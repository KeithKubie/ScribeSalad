- [Rob] So there's a tremendous amount of
excitement about the microbiome at the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.220
moment in part due to the $173,000,000
dollar NIH Human Microbiome Project where

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.100
the results catapulted from the pages of
Science and Nature to the cover of

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.460
Scientific American to the cover of The
Economist in record time and into public

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.930
consciousness. How did the excitements
that we're finding due to the decline in

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.410
cost in DNA sequencing over a million-fold
in the last 15 years? The microbes do all

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.580
kinds of things that we never suspected.
For example, they determine how attractive

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.190
we are to mosquitoes. So you're not crazy
when you go camping. You might really be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.530
10 times as attractive to mosquitoes as
the person you're camping with. They

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.720
determine how we respond to drugs. And
they even determine traits like obesity

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.470
and a wide range of other diseases have
subsequently been linked to the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.140
microbiome. So a lot of what we're trying
to do at the moment is understanding how

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.280
can we map our microbes across our bodies
or across our planet? And the intuition is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.710
here is that as you go to different parts
of the world, you see different species in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.070
different locations that immediately
identify a scene that's coming from one

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.710
place or another or another. So with
microbes, it's more or less the same, but

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.030
we have the problem that they basically
look the same under a microscope, unlike

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.090
these charismatic mega-fauna [sp]. So
instead what we do is we turn to the DNA

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.600
to understand them. Now, the Human
Microbiome Project together with a team of

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.540
about 400 researchers across the country,
we collected about four and a half

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.780
trillion As, Ts, Gs and Cs. But then the
problem with the data is it looks like

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.400
this. So this is the first 0.1% of the
first file. There's another 17,000 of

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.630
these. It's pretty hard to tell who lives
where in the environment from that, right?

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.750
So what we do is we use computational
techniques to develop these kinds of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.310
abstract maps where each point summarizes
all of the complexity in a given microbial

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.280
community summed up by its DNA. And two
points close together are more similar in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.660
terms of the evolutionary history of their
microbes. Two that are further apart are

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.700
more dissimilar in their microbial
evolutionary history. And so when we do

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.960
this, we see automatically emerging these
major patterns where the mouth is very

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.530
different from the skin, the vaginal
microbiomes and the fecal microbiome down

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.940
the bottom there is distinct yet again.
And so what this implies is that two

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.790
samples from the same person can be real
different in terms of the microbes. So

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.790
here I'm highlighting one oral sample and
one fecal sample from the first person

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.000
with the Human Microbiome Project. So
these are pretty different on this map,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.910
but we only really understood this when we
cross-referenced the data to the Earth

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.410
Microbiome Project where we can go out
into different physical environments and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.730
ask what two samples are as different from
each other as the mouth and the gut of

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.680
this one person. And so, if we compare
your mouth to being kind of like a coral

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.420
reef, you have these complex mineralized
structures covered with biofilms that

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.490
maybe your dentist pesters you about. The
microbes in the gut are as far away from

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.740
the microbes in the mouth as the microbes
in this reef are from the microbes in this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.170
prairie in Kansas; so essentially,
non-overlapping communities. And what that

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.770
means is that a few feet along the length
of your GI tract can make as much

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.680
difference to your microbes as hundreds of
miles across the Earth's surface. And what

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.460
I'll show you is that the skin which is
like yet another microbial continent, has

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.950
tremendous diversity as well both within
you as an individual and between different

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.180
people. So this might lead you to wonder
how stable our microbiome is, at least if

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.320
we're healthy. And my partner, Amanda
who's--I've got her put up with a lot in

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.200
the name of microbiome research. And I
addressed this question by sampling our

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.380
own microbiomes every single day for a
period of six months. So when I project

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.640
that into a slightly simpler version of
this data frame, basically, the dark

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.310
points on this are me. The light points
are her. Now, what you can see when I

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.230
start this going, so each frame on this
animation is one day as we move through

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.760
this landscape in microbiomes defined by
different people. And you can see

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.400
immediately how the skin in blue is much
more variable even within one person than

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.250
the other sites. The mouth in green is the
most constant, and then the gut down at

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.760
the bottom is intermediate between the
two.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.180
You can also see how we retain our
separate microbial identities through the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.900
six-month period, and that's especially
remarkable when you consider we work

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.940
together and have all kinds of
opportunities to exchange microbes with

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.290
each other. I'll just rotate this around
so you can see how we retain those

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:24.270
separate microbial identities there. So
all of this might lead you to wonder where

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.880
do we get these personally unique microbes
from. And if you have dogs or kids as I

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.480
do, you probably have some dark suspicions
about that all of which are true by the

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.310
way. So it turns out I can actually match
you up to your dog by the microbes you

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.590
share. Now that's not to say that your
microbes are exactly the same as the

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.180
dog's. So here what we can see on a map
that includes both humans and dogs is that

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.680
every site of the body whether it's the
tongue, the stool, or the skin, the dog

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.420
and the human are separate from one
another. And again, you can see that the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:05.930
dog's skin is very variable just like the
human skin is. But in all seriousness, our

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.340
first microbes depend tremendously on how
we're born. And so, this is like we did

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.080
with Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello now at
NYU, looking at microbes of mothers now

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.070
before they gave birth and then of their
babies within 20 minutes of birth. And

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.600
what you can see in red is the vaginal
communities from the mothers and then in

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.800
pink, we have microbes from all over the
bodies including the skin and including

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.360
the gut of babies 20 minutes after they
were born. Whereas in contrast, in the

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.090
dark blue, we have all the skin
communities from the mothers. And in light

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.130
blue, we have all the habitats from all
over the body of babies delivered by

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.410
C-section. So what you can see is that if
you're delivered by C-section, you're

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.380
denied the vaginal microbes you would
ordinarily have as you pass through the

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.620
birth canal. We think that the lack of
that co-evolved microbial community may

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.540
explain some of the differences in health
between vaginally delivered and C-section

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.430
babies. Of course, the most likely outcome
if you have a kid by C-section is that

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.970
your kid will be fine, but there are
slightly somewhat higher risks of all

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.590
kinds of diseases including ectopic
dermatitis, food allergies and even

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.100
obesity, all of which have now been linked
to the microbiome.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.240
So again with Maria Gloria, we're doing
this trial at the moment to try to figure

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.370
out, can you restore the microbial
community to kids delivered by C-section.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.230
And so, what we're doing here is
essentially collecting the vaginal

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.090
microbes from mothers then delivering them
to the babies. And this is very

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.020
preliminary data at this point, but we are
able to show partial restoration of the

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.700
microbial community both in the gut and in
the skin by applying this procedure. And

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.370
so, we're hoping to develop this into a
large enough study to develop clinical

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.760
recommendations based on this microbial
restoration. So you might be wondering,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.490
“Well, what happens after that?” What I'm
going to show you now is the trajectory of

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.110
one child--this is what we did with Ruth
Lee [sp], tracking one child over the

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.830
first two and a half years of life. And so
what we're going to be looking at his gut

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:07.190
community. He was delivered vaginally, and
you can see that his initial fecal sample

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.150
is up there in the vaginal region with
perhaps a little skin contribution as

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.550
well. And so the question is, “How long
does it take him to move through this

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.540
landscape towards the adult fecal
community over two and a half years? How

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.120
complete is that progression down towards
the bottom? And is it smooth or is it

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:29.010
chaotic?” So what you can see is at some
weeks, he changes a little bit whereas

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.410
other weeks, he changes a lot. And
remember what matters on these plots is

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.800
the distance from one point to another. So
it really is true that one week to the

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.650
next, your kid can look like a completely
different person at least when you compare

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.680
the distances between these points to the
distances between healthy adults in the

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.690
Human Microbiome Project which are those
points in brown at the bottom. Now, coming

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.470
up here is something fascinating. So he
gets antibiotics for the ear infection.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.500
See that tremendous regression of the
microbiome and then the recovery. That

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.640
went by pretty fast, so I'm just going to
rewind it for you and play it again. So

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.510
what you can see is on administration of
oral amoxicillin for an ear infection, you

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.840
see this tremendous regression of the gut
microbiome and during months of normal

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.130
development, followed in this case, by
rapid recovery.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.670
Then by the time he gets to two and a half
years, he's more or less in the healthy

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.720
adult distribution. But we just don't know
in general what the effects of antibiotics

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.470
are on the rest of the body and on the
sites they're targeted and whether those

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.600
early life changes can have profound and
lasting effects. There's some evidence in

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.460
both humans and experimental animal models
that early life antibiotics in the first

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.210
six months can lead to increased rates of
obesity, but we don't know about the

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:44.370
impact on the skin, on the mouth and on
other sites on the body yet. We can also

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.640
do this sort of thing cross-culturally. So
here in which we have gotten and we've got

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.260
an African population in red, South
American population in green and then the

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.170
US population in blue, the gut communities
converged on one another after the first

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.780
three years of life. However, where they
wound up in the three populations was very

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.950
different. So the rate of approach to the
adult stage is very similar

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.130
cross-culturally, but the final stage
where you end up can be very different.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:16.460
And you can see the Western population in
that right-hand panel in blue is very

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.350
different from the two non-Western
populations. And in that respect, it's

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.320
important to remember that even
large-scale projects like the Human

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.510
Microbiome Project have largely only
looked at healthy Western adults. And as

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.880
soon as you start to go into children and
as soon as you start to go to non-Western

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.160
populations, you see very different
things. This is true not just in the gut,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.740
but in every site in the body. So for
example, this is what we did with Maria

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:44.910
Gloria Dominguez looking at previously
uncontacted Yanomami in South America. And

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.890
what you can see is the Yanomami
population is more diverse in the skin, so

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.930
that's the left panel, than the US
population. And then the microbes that

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.470
they have on the skin are completely
different. So those green points separate

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.180
completely from the yellow points of the
US population.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.290
So this might lead you to wonder, “Well,
we've seen that the skin can vary

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.360
cross-culturally, but how does it vary
over the human body?” And this is like

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.540
we've been doing with Pieter Dorrestein
here at UCSD in the Skaggs School of

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.050
Pharmacy. And across the skin, it's just
so fascinating. It's this interface

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.430
between ourselves and the physical
environment that we're in contact with. So

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.350
Pieter was interested in how microbes were
over the skin. So he recruited two

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:31.300
subjects one of which was him, and sampled
the skin at 500 sites over the body and

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.350
then analyzed each of those sites using
two kinds of mass spectrometry. And

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.110
re-sequenced the DNA of the bacteria to
give a readout of where they are all over

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:44.310
the body. And one thing that was
fascinating is that all of the microbes

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.690
can differentiate the two subjects from
one another. They're not nearly as

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.080
distinct subject to subject as the
metabolites are. So you can see that the

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.420
metabolites from these two completely
separate clouds, one from the male in blue

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.670
and one from the female in red. And so,
the metabolites we can track down where

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.420
they are in the body. And some of them are
broadly distributed all over the body.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.540
Some are localized to the armpit or to the
groin or to the toenails or other

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.520
particular sites. And we can do the same
kind of thing for the microbes. So for

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.120
example, staphylococcus is mostly in the
moist regions like you'd expect so the

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.240
nose and feet. Propionibacterium are on
the head and shoulders and corynebacterium

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:26.460
broadly over the body. So one thing that
was really fascinating about this was when

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.340
we built these molecular networks to try
to figure out how the chemicals related to

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.030
one another, what we could see is that
most of the chemicals we found on human

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.930
skin did not come from pure bacterial
cultures or from human skin cell cultures,

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.820
but instead came from beauty products. And
in fact, 90% of chemicals that we

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.620
identified on skin in the study came from
sunscreen and moisturizer and shampoo and

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.570
other things that our subjects applied to
their bodies. So that's just fascinating,

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.530
right? That 90% of the identifiable
chemicals on your body probably come from

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:03.600
consumer products that you apply. So to
address this problem, I've been working

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.070
with the Hadza in Tanzania together with
Jeff Leach through the Human Food Project.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.734
And so, these are people who have not been
exposed to any of these products at all.

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:21.234
And essentially, what we've been doing is
sampling a wide range of things there

00:14:21.234 --> 00:14:25.921
including the gut, the skin, the various
dwellings and so forth on different

00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:31.394
projects. And so what you can see is that
the Hazda, shown here in yellow, have very

00:14:31.394 --> 00:14:35.965
different metabolic communities from the
Westerners even when we were out at the

00:14:35.965 --> 00:14:39.688
field site. So we're at the same location,
but you see these very different skin

00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:46.167
metabolite profiles. And what you can see
is of the metabolites that we saw, only

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:50.625
about 25% of what was identified was
shared by the Hadza skin and the skin of

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:54.340
Westerners. You can also see that the
Hadza skin is much closer to the

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.112
environmental samples, mostly water
samples that we collected on-site in green

00:14:58.112 --> 00:15:02.981
there. They also have a fairly large
contribution from honey which can make up

00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:06.631
a lot of their calories in the dry season
which is when we were doing the sampling.

00:15:06.631 --> 00:15:11.906
And we can also see a number of plants
that are contributing to the Hadza and not

00:15:11.906 --> 00:15:17.345
to the Westerner metabolites. And so these
are things like baobabs and other major

00:15:17.345 --> 00:15:22.600
sources of food that we can track down the
specific metabolic links between the food

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.405
and the person. So this is a kind of
molecular network where essentially you

00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:32.076
can think of this as basically being like
constellations of the different

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:35.140
metabolites where you connect up the ones
that are related to each other and match

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.033
them up to different kinds of
environmental samples. And so what we can

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:42.944
do with this is we can identify clusters
that their specific to particular niches.

00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:49.906
So for example, we can see plant
flavonoids. We can see monostearate which

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:54.715
is more on the healthcare products in the
US population. And we can zoom in and for

00:15:54.715 --> 00:16:02.956
example, look at the flavonoids and how
the profiles are somewhat similar, but

00:16:02.956 --> 00:16:08.170
then with subtle differences between the
US and the Hadza individuals in the study.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.150
And then similarly, we can do this sort of
thing with seterols which again are mostly

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.430
coming from plant metabolites and from
sucrose from the beehive which is found

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.620
predominantly in the Hadza. So we can also
do this sort of thing looking at the

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.080
bacteria. And what I'm doing here is just
coloring it by body site. So for example,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.540
the green is stool. The pink is skin, and
you can see this tremendous heterogeneity

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.310
in the skin. And we also got some samples
from three collaborators at the Yerkes

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.200
Primates Center, and I'm just going to
make some of the balls bigger for the

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.330
chimpanzees. Those of you familiar with
chimpanzee anatomy will understand why.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:51.570
And so, what you can see is that the fecal
samples from the chimps are distinct from

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.910
the fecal samples from the humans. Then
correspondingly, the few skin samples we

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.170
have from one chimpanzee individual, those
large pink balls, are substantially

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.530
distinct from the skin samples from any of
the humans including the Hadza. And then

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.170
within the human population like you can
see here basically the gray samples of

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:15.260
skin are samples from Westerners, and the
colored balls are from Hadza from

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.110
different camps. And you can see that
again, like the South American Yanomami

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:23.600
group I showed you before, the Hadza skin
samples are distinct from what we see in

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.310
Westerners. So we're just starting to
uncover the links between microbiology and

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:34.690
different lifestyles. I should point out
that most of this data from the Hadza and

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.380
from the chimpanzees was assembled over
the past week, and many of these figures

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.850
we made last night on the spot, so this is
still very preliminary data. We're still

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.170
trying to fully understand the results. So
anyway, one thing that's exciting about

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.980
matching up the metabolite and the
bacterial profiles is we can get an idea

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.300
of what bacteria are doing what functions.
So if I show you something like

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.590
proprionibacterium which is mostly on the
head and shoulders and then--sorry, mostly

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.350
on the head and shoulders and then
something like oleic acid which is on the

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:08.140
head and on the hands. You can see in the
third figure that oxidized oleic acid,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.900
which is a metabolic product of oleic
acid, that's on the head where you see

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.080
proprionibacterium but not on the hands
where you don't see it.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.300
And then similarly with palmitic acid, we
can see it getting degraded to monoolein,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:26.860
monopalmitin only with proprionibacterium
mostly. So what we can do then is we can

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.660
test that hypothesis by taking the
bacteria cultured off skin, and then

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.360
incubating it with a precursor and just
verifying that that particular bacterium

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.430
in the lab can do the chemical reaction
that we attribute to it. Okay, so I'm just

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.560
going to talk very briefly about how we
exchange our skin microbes with our

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:51.300
environment. And for example, we can match
up the keys on your computer keyboard to

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.970
the tips of your fingers and the palm of
your hand with your computer mouse with up

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.060
to 95% accuracy based on the microbes you
share. So this came out in the scientific

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.140
journal PANS a few years ago. Here, I'm
just showing you the skin of the

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.660
fingertips from the keyboard keys
clustering together by subject for three

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.760
different people. But more importantly, it
was on the TV show, CSI: Miami so you

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.410
really know it's true. In any case, we can
use this kind of mapping technique towards

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:21.200
sources of pathogens in the kitchen where
you can see in that top panel that you're

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.830
leaving your skin communities primarily on
the door handles and the trash can and

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.280
other things that you touch. We can do the
same kind of thing in bathrooms. So here

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.890
you can see that the skin's mostly on the
door handles and the toilet seats. Our

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.570
stool's fortunately mostly confined to the
bathroom. Then there's a big signal from

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.050
soil on the floor and intriguingly also on
the flush handle where apparently, a lot

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.730
of people were using their feet to flush.
And coming from New Zealand, I had never

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.730
heard of this cultural practice, but
apparently it's fairly common in the US.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.930
We can also do the same sort of thing in
homes. So this is what we did with Jack

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.330
Gilbert looking at what happens when you
move into a new house, and you can imagine

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.600
some different scenarios. So for example,
you might stay the same, and the house

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.880
might stay the same.
You might unpack your microbes all over

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.320
the house with the rest of your
belongings. Maybe the house instead

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.960
contributes microbes to you, or finally,
maybe you and the house blend into a new

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.890
community state. One thing we saw was that
the house microbes were very highly

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:20.420
correlated with human microbes from the
same dwelling. There was one case where

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.680
there were two lodgers--sorry, where there
was a couple and a lodger, and to

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.750
everyone's immense relief, the two people,
the couple were more similar to one

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.410
another in their microbial community than
either was to the lodger. And so there was

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:39.270
no difficult explaining to do. But one
thing we can do is we can track the

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.030
individual contribution to different
surfaces. So here what we're looking at is

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.300
each individual and each dog's
contribution to different surfaces like

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.210
the bathroom doorknob, the bedroom floor
and so. You can see that black line.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.850
That's where person one went away on a
trip, and you can see their particular

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.310
contribution to all of these surfaces
disappearing during that period when

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:04.300
they're away. So we can even tell who's
inhabiting a particular space by the

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.180
microbes that they're leaving behind. But
more seriously, we can apply this sort of

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.520
thing in the hospital environment to where
the hospital acquired infections. And we

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.690
can also apply these techniques to really
compelling questions in animal health. So

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.110
for example in the Earth Microbiome
Project, we've been looking at a huge

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.470
number of different microbial samples so
over 30,000 samples provided to them by

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:32.697
members of the community. And for example,
looking at komodo dragons--so this is me

00:21:32.697 --> 00:21:38.059
swabbing a baby komodo dragon at the
Denver zoo called Bintang. What we can see

00:21:38.059 --> 00:21:41.921
is that each komodo dragon in their
enclosure shares a whole lot of microbes

00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.755
with the particular enclosure it's in just
like we do as humans with the enclosures

00:21:45.755 --> 00:21:50.446
in which we capture ourselves. But what's
fascinating is that the microbial

00:21:50.446 --> 00:21:55.484
communities of the captive komodo dragon's
soil don't resemble at all the communities

00:21:55.484 --> 00:21:58.530
that we see in soil in the wild. So you
see these two completely distinct clouds

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:03.360
of points. And what's interesting is the
degree of sharing is pretty similar to the

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.230
degree of sharing we see between humans
and pets in the same houses, but not the

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.010
degree of sharing that we see with wild
amphibians and their environment where a

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.310
constant input of microbes seems to be
really important for health.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.750
Speaking of amphibian health, one thing
that's really important is this fungal

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:24.870
disease called Bd which is leading to
amphibian declines worldwide. And one

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.750
thing that's fascinating--and this is with
Val McKenzie at Boulder--is that we can

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.060
look at a whole lot of different
amphibians and actually put them along

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.460
this axis of resistance from the least
resistant to the most resistant to Bd

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.200
based on the skin microbial community. And
then the really cool part is like Rich

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.050
showed you in humans, we can actually
transfer the microbes from one frog to

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:51.020
another and confer resistance to the skin
fungus. And so, this idea of microbial

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.940
transplants is turning out to be
incredibly compelling. So I'll just wrap

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.380
up very briefly by mentioning that you can
put yourself on these kinds of microbial

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.670
maps now through this project called
American Gut, that will also accept skin

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:08.430
and other samples. And not everyone wants
to know what's in there, these middle

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.650
schoolers reacting to the idea we're going
to use robots and lasers to look at their

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:18.210
poop. But just to re-orient you on the map
in cases like clostridium difficile, what

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.940
you can see is this extreme dysbiotic
microbial community if you have this

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.390
profound form of diarrhea where you're
going to the bathroom many times a day. I

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.530
just want to show you what happens when
you do ecosystem restoration where you

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.230
have one donor who's down on the healthy
state there and transmit that to four

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.500
patients. So this is with Mike Sadowsky
and Alex Khoruts of the University of

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.940
Minnesota. And what you can see is that on
transmission of that microbiome from the

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.490
healthy donor to the four of these
patients, and each frame on this is just

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:51.170
going to be one day in the life of the
microbiome. What you can see is

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.320
essentially immediately, they go from the
unhealthy stage into the healthy stage,

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.300
and then they stay there. And so the
prospects to do this kind of thing--and

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.920
this is [inaudible 00:23:59] to clinical
remission of their symptoms within a day

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.250
or two.
The ability to do this sort of thing in

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.460
all body habitats whether it's the gut or
the skin or elsewhere is an incredibly

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.840
compelling area of medicine today given
the large number of diseases we now know

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.330
are linked to the microbiome. But what we
really have to do is develop not just

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.600
these microbial maps, but the kind of
microbial GPS that tells you not just

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.530
where are you right now but where do you
want to go in terms of your microbiome,

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.370
and what do you need to do step by step in
order to get there. We need to develop

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.410
this and make it so easy to use that even
our children can use it. So you can

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.270
imagine the kind of smart toilet that's
going to do an analysis of your microbes

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.780
and your metabolites. It's going to
deliver it to your smartphone which, let's

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.890
face it, I bet you're using it in there
anyway. And it's going to tell you whether

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.010
you're going in a good direction or a bad
direction and maybe what, specifically,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.100
you need to do in order to improve the
health of any of your microbiomes whether

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.650
it's your gut or your skin. So with that,
I'll briefly thank again the many people

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:03.870
who contributed to the specific week I
showed you, the large number of amazing

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.382
people I've had working with me in my lab
currently and formerly, and finally,
