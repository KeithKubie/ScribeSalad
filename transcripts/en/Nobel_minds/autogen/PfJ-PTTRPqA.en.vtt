I heard the news I came out of the the
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.010
I heard the news I came out of the the
plane landing at 20:30 and then there

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
plane landing at 20:30 and then there
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769
plane landing at 20:30 and then there
was a representative of the airport who

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
was a representative of the airport who
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.599

that was 150 emails and 75 text messages

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
that was 150 emails and 75 text messages
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549

later but the problem is that the list
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.819
later but the problem is that the list
of incoming phones is so so large so I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
of incoming phones is so so large so I
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.420

that's a lot of people I mean it is a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710
that's a lot of people I mean it is a
 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.480
that's a lot of people I mean it is a
team work and it is lots of people who

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
team work and it is lots of people who
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.280
team work and it is lots of people who
are completely invisible like all the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
are completely invisible like all the
 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.010
are completely invisible like all the
people in the University and Geneva and

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020
people in the University and Geneva and
 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.290
people in the University and Geneva and
the people in the research council are

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
the people in the research council are
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.070
the people in the research council are
sort of giving us absolutely top

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
sort of giving us absolutely top
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.680
sort of giving us absolutely top
conditions for 20 years which has made

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
conditions for 20 years which has made
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.230
conditions for 20 years which has made
it possible to to do the research we are

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
it possible to to do the research we are
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.730
it possible to to do the research we are
done so a lot of people behind it it's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
done so a lot of people behind it it's
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.150
done so a lot of people behind it it's
it's interesting that myprint made it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
it's interesting that myprint made it
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.560
it's interesting that myprint made it
made the same point so you're obviously

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570
made the same point so you're obviously
 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:51.560
made the same point so you're obviously
in perfect synchrony there's the proof

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
in perfect synchrony there's the proof
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.720
in perfect synchrony there's the proof
and of course you see you've received

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
and of course you see you've received
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.780
and of course you see you've received
the prize with John Okeefe yes has been

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
the prize with John Okeefe yes has been
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.480
the prize with John Okeefe yes has been
something of a mentor at some points yes

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490
something of a mentor at some points yes
 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.570
something of a mentor at some points yes
so yes I mean in 1996 that probably

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
so yes I mean in 1996 that probably
 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.880
so yes I mean in 1996 that probably
might be told you I worked there for

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
might be told you I worked there for
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.040
might be told you I worked there for
three months and she was the from one

three months and she was the from one
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.500
three months and she was the from one
month so he trained us to do the type of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510
month so he trained us to do the type of
 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.900
month so he trained us to do the type of
single cell recordings that we have been

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
single cell recordings that we have been
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.230
single cell recordings that we have been
doing since and three months I spent in

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240
doing since and three months I spent in
 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.030

so we she even I got a desk in his
 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.390
so we she even I got a desk in his
office and I shared the same lab with

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400
office and I shared the same lab with
 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.870
office and I shared the same lab with
him so he's a fantastic mentor and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880
him so he's a fantastic mentor and
 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.790
him so he's a fantastic mentor and
extremely advice that we can now share

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800
extremely advice that we can now share
 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.980
extremely advice that we can now share
the price together

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990
the price together
 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.940

at the airport there's lots of people
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.760
at the airport there's lots of people
standing here so they trying to get me

or two o'clock I probably better have to
leave but I saw that it was a number

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230
leave but I saw that it was a number
 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.710
leave but I saw that it was a number
from Sweden so therefore I I made an

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
from Sweden so therefore I I made an
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.170
from Sweden so therefore I I made an
exception and took the fall

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180
exception and took the fall
 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.110
