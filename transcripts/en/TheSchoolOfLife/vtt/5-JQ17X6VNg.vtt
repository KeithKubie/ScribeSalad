00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.410
Many of us feel that our societies are a little
– or even plain totally – ‘unfair’.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.980
But we have a hard time explaining our sense
of injustice to the powers that be in a way

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.430
that sounds rational and without personal
pique or bitterness.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.660
That’s why we need John Rawls, a twentieth-century
American philosopher who provides us with

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.890
a failproof model for identifying what truly
might be unfair – and how we might gather

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.850
support for fixing things.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.970
Rawls: http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/35/100835-004-0A003A0A.jpg

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.920
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, USA in 1921,
Rawls—nicknamed Jack—was exposed, and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.480
responded, to the injustices of the modern
world from a very young age.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.269
As a child, he witnessed at first hand shocking
poverty in the United States,

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.269
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qhA2oMrxkIQ/Tj6AiqtlZqI/AAAAAAAAErs/djyozUjG9A8/s1600/There%2527s_no_way_like_The_american_way.jpg

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.219
the death of his brothers from an illness
he unwittingly transmitted to them, and the

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.780
horrors and lawlessness of the Second World
War.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.780
http://haveblogwilltravel.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/old_town_warsaw_waf-2012-1501-311945.jpg

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.609
All this inspired him to go into academia:
he wanted to use the power of ideas to change

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.500
the unjust world he was living in.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.030
It was the publication of A Theory of Justice
in 1971 that properly made Rawls’s name.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.030
http://c2.bibtopia.com/h/565/846/734846565.0.m.jpg

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
Having read and widely discussed his book,
Bill Clinton was to label Rawls ‘the greatest

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.470
political philosopher of the twentieth century’–
and had him over to the White House for dinner

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.710
on a regular basis.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.600
What, then, does this exemplar of fairness
have to tell the modern world?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.950
TEXT: 1.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.210
Things as they are now are patently unfair

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.920
The statistics all point to the radical unfairness
of society.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.230
Comparative charts of life expectancy and
income projections direct us to a single overwhelming

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.230
moral.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.230
Here are three important example charts but
we probably should re-draw them (a small graphic

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.230
design task) for the film so that we haven’t
stolen theirs: http://pgpf.org/sites/default/files/sitecore/media%20library/PGPF/Chart-Archive/0015_life-expectancy-full.gif

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.230
I’d also suggest the first graph on this
website--it’s from a video: http://ethericstudies.org/responsibility/one_percent.htm

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.230
Here’s for the whole world:
http://thesocietypages.org/graphicsociology/files/2009/05/conley_champagne_distribution.png

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.230
But day-to-day, it can be hard to take this
unfairness seriously, especially in relation

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.230
to our own lives.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.370
That’s because so many voices are on hand
telling us that, if we work hard and have

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.530
ambition, we can make it.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.460
Rawls was deeply aware of how the American
Dream seeped through the political system

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.860
and into individual hearts – and he knew
its corrosive, regressive influence.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.860
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/THIS_IS_AMERICA..._WHERE_EVERY_BOY_CAN_DREAM_OF_BEING_PRESIDENT._-_NARA_-_515762.jpg

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.190
He was a statistician who knew that the rags-to-riches
tales were overall so negligible as not to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.840
warrant serious attention by political theorists.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.370
Indeed, mentioning them was merely a clever
political sleight of hand designed to prevent

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.040
the powerful from having to undertake the
necessary task of reforming society.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.700
Rawls understood that debates about unfairness
and what to do about it often get bogged down

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.840
in arcane details and petty squabbling which
mean that year after year, nothing quite gets

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840
done.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Barack_Obama_presidential_debate_preparations.jpg

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.870
What Rawls was therefore after was a simple,
economical and polemical way to show people

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.870
how their societies were unfair and what they
might do about it.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.870
TEXT: 2.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.390
Imagine if you were not you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.060
Rawls intuitively understood that a lot of
the reason why societies don’t become fairer

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.880
is that those who benefit from current injustice
are spared the need to think too hard about

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.840
what it would have been like to be born in
different circumstances.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.060
So he devised one of the greatest thought
experiments in the history of political thought,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.060
He called it: ‘the veil of ignorance.’

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.660
Show in text: THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.660
and show a picture

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.730
Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves in a conscious,
intelligent state before our own birth, but

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.460
without any knowledge of what circumstances
we were going to be born into; our futures

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.470
shrouded by a veil of ignorance.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.420
Hovering high above the planet (Rawls was
fascinated by the Apollo space programme),

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.350
we wouldn’t know what sort of parents we’d
have, what our neighbourhoods would be like,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.510
how the schools would perform, what the local
hospital could do for us, how the police and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.900
judicial systems might treat us and so on…

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.900
satellite view: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Flat_earth_night.png

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.030
The question that Rawls asks us all to contemplate
is: if we knew nothing about where we’d

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.740
end up, what sort of a society would it feel
safe to enter?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.470
The ‘veil of ignorance’ stops us thinking
about all those who have done well and draws

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.750
our attention to the appalling risks involved
in entering, for example, US society as if

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.250
it were a lottery– without knowing if you’d
wind up the child of an orthodontist in Scottsdale,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.250
Arizona

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.250
one option//example: https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8340/8240125300_bb65771f96_b.jpg

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.240
or as the offspring of a black single mother
in the rougher bits of eastern Detroit.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240
one option/example: http://pixabay.com/p-279457/?no_redirect

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.900
Would any sane birth-lottery player really
want to take the gamble of ending up in the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.720
society we now have?

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.440
Probably not--they’d insist that the rules
of the entire game had to be changed.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.400
Otherwise it would be too risky.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.430
TEXT: 3.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.069
You know what needs to be fixed

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:30.889
Rawls answers the question for us: any sane
participant of the veil of ignorance experiment

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.300
is going to want a society with a number of
things in place: they’ll want the schools

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.509
to be very good, the hospitals to function
brilliantly, unimpeachable and fair access

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.669
to the law and decent housing for everyone.

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.360
The veil of ignorance forces observers to
accept that the country they’d really want

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.259
to be born randomly into would almost certainly
be a version of Switzerland or Denmark.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.800
In other words, we know what sort of a society
we want to live in.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.099
We just haven’t focused on it properly until
now - because the choices have already been

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.110
made.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.740
Rawls’s experiment allows us to think more
objectively about what a fair society looks

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.590
like in its details.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.159
When addressing major decisions about the
allocation of resources we need only ask ourselves:

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:17.059
‘how would I feel about this issue if I
were stuck behind the veil of ignorance?’

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:22.629
The fair answer emerges directly when we contemplate
what we would need in order still to be adequately

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.099
positioned in the worst case scenario.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:26.199
TEXT: 4.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.339
What to do next

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.250
A lot will depend on what’s wrong with your
society.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.861
In this sense, Rawls was usefully undoctrinaire
– he recognised that the veil of ignorance

00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:39.630
experiment throws up different issues in different
contexts: in some, the priority might be to

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.389
fix air pollution, in others, the school system.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.159
But crucially, Rawls provides us with a tool
to critique our current societies based on

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.620
a beautifully simple experiment.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.199
We’ll know we finally have made our societies
fair when we will be able to say in all honesty,

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.710
from a position of imaginary ignorance before
our births, that we simply wouldn’t mind

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.370
at all what kind of circumstances our future
parents might have and what sort of neighbourhoods

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.339
we might be born into.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.870
The fact that we simply couldn’t sanely
take on such a challenge now is a measure

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.460
of how deeply unfair things remain – and
therefore how much we still have left to achieve.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.039
All this John Rawls has helped us to see.
