Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Theater

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.540
and believe it or not, theater in England doesn't end with Shakespeare.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.120
Nope, it's going to take some buzzkill Protestants to shut down that iambic-pentama-party.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.580
But, we're going to meet them next time.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.440
Today we're going to look at English drama after Shakespeare,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.720
explore the work of Shakespeare's contemporary, Ben Jonson,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.920
and check out some disturbingly violent Jacobean and Caroline revenge tragedies.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.620
We'll end with a visit to the Caroline Court Masques, which were created because nobles

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.160
were like, "theater is amazing! We want to act too!" Ugh, amateurs.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.940
You're making me look bad!

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.020
We ended our last episode with Ben Jonson's tribute to his old pal Shakespeare.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.800
Jonson belongs with Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe as one of the big-deal playwrights of the English Renaissance.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.940
But his plays are harder to love.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.540
They're very witty, but also very wordy,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.620
which is funny because that's pretty much what he said about Will.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.480
Elizabethan burn.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.980
Jonson was born in 1572. His father died before his birth and his mother married a bricklayer.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.940
So when it came time to go to university, Jonson had to become an apprentice bricklayer instead.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.840
He was not psyched.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.940
Eventually he went off to the Netherlands to become a soldier

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.340
but then got tired of windmills and killing people, so he came back to London to work as an actor and a playwright,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.200
though apparently he wasn't much of an actor.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.620
He wrote some tragedies and some comedies and his plays got him into trouble a lot

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.420
as he tended to fill them with racy political passages and personal attacks.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.920
Unlike Shakespeare, Jonson specialized in city comedies with plenty of contemporary references.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.180
Like Shakespeare, and everyone it seems, his work is deeply indebted to Ploutus and Terence.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.100
Jonson is best known for his Comedies of the Humours.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.060
The theory of the four humours said that bodies were composed of black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.580
and that illness resulted when the humours were out of balance.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360
Bring on the leeches and the purgatives.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.800
But even in a healthy body, it was thought one or two humours predominated

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.860
and these determined someone's personality

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.420
which could be bilious, choleric, sanguine or phlegmatic.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.780
Yorick is a phlegmat through and through, well, except for the parts of him that are hollow.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.360
Anyway, if you read Jonson, you'll find that his vision of humanity is a lot less expansive than Shakespeare's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.780
but he's still a lot of fun.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.520
Let's look at one of Jonson's greatest plays: Volpone,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.040
first performed at the Globe by Shakespeare's company, The King's Men.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.180
It's a comedy that takes an intensely skeptical view of human nature.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.560
Volpone is about humans behaving like animals if animals behaved really poorly

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.740
and then lawyered up. You can think of it as the crass menagerie.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.660
Volpone, whose name means fox, comes up with a hilarious prank

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.200
He's going to fool a bunch of his friends

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.420
into thinking he's on his death bed.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.860
LOL. So with the help of his servant Mosca, which means fly, he pretends to be violently ill.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.880
Voltore, vulture, Corbaccio, raven, and Corvino, crow,  all come to his house in Venice,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.220
bringing lavish gifts because they're hoping Volpone will bequeath them all his stuff.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.920
Corbaccio disinherits his son just to impress Volpone.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.900
Corvino agrees to let Volpone sleep with his young beautiful wife.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.740
The beautiful wife resists, and Corbaccio's disinherited son rescues her.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.920
They accuse Volpone of attempted rape, but Voltore, a lawyer, has the wife and the son imprisoned instead.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920
What a fowl move.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.800
Thinking like a fox, Volpone then decides it will be even more hilarious if he pretends to be dead,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.140
and makes everyone believe he's left his fortune to Mosca.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.200
The bird dudes go to court to contest Volpone's will.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.700
Mosca tries to keep Volpone's money.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.800
Volpone shows up in court and tells everyone what jerks the bird guys are.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.680
I mean, he's not wrong?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.980
The judge punishes them, but because it's finally time for a little moral authority,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.560
he also punishes Volpone and Mosca and I mean, he's not wrong either.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.700
By the end, Volpone has lost his money and his health, and he's going to prison, maybe forever.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.180
I'm never going to look at a fox the same way again.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.440
Thank you Thought Bubble!

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.780
I guess that was funny?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.900
As you can see, this is a comedy that feels very different from the comedies of Shakespeare.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.020
It's compact and elegantly plotted, but the psychology is a lot less nuanced.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.820
The morality is a lot less ambiguous, and characters are more stereotypical

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.020
and thin stand-ins for animals.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.400
We laugh with Shakespeare's characters, but we laugh at Jonson's characters

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.480
as they basically try to out-terrible one another.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.420
And whereas women are the center of Shakespeare's comedies, in Jonson's comedies,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.120
they hardly matter at all.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.120
In Volpone, Corvino's wife Celia is only present as a potential rape victim.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.460
Her own thoughts and desires don't matter, which is ugly.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.420
And where Shakespeare's tone is fairly hopeful in the comedies, Jonson's is not.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.020
Does Jonson seem dark? Well, theater is actually about to get a lot darker

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.580
with incest, werewolves, poisoned incense, poisoned pictures, poisoned swords,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.900
poisoned everything, basically, including poisoned skulls.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.280
I wonder if there's something Yorick is keeping from me.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.240
Anyways, yes, it's revenge tragedy, one of the most decadent forms of English renaissance drama.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.500
When our boy Ben Jonson was just back from the Netherlands, he played the lead role

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.640
in one of the first examples, Thomas Kyd's "The Spanish Tragedy" from 1587.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.900
Revenge tragedy borrows its form from Seneca, but where Seneca is extremely interested in moral choice,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.520
these plays are much more interested in lurid forms of murder.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.920
Though to be honest, Seneca was interested in that, too.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.720
As Vindici says in the 1606 play "The Revenger's Tragedy," which was probably written by Thomas Middleton,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.600
"When the bad bleed, then is the tragedy good."

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.460
So yeah, there's a lot of blood.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.100
Many tragedies also have meta-theatrical elements like plays inside plays or

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.280
scenes of intentional disguise, or characters performing madness.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.740
Shakespeare writes an on-the-nose revenge tragedy in "Titus Andronicus," which owes a huge debt to Seneca,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.820
then elevates the genre with "Hamlet" by making us feel very deeply for the revenger and

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.840
having Hamlet constantly question the morality of his actions.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.560
Until the play's final scenes, he's still debating the righteousness of revenge

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.080
and wondering if there's a way to escape the tragic cycle.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.560
He kills a lot of people but he never becomes a complete villain

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.260
and even in the end, we still side with him.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.340
Most playwrights weren't that high-minded.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.860
John Ford's "Tis Pity She's a Whore" is a Romeo and Juliet story except Romeo and Juliet

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.000
are brother and sister.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.640
There's a lot of random murder and lewd dancing and in the climactic scene

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.300
the brother kills his pregnant sister and comes back into the banquet hall with her heart on the end of his sword.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.560
Remember when you thought "Cymbeline" was intense?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.920
Seems a little quaint now, don't it?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.480
There's also "The Duchess of Malfi," in which a woman's brothers drive her mad by making wax statues

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.580
of her dead children because she marries below her station.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.780
And "The Revenger's Tragedy," in which a duke makes out with a poisoned skull and then

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.420
gets stabbed while he watches his wife betray him with another man.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.120
But here's a surprise.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.660
though God doesn't tend to go for anything as fancy as lunatics performing dance numbers.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.880
Other critics, though, insist that Jacobean tragedies are so extreme because they are a radical form

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.180
that is deliberately flouting restrictive social codes and accepted norms of behavior.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.700
They show the stark problems of sex and class underlying Jacobean complacency.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.860
Still others think they're mostly interested in acting out sadistic fantasies

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.580
and delivering just shocks, thrills.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.100
The last genre we'll discuss today is the court masque, a very fancy kind of theater

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.460
that was performed by and for nobles with professional actors taking on the comic roles

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.280
because as everyone knows, nobles are not funny.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.540
Why were the court masques so popular?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:02.560
Well, they affirmed existing power structures and they put the royals in some really mind-blowing doublets.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.400
Work it nobles.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.380
Masques have their roots in the Middle Ages,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:12.180
and derive from the pageants, processionals and tableau vivants that were created to celebrate royal occasions

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.120
like births, marriages. In court masques, a mix of professional performers and nobles,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.320
or if you were unlucky, just nobles would act out some allegorical scene backed by sumptuous scenery and

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.480
attired in knockout garb.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.460
Most of the action was set to music.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.940
Often, the men of the court would present a masque and then the women of the court

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.620
would answer it with another.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.620
The masques themselves were often preceded by comic or grotesque anti-masques,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.740
showing a disruption of the social order, like say, a couple of rogue satyrs up to no good.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.580
Maybe making trouble in the neighborhood,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.700
which would be magically fixed by the arrival of the kings' representatives onstage.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.820
Most Jacobean and Caroline playwrights wrote a masque or two

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.600
but the foremost masque maker was, fanfare please, Mr. Ben Jonson,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.800
who managed to put those badly behaved animals aside long enough to dream up

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.200
confections about nymphs and goddesses and constellations.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.320
What a job.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.480
Jonson's partner was Inigo Jones, the absolute genius of renaissance set design

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.980
and one of the crucial figures in the transition of theater construction toward the proscenium arch

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.660
that we know and sometimes love today.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:48.000
Jones had spent some time in Italy and absorbed the innovations in Italian stagecraft.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.960
He introduced perspectival staging to England and invented all sorts of awesome stage machinery

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.220
like clouds that would carry nobles to the stage floor.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.580
The court masque bromance of Jonson and Jones eventually broke up, though, because

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:07.260
Jonson thought the words were more important and Jones thought the pictures were more important

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.000
and well, I suppose the tragedy is that they were both right and wrong.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.620
Maybe they'd exhausted the nymph genre anyway.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.940
So, do all of these revenge tragedies seem excessive? They are.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.600
Do all these court masques sound really expensive? They were.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.280
And that's going to make some Puritans very unhappy.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:32.020
So enjoy your poisoned incense and majestic scenery while you can because pretty soon the Puritans

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.020
are going to make like those goths and visigoths and tank theater for a while

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.100
We've seen this cycle before in Western theater, from simplicity to virtuosity to decadence to bye-bye theater.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.000
Maybe we'll see it again.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.800
It's almost like history does this thing where it repeats itself?

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.200
Anyway, thanks for watching. It's been sanguine. Curtain.
