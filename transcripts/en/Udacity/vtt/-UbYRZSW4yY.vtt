00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:08.700
As I mentioned earlier, I can't really teach you software design. You have to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.280
actively learn it. To encourage this, part of your grade for the course will be

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.850
a measure of your participation in it. This is necessarily a subjective element,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.110
but I can let you know of some of the considerations that go into it.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.200
First is your teammates' evaluations of you on the projects and assignments.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.715
Also your engagement in the quizzes that are part of the lessons. Third is your

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:38.130
non-gratuitous participation on the class form. I consider this course, itself,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.920
as a design project. Although it has been offered many times before, it has

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.710
necessarily been adapted to deal with the constraints of web-based delivery and

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.880
a large number of students. Therefore, I expect some elements will work

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.980
better than others. I specifically would like to solicit your contributions,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.452
such as the following. First, any bugs in the material. These can be as

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:04.144
trivial as typos, or as vague as questions about unclear lesson content.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:05.973
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:09.729
If you have any suggestions for additional content, as long as the suggestions

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.940
fit within the general intent of the course. Also, specific examples, either

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
generated by you or ones that you have seen that were particularly edifying.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.160
Alternative assignments or assignment questions. Even suggestions for

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.140
style elements that might be added to the course. In general, the first

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.290
contributor on a particular item will get primary credit for that contribution.
