00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.438
- Hi, I'm Emily Heller,

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.974 align:start size:88% position:13%
and this is an
@midnight Master Class.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:11.978 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now when I'm not entertaining,
I love to entertain.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.447
At home, with a dinner party.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.616
And I'm gonna teach you how

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
to impress your
dinner party guests.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.888 align:start size:94% position:6%
All you need is a regular
cloth dinner napkin,

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.457
and an adventurous spirit.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.761
(soft piano music)

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.597 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're gonna lay it
flat out on the table.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.133 align:start size:97% position:3%
At this point, you should
maybe tell your guests like,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
hey guys, I invited
Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.003
And they'll be like, what
are you talking about?

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.405
And you'll be like, just wait.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.840
You're gonna grab two
corners like this,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.943
fold them right to the
middle, crease like that.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is a trick that
my dad taught me.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.549
By the end of this, you're
gonna know that that's bad.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.718
The next thing you do is you
grab the other two corners,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.421
you fold them toward the middle.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.955
We're halfway done, you guys.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.824
Please don't lose hope.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.894
Now grab the middle, right here,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.163
and fold it up like that.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.931 align:start size:81% position:19%
The next part, the
trickiest part,

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:07.400
but oh boy, is this
gonna be worth it.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.003
Grab, with your left
hand, just the corner.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.105
Careful not to grab the
napkin in the middle.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.841
And connect it to the other
corner on the other side.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
Same on the right,
just use your fingers.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.982
I think that was implied.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:27.654 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, in one swift motion,
you're gonna pull them apart

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:30.056
and hold it against your body,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.425
creating a brassiere.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
Marilyn Monroe is
at the dinner party.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.330 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's gonna leave
your guests saying,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.600 align:start size:88% position:13%
wow, this is definitely
a dinner party.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.471
Also, cook food.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
This has been an
@midnight Master Class.
