00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.400
People used to say comic books were just for
kids, but these days, playing a superhero

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.880
on the big screen is an actor’s fastest
way to superstardom.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.220
There aren’t many heroes more beloved than
Batman, set to go from a movie superhero to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.810
a Justice League universe star..

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.919
But not every actor to put on Batman’s cowl
ended up a hit – and one of the most influential

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.040
men to tackle the role never appeared on film
at all.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.230
Everyone has their favorites so make sure

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.730
Here is Screen Rant’s look at Batman: The
Actors Who Played Him Best.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.730
Adam West

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.920
Not every version of Bruce Wayne is shrouded
in darkness, but Adam West's starring role

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.699
in the original 1960s Batman TV show wasn't
just campy – it was more profitable and

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.600
popular than even modern superhero films could
hope for.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.200
After comics declined during the 1950s, West’s
technicolor take on the hero had entire families

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.499
glued to their TV sets.

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.659
As parents watched the insane hijinx of West's
caped crusader and the zany villains with

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.909
a smirk, the kids took every threat and villain
completely seriously - just like the show's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.909
hero.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.860
In a time when superheroes were anything but
cool, West didn't just have to take part in

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.000
absurd storylines, but couldn't be in on the
joke himself – and the fans loved him for

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.210
How many modern comedy stars could learn a
lesson from that?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.210
Michael Keaton

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.870
Two decades after West hung up the cape, comic
fans thought Tim Burton and Michael Keaton

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.970
were giving them another dose of camp with
1989’s Batman.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
Instead, they created a version of Batman
who was funny AND terrifying.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.600
Even if he was better known for his comedy
chops, Keaton perfectly captured the tortured,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.820
isolated side of Bruce Wayne, but was playful
enough to make the movie fun, not grim.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.900
Jack Nicholson's Joker gave him a towering
villain to match, and even without Robin by

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.160
his side, Keaton was the first actor to win
a Bat-sequel.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.450
Comic fans had sent 50,000 protest letters
to the studio when he was cast, but it was

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.710
Keaton who got the last laugh, remembered
as THE definitive Batman for entire generations.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.710
Val Kilmer

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.510
Burton and Keaton were impossible acts to
follow, but director Joel Schumacher and star

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.490
Val Kilmer tried their best.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.850
With Batman Forever, most of the twisted humor
turned into out of place, cheesy gags, and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.130
most fans gave up hope after one look at the
Batsuit's new nipples.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.909
Kilmer apparently butted heads with the crew
and director on set, but critics agreed that

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.299
his playboy persona was as Bruce Wayne was
convincing.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.120
In fact, Batman creator Bob Kane said Kilmer
was the closest he'd seen any actor come to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.599
his own idea of the superhero.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.849
In the end, the movie's villains were more
memorable than the hero, and Kilmer showed

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.670
that playing Batman on film relied on a lot
more than brooding and a rubber suit.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.930
George Clooney

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.480
After Val Kilmer passed on Batman &amp; Robin,
the studio turned to the one actor who embodied

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.569
Bruce Wayne's charm and good looks more than
any man on the planet.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.459
George Clooney's casting made sense – landing
the part right before he became a Hollywood

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.070
icon – but trying to recreate the camp of
the '60s TV show, but making sure Batman and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.889
Robin were in on every joke – was a total
failure.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:04.069
Clooney's dialogue, action and villains might
be "so bad it's good," but the actor has publicly

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.579
regretted the film ever since, even apologizing
to fans for ruining the Batman movie series.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.569
He doesn’t deserve all the blame, since
there's no denying that Clooney is as close

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.099
as an actor can get to the super-rich ladies
man comic fans have loved for decades.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.099
Christian Bale

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.810
By 2005, it wasn't just comic fans who wanted
to see Batman to be taken seriously, but movie

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.810
audiences everywhere.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.489
Director Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins
introduced a darker, more realistic version

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.409
of Bruce Wayne than any seen before, and Christian
Bale was the only man able to bring the character

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.409
to life.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.140
Training in martial arts and packing on muscle
to make sure he looked the part of a superhero,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.150
Bale tapped into the darker, angrier side
of the hero that no other actor had even tried

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.150
to touch.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.180
He still had a sense of humor, but it was
the drama and tension that helped the sequel

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.430
cross the billion dollar mark at the box office.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.889
Fans can debate the tone, the villains, and
Bale's one of a kind Batvoice, but the actor’s

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:57.219
trilogy of performances mean for millions,
he'll always be The Batman.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.359
Kevin Conroy

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.799
Who says you need to be seen to make your
mark on the Dark Knight?

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.920
Looking back, it’s hard to believe Warner
Bros. was on board with a cartoon aimed at

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.239
an adult audience, even choosing a film noir-influenced
art style for Batman: The Animated Series.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.769
But the writers made sure the stories were
polished, and actor Kevin Conroy provided

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.370
a voice for Batman that no fan will ever forget.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.690
It was Conroy who realized that Bruce Wayne
should be the performance, not Batman, and

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.550
his voices for each character were an instant
hit.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.000
The actor became the go-to voice of Batman
in animated TV, movies, and the award-winning

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.330
Arkham game series.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.110
To this day, the cartoon is hailed as one
of the greatest Batman properties ever created,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
and with more than two decades voicing the
hero, it’s safe to say Conroy’s place

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.310
in Batman history is guaranteed.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.910
Which of these Batman actors do YOU think
will stand the test of time?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.680
Do the directors and supporting cast deserve
some of the credit, or did one of these actor’s

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.310
nail the part better than any other?

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.759
