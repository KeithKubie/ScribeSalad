00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.367
JANE GOODALL: My mission was
to get close to the chimpanzees

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:08.132
and live among them,
to be accepted.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:11.934
When I was 10 and I said, "I'm
going to grow up, go to Africa,

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.733
and live with wild animals
and write books about them,"

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.033
everybody laughed.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.734
I wanted to do things which
men did and women didn't.

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:20.333
BRETT MORGEN: Jane
grew up in a time

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.000
when women did not do
the type of work she did.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.367
And she wasn't going
to be deterred.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.066
JANE GOODALL: Everything
was so different.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.799
I didn't have any
responsibilities except

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.100
to learn about the chimpanzees.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.400
Thanks to Brett
Morgen and the way

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.199
that he treated this footage,
it took me right back.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.667
BRETT MORGEN: We had 150
hours of disparate shots,

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.100
so we hired an army
of people to come in.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.133
And I gave them categories like
mating or eating or sleeping

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.934
so we could at
least see everything

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.166
grouped in succession
so we could

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.233
get a sense of what we had.

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.900
JANE GOODALL: And it was
very emotional for me

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.967
to just see my life unrolling.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:00.934
There was more about
my personal life

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:04.599
than there has been in
the other documentaries.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.699
BRETT MORGEN: I decided that it
needed to have a point of view.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.033
And I was going to express that
point of view through music.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.033
To achieve that, I
enlisted this support

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.633
and aid of Philip Glass.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.399
And, when Philip
delivered his first cue,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.000
I had tears going down my eyes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.300
I think he said, I think I might
have fallen in love with Jane.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.000
JANE GOODALL: And it's
come together to be

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.934
rather an extraordinary film.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:30.866
So what I hope is it's going to
bring back into people's minds

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:34.800
a renewed determination
to do their bit to save

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.567
what's left of this planet.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.833
