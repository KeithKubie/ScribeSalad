00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.700
So Pete, I'm going to talk element widths for a second.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.970
I've heard that relative widths are better suited for responsive design.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.610
Why is that?

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.690
Sure. Let's take a look at

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.870
this website for a second.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.940
It's got a beautiful, panoramic image that's 1200 pixels wide.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.500
On this laptop screen where the viewport width is 1280 pixels.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.910
No problem, the image fits just fine.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.460
Right.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.850
But now, what happens if you shrink the browser to a size that's below

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.590
the image's native width?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.460
Yeah! If I'm not careful,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.605
instead of shrinking and

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:35.790
re-scaling the image, the image will keep its original dimensions.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.340
Users will need to stroll left and right to see the whole image.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.890
Oh.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.560
That's ugly and annoying.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.650
Yeah. It's not a good experience.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.045
On the Nexus 7, about a third of the image is going to get cut off, but

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:52.345
on something like an iPhone 5, the users going to see less than half the image.

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:56.395
They're going to have to scroll left and right to see the whole thing.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:01:01.185
Since CSS pixels vary so widely across all these different devices, you

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:05.785
shouldn't count on a specific viewport width for your content to render well.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:10.230
Large CSS widths or even absolute positions can result in

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.960
elements that are either too big or don't fit on the screen at all.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.160
This is why you should use relative positions instead of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.164
absolute positions such as width 100%.
