[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt; Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.507 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
"THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS
JON STEWART.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.109 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
I'M EXCITED WE HAVE GOOD SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:13.679 line:91%
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT MY
GUEST, "SELMA" DIRECTOR

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.382 line:91%
AVA DUVERNAY, AND THIS MOVIE IS
PHENOMENAL. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:21.687 line:85%
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HER.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:32.098 line:91%
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW -- I THINK
WE'D ALL AGREE 2014 WAS NOT A

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:36.135 size:81% position:41% line:91%
GREAT YEAR FOR PEOPLE. BUT
I THINK THE HOPE WAS THAT

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.272 size:84% position:42% line:91%
2015 WOULD BRING SORT OF
A RESPITE FROM THE KINDS OF

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:47.480 align:start position:0% line:91%
TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT HAVE BECOME
ALL TOO FAMILIAR FOR US.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.482 line:91%
BUT, BUT -- OUR HEARTS ARE WITH
THE STAFF OF CHARLIE HEBDO AND

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:53.519 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEIR FAMILIES TONIGHT.
I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:59.459 line:91%
GO INTO TO COMEDY, YOU KNOW, AS
AN ACT OF COURAGE MAINLY BECAUSE

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.593 line:85%
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.729 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT SHOULDN'T BE AN ACT OF
COURAGE. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start position:0% line:91%
ESTABLISHED LAW.
BUT THOSE GUYS AT HEBDO HAD IT,

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:14.841 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
AND THEY WERE KILLED FOR THEIR
CARTOONS.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.509 align:start position:0% line:91%
STARK REMINDER THAT FOR THE MOST
PART THE LEGISLATORS AND

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:21.214 align:start position:0% line:91%
JOURNALISTS AND INSTITUTIONS
THAT WE JAB AND RIDICULE

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:26.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE NOT IN ANY WAY THE
ENEMY.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR HOWEVER FRUSTRATING OR
OUTRAGED THE BACK AND FORTH CAN

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:35.128 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BECOME IT'S STILL A BACK AND
FORTH A CONVERSATION AMONGST

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.429 align:start position:0% line:91%
THOSE ON LET'S CALL IT
TEAM CIVILIZATION.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:43.035 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE ONLY
CLARIFIES THAT REALITY.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:48.641 size:88% position:44% line:91%
BUT OF COURSE, OF COURSE OUR
GOAL TONIGHT IS NOT TO MAKE

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:54.480 line:91%
SENSE OF THIS BECAUSE THERE IS
NO SENSE TO BE MADE OF THIS.

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:59.752 line:91%
OUR GOAL AS IT IS ALWAYS IS TO
KEEP GOING. KEEP CALM AND CARRY

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.822 line:91%
ON OR WHATEVER VERSION OF THAT
SAYING IS IN YOUR DORM ROOM.
