have deep talents and the potential for
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.460
have deep talents and the potential for
engagement and we should explore it I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470
engagement and we should explore it I
 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.710

have fallen into using the phrase the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
have fallen into using the phrase the
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740
have fallen into using the phrase the
other climate crisis and I think I think

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
other climate crisis and I think I think
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300
other climate crisis and I think I think
it has a residence I what I mean by it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
it has a residence I what I mean by it
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069
it has a residence I what I mean by it
is that we we've become used to the fact

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
is that we we've become used to the fact
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.649
is that we we've become used to the fact
now at least I hope we have that there's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
now at least I hope we have that there's
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.850
now at least I hope we have that there's
a crisis in the world's natural

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
a crisis in the world's natural
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.399
a crisis in the world's natural
resources but I also think there is a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
resources but I also think there is a
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.550
resources but I also think there is a
crisis in our human resources and how we

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
crisis in our human resources and how we
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.980
crisis in our human resources and how we
use them and and one of the themes of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
use them and and one of the themes of
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.179
use them and and one of the themes of
the book is to make an analogy between

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
the book is to make an analogy between
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580
the book is to make an analogy between
the natural world and and the way our

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590
the natural world and and the way our
 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.980
the natural world and and the way our
lives operating we tend to think that we

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
lives operating we tend to think that we
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.199
lives operating we tend to think that we
you know we persuade ourselves because
