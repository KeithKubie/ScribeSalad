00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As we switch from one's -- one Sprint to the next,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I want to note that the importance in this whole effort

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of thinking through how partnerships will work with existing major project.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
HathiTrust was invoked in this  -- they

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and his team have been great supporters

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and deeply involved in figuring out how we work with

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and are ever -- interoperable with HathiTrust is  --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
thank you for helping us see some of that through the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Beta Sprint.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The fifth is called metadata interoperability services.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The DPL a -- DPLA,  over to you guys.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Okay. Good afternoon.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Is our great pleasure to be here on this event

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we thank you very much for the invitation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My name is Stephna Scolios.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We are heavily involved in the development in Europe over

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the last several years, and the last four years, a.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What we're going to present today is a system.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We have implanted during this years,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and leaving this activity -- may be in order to define the scope,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I would like to say how it fits with what we have heard

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
in this session. Take for example the first presentation,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where you had the three big organizations,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that said they would like to share their content.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And presented through the DPLA.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What was implemented if I understood correctly it was

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that gave a small number of data to the third one,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
who used their own metadata

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and president -- presentation schema to make the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
presentation public. So think of the whole country.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So you have thousands of medium, small libraries,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
different organizations, that represent their data,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
their content through different schemas for example.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Libraries use code or mediate -- museums use -- your is used by archives.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And the different -- these different variations of this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
schema represent their content,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
based on specific usage of their content.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So you really need some mapping.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Especially on where you have all the data collected in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
some place, but what really uses the metadata

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and the presentations -- interoperability of access is gained through these mappings,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
they can be at the semantic level,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the involvement of the use of experts at least in the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
beginning of the organization to rip is in the mapping.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Based on this involvement with all this activity within

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Europe, we implemented a system that will be percent now.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Hello. As you already learned,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm going to presenting the data services which is our --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I would also like to thank the DPLA steering committee

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for encouraging us  to submit something for the DPLA.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We are of course happy that it can lead  to some cooperation between us.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So to start, services or -- supports aggregation workflow.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
As we mentioned, mainly in the European region and typically,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
these work to score -- corresponds three main states.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Mainly the first one is to gather providers without data, and in this step,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
which means we are gathering metadata and materialization.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The second step is as the professor mentioned, to try to connect

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
or align the different provider metadata.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Aggregation data model, and Jew that,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
we need visual editor for the -- in order for providers

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to be able to implement and -- between their methods

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and the aggregation and metadata schema.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Finally the third step is to --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is essential -- this is a the -- you can see the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
schema coming from the provider side.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
When the right part is the aggregation target schema.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
In this specific case,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it's the museum standard that is being used widely now in

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Europe. While in the middle of the screen,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you see specific subject that corresponds to the selected

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
button, and it is actually the mapping area.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
In order for a provider to map his data to the target

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
model, he actually needs to drag

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and drop in this case we have a single one-to-one mapping.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Gets mapped to the title of the target schema.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This is done by drag and drop action

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and every mapping action like that,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
corresponds -- is translated to the team in the back,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
so that you have a formal way to transform your data

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
between the two schemas and the -- that can be maintained and formalized.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The buttons and others, the user can perform conditional mappings,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
structural mappings, string concatenation,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
concatenation of elements and so on.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So in practice,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
MINT has been used by several  aggregations in the European sector -- sector.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
One of the first and most important ones is the Athena Project that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
gathered over 5 million museum items from organizations

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
all over Europe including Russia and Israel.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And under this schema I mentioned earlier,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
use green is a visual aggregator that offers support --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
EU Screen. Certain ecological monuments

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and signs with a special focus on 3-D digital resources for cultural activities.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Cross domain aggregations like Judaica Europena.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
In digitization projects and so on.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Also MINT is used outside of aggregators for different

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
scope for supporting the evolution of the data models

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
like  prototype and European data model,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
by the European in order to publish -- since most of

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
those schemas also have the semantic version of this,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
focusing towards the lean data publication,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
one of the first one is the link to data byte use green. -- By EUScreen.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And we are collaborating with other themes in order for

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it to be reused. Through all these aggregations and projects,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
we have gathered the growing number of common providers.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It's approximately 300 institutions and 500 users so far.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
What we are learning together with them

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and with the help us define and create services for is that aggregation corresponds

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to domain experts.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Is the natural next step after annotation, and it's a step that is not a procedure, usually is ongoing.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And of course aggregation -- aggregators have envisioned

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
these past two years has led to the introduction of new

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
casts. And as a result, new services for cleaning, I can,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and reconciling. Apparently went too far.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
We tried to help the DPLA to  design and operate

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
appropriate workflows for the delivery of metadata from the diverse institutions.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
That you plant aggregate. And help providers agree to the DPL a -- DPLA layer

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
regardless of  different institutions, or the level of adoption of any DPLA requirements.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And of course, supports the natural evolution of data modeling with the

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
metadata schema itself. Or terminologies being used and so on.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I will not go on about that.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The people you can find more information here are the URL.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You can of course -- you are free to contact us,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and there is also the DPLA  Beta Sprint server where you

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
can use the mapping tool forr several other domains start of. Thank you very much.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
[Applause]

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We do have time for a couple questions for these

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
gentlemen who've come so far.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Thank you for traveling such a distance.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Trying to avoid strikes.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
[Laughter].

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We have some occupying protests and other things for you.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Actually, I live next to the major street. Like I never moved.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Another form of interoperability.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Exactly.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
John Arnold from Massachusetts.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
A quick easy question, -- geeky question,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
are you actually doing that mapping at the sort of abstract schema level

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
or do you actually do it by examples

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and do you think your system could learn by example by

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
having professional catalogers go for one other was an

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
example and let it learn what the --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It doesn't actually learn,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
since it's really sensitive at list with the provider

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that we used to work with to tell them that anything is happening automatically.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Or they want to be really sure that they can validate the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
end results. So the idea is that usually on the target,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
we have specific data model, usually a standard domain,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
so it's something concrete while on the inputs we have

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
provided a to -- data that maybe standards,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
maybe they think that it is standard but have customized it so it is standard home or.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Usually we work on the instance level.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That up let their specific connection.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Say you want to aggregate? That map it

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and if they use it coherently throughout the organization,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
they can use this stored mapping for subsequent inputs.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Sir, with a microphone, yes Sir?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Are the mappings themselves published as open data for

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
example as RDF triples for end,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
can they be reused by others? Other applications?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
For the time being, mappings of course they are stored

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and people can download them

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and load them in other instances. And of course,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
they can share it to in them,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
so we had the case especially with museums that they were

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
serving the same metadata schema,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
so someone created the master template mapping.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And they use it as a template to create their own specialized mappings.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Now, as we see again through the aggregator evolution,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
back in three, four years you're, asking,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
give us were metadata records in the format that we are

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
suggesting. Now it seems that people tend -- and in general,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
aggregators tend to ask for the original data together with we formalized mapping.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And mapping becomes a part of the data that is being transferred between institutions.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So yes, currently it's in excess of form,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
but for schemas and links data publications,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
there are subsequent mappings that can be also published

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
as RDF triples.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So your question -- the answer to your question is that

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
mapping yes,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
becomes part of the total providers community.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Wonderful. Thank you both for coming.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Applause]
