Hi, I'm John Green, 
this is Crash Course US History,

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.180
and today we're gonna talk about July 4th, which in the United States is known
as Independence Day.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.780
This is the day that Americans celebrate our Independence from Great Britain 
by doing what we do best:

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.260
blowing stuff up, offering significant
discounts on mattresses,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.420
driving long distances for uncomfortable family interactions,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.580
and eating a lot of grilled meat.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.760
[intro music]

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.880
Right, so the story goes that the founders
of this nation signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4th 1776,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.020
parting ways with King George
to found the freest, finest nation on the face of the Earth.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.180
[Libertage: America: It's our birthday!]

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.260
Yeah, except the continental congress actually
approved a resolution of independence on July 2nd.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.060
The Lee Resolution was proposed by Richard
Henry Lee of Virginia in June of 1776,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.100
and was a simple legal 
declaration of separation from England.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.329
John Adams got so excited about it that he
wrote to his wife Abigail,

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.810
The second day of July 1776 will be the most
memorable epic in the history of America.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.420
I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated
by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.320
It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade,
with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.319
and illuminations from one end of this continent
to the other, from this time forward forevermore.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.399
So what happened on the fourth?

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.789
Well, not that much, actually.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.770
The Declaration of Independence was the formal
announcement of independence and its text was approved on July 4th 1776.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.160
The fancy parchment version with all the pretty
calligraphy wouldn't get drawn up until July 19th,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.500
and most members of the Congress signed
the Declaration on August 2nd.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.960
Adams may have been wrong about the date,
but he was definitely right about the celebration.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.920
Americans started celebrating the 4th of July
as early as 1777, and, as Adams predicted,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.439
the holiday was observed with feasts, 13 gun
salutes, and fireworks.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.609
Why don't we call them illuminations anymore,
Stan?

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.240
Y'know, people can say, like, "oh, we put
a man on the moon

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.260
and we can refrigerate our meat now"

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.799
but I miss the old days!

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.580
Anyway, in 1778 George Washington celebrated
the Fourth by giving his soldiers a double ration of rum,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.379
and also there was much more
shooting than usual.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.969
But while the people celebrated the anniversary
from the beginning,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.880
the federal government took its sweet time in formalizing the holiday.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.180
Independence day became an unpaid holiday
for federal employees in 1870

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.920
and became a paid day off in 1938.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.721
4th of July observances have evolved over
the years,

00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:34.790
but they generally involve patriotic displays, 
including decorations, fire, and explosives.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.920
Essentially, we celebrate our independence
by having a one-day fake war each summer.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.600
Huzzah! 
[pops party popper]

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.620
Aw, freedom-tenitis.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.616
Early observances were
marked by huge bonfires,

00:02:46.616 --> 00:02:51.900
but the litigious nature of modern American society has greatly reduced the number of bonfires.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.110
However, we still have a lot of fireworks
on the 4th of July.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.700
Many cities and towns across the country sponsor
fireworks displays on the Fourth;

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.300
New York's fireworks display is the largest in the nation.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.940
Despite the grandeur of these officially sanctioned
displays,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.040
many, many individuals across the nation feel the need to blow stuff up on their
own in their yards,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.580
because, y'know, they have all of their fingers and that seems like too many.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.480
Many states have restricted the sale and personal
use of fireworks

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.580
freedom haters!

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.120
but would-be patriots find their way to marginal neighborhoods every year to buy fireworks out of the backs of vans.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.960
In my neighborhood, these personal pyrotechnic
celebrations started about mid-May and continue well into August,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.470
causing my dog to have a
very stressful summer.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.430
John Adams's prediction about gunfire holds
true as well.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.720
On most military bases, 50 gunshots -- one
for each state --

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.400
are fired at noon on July 4th as a salute to the Union.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.909
And in Stan's neighborhood, where you go to
buy the fireworks out of the backs of vans,

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.150
celebratory gunfire is common throughout the
year.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.879
Here is an actual bullet hole in Stan's actual
window.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.260
Stan, can we get the Libertage again?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.400
[Libertage: America - seriously, a bullet
came into my house]

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.000
In the 19th century, many ex-presidents celebrated
the 4th of July by dying.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.169
Both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams died
July 4th 1826,

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.739
and James Madison died on the 4th of July in 1831.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.349
Calvin "Silent Cal" Coolidge was born on July
4th 1876,

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.370
but as he was never demonstrably alive, no one really cares that much.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.810
Finally, lest we forget, Americans also celebrate
the 4th of July by eating.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.939
Millions of Americans host cook-outs to celebrate
independence,

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.490
and the greatest spectacle in professional sports happens every year on the 4th of July.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.980
I am referring of course to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.510
The current world record is 68 HDBs, hot dogs
and buns, in ten minutes.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.940
That means the world record holder, Joey Chestnut,
consumed about 28,500 calories in ten minutes,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.170
but don't worry -- he threw it up shortly
thereafter.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.810
So happy 4th of July from all of us here at
Crash Course.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.560
We may not celebrate American independence
on the right day, but I would argue that,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.280
in spite of it all, it's still worth celebrating.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.880
Thanks for watching; I'll see you next week.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.390
[pops party popper]
 Boop!

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.720

And our graphics team is Thought Cafe.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.470
Every week, there's a new caption for the
Libertage.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.354
If you'd like to suggest one, you can do so
in comments,

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:15.740
where you can also ask questions about today's video that will be answered by our team of historians.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.538
Thank you for watching Crash Course, and as
we say in my home town,

00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:19.790
don't forget to be awesome.
