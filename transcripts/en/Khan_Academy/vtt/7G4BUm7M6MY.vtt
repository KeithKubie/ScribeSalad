00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.100
- [Narrator] In this video,
we're going to explore the idea

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.330
of an indifference curve.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.400
Indifference.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.290
Indifference curve.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.850
And what it is, is it
describes all of the points,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.980
all of the combinations of
things to which I am indifferent.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.650
In the past, we've thought
about maximizing total utility.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.310
Now, we're going to talk
about all of the combinations

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.230
that essentially give us
the same total utility.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.230
So, let's draw a graph

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.720
that tells us all of the different
combinations of two goods

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.850
to which we are indifferent

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.490
and like I've, we've mentioned before,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.050
we're focusing on two goods,
because if we did three goods

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.440
we would have to do it
in three dimensions,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.000
and four goods would get very abstract.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.910
So, let's say in this
axis, the vertical axis,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.160
this is going to be the quantity

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.780
and we'll stay with the chocolate
and the fruit trade-off.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.250
Those are the only two
things that we consume.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.190
So, this is going to be the
quantity of chocolate in bars

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.130
and in the horizontal axis,
this is going to be the quantity

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.810
of fruit and this is going
to be in pounds of fruit.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.360
And this will go, see
this is 10, this is 20

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.997
this is 10, and this is 20

00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:12.250
and this would be 15, 5, 5, and then 15.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.170
And let's say, let's say that
right now, at some point,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.690
I am consuming 5 pounds of fruit per month

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.240
and 15 bars of chocolate per month.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060
So, that would put me right there.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
And if someone were to ask,
"Sal, how would you feel,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.040
how would you feel if instead
of that, instead of that,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400
I were to give you, let's say,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400
10 bars of chocolate and 7
pounds, and 7 pounds of fruit?"

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.700
And I would say, you know
what, I'm indifferent.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.530
I wouldn't care whether I have,
so this right over here is,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.660
I wouldn't care whether I
have 15 bars of chocolate

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.810
and 5 pounds of fruit or
whether I have 10 bars

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.560
of chocolate and 7 pounds of fruit.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.960
I am indifferent between these two.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.920
I have introspected on what I like

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.540
and what I derive benefit
and satisfaction out of,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.720
and I get the same total
utility out of either of these,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.570
out of either of these points.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.300
So, both of these are on
the same indifference curve

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.410
and in general, I can plot all
of the different combinations

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580
that give me the exact same total utility

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.130
and it might look something like this.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.760
Let me try to draw it
as neatly as possible.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.170
I'll do it in magenta.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.630
It might look something like this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.490
and then keep going all
the way down like that.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.410
So, any point on this
curve right over here,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.180
I'm indifferent relative
to my current predicament

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
of 15 bars and 5 pounds of chocolate.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.330
So, that is my indifference curve.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.210
Indifference.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.010
Indifference curve.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.960
Now, let's think about, so, obviously,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.250
if I go all over here, 20 pounds of fruit,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.820
and I don't know, that looks
about 2 bars of chocolate,

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.220
to me, the same utility
based on my preferences,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.780
as where I started off with.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.870
So, someone just swapped everything out.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.030
I would just kind of, you know,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.650
shrug my shoulders and
say yeah, no big deal.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.483
I wouldn't be happy.

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:13.360
I wouldn't be sad.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.230
I am indifferent.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.427
Now, what about points down here?

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:20.920
What about a point like this?

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.060
Well, that is clearly not
preferable because, for example,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.320
that point I just showed,
I can show a point

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.070
on the indifference curve
where I am better off.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.820
For example, that point that I just did,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.820
that's 5 pounds of fruit and
about 5 bars of chocolate,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.500
but assuming that the marginal
benefit of more chocolate

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.780
is positive, and the way I've drawn this,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.060
or the assumption is that it is, then,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.610
I'm obviously getting more benefit

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.520
if I'm get even more chocolate per month.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.740
And so, anything down here,
below the indifference curve,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.430
is not preferred.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.620
Not preferred.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.630
Preferred.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.210
And, using the same exact
logic, anything out here,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.350
anything out here,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.780
well, that would be good
because we're neutral

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.640
between all of these points on the curve

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.300
but this green point right over here,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.520
I have the same number of
bars as a point on the curve,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.810
but I have a lot more pounds of fruit.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.970
It looks like I have 11
or 12 pounds of fruit.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.150
So, assuming that I'm
getting marginal benefits

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.980
from those incremental pounds of fruit,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.950
and we will make that assumption,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.270
then, this right over
here, anything out here,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.470
is going to be preferred.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.500
So, this whole area is
going to be preferred

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.440
to everything on the curve.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.363
Preferred.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.440
And the whole area down
here, is, obviously, we've

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.670
not preferred to anything on the curve.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.710
And let me, just to show
you this, not those points.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.310
So, all of this, and let me do that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.290
in a different color actually,
'cause our curve is purple,

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.200
everything in blue is not preferred.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.570
Now, the last thing I want
to think about in this video

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.700
is what the slope of this
indifference curve tells us.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.480
When I talk about the slope,
and this is really kind

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.110
of an idea out of Calculus,

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.420
'cause we're used to thinking
about slopes of lines.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.730
So, if you give me a line like that,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.220
the slope is how much does
my vertical axis change

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.810
for every change in my horizontal axis?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.410
So, in a typical algebra class,
that axis is your Y axis.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.110
That is your X axis.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.960
And when we think about
slope, we say, okay,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.960
when I have a certain change
in Y when I change in X by 1.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.450
So, we have something like this.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.560
So, when I change, I get
a certain change in Y,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.620
the triangle means change
in, delta, change in Y,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.853
when I get a certain change in X.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.730
And delta Y, the change in Y,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.120
over change in X is equal to the slope.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.210
But this is when it's a line
and the slope isn't changing.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.040
At any point on this line,
if I do the same ratio

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.470
between the change in
Y and the change in X,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.370
I'm going to get the same value.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.410
On a curve like this, the
slope is constantly changing.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.730
So, what we really do, to
figure out the slope exactly

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.790
at a point, you can imagine,
it's really the slope

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.360
of the tangent line at that point.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.810
A line that would just
touch at that point.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.490
So, for example, let's say
that I draw a tangent line,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.680
I am going to draw my best attempt

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.980
at drawing a tangent line
and I'll do it in pink.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.330
Let's say I have a tangent line right

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.270
from our starting
predicament, just like that.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.003
And it looks something like that.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.810
It looks something like that.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.810
And so, right where we are
now, exactly at this point,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.760
you know, if we veer away,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.170
it seems like our slope is changing.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.640
Matter of fact, it definitely is changing.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.760
It's becoming less steep as
we go forward to the right.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.300
It's becoming more steep
as we go to the left.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.090
But right there, the slope

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.620
of the tangent line looks right like that

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.690
or you can view that as the
instantaneous slope right there.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.280
And we can measure the
slope of the tangent line.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.820
We can say, look, if we want an extra,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.463
let's see, this looks like about,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.320
if we want an extra 2 pounds of fruit,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.540
how many bars are we
going to have to give up?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.760
How many bars are we
going to have to give up?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.570
Well, it looks like we're
going to have to give up,

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.640
based on the slope right over there,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.457
looks like we're going to
have to give up 5 bars.

00:07:11.457 --> 00:07:13.760
So, this is 5 and this is 2.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.063
So, what is your change
in, what is the slope here?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.130
The slope here, is going
to be your change in bars,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.450
and I should actually say this

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.100
is a negative right over there,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.710
it's going to be your change in bars,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.710
your change in chocolate bars,
over your change in fruit.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.520
Over your change in fruit.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.377
And in this situation, it is -5 bars

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.760
for every 2 fruit that you get.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.290
So, bars per fruit.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.290
Or you can say this is equal
to -2.5 bars per fruit.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.510
So, it's essentially saying,
exactly at that point,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.300
how are you willing to
trade off bars for fruit?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.150
Exactly at that point, it's gonna change,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.530
as things change along this curve.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.270
But it's saying, exactly where
you're sitting right now,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.320
you would be indifferent but it's only

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.680
as you just slightly move
for an extra drop of fruit,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.580
an extra ounce of fruit,
not even a whole pound,

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.900
you'd be willing to trade
off 2 1/2 bars per fruit.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.820
And what this says, so
you're willing to give up,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.190
since it's negative,
you're giving up 2 1/2 bars

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.930
of chocolate for every pound of fruit.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.060
Now, it's going to be different.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.360
Once you have a lot
more fruit, you're going

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.950
to be much less willing to
give up bars of chocolate.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.490
Over here, you have a lot of
bars and not a lot of fruit.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.510
So, you're willing to give
up a lot of bars for fruit.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.110
Over here, if we go over here,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.010
the slope looks a little bit different.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.290
Over here, it is much flatter.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.350
So let me draw it in a
color we haven't used yet.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.530
So, over here, the tangent
line looks something like this.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.230
It looks something like this.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.230
And let's say, when you
calculate it, in order to get,

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.640
I don't know, this looks
about 5 pounds of fruit,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.180
in order to get 5 pounds
of fruit, you are going

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.997
to have to give up 2 bars.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:14.514
So, once again, the slope is
the change in the vertical axis

00:09:14.514 --> 00:09:16.854
over the change in the horizontal axis.

00:09:16.854 --> 00:09:21.137
So, over here, at this
point, your change in bars

00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:25.043
over your change in fruit, is going to be,

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:30.043
well, you're going to give
up 2 bars, for every 5 fruit.

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:33.543
Bars per fruit.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.563
So, this right over here, is -0.4.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.040
I'll say B for F.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.440
So over here, you're willing
to give up much fewer bars

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.860
for every incremental fruit.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.770
Up here, you were willing
to give many bars away

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.960
for every fruit and that makes sense.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.880
Over here, you had a lot of chocolate bars

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.820
and not a lot of fruit.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.780
So, you were willing to give
up more bars for your fruit.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.500
And over here, you have many fewer bars

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.780
so you're much more resistant
to giving up bars for fruit.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.300
But this number, how
many bars you're willing

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.270
to give up for an incremental
fruit at any point here,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.940
or you could view it as a slope
of the indifference curve,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.250
or the slope of a tangent line

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.080
at that point of the indifference curve,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.520
this, right over here is called

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.833
our marginal rate of substitution.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.460
Marginal rate of substitution.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.170
It's a very fancy word
but all it's really saying

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.670
is how much you're willing to
give up of the vertical axis

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.640
for an increment of the horizontal axis.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.080
Right at that point, and it
changes, as soon as you move,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.790
because this is a curve,
it changes a little bit,

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.590
but right at that point, for
a super super small amount,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.860
how many bars are you
willing to give up for fruit?

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.960
And obviously, it changes

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.553
as we go along this indifference curve.
