00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.079
It is time!

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.229
We have arrived at the final conflict.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:04.580
The battle royale.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.280
A fight to the…well, hopefully not death,
but a big fight anyway.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.470
It only seems fitting that we spend this,
our last episode of anatomy and physiology,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.670
talking about one of your body’s last-ditch
efforts to defend itself, at all costs.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.120
This is what happens when all the other failsafes
have failed.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.560
Your skin and mucous membranes did what they
could, as physical barriers against infection. And

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.140
your humoral immune response cranked out antibodies,
in an effort to keep your interstitial spaces healthy.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.579
But when those systems weren’t enough, your
cells themselves were breached. And pathogens

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.510
and abnormalities began to run amok where
antibodies could not get to them.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.979
Now, it becomes the business of your cell-mediated,
or cellular immune response.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.599
And that’s where stuff gets real. Where
cell fights cell.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.160
And where the heroes look like T lymphocytes.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.149
These lymphocytes, known on the streets as
T cells, go after body cells that have been

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.239
hijacked by things like viruses, or bacteria,
or become cancerous.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.519
T cells cause inflammation, activate macrophages,
get other T cells fired up, and generally

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.320
regulate much of the immune response.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.980
Which is important, because -- of all the
ways in this course that we have described

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.640
how you could die -- two that we’ve neglected
to mention are what happens if your body completely

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.600
fails to protect itself, and what happens
if your immune system goes rogue, and attacks

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.930
your own, healthy cells.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.310
But even when they’re functioning well,
some of your immune cells are careening around

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.149
your body like miniature, biological versions
of Mad Max war boys.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.090
Amped up on signaling chemicals, scouring
the terrain for hostiles, and covered from

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.409
top to bottom in the dismembered parts of
the enemies that they have vanquished.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.609
They’re out to protect all of the tissues
and organs and systems that we’ve been talking

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.299
about for the past 46 weeks.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.800
And these guys play for keeps.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.180
If there are cells in your body that look
and act like they’re from some post-apocalyptic

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.799
hellscape, it’s gotta be the cells in your
immune system.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.819
Aside from the fact that they go around literally
eating their enemies, and have names like

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.299
“natural killers,” some of these cells
are dressed for the part, too.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.200
Specifically, they go around wearing parts
of the organisms that they’ve killed, so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.679
others can see them.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.119
Sounds a little bit messed up, but we’re
talking life and death here. The stakes are high.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.270
And this kind of behavior occurs both in your
innate immune response and your acquired response.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.190
We’ve already talked about how, in the innate
response, when a phagocyte sees a suspicious

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.490
character, it engulfs it, and kills it, right?

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.030
But what we didn’t get into before is that,
during its attack, the phagocyte actually

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.190
breaks the pathogen into tons of tiny molecules,
and then proudly displays those broken bits

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.500
in grooved proteins on its outer membrane.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.140
These proteins are called major histocompatibility
complexes, or MHCs. And they’re a lot like

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.470
how Vlad the Impaler decorated his front yard
with the bodies of his skewered enemies ... or

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.100
how a battle-crazed warrior might show off
a necklace made of knucklebones.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.140
Because cells from both your innate and adaptive
branches do this grisly accessorizing like

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.180
it’s their job, they are referred to as
professional antigen presenting cells.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.160
Which might make you think, “Is there an
amateur version of an antigen presenting cell?”

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.500
and yeah, there kind of is.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.690
Every nucleated cell in your body -- which
means all of your cells except for your red

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.200
blood cells -- have one kind of MHC protein
on their surface, called class 1 MHC.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.280
MHC 1 proteins present short chains of amino
acids that are based on endogenous proteins

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.140
-- that is, proteins synthesized inside that
cell.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.950
So if a particular cell is healthy, the antigens
on its MHC 1 tell roving immune cells that

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.370
everything’s ok inside, nothing to see here.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.450
But if the cell is, say, cancerous and it’s
making abnormal proteins, then it’ll fix

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.850
bits of those proteins to its MHC, which alerts
immune cells that there’s a problem inside,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.010
and basically asks to be killed.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.470
Now: your immune-related cells -- like macrophages,
dendritic cells, and B cells -- wear class

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.420
2 MHC proteins on their outsides.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.940
These are the professionals.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.070
Class 2 MHC proteins bind to fragments of
exogenous antigens, like a virus that’s

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.510
been engulfed, broken up, and displayed to
get the attention of other cells.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.220
And this is how MHCs are totally essential
to the cellular immune response.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.480
Because, the heroes of your cellular defenses,
the T cells, can’t actually detect whole antigens --

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.080
they can only recognize them when they’re all
diced up and decorating an antigen-presenting cell.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.260
T cells are made in the bone marrow, but they
mature in the thymus, the lymphoid gland that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.200
sits on top your heart, and which is actually
what the “T” in “T cell” stands for.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.460
And you have several different kinds of T
cells, but the two you really have to know

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.460
about are the helper Ts and the cytotoxic
cells.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.350
Helper Ts themselves can’t kill, but they
can activate cells that do, and they help

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.820
call the shots for the whole adaptive immune
response.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.900
Meanwhile, cytotoxic cells are the ones that
actually do the killing of the cells gone bad.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.860
Now, much like how a naive B-cell carries
antibodies for one specific antigen, a naive

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.010
helper T cell has receptors that will only
bind to one specific combination of a class

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.460
2 MHC and a particular antigen.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.120
If that match is right, the Helper T bonds
to the MHC-antigen bit and it gets activated.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.620
Then, just like with the B cells we talked
about last time, the Helper T starts copying

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.720
itself like crazy, making a few memory T cells
as well, which remember that particular antigen

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.120
should it meet one again in the future.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.510
And it also produces a whole mess of effector
T cells -- mostly more Helper Ts, but also

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.350
some regulatory T cells that I will get to
in a minute.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.740
But the main thing the helper T cells do is
raise the alarm that tells other immune cells

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.940
that there is a problem.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.639
And they do this by releasing a cocktail of
chemical messengers called cytokines.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.060
When a cytokine enters another Helper T, that
cell usually starts dividing, making more

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.800
memory T cells and more Helper Ts, which release
more cytokines that keep boosting the signal.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.770
And some of those cytokines also go on to
help activate the cytotoxic T cells.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.150
You know that macrophages from the innate
system just sort of roll up and swallow pathogens

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.400
whole…. but cytotoxic T cells do their killing
a little differently.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.520
They roam the blood and lymph, looking for hijacked
amateur body cells that are asking to be killed.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.360
Basically, these infected cells are already
dying, so they’ve digested some of their

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.030
invader’s proteins, and stuck them on some
of their class one MHCs, effectively waving

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.280
a surrender flag made of fragments of the
very virus or cancer that is destroying them.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.840
If a cytotoxic T cell with the right receptor
floats by, it binds to the antigen-MHC combination,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.760
and moves in for a mercy killing.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.740
It does this by releasing special enzymes
that punch holes in the cell’s membrane

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.440
or otherwise trigger apoptosis, killing both
the cell and whatever is inside of it.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.419
Then the cytotoxic cell just detaches and
continues to run down other prey.

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.300
So by now it should be pretty obvious that
without T cells, there basically is no adaptive

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.620
immune response. And it really all comes back
to the Helper Ts.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.050
Which is why immunodeficiencies can be so
deadly.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.610
AIDS, for example, is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus that specifically attacks

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.080
Helper T cells. And without the Helper T’s,
there wouldn’t be much of a humoral response, either.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.900
Because the cytokines that come screaming
out of the helpers not only activate other

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.470
T cells, but they also finish the training
of the B cells.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.480
The fact is, most of your so-called naive
B cells don’t get fully activated -- and

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.940
become memory or effector cells -- when they
first bind to an antigen.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.080
And there’s a good reason for that.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.090
Since antibody receptors are generated randomly,
you might wind up with B cells that could

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.550
bind to your own, healthy proteins, like,
say, your growth hormone.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.760
So, once a B cell interacts with a substance
-- whether it’s growth hormone or some dangerous

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.840
bacterium -- it still needs to bind to it, engulf it,
and present some fragments of it on its surface.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.720
But then, it’ll stop, to await inspection.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.740
It pauses until the right Helper T cell comes
by to check out its presentation. If the T

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.270
cell binds to the presented fragment, then
it releases cytokines, which fully activate

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.840
the B-cell and suddenly you’ve got antibodies
going everywhere.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.720
But if it doesn’t, then the B-cell just goes about
its business and doesn’t trigger an immune response.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.070
This check and balance between Bs and Ts is
an important safeguard against your immune

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.360
system becoming too good at its job.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.730
Which is a very real risk.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.080
A hyperactive immune system can cause mayhem
by losing its ability to distinguish enemy

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.260
from self, as it turns on your own body.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.220
Your regulatory T cells -- another type of
effector -- help prevent this by releasing

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.460
inhibiting cytokines that tell other immune cells to
stand down once the initial threat has been handled.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.680
Without that regulation, the body might start
cranking out too many antibodies and cytotoxic

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.120
cells that could damage or destroy its own
tissues.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.800
This dangerous confusion is what causes many
autoimmune diseases -- like multiple sclerosis,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.680
which eats away at the myelin sheaths 
around neurons, or Type One Diabetes which

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.880
tears up the pancreatic cells that make insulin.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.040
So the takeaway here is that your immune system
is usually really good at its job, which is

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.310
to kill stuff in the name of keeping you alive.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.630
And you really don’t want it to go rogue
on you, because if there’s one thing you

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.190
should have learned in the past year with
us, it’s that your body is both resilient

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.610
and fragile, and it survives only when the
sum of its many complicated parts

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.730
stays balanced and works together.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.030
And that is the glorious wonder of you.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.000
As we wrapped up our tour of the immune system
today you learned how the cellular immune

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:34.430
response uses helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory
T cells to attack body cells compromised by

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.779
pathogens. We looked how cytokines activate
B and T cells, and what happens if your immune

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:42.069
system goes rogue and starts causing autoimmune
trouble.
