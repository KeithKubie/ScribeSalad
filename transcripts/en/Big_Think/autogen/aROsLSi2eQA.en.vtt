that's existing all the time and it
 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.549
that's existing all the time and it
happens in the brain and you see that in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
happens in the brain and you see that in
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.619
happens in the brain and you see that in
autopsies of Alzheimer's patients so the

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629
