00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
&gt;&gt; It is not a matter of whether China will
pull out of the economy

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.640
crisis or not.
It is a mandate that China should get out

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.170
of the economic crisis and
should continue to lead the world economy.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.449
Otherwise, other countries will be having
hard times.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.640
Therefore, it is very, very important that
China recovers itself from

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.149
the economic crisis and reactivate the entire
world economy.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.579
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much.
