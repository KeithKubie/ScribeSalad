00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.490
So, the first thing I will do on

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.600
my Windows machine, is open Python and IDLE. Here's

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.230
how to do it. I can go to the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.060
Start Menu, hit All Programs, find Python 2.7, which

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.040
is what we just installed and launch IDLE. On

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.380
a Mac, this is what you'll need to do.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.640
I will go to Spotlight and then type Idle. You can think of IDLE as a notepad or

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.450
a place where we write Python programs. I can click on File and then New

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.010
File and boom, I will get a fresh new place where I can write my code.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.000
By the way, the other window is where

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.330
we'll see the outboard of our program. Okay,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.820
let me rearrange both of these windows so we can see them at the same time.
