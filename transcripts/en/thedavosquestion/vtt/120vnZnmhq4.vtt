&gt;&gt; Well, hello from Davos again. Will Swope
and I run Sustainability for Intel. My last

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.429
video blog I said, "Here are three things
you can do as an individual", and I got one

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.849
more for you today. Work with your company
to create a forum, so every employee can contribute

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.019
to how to make their lives more sustainable
and how to make your company more sustainable.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.090
We are hard at work at this at Intel, and
I've met multiple companies here in Davos

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.200
that have said the employee involvement and
the employee enthusiasm has been unbridled.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.900
Here's an opportunity for every employee of
our company to help themselves and to help

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.110
their company do a better job. Most of these
are going to result in savings to the environment

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.470
and economic savings to the company. Let's
all do that together, it will make a difference.
