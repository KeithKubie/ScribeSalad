00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
So, Intel Inside® was a great example of joint business development.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.380
They managed to exchange advertising dollars

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.880
for a prominent position on the outside of computer manufacturer's boxes.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.900
What computer manufacturers got in exchange

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.880
was gross margin that they never would have gotten in a low-margin business.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.240
Starbucks® and Pepsi™ to promote Frappuccino®

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.010
was a great example of a strategic alliance.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.650
Apple and the record labels was another example

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.850
of a great strategic alliance, but Apple and Foxconn is a great example

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.800
of a supplier and might, at times, actually be a good example

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.950
of a joint venture as well.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.280
Fashion week, well that's an example of coopetition.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.190
Normally, at other times of the year, these high-end clothing manufacturers

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.460
compete with each other vociferously,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.200
but once a year they get together and cooperate in grading the industry.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.600
Standards groups are another example where competitors get together,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.800
put aside their differences, and work together towards a common goal

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.160
of trying to come up with a set of mutually agreed standards.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.930
Kind of the ringer in here, that is the one that I didn't describe,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.970
but all you had to do was go on Google,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.070
is the most famous aircraft partnership ever made

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.480
where 2 of the most unlikely partners, GE and a French aircraft manufacturer,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.420
came together to do a joint venture for the CFM-56 jet engine,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.420
which is one of the most popular turbofans in the world,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.140
so that was a great example of a joint venture

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.150
and also had a bit of coopetition in it as well.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.610
Finally, for traffic partners.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.970
If you think about all the online scheduling sites, KAYAK, Expedia, Hipmunk,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.310
they're all traffic partners for the airline industry.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.060
In fact, that's how they make their money.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.950
While you're having a great time figuring out multiple airline schedules,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.310
every time you click through to by a ticket,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.810
they are getting paid by the airlines, and that's how they make their money.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.060
So, I hope these were good examples to help you understand

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.220
the different types of relationships.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.290
As I said, sometimes they kind of blur between each other.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.310
Sometimes it might start with coopetition and turn into a strategic alliance

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.420
and someday might actually be a joint venture,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.690
but the whole idea is that you're working together with others

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.840
to help build your company.
