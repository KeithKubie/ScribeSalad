our first experiences were when we had

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
our first experiences were when we had
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.050
our first experiences were when we had
determined to first structure by NMR the

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060

first reaction was that it cannot be

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
first reaction was that it cannot be
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.779
first reaction was that it cannot be
done that was the reaction from the site

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
done that was the reaction from the site

documented in writing so it must be it

must be a modeling using information
from crystal structures the second

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680
from crystal structures the second
 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.549
from crystal structures the second
problem arose because we solved the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
problem arose because we solved the
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.760
problem arose because we solved the
second structure the first structure was

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
second structure the first structure was
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.760
second structure the first structure was
bull seminal inhibitor that's a small

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
bull seminal inhibitor that's a small
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.529

very stable molecule from bull semen and

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539
very stable molecule from bull semen and
 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.100
very stable molecule from bull semen and
that that's just globular structure and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
that that's just globular structure and
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.160
that that's just globular structure and
there were analogues of which the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
there were analogues of which the
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349
there were analogues of which the
crystal structures had been solved so

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
crystal structures had been solved so
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.850
crystal structures had been solved so
the suggestion was that we had used

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860
the suggestion was that we had used
 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.730
the suggestion was that we had used
information from these homologues second

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
information from these homologues second
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.210
information from these homologues second
structure resolved was metallothionein

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
structure resolved was metallothionein
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.120
structure resolved was metallothionein
and they turned out that unknown to us

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
and they turned out that unknown to us
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460
and they turned out that unknown to us
the crystal structure had been solved

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
the crystal structure had been solved
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.929
the crystal structure had been solved
and the two were completely different it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939
and the two were completely different it
 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.539
and the two were completely different it
is so that in metallothionein you have

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
is so that in metallothionein you have
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.160
is so that in metallothionein you have
