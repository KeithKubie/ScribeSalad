00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.544
- [Instructor] A set of middle
school students' heights

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:07.526
are normally distributed with
a mean of 150 centimesters

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:11.502
and a standard deviation
of 20 centimeters.

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:13.714
Darnell is a middle school school student

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.631
with a height of 161.4 centimeters.

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.899
What proportion of student heights

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.566
are lower than Darnell's height?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.391
So, let's think about
what they are asking.

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.300
So, they're saying that heights
are normally distributed.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.595
So, it would have a shape that
looks something like that.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:36.652
That's my hand-drawn version of it.

00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:40.819
There's a mean of 150
centimeters, so right over here.

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:44.696
That would be 150 centimeters.

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:46.945
They tell us that there's

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.724
a standard deviation of 20 centimeters

00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:54.199
and Darnell has a height
of 161.4 centimeters.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.462
So, Darnell is above the mean,

00:00:57.462 --> 00:00:59.940
so let's say he is right over here,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.322
and I'm not drawing it
exactly, but you get the idea.

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:05.489
That is 161.4 centimeters.

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.430
And we wanna figure out what
proportion of students' heights

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.763
are lower than Darnell's height.

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:14.400
So, we wanna figure out what is the area

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.296
under the normal curve right over here.

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:18.658
That will give us the proportion

00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:21.371
that are lower than Darnell's height.

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.927
And I'll give you a
hint on how to do this.

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:26.215
We need to think about how
many standard deviations

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:28.954
above the mean is Darnell,
and we can do that

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:32.359
because they tell us what
the standard deviation is

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.999
and we know the difference

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.273
between Darnell's height
and the mean height,

00:01:37.273 --> 00:01:39.757
and then once we know how
many standard deviations

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:43.529
he is above the mean, that's our z score,

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:46.479
we can look at a z table
to tell us what proportion

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.269
is less than that amount
in a normal distribution.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:53.387
So let's do that.

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:57.684
So, I have my TI-84 Emulator
right over here and let's see.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:02:00.684
Darnell is 161.4 centimeters, 161.4.

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:08.695
Now, the mean is 150,
minus 150 is equal to,

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.148
we coulda done that in our
head, 11.4 centimeters.

00:02:14.148 --> 00:02:17.482
Now, how many standard deviations
is that above the mean?

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:19.220
Well, they tell us that
the standard deviation

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.478
in this case for this
distribution is 20 centimeters,

00:02:22.478 --> 00:02:25.543
so we'll take 11.4 divided by 20.

00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:28.085
So, we will just take our previous answer,

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:29.473
so this just means our previous answer

00:02:29.473 --> 00:02:33.473
divided by 20 centimeters
and that gets us 0.57.

00:02:36.903 --> 00:02:39.486
So we can say that this is 0.57

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.517
standard deviations,
deviations above the mean.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.809
Now, why is that useful?

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.077
Well, you could take this
z score right over here

00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:57.485
and look at a z table to
figure out what proportion

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:01.652
is less than 0.57 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.384
So, let's get a z table over here.

00:03:06.384 --> 00:03:07.391
So, what we're going to do is

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.601
we're gonna look up this
z score on this table,

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.193
and the way that you do
it, this first column,

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:17.360
each rows tells us our z score
up until the tenths place

00:03:18.492 --> 00:03:20.426
and then each of these columns after that

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:22.260
tell us which hundredths we're in.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.093
So, 0.57, the tenths
place is right over here,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.708
so we're going to be in this row.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:36.391
And then our hundredths
place is this seven,

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:38.175
so we'll look right over here.

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:42.157
So, 0.57, this tells us the proportion

00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:46.324
that is lower than 0.57 standard
deviations above the mean,

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:53.348
and so it is 0.7157 or
another way to think about

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:56.557
is if the heights are
truly normally distributed,

00:03:56.557 --> 00:03:58.807
71.57% of the students

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:03.625
would have a height less than Darnell's.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.264
But the answer to this question,

00:04:05.264 --> 00:04:06.705
what proportion of students' heights

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.914
are lower than Darnell's height?

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.164
Well, that would be 0.7157,

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:15.755
and they want our answer
to four decimal places,

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.672
which is exactly what we have done.
