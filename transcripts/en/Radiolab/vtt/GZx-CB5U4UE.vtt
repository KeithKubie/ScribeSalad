Homerun, and I'm Robert Krulwich.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.400
In this hour we've been talking about the placebo effect. Yes.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.450
About the power of belief and suggestion and thus far we've looked at it from

11
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.130
the perspective of the patient,

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.980
but certainly the doctor has a role to play in all of this.

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
So I have a story to tell you. Five, four, three,

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.790
two one zero it's, it happens to be a better doctor. Yeah.

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.460
I'm Dr. Albert Mason.

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.670
I was trained in medicine in guy's hospital back in the 1950s Albert Mason was

17
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.410
delivering babies at a hospital in London.

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.620
He was a young guy at anesthesiologists and he was looking for a new way to

19
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.970
anesthetize his patients, the moms. Some of them may be safer than drugs.

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.620
And one day he ran across a book about medical hypnosis,

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.970
medical hypnosis,

22
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.140
and I just read the technique and tried it out on some friends.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.370
And under what circumstances, like you,

24
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.810
you would put a watch and have it swing back and forth left and right. No, no,

25
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.780
no. Just lay them down on a couch and say,

26
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.310
I'm now I want you to let your whole body go loose at your arms,

27
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.140
go loose that your legs go loose.

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.670
And it worked on some people and not on others. But the more he practiced,

29
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.940
the better he got. You know, putting his friends on to a trans stay,

30
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:42.480
getting them to remember stuff from their fifth birthday and all sorts of games

31
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:44.220
that we played as medical students.

32
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.870
And so we took this little party trick into the delivery room and it worked.

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.430
That's right. I delivered about 20 babies under hypnosis.

34
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.760
And the moment you start to do hypnosis,

35
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.260
you start to get a reputation as being somebody who has power. Well,

36
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:04.470
I would think you get two reputations. The patients might think you have power.

37
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.680
The doctors might think you're a quack. Well, both of those are true,

38
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.180
but at that time it was kind of fun because the hospital administrators were

39
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.360
kind of curious about this young doctor. Slash. Hypnotist.

40
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.460
Maybe he was onto something, who knows?

41
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:21.720
So they started to send him all kinds of patients, skin disorders,

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.850
asthma, and he'd hypnotize them,

43
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:28.170
which led to a weird little discovery of all things that hypnosis might help.

44
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.140
The one that seemed to work the best was warts, warts,

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.190
Bortz. To my delight,

46
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.940
I found that if you hypnotize them and told them that the warts would go,

47
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.530
they went in a certain number of cases. Let's fast forward a little bit,

48
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.850
and Dr. Mason is treating lots of these worths patients and things going pretty

49
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.990
well. And one day a young boy came to this hospital.

50
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.230
He was wheeled in on a Gurney and the first thing I saw was his arm.

51
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.950
I could have dropped through the floor because this wasn't a dozen wars,

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.270
this was millions. This was the entire surface of the skin.

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.620
It cracked and got infected and his life was impossible.

54
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.300
He couldn't go to school because he smelt. Now,

55
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.720
I don't know if you've ever seen the photographs of this boy.

56
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.160
Just check this out. Look at these pictures here. Oh my God.

57
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.230
It looks like he has a, a black hide over his whole body.

58
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.720
It looked like an elephant skin. That's what it looked like. Wow.

59
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.860
So they take this poor boy to surgery. The surgeon, a man called Jerry Moore,

60
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.330
was trying to graft healthiest skin onto the hands.

61
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.110
And when I saw this skin, I said to him, Mr. Moore,

62
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.790
why don't you treat him by hypnosis? And he looked at me and he said, well,

63
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.100
why didn't you? And he walked out with you.

64
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.140
Why don't you in, in despair or in contempt?

65
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.400
I think a mixture of both. And by the way, when you asked that question,

66
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.110
you're the kid asking the senior practitioners. So I was cheeky.

67
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.630
Yeah, you were cheeky.

68
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.390
So there's Albert Mason cheeky alone with his boy with a million warts.

69
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.610
And Albert asks him, do you mind if I hit my ties?

70
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.400
And this kid who was 15 said, okay, didn't you have to tell the parents?

71
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.260
Um, no, couldn't have got away with it today, could I?

72
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.970
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

73
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.800
<v 2>so I hypnotized this kid.</v>

74
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.790
I told him the watch on your right arm will shrivel up and die and new skin will

75
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:40.760
grow. And why did you choose the right arm? Oh,

76
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.180
I had to start somewhere and I sent him away.

77
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.200
He came back in a week and one of them was clear.

78
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.840
<v 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.520
<v 0>totally clear. I mean, imagine this,</v>

80
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.730
the left arm is black and scaly like elephant skin and the right arm is totally

81
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.270
normal. Totally normal looking. Here's the [inaudible]. This is a real photo.

82
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:06.740
This is a, this is verifiable. It looked like a normal skin,

83
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:11.420
but rather pinker the neutral, slightly pink and soft and supple.

84
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.770
This is for real. Yes.

85
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.460
It's like all those thousands and thousands of words that covered the right arm.

86
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.450
I guess they just fell over. And what were you thinking when you first saw it?

87
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.300
I was thinking how wonderful.

88
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.440
I was thinking, Oh wait, let Mr Moe sees this.

89
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.600
So he takes the boy,

90
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:38.350
he runs down the hall to the Operating Room when Mr. Moore is in the middle of

91
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:41.200
an operation. He takes the boy up to the big, you know, the glass window.

92
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:44.410
And I held up both his arms, one blackened, scaly,

93
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:49.411
the other pink and raw and more put down his scalpel.

94
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.640
He came out of the theater and he looked and he said, my God,

95
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.710
look at that. And I said, well, I told you a could go.

96
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.370
And he looked at me pitying. He said, this isn't warts,

97
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.210
this is congenital [inaudible] Olam, arithe redundancy of Bro.

98
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.620
Whenever those of us who are uninitiated,

99
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.280
what is Roman [inaudible] gamma guy with Axios, hopeless condition,

100
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.480
never been known to, to change the surgeon,

101
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.250
informed Albert Mason that he had just hypnotized away a condition that never

102
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.290
once in medical history had been known to go away for any reason, whatever.

103
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.850
So he says,

104
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.530
we're going to take him to the Royal Society of medicine to show him to all the

105
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:35.660
dermatologists in London.

106
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.820
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.850
<v 0>so more took me up there with the boy.</v>

108
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.310
Thank you Dr [inaudible] and to the Royal Society for this opportunity.

109
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.620
And I demonstrated, first of all,

110
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:52.650
I demonstrated how to hypnotize is quite easily achieved.

111
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.570
You simply let the patient down and say,

112
00:06:54.571 --> 00:06:58.230
now I want you to let your whole body go loose. Let your arms go loose,

113
00:06:58.231 --> 00:07:01.510
let your legs go loose. And then I showed his arm, please, sir,

114
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.820
if you don't mind, raise both arms.

115
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.123
<v 1>Cool.</v>

116
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.280
<v 0>They were staggered. In fact,</v>

117
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:15.281
the president is upset that it's inconceivable that this gets well because we

118
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.210
all know that congenital [inaudible] incurable

119
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.310
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

120
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.640
<v 0>that was the exact word he used in curable, incurable</v>

121
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.390
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.380
<v 0>curable. And the thing was, since all this took place at a hospital,</v>

123
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.120
every stage of it was documented.

124
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.350
There are photographs every step along the way before shots after shots,

125
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.320
closeups, all available to reporters. You can imagine what happened, right?

126
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.230
It was picked up in every newspaper, Time magazine, big media story. In fact,

127
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.250
the first I heard about it, I was in bed one morning,

128
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:57.251
a year after I'd sent the paper in from habilitation and the phone rang and the

129
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.990
voice said, this is whipsnade zoo.

130
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.450
We have an elephant with a skin like a little boy. Can you kill him? And I said,

131
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.910
what's up? I don't know. What the hell are you talking about?

132
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.360
And then the phone started to ring and ring and ring and hundreds of calls,

133
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.190
hundreds of letters came in from all over the world.

134
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.230
And I had people coming in with the most terrifying illnesses wanting to be

135
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:24.920
killed, especially people with that very rare skin condition,

136
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.900
congenital [inaudible], whatever it's called,

137
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.540
they flocked to him from all over the world.

138
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.560
And that's now here's where the story takes a turn. He would see these patients,

139
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.760
he would hypnotize each one one at a time and then send them away,

140
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.910
hoping of course that they'd get better and they would come back a week later.

141
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.920
<v 3>And</v>

142
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.900
<v 0>none of the others ever got well</v>

143
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.090
<v 3>at all. No,</v>

144
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.430
<v 0>not in any way. No improvement. Um,</v>

145
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.770
I've spent the rest of my life trying to understand this phenomenon I gave up.

146
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:57.780
And it's usually a few years later,

147
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.710
Albert Mason quit medicine and he decided to become a psychiatrist.

148
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:06.420
He wanted to understand why he had the touch the first time and why after that

149
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:10.800
it just didn't work. So the central question in your mind was,

150
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.970
why not what happened to the kid? But what happened to me. That's right.

151
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.600
That's right. And what do you think the answer to that is like? Well,

152
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.630
there is a condition called infantile omnipotence that we all suffer from when

153
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:26.040
we're kids.

154
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.450
We think we can do anything unconsciously.

155
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.070
I knew this was incurable. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

156
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.980
Are you saying because it's incurable would mean that it had never been cured,

157
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.390
but you've tried. You had tried. Created an exception. So look,

158
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:47.750
when you're 25 and the president of the Royal Society of medicine tells you it's

159
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:53.250
incurable, it has an effect. That's his best guess.

160
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.280
He thinks that that word incurable changed him just a little bit.

161
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.590
I lost my crazy confidence even though I had the evidence,

162
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.760
but it didn't work.

163
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.500
<v 1>No.</v>

164
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.280
<v 0>Confidence is a hard thing to measure. You can't put it on a scale.</v>

165
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.390
You can't weigh it,

166
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.890
but you can sense it because it's conveyed in a million little ways how you

167
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.520
stand, whether you look your patient in the eye, when you pause,

168
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.040
where you pause, what you say, what you don't say.

169
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.790
All these things are like signals may say to the patient,

170
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.040
they murmur to the patient, I can help you, they can do this. You know,

171
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:36.570
you go to a doctor, you've got this horrible rash, all of you. And he says,

172
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.160
oh that's everything in my multiform me and you feel better immediately cause

173
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:42.510
he's named it will.

174
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.380
All he said is many red spots in Latin.

175
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.750
But the thing is that he knows what it is and you feel that,

176
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.840
oh he knows now I'll be okay.

177
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.780
<v 0>Cause when you're feeling terrible,</v>

179
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.460
what you just want to do is hand over the authority for your situation to

180
00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:06.220
someone else who's got information hour

181
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.120
<v 4>and he's going to tell you you're going to be fine. Yeah.</v>

182
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.160
And maybe that comes from early childhood when it seems to us that our parents

183
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:16.040
have that capacity. Harvard historian and Harrington,

184
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.000
I have a two year old and a, we're already now at the stage where, you know,

185
00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:23.990
he gets a little bump and he comes to me and holds the bit of his body out.

186
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.740
That's been hurt and I kiss it and it's okay.

187
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.560
And I,

188
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.180
there is a way that mommy's kiss is kind of a placebo effect. Testing,

189
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:39.260
testing, and now imagine that you're sick. You know when you're sick,

190
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:44.261
there's a strong impulse to kind of revert back to that way of interacting with

191
00:11:44.331 --> 00:11:46.750
people. You have to say something just to Shuba Duck.

192
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.950
That's Arabic for what do you want? How's that? How are you?

193
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.960
I'm good dad. How are you? I'm doing very well. This is my dad.

194
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.340
Do you see how your voice goes on the thing?

195
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.480
He's the guy I bring my booboos to as a kid. Tell me what you do. Actually,

196
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:04.540
I still do like your title and that kind of thing because he happens to be a

197
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.870
doctor. I'm the chairman of the Department of surgery at Vanderbilt.

198
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.750
Vanderbilt is in Nashville, Tennessee where we grew up for much of our life.

199
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.000
Where are you? Grew up for much of your life. Okay,

200
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.990
so my dad had no idea why I wanted to follow him around the hospital.

201
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.750
I didn't exactly lead with the whole placebo thing.

202
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.400
How often do you see patients? Truth is,

203
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.790
I feel okay about that because this show isn't really about lying.

204
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:31.060
It's about healing the healing process, which doesn't happen in a vacuum.

205
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.360
Patient of course, has to believe in the cure,

206
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.010
but the doctor has to create that book. Okay, wait, you have to walk slower.

207
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.520
I can't talk slowly now. How does he do that? Tell me where we're going.

208
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:46.810
Now we're going into the clinic and it'd be more specific with what happens at

209
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:50.890
the clinic. I have patients scheduled to come to see me today. These days.

210
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:53.710
My Dad's hair is, this white is his white Dr Kobish,

211
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.900
but he's still sees patients every Wednesday daily.

212
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.680
I have four patients and that is why I'm here.

213
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.460
1:00 PM clinic begins in the clinic and as if to illustrate an Harrington's

214
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.750
basic point, when you're sick,

215
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:14.751
there's a strong impulse to kind of revert back to that way of interacting with

216
00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:17.340
people. As soon as my dad's first patient shows up. Hey,

217
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.170
hairstylist from Murphy, I'm a single parent and I own my own business and I,

218
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.380
I've always been in survival mode and I've always had to be strong.

219
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.420
And so that's why this has been so hard for me. They give me two,

220
00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:33.330
a tiny exam room, which is quiet and super intimate compared to the hallway.

221
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.490
Dad Has Megan sit on a table if that.

222
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:39.040
<v 3>Okay.</v>

223
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.670
<v 4>And he gently presses two fingers there. Next Waldo</v>

224
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.870
<v 3>a little bit. Let's just say</v>

225
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.650
<v 4>there's a tiny gland in her neck.</v>

226
00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:51.330
That should be the size of a piece nod you put over the past four years,

227
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.960
it's gotten bigger. Three inches and bigger.

228
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.320
<v 3>Wide and two and a half inches in the other direction.</v>

229
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.240
<v 4>No, it's the size of a golf ball. She presses against your ear. Yeah. At night.</v>

230
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:08.710
Sometimes I wake up and you know, it's good and I think, Oh God,

231
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.770
should I call nine one one? And I keep asking him every week,

232
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.810
are you sure I'm not going to choke? It's not gonna choke.

233
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.300
Kit's not gonna choke me. It is not good choice. Sure. You know,

234
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.920
just him reassuring me it's not going to affect the airway.

235
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.180
I try to remember those things that he says to me when I,

236
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.410
especially in the middle of the night when I start feeling anxious or panicky

237
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.361
and I same time,

238
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:32.710
how do I deal with it and anxiety that surrounding this thing because like I've

239
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:37.630
got anxious and lots of anxiety, but I don't know.

240
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.920
We're going to scared of the unknown part or that is warn about the future.

241
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:44.500
I think just because it's just me. Well, I know,

242
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:46.860
but I guess it's just because of my risk.

243
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.360
My personal responsibilities work with you.

244
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.490
Got To put them at ease is not nothing life threatening

245
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.410
<v 3>today. You have to put them at ease.</v>

246
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.990
I'm going to give you a short term plan and a long,

247
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.870
<v 4>okay. Yes. Medicine.</v>

248
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.050
We're just science and all of this talk would be just noise because the real

249
00:15:04.691 --> 00:15:08.440
business within happen in the next room where there's this big machine ready to

250
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:12.610
scan Megan's thyroid, but medicine isn't purely science. Yeah. I mean,

251
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.100
which my dad had miss. That's an art. It's communication,

252
00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:20.101
which is why he and Megan talk and talk and talk and talk for over an hour.

253
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.540
In a way, it's a kind of negotiation.

254
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.110
She wants to know one thing like what if my thyroid has gotten bigger?

255
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.620
What if I have to have radiation? Will I have to quit my job?

256
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.480
He needs her to focus on anything but the what ifs to stay focused on what they

257
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:35.051
do know,

258
00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:39.520
which unfortunately is that they won't know anything for another day.

259
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.470
<v 3>Did he draw the blood today and he goes or not? I know it was in 24 hours. Okay.</v>

260
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.570
I need to know the size of that type of thing.

261
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.330
<v 4>Okay. Somehow in the end, despite all the open questions,</v>

262
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.870
because as they do that, he gets there to relax. We're going to work together.

263
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.510
We're going to let you guys talk going into town so much.

264
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.130
It's really inconvenient for me. How much performance isn't it?

265
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.060
What do you mean performance? Yeah.

266
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.030
How much of doctoring is having to play a certain role that the patient needs at

267
00:16:10.031 --> 00:16:13.120
that moment? It's just about every bit of it.

268
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.320
So if I were to call it theater, would that offend you or no?

269
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.910
It's not a theater a it is.

270
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.230
I'm living that draw. It's part of me.

271
00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:30.040
It's not part of a fake image that I'm projecting.

272
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.070
I think you know what I'm trying to get at. Really? No,

273
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.560
you call it theater. You can call it theater. But I just mean that.

274
00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.330
I mean when you, when you don't have the white coat on you,

275
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:43.660
you're not like in doctor mode. You know, you don't have all the answers.

276
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.860
You don't, and I don't have all the answers then like, but you,

277
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.820
but you seem to, and you know with her, that's what I really wanted to know.

278
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.520
That magic pixie dust called certainty.

279
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.990
How do you project that instantly to patient? The moment you walk into a room,

280
00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:02.980
even when the patient hits you with questions like Doc, am I gonna make it?

281
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.900
It can seem kind of mystical, that aura. But then again,

282
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.350
there are the props. Okay, you have to tell me what you're doing now.

283
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.540
What does this for instance, to rewind a moment.

284
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.770
Here we are before clinic in my dad's office and he's just opened up his little

285
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:18.604
coat closet,

286
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.730
<v 3>my coat on, and I usually on the day of the clinic I choose a clean white coat.</v>

287
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.550
Really? Yeah. Do you have many to choose from?

288
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.110
I have one, two, three, four, five, five,

289
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.260
<v 4>five blindingly white, white coats.</v>

290
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:36.720
He flips through them because the white as to the bunch of puts it on and I

291
00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:38.940
swear to you, even now when I'm older,

292
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.650
it's supposedly wise to these kinds of things. It's like he changes somehow.

293
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.830
Do you ever go to see patients without your weight

294
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.120
<v 3>cut on? Uh, I don't like doing it. Yeah.</v>

295
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 4>It's almost like you're naked without it. You do seem Tyler with it on,</v>

296
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.650
can I do? Yeah. There is inherent power in the props,

297
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.430
especially the code. And if you have any doubt the doctors don't know this,

298
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.690
go to a med school,

299
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.650
any med school on the day the new students arrive and you'll probably find

300
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.320
something like, excuse me, if we could all have a seed,

301
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:14.400
we'll start the ceremony. The white coat ceremony. Thank you.

302
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.450
It's as close to religious ritual as you can get in medicine. In fact,

303
00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:21.360
the one that we attended at Columbia University in New York,

304
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:25.320
I asked the students to please stand with me included a chaplain.

305
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.743
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

306
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.280
<v 4>As you are able let us pray together.</v>

307
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.680
Compassionate. God

308
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.190
bless these new medical students of the Columbia University College of

309
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.600
Physicians and surgeons and bless the white coats that they receive today.

310
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.740
May these white coats be for each student,

311
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.320
a cloak of compassion, a clear statement of purpose,

312
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.280
a sign of assurance and a symbol of respect.

313
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.500
The ceremony we pray for the Strait and for the Times has some almost spiritual

314
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.490
component. The Art of healing. It's quite moving I think.

315
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.100
I hope you'll find that's Arnold and Sandra gold.

316
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.580
They began the white coat ceremony at Columbia almost 20 years ago.

317
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.550
I'd be with each student and they were in the audience today. We were there,

318
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.870
God be with each of us along with about 250 students and their families first.

319
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:24.350
Each student is cloaked individually and call by name,

320
00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.180
<v 5>Eric, j. R e s James J. Truck.</v>

321
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.010
<v 4>They then return to this eats.</v>

322
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.000
So we see this visual transformation that occurs.

323
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.180
This is a change that you can actually see it.

324
00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:41.630
These people come into this room with their coats on their arm and they're

325
00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:45.410
wearing blue and black and green and yellow and that's who they are.

326
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.030
And you see the room filling up in white and they see the room filling up in

327
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:54.830
white, Alexandra J. Borst. And you know in the old days doctors wore black.

328
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.540
It's true. A hundred years ago doctors were gothic black coats.

329
00:19:59.541 --> 00:20:04.400
But then someone discovered germs and had the insight that germs live in dirt.

330
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.210
And because you couldn't see dirt on black coats had to be white.

331
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.730
They changed for antiseptic reasons.

332
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.560
That is when a certain symbolism to cold. When you think about angels,

333
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.440
they're never in red, they're never in black.

334
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.600
<v 5>Please turn around to face the audience</v>

335
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.560
and I present to you the class of 2000 okay.

336
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.990
<v 1>[inaudible] lab. We'll continue on.</v>
