00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
I was around 15-years-old

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.760
I agreed to do this for my family's sake

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.960
because my mother asked me to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.520
At first, I said I didn't want to,
but she convinced me by saying:

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.560
'You're the only one who can help our family,
we're completely dependent on you.'

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.280
In my heart,
I've never been upset with her

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.760
It's a tough situation...
I never felt anger towards her

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.960
I still love and respect her,
despite what she asked me to do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160
I obey her

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.640
I sold her

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.520
to a Cambodian

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.800
for around $400 or $500

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.040
I want to finish school and get a good job

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.000
But I want you to
work and study at the same time

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.480
I'm too tired to do both at once

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.440
Then you should stop studying

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.640
You have to because we
won't be able to pay the rent

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.040
Why don't you help,
so I won't have to work alone

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600
How can I?
I've already done my best

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.080
I'm not as strong as a man

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
The last time I worked there,
men wanted to do bad things to me

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.040
And what if I get drunk?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.960
How would I get back home?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.280
I might even get raped

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.920
If you don't, there'll be no rent and no studies

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.160
We'll be poor forever, living on the streets

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.840
I'm in the 10th grade at High School

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.400
I want to become an accountant after I graduate

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.800
My Mum wants me to quit school and get a job,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.480
but I don't want to

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.360
I'd like to go on to university too,
but I wouldn't be able to pay for it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.720
To avoid pressure from my Mum,
I help her with her laundry work

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.480
Sometimes, if there aren't any orders,
I borrow money from friends to give to her

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.320
If I can't borrow,
I work as a waitress to give her the tips

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.360
My salary's only $90,
so I need to earn more money

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.920
If I don't manage to,
my family will have problems

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.360
One day I met a guy and told him
it was my daughter's first time

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.880
I explained that I couldn't pay the rent
and we were very poor

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.920
He asked my daughter
to sit next to him and said he wanted her

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.160
He asked me how much,
but I didn't know what to ask for

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.200
I wanted to ask $500,
but hadn't discussed it with anyone

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.400
I thought that might be too cheap

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.600
I thought that $1000 would be too expensive,
but I asked anyway

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.000
and he said OK

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.720
Is it true? She really sold you?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.440
Yes, it's true...

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.960
She made me do that

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.400
We argue whenever this topic comes up

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.040
I love her, but I hate her too...

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.920
for what she did

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.960
I used the money
to start a lottery ticket business

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.440
It's provided enough to survive,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.440
but now there's too much competition
and sales are down

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.840
I don't have enough for the rent

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.520
I want her to work in the sex industry again,
but she says she's sick of it

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.360
She just wants to study
and refuses to do it again

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.480
I'd have to beat her to make her,
I see no other way, what can I do?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.360
At the karaoke club,
the patrons asked us to do more

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.080
They invited us to sit with them

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.640
They'd make us drink with them all evening

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.120
For tips, we had to act easy
and let them touch us,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.400
or they'd complain to the boss

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.400
Sometimes they tipped us $10 or $20,
but if we agreed to sleep with them,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.800
it was a lot more

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.240
My classmates look down on me
for being a prostitute

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.240
They spurn me
and won't socialise with me,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.160
for fear that others will think
they're prostitutes like me

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.720
This really affects me

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.360
It's very hard

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.680
to study in an atmosphere
where they won't even talk to me

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.280
What are your chances
of continuing your studies?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.280
I think...

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.720
only 50% if Mum forces me to do that again,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.960
but if she needs a lot of money,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.160
I'll have no choice

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.520
I don't want to leave school

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.480
When I'm older,
I don't want to be scorned

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.000
If I stop studying,
I think I'll always remain poor

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.840
I'd do laundry for other people
and always be tired...

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.080
without a penny to my name

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.200
She was extremely traumatized from the rapes

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.920
When we brought the child to the hospital,

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.920
the doctor said we were right
to bring her there for treatment

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.840
I decided to take the child
from her mother in Pnomh Pen

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.160
and send her to her grandmother
in Kampong Ton

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.360
I had the mother sign a contract.
She can't take her back

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.840
We try to talk to her

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.960
We've asked her grandmother
and the younger children

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.720
to spend more time playing with her,
to comfort her,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.200
to take her to school and encourage her
to make friends with classmates

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.720
By going to school and developing friendships,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.800
she's gradually begun
to forget her city life as a beggar

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.000
We've tried to help her adapt to her new life

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.040
She's begun to feel happy and enjoy school

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.360
Her studies are improving and now
she's among the top 10 in a class of 30

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.800
My father was run over by a ploughing machine

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.800
while he was working in the paddy fields

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.600
It had some kind of mechanical problem,
I don't know

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.600
My aunt told me; it was before I was born

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.500
- And your mother?
- She died giving birth to me

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.300
I met my boyfriend in Pnomh Penh,
he asked me to live with him after a while

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.600
He set up a business,
but didn't have enough capital,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.000
so he made me sleep with a client to help him

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.600
He owed a lot of money,
so I slept with the client for $30

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.000
to help him out with the capital

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.500
But the next day,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.200
he wanted me to sleep with
a client for money again

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.900
After living with him for quite some time,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.400
I realised he was only with me for the money

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
She said:

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.700
'Pich, I don't have any money,
I'm not opening the shop today

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.900
I'm poor and I owe everyone a lot of money,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.200
so you need to help me

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.240
Take on a couple of clients

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.480
I really need the money,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.080
you know how badly in debt I am

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.240
You see how my family's
standard of living is falling

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.480
It's much worse than it once was'

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.800
I knew it was wrong,
but I was living with her,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.080
so I had to

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.120
If I'd thought too much about it,
I wouldn't have earned anything

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.440
And so, that's how I started...

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120
selling myself again

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.520
I had nowhere to sleep,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.760
so I came here to the
gas station to sit every night

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.040
It was late at night,
around 1 or 2 am, very quiet

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.520
I wanted to sit in front of the pagoda,
but then I met a man in the middle of the street

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.560
I wasn't sure if he was drunk or not

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.640
He came up to me from behind
and asked where I was going

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.080
I didn't reply

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.240
I just kept walking faster and faster,
but he hit me and knocked me out

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.400
When I opened my eyes

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.000
I saw I was naked,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.720
but there was no sign of him

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.440
I thought to myself:

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.200
'Who was he?

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.400
Why did he rape me?'

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.480
It's really hard to talk about this

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.880
I think life is very hard without parents

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.120
I'd like to have parents
and a normal job like other people

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.720
All the men I know personally are bad

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.120
In general, the men I meet are all bad

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.440
I've never met a good one

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.840
They treat me like a sex toy, a pleasure girl

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.160
to satisfy their desires.
Then they throw me away

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.760
I do it because I want to stop doing it

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.840
Right now I have no money,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.000
but, in the future,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.640
I want to open my own beauty salon

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.160
I need money to buy nails,
nail polish, and makeup

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.600
I used to work as an apprentice beautician

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.800
We negotiated price and time...

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.040
whether he wanted her for a week or a month

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.160
Where did he take her?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.240
They went sightseeing

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.760
But where did he take Ty?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.720
I don't remember exactly,
they just went round Pnomh Penh

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.360
He said they wouldn't go far because
he was afraid I'd worry about my daughter

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.800
What did he do? Was he young or old?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.800
He was about 30,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.160
maybe a businessman,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.840
but I'm not really sure

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.720
I just knew he had money,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.760
so I decided to sell her to him

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.120
Was Ty a virgin at the time?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.760
Yes, she was, she was only 15

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.440
He arrived on a motorcycle,
it was a very modern one

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.320
He brought food and some cans of beer

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.480
He told us where he was staying
and said he'd wait for me there

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.680
I went to his place and we drank and talked

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.240
I already knew I was going
to give him my virginity

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.320
I'd never drunk before,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.000
so two cans were enough to knock me out

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.280
I lay down on the bed and passed out

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.760
Exactly what he did with me,

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.520
I don't know

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.480
I only knew what had happened
when I woke up and saw blood on the sheets

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.720
I had no choice

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.840
because we were very poor

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.080
It's very painful for a mother
to push her daughter into that

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040
The pain is indescribable

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.080
I didn't know what to do,
not even my family would help

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.600
What could I do?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.160
It was wrong, but didn't know what else to do

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.480
We were living in squalid conditions,
I had no husband to provide for me

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.080
I did what I could: I made my daughter do...

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.160
what I couldn't

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.320
My mother owes a lot...
We're poor, so we borrow from others

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.600
Sometimes people don't remind
us about the debt too often,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.280
but some days they come
and ask us to pay them back

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.080
and insult us like dogs if we can't

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.600
I don't know what to do

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.280
My father's very old

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.120
and he lives far away

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.920
We rarely hear from him

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.560
because he lives with his second wife

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.080
He can't help us

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.600
I have to provide for myself

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.440
I'm not a little girl anymore

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.560
I'm already an adult

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.440
When I got home I spoke to my mother

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.840
She suggested I start working,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.880
as I'd already lost my virginity
and the family sorely needed the money

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.320
I asked her:

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.120
'And what would you have me do?'

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.760
She said I should go into prostitution

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.440
I said I didn't want to,
but she begged, saying

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.960
'My darling, only for our family's sake, please!
We all depend on you!'

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.960
She's my mother

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.680
I must help her because she's helped me,
my sacrifices don't compare to her care

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.360
She's also slept with men for money to feed us

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.840
Of course, deep in my heart,
I didn't want to do it... I didn't at all

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.000
When a customer comes into the shop,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.320
I ask him what he wants to drink

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.800
If he says coffee, I bring him some and ask:

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.040
'Mister, do you want sex?'

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.280
If he says yes,
he goes to a room in the back and I follow

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.440
After we're done, I get paid

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.600
I only see 4 or 5 clients a day
I can't take more...

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.360
even for the money

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.360
After 4 or 5 I feel weak and faint
because I'm young

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.960
I don't have that much strength
and I'm often sick

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.600
I've tried to find other work,
but it's hard for a girl with my past

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.080
People just don't accept me

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.760
Now, with all the problems we're facing,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.640
I feel like I've lost my soul

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.200
I don't want to go home
because I just feel depressed there

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.320
I just want to be away
in a silent place where I can think

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.800
I always cry alone

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.480
I only have two friends

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.520
They support me and tell me
not to do anything terrible

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.760
Even when I feel there's no way out,
suicide is not an option

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.920
I'm not angry... This is just my life

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.400
I need to bear it and be patient
no matter how much I'm scorned

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.120
I feel sorry for my mother and little sisters

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.080
They never feel loved

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.320
Whenever they see a father
sitting and laughing with his family,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.240
they cry

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.280
I want to help, but I don't know how
