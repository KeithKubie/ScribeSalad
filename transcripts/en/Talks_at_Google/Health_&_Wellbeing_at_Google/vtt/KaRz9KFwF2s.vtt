[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.140
GREG MOORE: Hello Googlers,
both here in Sunnyvale

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.550
and around the world.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.270
Good afternoon.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.059
My name is Greg Moore.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.340
I lead health care
here at Google Cloud.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.556
And we have a very, very special
guest with us this afternoon.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.800
It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.460
today Dr. Lloyd B. Minor, M.D.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.770
Dr. Minor is the Carl
and Elizabeth Naumann

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.710
Dean of the Stanford
University School of Medicine.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.230
Under his leadership Dr.
Minor has established

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.260
and is now executing
strategic vision

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.030
to lead a biomedical revolution
both nationally and globally

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.360
in precision health.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.390
Dr. Minor is a professor of
otolaryngology, head and neck

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.720
surgery, at Stanford University
with additional appointments

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.070
both in bioengineering
and neurobiology.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.630
He's a prolific author.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.330
Over 140 published
papers and chapters,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.519
a widely-recognized authority
in the area of balance

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.460
and inner ear disorders.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.060
For his contributions
in 2012 Dr. Minor

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.439
was elected to the National
Academy of Medicine.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.980
So we're really pleased to have
Dr. Minor with us here today.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.693
Let's give him a warm welcome.

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:18.443
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:19.651
LLOYD B. MINOR: Thanks a lot.

00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:23.380
Well, thank you, Greg.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.800
It's really a privilege and
an honor to be here today.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.940
And as I was thinking
about my remarks,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.120
Google is about to celebrate
its 20th anniversary.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.460
We-- Stanford and Google--

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.850
obviously share
a lot of history.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.350
Right?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650
I mean, Google began in
two dorm rooms at Stanford.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.240
And early on the
founders articulated

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.260
what principles that
they described as,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.432
10 things we know to be true.

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:52.140
So I thought I would
parallel that a bit.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.681
And I think you're
going to recognize

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:57.180
some distinct similarities
between 10 things

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
that I know to be true
about health and health care

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.890
and what the founders had in
mind in establishing Google,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.759
and what is very much reflected
today in the great work

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.420
that all of you are doing.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.280
So, principle number one.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.020
Very similar to principle
number one for Google.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.520
For Google, of course, focus
on the user and all else

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.600
will follow.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.070
For us in health
and health care,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.070
focus on the patient and
all else will follow.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.580
And this may seem
to be self-evident,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.550
but it's actually
only recently that I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.250
think health care professionals
have begun to embrace

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.070
this as the True North.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.440
Only recently because,
unlike managing our finances

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.290
or deciding what car
we're going to buy

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.940
or what bicycle
we're going to buy

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.650
or what school we're
going to send our kids to,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.420
health and health
care in the past

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.100
has not always garnered
the degree of engagement

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.650
from consumers that almost
every other aspect of life has.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.700
All too common there's been the
attitude, well if I get sick

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.650
I'll go to the doctor
and they'll fix me.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.450
Or I'll take a medicine
and it will cure me.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.260
And so the notion that--

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.450
I think there are lots
of reasons for that.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.230
But I think one reason is
that we, as health care

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.860
professionals, haven't
focused on involving

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.090
our patients, the people who
entrust us with their care

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.450
and who look to
us to be advisors

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.140
as well as to bring our
expertise to their treatment--

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.060
we haven't always
focused on the way

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.860
that we can engage patients
in the way we need to.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.130
And yet, really, if you
go back to the founding

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.970
of modern medicine and some of
the original greats who helped

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.480
get us started on a more
scientific path in medicine--

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.500
you know, William Osler, who
was the first physician in chief

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.630
at Johns Hopkins Hospital--

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.200
sort of a founder of
modern internal medicine--

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.850
he famously said, you know,
listen to your patients.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.740
They're trying to tell
you their diagnosis.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.420
And so today this principle of,
focus on the patient and all

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.910
else will follow,
has never, ever

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.280
been more applicable
than it is today.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.260
And what I'll talk about a
bit more, and what many of you

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.550
are engaged in every day,
is that our opportunity

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.630
to use technology to
focus on our patient,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.630
to use technology for high tech
to enable high touch health

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.150
care has never been
greater than it is today,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.110
and is going to continue
to increase exponentially

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.955
in the weeks, months,
and years ahead.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.540
So second principle.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.810
The future of health
care is proactive.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.220
Related to the first,
what I just spoke about,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.690
in the past we've
tended to think,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.620
well, if we get sick
we go and we get fixed.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.290
We either have an operation,
we take a medication.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.790
We've had far less attention
on how we can prevent disease

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.910
in the first place, how we
can be much more proactive--

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.310
us as individuals
thinking about our health,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.900
and health care
professionals thinking

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.350
about how we develop the
science around prediction

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.630
and prevention.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.780
And as Greg mentioned
before, we've

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.960
had a strategic vision
at Stanford Medicine

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.460
on focusing on what we
call precision health.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.980
Now, all of you have heard
of precision medicine.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.940
And we for sure practice
precision medicine at Stanford.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.100
Precision medicine is about
using genomics and informatics

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.070
to improve the care we deliver
to patients with cancer,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.590
so that the care is
truly personalized,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.280
individualized, based upon
the molecular and genetic

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.680
characteristics of the tumor.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.130
And for sure when we have
cancer or heart disease

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.590
we need precision medicine.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.060
But wouldn't it be great if
we prevented those conditions

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.940
to begin with, or
if we diagnosed them

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.564
much earlier than we did today.

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:19.230
So the way we think
about the difference

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.260
is that precision medicine
is about sick care.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.590
Precision health is
about health care.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.590
The goal of precision
health is to predict,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.490
to prevent, and cure precisely.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.200
But really in that order.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.830
Prediction, prevention,
and then cure when we still

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.680
are not able to
adequately prevent

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.680
a disease from occurring
in the first place.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.540
And we're seeing all sorts of
examples where that vision is

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.390
coming into reality today.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.330
And of course the way we
will know 10 years from now

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.340
that we've succeeded
in this vision

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.800
is that the need for
precision medicine, the need

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.010
for the ultra-complex
acute care will

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.730
be reduced because we will
have prevented or diagnosed

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.910
early and therefore more
effectively treated diseases

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.220
before they need the complex
tertiary and quaternary care.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.290
Principle number three.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.840
Data holds the secret
to better health.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.020
There's a tremendous amount of
health data that exists today

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.570
embedded with electronic
medical records,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.670
coming in from wearables.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.950
So when I think
about digital health

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.080
I think about two related but
somewhat distinct verticals.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.580
One vertical focused on
consumer-facing devices,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.790
the things that enable us to
get a lot more information

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.400
about how our body is working.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.870
And then the other
closely-related but distinct

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.090
area is the analytics
related to complex data sets.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.450
So how do we bring in data from
those consumer-facing devices

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.750
combined with the
data that's sitting,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.800
by and large, unaddressed in
electronic medical records

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.390
today in order to inform
decision-making and engage

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.490
people more in their health
and their health care.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.570
There's tremendous
opportunity in both areas,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.920
both in terms of consumer-facing
devices and technologies

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.230
and also in analytics.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.900
Let me just give
you one example.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.840
You know, earlier in my career--

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.580
as Greg mentioned,
I'm an ear expert.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.880
I focused on inner
ear balance disorders

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.000
and in 1998 I described a
clinical syndrome, an inner ear

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.106
disorder.

00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:43.730
It's a disorder with
one of the balance

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.900
canals of the inner ear.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.750
It's a disorder caused
by the bone that

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.600
should cover that balance
canal getting eroded over time,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.350
and then the balance canal
itself begins to respond

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.390
to sound and pressure.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.000
So these patients that
have this disorder

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.290
experience certain very
distinct recognizable symptoms

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.700
and signs.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.140
And one of those is that they
have noise-induced dizziness.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.050
And so if you open the Google
search engine right now

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.040
and you type "noise
dizziness," on the first page

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.520
you'll get several websites
that describe this syndrome,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.320
superior canal
dehiscence syndrome,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.300
as well as a host
of other conditions

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.480
that can cause related
symptoms and signs.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.290
If you type those same two
words in the chief complaint

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.800
line of one of the commonly-used
electronic medical records

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.860
systems today in doctors
offices and hospitals

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.740
around the country,
you get, as a provider,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.840
no diagnostic assistance at all.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.877
So if you're someone
in my specialty,

00:09:44.877 --> 00:09:47.210
you've certainly seen patients
with the disorder before.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.800
You know to be suspicious.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.680
But if you're a primary
care physician who's

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.430
may be seeing a patient
with this disorder

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.910
for the first time, you may not
know that that's the diagnosis.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.480
And so it's still
the most common way

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.630
that patients with this disorder
are being diagnosed today,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.610
is by searching the symptoms and
the signs themselves, usually

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.720
on Google, and finding a website
that describes the condition,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.030
and then going to their
physician and saying,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.980
I think I have this.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.066
Look at this web page.

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:19.190
We can do better than that.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.420
We can do a lot
better than that.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.770
And I think the work that's
going on in Google Cloud as

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.060
well as a lot of
different other areas,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.070
is going to get us more towards
the type of environment that

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.650
can really enable us to fulfill
this vision of precision

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.150
health.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.950
Fourth principle.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.300
To change health, we
have to change behavior.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.930
You know, when we look at
the determinants of health,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.000
of wellness and well-being--

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.510
yes, there is medical
care and there's genomics.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.870
But if we look at health and
well-being as being a pie,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.940
then genomics and medical
care represent maybe 25%

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.580
to 30% of that pie.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.580
The majority of the
determinants of health

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.840
are behavioral, social,
and environmental factors.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.600
And yet in the past we
focused far less attention--

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.160
and by "we" I hold ourselves
in academic medicine very much

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.300
accountable for this--

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.110
we focused far less
attention on behavior

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.060
and social and
environmental factors

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.760
than we have on the medical
and genomic factors.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.620
And today we obviously have
the opportunity to change that.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.610
Now, let me mention
one project and I'm

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.980
really excited about
going on today,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.820
started by a team of
Stanford investigators.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.580
It goes by the acronym SPHERE.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.740
So at Stanford,
just as at Google,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.060
acronyms play a big role
in how we communicate.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.030
SPHERE is short for
Stanford Precision Health

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.480
for Ethnic and Racial Equity.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.330
And one of the projects
sponsored by-- this

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.840
is funded by an NIH grant.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.980
One of the projects
sponsored by this grant

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.610
looks at obesity in
latino-american children,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.320
focusing initially in
Santa Clara County.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.610
So over 200 children
and their families

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.520
right now in Santa Clara
County enrolled in this study.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.120
And yes, we are looking at their
genomics, at their microbiome,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.750
at other metabolic parameters.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.610
But we're also
looking at what types

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.730
of interventions such
as changing the size

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.350
of the plates in the home.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.900
Rather than giving large
plates, furnishing the family

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.610
with smaller plates.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.160
How can exercise and
physical activity

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.830
be encouraged either in the
school environment, the home

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.500
environment, or getting
to and from school?

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.290
So both an approach
that looks at, yes,

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.120
what are the traditional
medical genomic factors that

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.160
are involved in
obesity, but also

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.850
looking at the
social, environmental,

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.699
and behavioral factors.

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:00.740
And it's through that
combination, really looking

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.250
at the whole pie of
health and well-being,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.060
that we're going
to be much better

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.540
able to have an impact
with the people who

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.700
entrust their care
to us, have an impact

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.990
on health and well-being.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.400
You don't need to be at
a hospital to get care.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.230
I think that's obvious
today, but it's

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.710
going to become more
obvious in the future.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.500
We rolled out a
program to people

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.240
who were enrolled in
our accountable care

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.370
organization, Stanford
Health Care Alliance,

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.470
called Click Well.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.950
Click Well lets you do
fairly common, simple things,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.650
like schedule an
appointment online.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.080
But it also allows you to
schedule a telemedicine visit

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.260
with a health care provider
or with a lifestyle

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.660
coach or a nutritionist.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.480
And what better way to
talk with a nutritionist,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.250
rather than coming
into an office

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.220
and sitting across a
desk from a nutritionist,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.360
why not have that interaction in
your kitchen, with your spouse

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.150
or significant other,
and talk in real time

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.690
about meal planning and
cooking and nutrition?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.230
So we're just scratching
the surface today

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.890
of the possibilities of
telemedicine and also

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:17.770
of how people are able to engage
with the health care delivery

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.340
system in ways other
than physically being

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.620
in an office or a hospital.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:29.290
But in the end part of
this greater accountability

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.560
and engagement of people
in health and well-being

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.450
involves making it more
accessible and, if you will,

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.660
easier for each of us to
learn about our health

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.780
and be more proactively
engaged in our health

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.180
than the old model
where we would go in

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.030
and see our doctor once a
year, get some lab tests done,

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.905
and then forget about
everything in between.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.220
Number six, fundamental
discovery pays off.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.220
You know, it's fascinating to
think that the transistor was

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.080
only developed in 1947.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.040
Right?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.050
And when John
Bardeen developed it,

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.750
it was considered
a lab curiosity.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.170
I mean, how could he
or his contemporaries

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.150
have imagined what was
going to result just

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.680
in a couple of generations.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.430
Right?

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.440
And also we know that
GPS was developed

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.180
as a variant on an
atomic clock to test

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.950
Einstein's theory of
relativity, and look

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.800
how GPS is being used today.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.470
So we never really,
at the outset,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.290
know where a fundamental
discovery is going to go,

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.290
but I've yet to see a
fundamental discovery that

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.900
hasn't had some profound impact.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.740
An example from our own world--

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.059
we're today very fortunate.

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:47.100
The School of Medicine
have seven Nobel laureates

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.440
on our faculty.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.730
One of those, Michael
Levitt, won the Nobel Prize

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.530
in chemistry a few
years ago for work

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.230
that he did more
than 20 years ago.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.490
Michael was really one of the
first computational structural

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.960
biologists.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.500
He used computer
programs and algorithms

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.920
to predict how the
structure of proteins

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.220
change in different conditions.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.470
Those formative
algorithms, the approach

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.350
that he took in his very
original and creative work,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.530
are now in use today
in drug companies

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.470
to allow them to
predict how changing

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.470
the structure of a drug
will alter its interactions

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.120
with the receptor.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.550
So an entire field
of drug discovery

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.410
was born based upon some very
fundamental computational work

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.690
designed to understand
the structure of proteins.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:45.440
Number seven, one that we're
very pleased to collaborate

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.350
and embrace with you.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.560
Academia and industry
must collaborate.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.330
It's always been true.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.120
If we look at, for example,
one of the great success

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.310
stories of the past
20 years in medicine,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:05.470
and that is changing HIV from
being a 100% fatal diagnosis

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.010
now to being, in the
vast majority of cases,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.670
a successfully chronic disease--

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:17.319
successfully managed on
multiple antiviral therapy.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.339
That success story required
discovery-based research

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.670
at universities.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.790
It required clinical
trials at universities,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.930
but would not have occurred
without the type of support

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.140
and the type of
focus and resources

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.090
that pharma brings
to problems as well.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.040
And the same is going to be true
in the digital world, for sure.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.420
And I'm really pleased that
we collaborate with Greg

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.090
and team at Stanford
in using Google

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.630
Cloud for our genomics
platform and the analytics

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.610
that you have
developed here, and

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.820
pleased that in another
branch of Alphabet, Verily,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.910
we're working on what we call
the Google baseline study, left

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.960
over from when
Verily was Google.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.220
So baseline is a 10,000-person
longitudinal cohort study.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.580
Cohort, in that it's 10,000
people and everything

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.520
you and I can imagine about
their health will be measured.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.990
Whole genome sequencing,
immunome, microbiome.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.980
Verily developed a new wearable
to track these enrollees

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.190
over a long period of time,
initially at least four years.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.690
And for the first time we'll
have enough baseline data

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.850
about the health of
these individuals

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.490
to be able to look
back and to say, well,

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.820
when someone develops a
disease later on, well,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.650
here were the early indicators.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.260
Rarely do we have that
sort of information today.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.130
So some of the patients
enrolled in baseline

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.990
are going to be healthy today.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.350
Some will have a diagnosis
of cancer already,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.690
and some already a
diagnosis of heart disease.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:57.570
And the information gathered in
this fashion very much powered

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.450
by the type of analytics
that you and your colleagues

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.870
do every day is going to give
us insights we've never ever

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.210
had before in health
and health care.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.510
Number eight.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.830
Diversity drives innovation.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.620
In academia and in industry
there's a lot of thought about,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.465
well, do you need
specialists or generalists?

00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:21.090
And of course you
need some specialists

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.680
and some generalists.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.020
But often times
the real advances

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.860
come from what are described
as T-shaped people.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.190
That is, people who are
specialists in an area

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.580
but also who have a broad
horizontal component cutting

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.870
across multiple different areas.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.559
I know you have many such
people here at Google.

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.850
So there's that sort of
diversity in terms of diversity

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.760
of ability and
thought, but also--

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.850
and in particular in
health and health care--

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.630
we have to focus more on
ethnic, racial, socioeconomic

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.620
diversity.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.060
Over half the children
under the age of five

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.820
in the United States
today are from what

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.310
previously were
considered to be minority

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.560
racial and ethnic groups.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.170
And the majority of
the US population

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.810
will be that
minority coming ahead

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.790
in the next 40 to 50 years.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.850
And yet today only about 5.5%
of the physicians in the United

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.110
States identify themselves
as African-American,

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:31.330
and only about 6.3% identify
themselves as Hispanic.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.050
We have to do better in
terms of representation

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.180
in our profession.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.100
It's been a big passion
of mine since coming

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.020
to Stanford five years ago.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.940
I'm pleased that in our
medical school class

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.640
we've moved from
five years ago having

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.260
14% from under-represented
groups to now having 26%

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.850
entering our medical school.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.280
And in our biosciences
PhD program

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.830
we've moved from 12% from
under-represented groups

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.952
five years ago now to 25%.

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:04.320
But we can't take our
eye off that ball.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.650
We can't for a moment back
away from our commitment

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.115
to achieving greater
diversity in our profession,

00:21:10.115 --> 00:21:14.490
and I think it applies certainly
across the board in professions

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.510
in the country today.

00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:20.920
Well, one that's familiar and
took me a while to get used to,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.460
and that is, you can be
serious without a suit.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.500
There's the obvious
implication of this.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.690
And I'll tell you a funny story.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.960
When I was looking at this
job and I was making trips

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.120
out from the East
Coast-- and, of course,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.420
searches of this nature
are done pretty quietly

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.735
because of factors
at the institution

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:43.460
you're moving to and factors
where you're coming from.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.250
So I was coming
out on a Saturday

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.920
and I got a call from the
office organizing the search.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.600
And they said, you know,
you're meeting with the search

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.740
committee on
Saturday, and the men

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.260
will not be wearing a necktie.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.800
And I went home that
evening and said to my wife,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.710
I got this call and they
said that the guys coming

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.750
on Saturday won't be
wearing a necktie,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.650
and I think that means I'm not
supposed to wear a necktie.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.510
And she said, yeah,
you know, that's

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.650
definitely what it means.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:12.670
And that's going
to be hard for you

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.128
because you wear
a necktie when you

00:22:14.128 --> 00:22:15.550
take a shower in the morning.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.060
So I have gotten used to
not wearing a necktie.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.310
I think the more serious
side of this statement

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.900
is that we shouldn't be taking
ourselves too seriously.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.070
You know, the beginning of
a decline of an organization

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.560
usually centers around two
things, complacency and hubris.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.440
And in particular in
health care we for sure

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.360
can't be complacent.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.100
And in the past, I think--

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.010
and I would say the physician
profession in particular

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.590
has had more than
its share of hubris.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.620
And that has to
change moving forward.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.840
Before medicine became more
scientifically-grounded,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:03.810
what physicians offered their
patients was an ear, a shoulder

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:08.660
to rest a head on,
an understanding,

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.970
empathetic voice.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.640
But there wasn't all
that much that physicians

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.440
could bring to the table.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.230
That's changed
today, fortunately,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.790
and we wouldn't want to go back.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.130
But that desire and
that need for empathy

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.910
has never been greater
than it is today.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.550
I mentioned before
that we started this--

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.120
that in our accountable
care organization

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.360
we allow people to
have virtual visits.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.670
And that's great, and many
people take advantage of them.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.810
We also give people
the option of receiving

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.040
all of their health care
virtually, if they wish.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.630
And almost no one
elects to have that.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:53.150
They want to have a primary
care provider who knows them,

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.237
who they rely upon as a
primary care provider.

00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:58.070
But they understand
that that person may not

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.600
be available at 8
o'clock at night

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.860
when they have a question.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.230
And that really then
gets back to the crux

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.260
of the talk and the discussion.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.250
And that is, how
can high tech be

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.160
better able to enable
the high touch that I

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.920
think everyone expects from us?

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.070
So that's on the part about
making sure there's no hubris.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.890
But then the part
about complacency

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:30.510
and how it can spell the
downturn of any organization

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.670
really relates to
principle number 10,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.760
exactly the same as Google's
principle number 10.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.340
Great just isn't good enough.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.580
And certainly when we're talking
about health and well-being,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.460
when we have this crying need
in the United States today--

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.570
you know 18% of our GDP
being spent on health care,

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.020
and yet our outcomes
are very poor compared

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.690
to other OECD countries.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.020
You know, we have to be doing
better than we're doing today,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.800
and I think we always
have to embrace the notion

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.977
and live the notion that
great isn't good enough.

00:25:05.977 --> 00:25:06.810
Thank you very much.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.351
I'd certainly welcome
your questions.

00:25:08.351 --> 00:25:10.968
I'm honored to be here today.

00:25:10.968 --> 00:25:13.398
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.990
GREG MOORE: Thank you so much,
Lloyd, for that inspiring talk.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.340
Happy to take questions here.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.714
And because I have
the microphone

00:25:23.714 --> 00:25:26.480
I get to ask the first one,
and then we'll come over.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.377
So many of the
engineers here at Google

00:25:32.377 --> 00:25:33.710
are engaged in machine learning.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.050
That's the engine.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.480
The fuel for that
engine is data.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.070
Your point number
three, that data does

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.840
hold secrets, as
you said-- secrets

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.530
that can help us help
patients globally,

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.550
and to unlock those secrets
for discovery and for research.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:00.500
How can the academic medical
centers, one of which you run,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.940
and the industry collaborate
to begin to use that data more

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.480
effectively?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.420
Because it's always
been a friction point

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.040
and there's
consequences to delay

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.425
of sharing that data, of course,
that impact the patients.

00:26:12.425 --> 00:26:13.300
LLOYD B. MINOR: Sure.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:19.180
I think the data sharing
problem has several root causes.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.790
There are increasingly
areas of care

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.590
that are covered by
bundled payments.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.860
Namely, that the health system,
the physician-- everyone

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.940
gets paid a fixed amount
and not anything more.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.700
But still, by and large, it's
a fee-for-service backbone.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.950
And therefore it
hasn't necessarily

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.680
been perceived to be to the
advantage of health care

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.550
delivery systems to make
data easily portable.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.110
That's one reason.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.150
Second is, there is
the legitimate concern

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.820
about the privacy
and security of data.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.060
And it's a real concern that--

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.090
I've read that it's estimated
that about 42% of Americans

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.330
have had, in some way, their
health records breached.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.770
But, you know,
that's not all that

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.890
difficult to see how that
happens, and you would know

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.890
better than I. But
when you have data

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.350
in multiple different
platforms sitting in servers

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.160
all over the place managed
with various different security

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.530
regimens, that's
kind of a recipe--

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:19.830
isn't it-- for
having data breached.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.330
So I think one thing that
you do, obviously-- and you

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.600
do really, really well-- is to
manage the security of data.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.360
I mean, it is your
entire business.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.280
And I know you have
lots and lots of people

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.390
working on that every day.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.340
So I think that what you
bring to the table, obviously,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.210
analytics and data
security, most people--

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.460
when they trust that their
privacy will be protected--

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:53.270
are happy to share at least
portions of their health record

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.080
for the greater
benefit of discovery

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.820
and for the greater
benefit of care

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.910
even though it may not
immediately benefit them.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.850
But I think we haven't had
the incentives in the system

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:09.770
to communicate that, nor have
we had the portals to enable

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.400
people to elect to
bring their data in,

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.750
or for organizations like
yours to be able to aggregate

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.070
the data in a sufficiently
meaningful way that truly

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.710
leverages the power of big data.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.870
When I talk to my computer
science colleagues

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.530
and I say that we have over
2 million unique patients

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.180
in the Stanford medical record--

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.720
and we do have a de-identified
version of that record--

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.340
their comment is, oh,
that's not big data.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:38.840
You know?

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.465
Call us again when
you have 20 million.

00:28:40.465 --> 00:28:41.550
If you have 200 million--

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.050
yeah.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.370
Then we would be interested.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.750
So we have to figure out ways
to aggregate data together,

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.080
for sure, to increase
the security of data,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.260
and then to convey
the benefits of being

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.270
able to study the
data in the way

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.704
that we're capable of doing.

00:28:59.704 --> 00:29:00.620
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.760
I think we had a question here?

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.968
And I'll ask you to come
back and use the microphone,

00:29:03.968 --> 00:29:05.372
if you don't mind.

00:29:05.372 --> 00:29:06.080
For those remote.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.370
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.560
My question is that, related
to the technological advances

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.240
like machine
learning, there might

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.890
be a move towards diagnosing
patients through technology?

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.990
Do you see that as
something that's actually

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.010
going to develop
in the near future,

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.270
maybe with diagnostic
applications replacing doctors?

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.730
Or do you see technology
more as augmenting

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.140
the power of doctors?

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.640
LLOYD B. MINOR: I
think it initially

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.280
will be augmenting
the power of doctors.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.710
And already an interpretation
of radiology, imaging studies,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.930
we're seeing the
tremendous power

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:48.060
of augmenting the diagnosis
and of using machine

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.870
learning initially on an
imaging study to give a reading,

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:57.780
and then having that confirmed
or not by radiologists.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.870
You know, I don't think
that the need for--

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.140
I think the role of physicians
is going to change for sure.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.990
And there may be some
specialties more affected

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.150
by those changes than others.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.360
But the need to have a human
interface in health care

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.000
I don't think is going away
any time in my lifetime.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.820
I certainly think the
majority of physicians

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.300
welcome the opportunity to
more constructively engage

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.542
technology.

00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:27.000
You know, one of
the problems today

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.440
is that electronic medical
records are oftentimes

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.240
cited as a or the
leading contributor

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.620
to physician burnout in America.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.670
So over 50% of physicians
in America today,

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.830
by a variety of
different metrics,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.570
are determined to be burned out.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.540
Now that is really,
really concerning.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.630
And as an organization
that trains physicians,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.100
it's enormously
concerning to me.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.210
And an average
primary care physician

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:02.130
is spending two additional
hours a day doing documentation

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.320
in the electronic
medical record at home

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.440
or after hours in
addition to the care

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.170
that she or he is
providing to patients.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.860
And furthermore, during their
encounters with patients

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.290
they may be at a
terminal typing,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.960
not looking someone in
the eye, and really trying

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.680
to have an empathetic
conversation with them.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.160
So in that sense
technology gets a bad rap.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.280
That's not really-- the
bad rap is on the structure

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.992
of the systems.

00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:31.950
And there are a whole
host of reasons for that.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.830
It's not technology per se.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.620
So I embrace what
is occurring today

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.250
in health-related
technology and what

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.104
I know is going to occur
even more in the future.

00:31:45.104 --> 00:31:46.020
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.720
I think we're going to take a
question remotely from Dory.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.210
The highest voted one
is at the top there.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.030
"Medical technology improvements
are great but often come

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.184
with a very high price tag.

00:31:56.184 --> 00:31:58.350
We are increasingly faced
with health care occupying

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.060
a greater proportion of GDP.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.540
How can a health care
system like Stanford

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.670
deliver precision in a
cost-effective manner that

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.814
is accessible to the populous?"

00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:08.730
LLOYD B. MINOR: Right.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.970
It's certainly true that most
technologies, particularly when

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.280
they're first
introduced, increase

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.627
the cost of health care.

00:32:16.627 --> 00:32:18.210
It's not true across
the board though.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.490
Let me give you
a counter-example

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.490
that I think
increasingly will be

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:27.180
paradigmatic for the
type of cost efficiencies

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.920
that can occur with
advances in technology.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.430
You know, it used to
be that the only way

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.910
to diagnose a chromosomal
abnormality in a fetus

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.520
was with a procedure
called amniocentesis.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.000
That's inserting a
needle through the skin

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.040
of the abdomen in the mom and
withdrawing amniotic fluid

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.460
and then looking and doing
a chromosome analysis

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.740
from the amniotic fluid.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.390
It's an invasive procedure.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.470
It carries a risk to
the fetus, and it's

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.490
an expensive procedure.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.370
And fortunately
it's now virtually

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.970
been eliminated
because it was found

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.810
that you can as
accurately diagnose

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:16.890
a fetal chromosomal abnormality
from the circulating DNA

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.920
in a blood test from
the mom as you can

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.260
from withdrawing amniotic fluid.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.990
So now a simple
blood test can be

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.050
used to diagnose
chromosomal abnormalities.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:32.560
That's a tremendous savings
in terms of the dollar sign,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.760
but even more importantly in
terms of reducing the risk.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.040
And there are going to be
a host of other advances

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.850
under that umbrella.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:42.610
But a lot of the problem--

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:47.320
a lot of the reason, I think,
for medical technology driving

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.840
up costs is that
we, by and large,

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:55.010
introduced medical technology
in the most severe, complex

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.460
diseases.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.700
And as we start seeing
technology transform

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.210
in the areas of prediction
and prevention technology

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.850
should actually be
driving down cost.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.940
And there are examples of that
today, examples of companies,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:14.679
for example, in
diabetes management.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:19.150
By measuring glucose--
either continuous monitoring

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.580
or intermittent
monitoring-- and then

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.100
having coaches that receive
the information as well

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.620
as the individual,
the management

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.960
of diabetes in a lot of people
is being dramatically improved.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.650
The savings in terms of cost
of health care in those people

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:40.360
with diabetes far outstrips
the cost of the implementation

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.190
of the technology.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:46.610
So it's both a problem that
the technology has been focused

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:52.400
on the most severe, acute
and chronic diseases,

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.860
and the technology has not made
its way into the prediction

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.460
and prevention realm in the
way I think it will very soon.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.476
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:35:02.476 --> 00:35:06.440
A question back here, locally?

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.960
AUDIENCE: Just a question
on changing health care

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.460
from reactive to proactive
using precision health.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.090
So, like precision
medicine, things

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.720
like genome-wide
association studies

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.740
are great for diagnosing
metabolic pathways.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.640
But how do we change those
things into actionable things

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.540
physicians can do?

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.140
So, for an example, if I find
LDL cholesterol is associated

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.480
with aortic stenosis, do I start
prescribing statins right away

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.240
to a person who has
LDL high cholesterol?

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:34.970
Right?

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:41.246
So it seems almost invasive
to start becoming proactive.

00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:42.120
LLOYD B. MINOR: Yeah.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:48.510
Well, let me mention an example
similar to the one you just

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.300
very nicely described
where already we're

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.440
seeing an analytical
approach making a difference.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.250
You know, congestive
heart failure--

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.150
heart failure is one of the
most common causes of people

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.460
being admitted to the hospital.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.060
And now in Medicare, for
patients with heart failure

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.390
who are covered by Medicare, if
you're admitted to the hospital

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.660
and then you go home and you
get readmitted within 30 days,

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.260
the hospital gets paid very
little for that readmission.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.500
So what we need to
do is figure out

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.360
what are the parameters of
the management of that patient

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.060
to know that they're
optimized before they go home

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.030
and that they won't be coming
back into the hospital.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:35.580
And using an approach that
I'm certain is similar to what

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.235
you're doing every day
in your work, Nigam Shah,

00:36:38.235 --> 00:36:41.490
a professor at Stanford,
was able to look at multiple

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.340
different factors-- almost
like a [INAUDIBLE] study

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.780
for physiological parameters--

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.650
and identify in a
weighted fashion

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.320
what the predictors
of remission would be.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.290
And that algorithm can
now be implemented,

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.464
used in real-time as
physicians are making

00:37:02.464 --> 00:37:03.880
the rounds in the
morning, to say,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.460
well, Mr. Jones looks like
the probability of readmission

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.440
is less than 10%.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.684
He's feeling well.

00:37:11.684 --> 00:37:12.600
He's ready to go home.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.372
Or, no, he's still got these
indicators that would--

00:37:16.372 --> 00:37:18.330
or these parameters that
would indicate there's

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.880
a very high probability
of readmission.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.630
So for that to be successful
required aggregation

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.360
of a lot of data, and
then machine learning,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.670
and then testing the
algorithms to see

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:36.540
if they're accurately predicting
the probability of readmission.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.150
That model will certainly
generalize to other diseases

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.030
and conditions, including the
one that you just mentioned

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.834
on cholesterol management.

00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:45.750
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:46.458
Another one here.

00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:50.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.350
Thanks for your lecture.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.540
My question is about precision
health and preventive

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.160
health and nutrition.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.660
Nutritional studies
are notoriously

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.445
difficult to conduct,
and I'm just curious

00:37:59.445 --> 00:38:02.520
about your thoughts on how
nutritional studies could

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.090
be better designed and funded--

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.510
high-quality studies--
funded until we have

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.670
the benefits of that knowledge.

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.344
Thanks.

00:38:12.344 --> 00:38:15.010
LLOYD B. MINOR: I think, to take
the second part of the question

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:20.100
first, as we move more away
from a fee-for-service model

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.690
and more into a model that
places risk and accountability

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.140
for health on the shoulders
of health care providers

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.710
and systems as well as on
the shoulders of consumers

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:35.910
receiving health care,
then it will be a much more

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:39.150
appealing business
model to really focus in

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.860
on nutrition and other
factors that can play

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.570
into keeping a person healthy.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.992
So the reason that
there hasn't been--

00:38:48.992 --> 00:38:49.950
there are many reasons.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:54.150
And you're right, it is
difficult to study what we're

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.780
eating and then sort that
out among the many variables

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.000
that impact health.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.650
But there haven't been the
incentives to focus on those

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.680
types of studies as there
have been, for example,

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.410
to focus on new classes of drugs
for you-name-the-condition.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.520
Now, it shouldn't be
an either/or world.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.330
I mean, we shouldn't abandon
the amazing work that's

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.180
going on today, for example,
in cancer immunotherapy,

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.610
which is truly transformative.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.880
So it is precision
devoted at the cure,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.510
a part of the equation
of precision health.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.630
But there will be more
and more economic emphasis

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.330
on understanding the
roles of nutrition

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.930
as it becomes an economic
imperative for health care

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.780
delivery systems
to be engaged more

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.300
in thinking about
maintaining health

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.450
of those who are enrolled
in their benefits and health

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.130
plans.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.420
So I think that's one element.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.340
The other-- most
people employed today

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.390
are being employed
by organizations

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.330
that, in one form or
another, are self-insured.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.450
So there's a lot that
companies and organizations

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.630
can do in the type
of food they offer

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.380
in cafeterias, in the type
of nutritional education

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.290
that's offered as a part
of being an employee.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.490
There's a lot that can be
done right at the workplace

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.640
even before the health
care delivery systems start

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.180
embracing it into
the models of care.

00:40:31.425 --> 00:40:32.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.000
Thanks for your overview.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.680
A lot of things resonate.

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.880
I'll ask a slightly provocative
question, just because I can.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.560
And you touched upon it, but
I'll ask a little bit more.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.650
So I think people have
noted that health care is

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.490
a field with a particularly
high tolerance to pain

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.147
or disorganization.

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:52.480
You know, just look at which
other field do people still

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.870
work 24-hour shifts, or which
other field do people actually

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.270
go to school for 15 years.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.860
And so my question is around
tolerance to broken stuff.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.122
And so, for example,
it's faster and easier

00:41:07.122 --> 00:41:08.830
to actually search
trillions of documents

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.200
on the web than a
few thousand of notes

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.120
about this individual patient.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.300
Or, we are probably more
accurate in predicting

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.110
the click on this ad
than Nigam's model

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.040
is on predicting readmission.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.870
And so, what would it take for
physicians or administrators

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:30.060
or patients to say, this
is not really good enough?

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.690
Why is this such a high
tolerance to things

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.330
not being good enough?

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.380
And this is going back to your
point, great isn't good enough.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.040
Why do people tolerate
in this industry

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.230
so much things that
are not good enough?

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.110
LLOYD B. MINOR: Well,
it's a great point.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.190
I think it--

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.850
I don't claim to
have all the answers.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:54.440
But it relates to something
I said during the talk.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.360
And that is, why is
it, for example--

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.000
a good example of people
not tolerating chaos

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.690
would be what's happened in the
financial services industry.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.310
You know, each of us in this
room has an ATM card probably,

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.360
and we can use it at pretty
much any ATM on the planet

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.690
to withdraw cash, perform
financial transactions.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.850
Or we've gotten
rid of the ATM card

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.530
and we use Venmo or
something like that.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.029
You know?

00:42:22.029 --> 00:42:25.840
But there are a whole host
of technological solutions

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.740
that, in order for those to
work the financial services

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.750
industries had to
come together and say,

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.330
we will adopt uniform
platforms and standards.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.020
Right?

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.950
Why?

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:41.990
Because I wouldn't-- would I
choose to bank with a bank that

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:46.580
only allowed me to use my
ATM card at their machines?

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.040
And then when I'm traveling,
you know, I can't-- no.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.240
So there was this imperative
generated, I think,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.580
by consumers and embraced then
by business leaders that-- no.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.000
We have to make this
interoperable, interchangeable.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.690
So why not in health care?

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:09.180
I think partly is the attitudes
that many individuals have

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:13.860
had about health care as being
somewhat their responsibility

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:16.260
but also not so much.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.780
Not in the way that each
of us, I think, accepts

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.042
that our finances are
our responsibility.

00:43:21.042 --> 00:43:22.500
Again, the thought
that, well, if I

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.583
get sick I'll go the doctor,
I'll take a medicine,

00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:26.480
I'll be better.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.440
And then that has been added
to by the traditional attitudes

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.880
in the profession which
have not engaged health care

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.934
consumers in the ways
that, for example,

00:43:39.934 --> 00:43:41.850
something like the
financial services industry

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:46.240
has always known it needs to
engage its consumer base more

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.740
of.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.710
And I'm not saying we should
become like financial services.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:54.420
But it's a combination of
the inherent attitudes of--

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.470
or the previously dominant
attitudes of both consumers

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.430
and of the businesses associated
with delivering health care,

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.550
and not having those
converge on a model which

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.910
really puts the
patient first, but also

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:13.080
puts more responsibility
and accountability on both

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.630
the health care consumer
and the provider

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.840
to maintain health and
not just treat disease.

00:44:21.054 --> 00:44:21.970
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.020
And we'll just do one
last question here.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:24.210
LLOYD B. MINOR: Sure.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.930
GREG MOORE: And
finish up with that.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.700
In just the top
part, "how do you

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.590
see machine learning applying
to precision health use cases?"

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:35.050
That is, how do we take vast
quantities of information

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.270
from many patients
and actually bring it

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.790
down to a single patient
using machine learning?

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.690
LLOYD B. MINOR: Sure.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.760
Well, there are so many sources
of information about health.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.480
Right?

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:52.487
And those are not being
brought together in the way

00:44:52.487 --> 00:44:54.320
that I think they could
be brought together.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.697
We talked before about--

00:44:56.697 --> 00:44:59.030
at least in the past there
have been very few incentives

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.660
for health care systems
to make their data readily

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.070
interoperable.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.530
I mean, in an example I
told you about an ATM card.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.840
Still, if I want to
get my medical records

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.680
from my primary care doctor
in Palo Alto to someone else,

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.980
I'm still taking them
either as printed copies

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.120
or through a fax--

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.300
fax machine.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.617
Where else do you see
fax machines today

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:21.700
other than in health care?

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.380
Do you have fax machines
in your offices here?

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.570
Of course not.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.199
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:26.990
Well, maybe you do.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.810
OK.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.560
I bet you don't
use them very much.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:34.430
So, you know, we have to be
able to bring the data together,

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:35.300
aggregate the data.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.830
And increasingly though, as
wearables become more common,

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:45.530
as we can look at other sources
of health-related data like

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:50.120
the environment, and then bring
all of those factors together,

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.890
those algorithms--

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:55.280
like the algorithm for
predicting readmission--

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.480
will become much more accurate
and much more comprehensive

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.420
than they are today
because they'll be based

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.734
on a broader diversity of data.

00:46:05.734 --> 00:46:06.650
GREG MOORE: Thank you.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.540
Please join me in
thanking Dr. Minor.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.050
LLOYD B. MINOR:
Thank you very much.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.350
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:10.850
Thank you.

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:13.300
[APPLAUSE]
