00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
would be the way forward and of course
 

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
would be the way forward and of course
it<00:44:29.830><c> means</c><00:44:30.070><c> also</c><00:44:30.540><c> statistics</c><00:44:31.540><c> people</c><00:44:32.350><c> are</c><00:44:32.500><c> not</c>

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:32.710 align:start position:0%
it means also statistics people are not

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:36.610 align:start position:0%

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%

in<00:44:36.760><c> natural</c><00:44:36.910><c> frequency</c><00:44:37.750><c> they</c><00:44:38.020><c> get</c><00:44:38.200><c> the</c><00:44:38.410><c> point</c>

in natural frequency they get the point
 

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.910 align:start position:0%

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
so there are ways of overcoming it and
