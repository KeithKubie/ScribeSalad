We tried to give you sponsors is I would buy that. This makes sense. One of them's carbonite. Carbonates. Way To backup your shit. Did you know that about 12,000 laptops are lost? Every God damn week at us airports. 12 Zen. Seriously? Yes. 12,000 it's insane. 12,000 with carbonite. Carbonite to sweet set up. You can you back up all your shit. It does it automatically. It does. You don't even have to think about it. You don't just leave your computer on it backs it up for you and if you leave your computer at the airport and they steal it or someone takes it and doesn't turn it in, you just get another computer if you can, and you download all the information and it's like you got the same goddamn computer. It's, it's a beautiful thing and it's very important. If you're a traveling person or if you have important data that you don't want to lose the loss of one person's laptop, that it glues essential business files could leave to disastrous consequences for the entire company and the earth.

Very excited about this to Jeff digestive enzymes, how they help your body absorb the nutrients in your food. All of it is explained on on at.com with out me a beating the science down with my shitty vocabulary and poor, poor actual knowledge, but it's a very fascinating a digestive supplement. We sell all kinds of different supplements, new mood, which is a five HTP supplement, which is actually helps your brain boost serotonin and makes you feel happy. It's one of the things that people tell you to not take if you are on SSR. I's however they don't want you having too much serotonin and Brian calendar cause it's not good for the dome. Apparently he could overflow and think that life is like way groovier than yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       I do anyway. Pure happiness.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       Good for you or one way or another. But with that, if you're not on them, it's fantastic stuff and it's actually a natural, simple, very easy to describe.

And with that said, this is episode four 20 of the Joe Rogan experience podcast. My little buddy red band is out rocking the house in San Francisco tonight, sir, it is Brian Callan and Tom rose are here to bring in the most retarded hothead, holidays.

Speaker 3:          00:05:17       This is our day. All Day. I'm Kinda tired of four 20 I'm already tired of it. I'm tired of the name. I'm tired of that number. I'm talking to people before 20 dudes floor, 20 years. People have, people have it need

Speaker 1:          00:05:34       to belong to some kind of a tribe. They, even if it's a pot tribe, like it's so funny how human beings cluster in groups. They just get nationalistic over any cause. Well, in all fairness though, the pot tribe and the psychedelic tribes are very different because they know some shit that other people don't know. Like if you're dealing with their pots, going to rot your brain. Yeah. All right dude. Right. Good. Good luck with that thinking. Know potheads unite in that you know that we know like this is a good thing, right? This is a good, this is a good supplement. Supplements. He lives in the heart hurting anybody. This is not bad for you. You know, you know a woman, bad law. My friend threw a party and he had a pot, cookies and crackers and a pregnant woman. She was five months, six months pregnant.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       She had a bunch of them by accident, so they rushed to the hospital and she got, she was all bunched. I mean really high. She didn't realize, I mean really high and you know what the doctor said, doctor said, don't worry about it. It won't transfer to the fetus. It's fine if you drink alcohol way worse. And by the way, alcohol is even worse for a baby. Then cocaine by far. And I was amazed, but he said it was actually no worry at all that she'd eaten those popcorn. That's not it. I'm not advocating pregnant women eat hot on it. Might be writing poetry a lot earlier, but I was very surprised to hear that. Yeah, you might be, you might be, um, very mellow when it comes out of, he might not be crying. He might be going, dude, when he comes out of your, well, it's interesting what the fetus is protected from by the mother, by the body.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       You know, it's interesting what gets through and then what animals gets through because like with chickens, you know, I'm still, I've started to raise chickens. You can feed them food. That's kind of a little bad because their body just processed it. I didn't want effect the eggs at all. Well you don't want to give him like rotten moldy fucking worm covered food, but you can give them some food that you would need. Sure. And they'll eat the shit out of it. Give them some rotten fruit. They'll go fucking crazy that they eat. If you want the shelves to be a certain way, they feed them. Um, I think and for the calcium, they'll feed them stones. A certain type of a pebble. It's actually feed them shells, shells, their own egg shells and smash them up in their food. [inaudible] you don't want to, you want to disguise it though, because if you don't have to, sky's it than the chicken will know that eggs like eggshells tastes delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       So fuck up their own eggs. And when they start eating their own eggs, he got to [inaudible] babies to make the soup. Don't pick that baby. Otherwise it'll just be eaten eggs all the time. And you just go into the chicken house. That just massive fucking cannibalism. There's just something people feed chickens, chickens to regular basis. Well that was the, that was, they were doing that for awhile. You know, big chicken farms would grind up the beaks and the feet and things like that. They had nothing to do with them back and feed them right back to them. That became more more respect for such a delicious little creature. They were asked and how mad cow disease started mad cow disease is the same disease that cannibals in New Guinea get. They get a brain disease. I think it's the nature, the pronunciation, I'm probably going to butcher this, but I think it's like Jane Jacobs, crux Feld disease, and it's essentially the same disease as this uh, cannibalism disease that the cows get mad cow disease comes from feeding cows, cows that's really feeding and typically a feeding cows.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       The central nervous system, another cow. So they take the spinal cord and things they couldn't really sell or use and they grind it up and they would feed in that. They'd put it back in the, in the feed as protein. Yeah. House. Which by the way, complete herbivores. They're not supposed to be eating. I mean they would eat the occasional bug accidentally in their body, can process it, but they're not eating animals. If the account stumbles across a carcass of a horse, it doesn't just start challenged at, oh man, they eat grass, the grass. So it's so fucked up that they mix this in unbeknown list in their feed. Yeah. And it's, it's so, so evil that nature made it so that you know, their whole bodies breakdown when they do that and they get this horrible central nervous system sold by weight. So what they'll do is like the last three months or whatever, uh, and maybe a marker of there before they get slaughtered, they put a, an estrogen pump behind their ear and the estrogen will actually add weight to their bodies.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       Oh yeah. It's good stuff. We'll do the weird thing is these priorities. Yeah. Pre Hounds are [inaudible] how do you say [inaudible] [inaudible] you can boil a prion and it will not die. Yeah. And that's what causes this mad cow disease. Yeah. They can like, they can withstand like a thousand degrees. The teams. Yeah. Crazy. They do not die. They don't die. It's not like you can boil mad cow disease meet and be fine if you're, if you eat it, if it's you, it was usually an hotdogs or hamburgers because they were gay or blending the central nervous. You guys make me want to go on a full fish diet. The sweat, then the fishing should fishing plastic people and everything. Right? Everything. Yeah. Mercury is bad. Yeah. I had um, arsenic in my body from sardines. Yep. I was eating Kansas. Sorry. I used to love, sorry. Do you really need two, three cans a date?

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       I'm like the fish on the cartoon because Joe fucking eat. Of course Joe being the extremist, it's never just one hand. I like sardines. Time to eat a thousand. I'm a whale. I just used to love eating them and uh, I went to the doctor to get my blood work done and he goes, you've helped arsenic in your system. Wow. And I'm like, how much? And he's like, very little. Like you don't have to worry about being poisoned, but we need to find out how it's getting in there. And I was like, what? Like if someone poisoned, but no, it's just eating sardines. I cut it out. All went away. I was like, wow. He goes, it's very common. He's like, especially with sardines, apparently because they're bottom feeders. They're always at the bottom that were the heavy metals accumulate. Well, you told me that. I remember and I stopped eating sardines.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       We broke the ocean. You to Kansas, sardines at their foods. If you eat too much of it, you're getting arsenic in your body. Don't eat bluefin tuna either and don't now. How about now? How about don't eat it now because all the shit that's pouring into the ocean, they're finding there's a 3% jump in the, uh, amount of radioactive activity that there's some detecting and tuna. That's just now. You mean that's, that's from you're talking about from the, uh, from [inaudible]. Yeah. I mean, the, these tune are traveling all over the fucking ocean. They're like, they're on a jetliner liner is schools of them. They're getting caught up in the water that's coming from Japan. A lot of water coming from Japan that's radioactive. And who knows what's going to actually happen. We've never had this happen before. It's total speculation as to what's going to happen with Fukushima. They have not resolved it. We don't know the consequences. We don't know how bad it's going to get. It's basically on the edge. If they get hit again,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       like they got hit there before. Yeah, you're talking a monstrous disaster because they can't shut those things down. It's abundantly clear that all the evidence is in place. They can't shut them down. So then it's about storing wastes and keeping it cool and it's just a big fucking hole, a big stinky nuclear hole in the ground. It's water's getting into it. You can't get near ass. Russian can't even get near. You can get near for like a minute or 30 seconds and your Dick will probably break off, but you might live. Yeah, no thanks. We're so weird. We're so weird that we've done this and in such a short period of time, people don't realize what a short period of time it is to ruin two spots forever. The three, the four mile, three mile island, whatever the fuck it is, that spots probably fucked, but not as fucked as Chernobyl and definitely not as fucked as Fukushima.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       Those places are foe a duct to places in the, what was it, 70 years of using nuclear power, right. Seven years of understanding it. We've already fucked two spots up forever. Like for way longer than there's been history. Yeah. Probably longer than we even looked like this when Enrico fair man, there's guys developed the first nuclear reaction at the university, I think of Chicago. Uh, they were literally in the gym and I are in an area right there and it started to click and there's a great story that I'm going to butcher, but it's a great story about these, these brilliant scientists. Enrico Fermi was this guy from Italy comes along and says, they create the first nuclear reaction. They realize we have a nuclear reaction here. Problem is not sure if we can shut it down. Uh, and, and so they had a guy with buckets of water and, uh, and he had some other thing, like there was a hatchet to, to hit a cut a rope, so something would fall on top of it. There was the snow. They really just didn't know for sure that they were going to be able to shut the thing off. And they were able to though, and I'm sorry about butchering that story, but I just, I just heard it about Oppenheimer speech when they detonated the first nuclear

Speaker 4:          00:13:50       bomb. Oh yeah. What was it? He quoted like something from hamlet or something, right? Bhagavad Gita. Yeah. Oh, well, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       I am become death destroyer of worlds. Wow. Yeah, Dude. I mean, you want to talk about the perfect shit to say after you just

Speaker 4:          00:14:03       blew up a nuclear bomb, right, right. He was interested in guy. Did you see that Oliver Stone? Uh, untold history of America, but I heard it was amazing. I just watched the entire thing. How many hours is it? I don't know. It's like a, I'm gonna order it right now. It's fantastic. And, uh, I, I was very impressed. Uh, and, and it, it covers Oppenheimer and you know, the, you know, there's a big communist scare in the United States and all this witch hunt. And apparently Oppenheimer was like a liberal and a, it's a belongs to every capacity. Doesn't belong to every Communist Party, but they let they let him slide, uh, because he had the knowledge to give them the bum.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Yeah. And I believe at the end of his life, he was very vocal about, he was very anti nuclear bomb at the end of his life, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:14:47       Wow. Right. Well, the guy that invented the AK 47, I wish I would have invented a, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Lauren and I like say Kalashnikov. I think his name is. Yes, exactly. Yeah. There is a, there's the quote, watch Oppenheimer say this, this is even here.

Speaker 5:          00:15:00       Not Be the same. People look at him saying, man, cried. You see him up and people were silent. I remember flying from the Hindu scripture of the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu, trying to persuade you shouldn't do his duty. Twain impresses him, takes on multi armed form who says, now I am becoming death. The destroyer of worlds. Wow. I suppose we all thought that one way or another.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:15:52       He's haunted, isn't it? Yeah. That's a hard to that story. Wow. That's hardcore. Not Be, could you imagine what it's like to have no nuclear bomb ever. And then all the sudden the nuclear bombs here and it's coming from your imagined that Jeanie,

Speaker 4:          00:16:09       you know, uh, that, that untold history of America, you'll love it. And there's a great thing in there about the Cuban missile crisis and how close we actually came to nuclear annihilation in this country and in the world. It's right. And apparently there was like one, uh, Admiral Guy, submarine Russian submarine, a nuclear sub guy who stopped it all because they had lost communication with Moscow and their orders were if they lost communication, that means they've been attacked and that they should launch the things. So like they were totally about to attack and it was this one guy's decision not to do it. God, that would have jam denialist it half

Speaker 3:          00:16:47       God, there wasn't some fucking, what was the guy who used to be the attorney general? John Ashcroft. We got to sing that Eagle Song, that Christian, he goes song. Yeah, the Christian Eagle Shoreham he wrote a song, he wrote his own song. Yeah, he was the attorney general at one point in time. I mean, that's a big position of power. Could you imagine if a guy like that was the guy who got to make the call? At the end of the day, it is the admirals and those guys who have to actually, you know, make that call on the submarine, but people have made it, obviously they dropped one of the Enola Gay, they dropped the other one on Nagasaki. What was the plane that dropped? Did that, there was another plane. They know a game. There was one other plane. Right. Did I ever tell you Larry Small? I don't, I'm sorry. I didn't know the name. I'm changing subjects now again. What was the question? I'm sorry about that. I said there was the Enola gay, but it was another plane that drops him on Nagasaki. That's trivia. A little boy with a bombs, right?

Speaker 4:          00:17:38       Yeah, I've seen it. It's at the, uh, Air Force Museum and date.

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       It's, yeah. I would watch that stupid movie, Wolverine, the, the new one, and he's a part of the, uh, the Nagasaki now

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       one of them. And you know, the, the, there's a nuclear blast and he gets fucked up on the nuclear power, but he, you know, turns back into Wolverine again. Boxcar, that's the box car. There's another guy, great guy I know who is the president of the Smithsonian Museum and he used to keep a name dropper. I know, I know. I know. And even intellectual named John [inaudible] name dropper. Sonya. Exactly what I must say, that she was having tea with Oppenheimer. I should be speaking this way. Of course, you get away with a great Taylor Michael, of course, when you speak this way, to get away with a great deal of Joseph. I could pull in Jamaica, but my, he used to keep a, and a model of the Enola gay on his desk and around his desk. He had a red bonnet. And when people would come in.

Speaker 6:          00:18:42       And this one person said to him, you know, I find your plane very offensive because it dropped the bomb and killed 100,000 people. And he said, I agree it's a terrible, um, symbol, but I have also a red bonnet around here. And, uh, the bonnet belongs to my wife was a, uh, was in fact at a prisoner of war in a Japanese in a concentration camp. And she was, she had rickets cause they wouldn't give her, they weren't giving her enough food or anything for that matter. And when the bomb was dropped, the Japanese surrender to my, my, this little girl was liberated two days later and ended up being my wife and giving birth to my children. So I actually liked the Enola gay. It was kind of a controversial thing to say, but I remember there was something that, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       pilots said they, it was interviewed about it or we talked about when they, when he dropped that bomb, uh, that the plane felt like someone was beating it with a telephone pole that like the after blast. Oh my God. That explosion. And, you know, they were, they dropped it and they're, you know, they're moving as far as philosophy. And he said, even enough, not enough that it still hold plane was just right

Speaker 6:          00:19:48       rocket. Yeah. That must somebody fucked them up. I mean, of course had to be, well, I just think more than anything what it does to your imagination and how you must've felt the fear he misspelled at, at the power human beings have to destroy. It takes so long to build something. Think about how long it would take to build a city and then think how quickly you can destroy a city or how long it takes to build a human being and how easy it is to destroy that human being. That's always been the thing about life that has kept me, uh, I think in some ways motivated in that. I don't know how much time I have, but we were talking about it. Stay positive and keep trying to accomplish stuff cause there's not a whole lot of time to waste in a way to have my fun before the whole Shit House goes up in Jim Morrison.

Speaker 4:          00:20:31       Uh, and on that, on that, that, that series was fantastic. Uh, Gorbachev was totally wanted to denuclearize know Russia before the Soviet Union collapsed. Uh, he realized that it, you know, it was, phew, feudal, they've spent all this money and did a lot of that money, could be educating and feeding really poor Russian people. But Reagan, you know, they were set on spending all this money on the star wars program, which all this money had been earmarked for it, which is totally unnecessary. And the Russians were totally, you know, doing whatever we wanted for these treaties. And Reagan was just, you know, big Dick Actor guy, you know, playing hardball for, uh, you know, the, the money war machine of this country. But, and that's actually what they said, that, you know, led to Gorbachev's demise and why the Soviet Union ultimately collapsed. Well, it was really interesting. That was a super job, actually was like this really visionary, you know, smart. He was like an agricultural leader. He was like a farmer. That's how he came to power in Russia. But it had, you know, that Reagan and then he totally, you know, we wanted to do away with, with all nuclear weapons and be friends with the United States and rig and just, you know, was the cowboy actor. But

Speaker 6:          00:21:47       before that, the Reagan doctrine there, there was a very, there was a systematic like decision among many people in the United States state, look, let's force the Soviets into an arms race because they're, our economy cannot support. That's exactly what happened. And so what we'll do is we'll literally, that was the, the idea behind star wars, the idea behind the STI and, and, and, and just really pushing that arms race on the Soviets, not just nuclear, but also a conventionally, you know, we developed planes that flew way better than those migs because we had an a metal alloy that burned hotter that could withstand more heat. So our planes were faster and flew higher. And that was a huge advantage over the mix. So the Soviets very quickly realized that they were not going to able to compete technologically with us. And, um, that was, that's exactly right.

Speaker 6:          00:22:37       Peep. And lot of people say that the Soviet first of all comments system was a failed experiment for the most part. But a lot of people say that so much of it had to do with, you know, I went there when I was 17 and 1985 and one of the things that struck me was seeing bread lines, people waiting in line for bread in the morning. And the other thing that really struck me about being there at 17 years old, and I'm not kidding about this, no one smiles, no one smiles. And I had grown up over the all over the world and seeing different people. Usually the people that I was around look a little bit differently than I did. Um, they were, uh, Pakistani or were Indian or they were, they were a Lebanese. When I went to Russia, what was striking was that they looked, they were Caucasian.

Speaker 6:          00:23:18       That somehow I saw all these people that looked American and, and they weren't smiling and the food was terrible. And there was this really in the way they would clap when we would go to, um, we went and saw these shows. They don't clap like this, like the way we do, they clap like this, all of them at the same time. Like, uh, ah, I like that. That's how they clown the uniformity in that society that was forced on them was men. It was mind blowing. Um, I went to Saint Petersburg about 10 years ago. It was a it, yeah. I see what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       Pretty bleak. But I mean, I was here. There's a little bit different though. Yeah. I mean, I didn't want to, I think a lot has changed. I think things were way bleaker when you were there, but I, I see they weren't as happy blamed the Mongols, but it wasn't, it was a pretty cool time. It was conquered those motherfuckers for hundreds of years. Yeah. The Concord, everybody. Yeah. The Mongols came through Moscow in the winter. They came through the, through the fucking attacked Russia in the winter because nobody else would do it that way. And they didn't need, they didn't see it coming. Did I tell you how they, why they were so hard to follow into the desert. Who? The Mongols, you didn't have to tell me. I know a lot about them, but go ahead if you want to.

Speaker 6:          00:24:26       Well, just when you were fucking educated. No, because did I tell you, cause they were like, we got some societies would get their arms together. Have I, have I briefed you? Have I briefed you on the phone? Goes my friend. I'm glad you, I'm glad you asked. Uh, they, they would get these arms together and go into the Gobi desert after them cause they'd be so fed up with their fucking rates and stuff and everything else. Problem was you can get about six days in and [inaudible] that's when your water starts to run out and then you have to turn back around because you've got to feed all your horses. Everybody water, it's really dry. You can maybe get six days in, here's what the Mongols would be doing. They'd be drinking their horses blood. They'd be tapping a vein and just, and just hang into of reach. And then when you turn around all parched, they'd wait until you were about a day from home. They'd be like, oh, they're really thirsty. Here we come boys. And they just close in on you and district.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       They did a lot of ruthless shit. They were, there were the most ruthless motherfuckers of all time. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:25:21       And and gangs con ran into a huge problem because he was doing these raids with his, his boys and you know, like they would bring the young kids along to teach them how to do these things. And they also had a philosophy that if you are a human being from another tribe, whatever, you're basically chattel. You're, you're on the same level as a goat. And stuff like that. Problem was that these boys were growing up seeing this horrific shit, rape and stealing and looting and killing. They started doing that to their own women. They started doing that to their own people because these young warriors came back to, you know, when they'd be at the village and they would go, I'm taking that. I want to rape that girl. I'm taking this end. Gangs can realized there was going to be a breakdown from within kind of a snake eating its own tail.

Speaker 6:          00:26:01       And he had, uh, he, he then had to really instill the idea of the things that, that glue is society together. Not only do you, you can't just tell warriors how to behave, you have to tell them why they have to behave that way if you don't have a philosophy. And it was a real crisis for him and for his empire. Um, which is the demise of the Mongol people. Uh, the demise of the uncle people apparently was when they would come in and they sacked most of what we know as the Middle East. For example. Um, the Middle East had its own renaissance and it was destroyed by the Mongols. They were huge shit heads. But I think what happens to any invading army is you start marrying, you start there. Not Everybody's an asshole. You start ideas of win the day

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       or are you like, well, how much is can we destroy until, you know, there was a bunch of issues with the Mongols. One of them was the Gingiss Kahn died. And his sons inherited his empire and the son's never had to go through what he went through. So they were never the same man he was. They didn't have the character that he had that didn't, they weren't brilliant military strategists like he was Dan Carlin's five part series. If anybody is interested in it and you want to like learn about the Mongols without actually having to read a book, it's actually, it's difficult and annoying. Um, hardcore history. It's called wrath of the con and it's an amazing five part series in the Mongols will freak you out man. Like there was a, they were headed into Gin, China, these, uh, Arab dudes, they were trying to check out China and to see if maybe they should go in there and kick some ass and take some, take some riches or they had heard great things.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       They got there and they saw it in the distance. What they thought was a snow capped mountain. It turned out to be a mountain of bones, just a pile of bones because the Mongols had killed a million people. They killed every one. They killed everyone in these cities where they had 40 foot high clay walls and they'd get there and there'd be no one there. And the, the choirs mean Shah's troops had to turn around because the ground had become decayed from rotting flesh. It was just mud everywhere. And the smell was so thick in the air that his troops were dying. They were dying from the fucking, the odors of the dead bodies are so many dead bodies. The roads were gone. There was no roads. It was just mud from decaying flesh. I asked us historian on my podcast if they were really that bad and he's spent his life studying the Mongols I snow. They really that bad. And he said, yeah, they were really

Speaker 7:          00:28:19       well. Uh, there were Great Wall of China. The Great Wall of China was built to keep the Mongols out. Yeah. And uh, if you go there now, I was just, I just got back from China on Monday. I went to the Great Wall like two weeks ago, but the first time I went to the Great Wall was about 12 years ago. And, uh, there's Mongolian people hang out on the top, just a few of them that are like selling things like woman's selling postcards and cheap stuff. And, uh, I bought some postcards. It was like a dollar. I gave the woman a 10. She wouldn't give me the change. Uh, so, you know, they change. They might, uh, be rotten people historically, but I also want to remind you that they'll cheat yet the Great Wall, Tom. Tom, that's outrageous. The Great Wall. She wouldn't give you change. How did that go down?

Speaker 7:          00:29:03       Uh, you know, good friends, good friends. You know, it was just to keep the money. That was awkward. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Good friends, good friends, good friends. Uh, I would just set the Great Wall and again, did you get your money? Uh, I didn't. They, they, there was a few. They're selling like cokes and some different trinkets. I didn't, uh, I didn't fall for it this time. It's crazy. The wall $10. I never got it back. No. Wow. No, no, no. A detailed question. Now at the Great Wall, I know it is a TMC, Cancun. He had my friend, my good friend, I've got, I've got it. I've got a video on Youtube, uh, Beijing, Tom Rhodes, Beijing, and it's on there. I had my camera running. Oh, you could see the woman, the woman. And she's not giving me the change in my little Beijing video. And what's all the video title again?

Speaker 7:          00:29:53       It's Tom Rhodes. Beijing. Okay. Uh, and what, and what's in that video also is the greatest thing. As great as the Great Wall is, there is a Toboggan slide that you go down as a little, you get it sit on like a little loose plastic thing and you got to stick between your legs and you push it forward to go fast and pull it back to slow down. And it's windy and it's got some huge drops in it. And I went there. I don't remember that. Damn. There's three, there's three sections that tourists can go to the Great Wall. Yeah. And there's only the one section that has this fantastic, magnificent slide. Right. And it's thrilling. And then you, you get down to the bottom and there a big, it's on that Beijing video. I've filmed it while I did it, but I just, I just did it again a few weeks ago and at the bottom, uh, are there, it is exactly.

Speaker 7:          00:30:39       Uh, is there, there's some, there's some Chinese, a soldier, communist guys would like military jackets on down at the bottom on these big turns going slow down, slow down. You're moving. Because obviously they've had a few people like fly off lip off the corners. Oh my God. Whoa. How are you slowing down? How do you slow it down and what you just, you pull this stick towards you. Oh my God. And I did it. I wouldn't see that was in winter when I first went, but I just did it again, man. It's, it's, I wanted to go right back up at the top. Is that as great as the Great Wall is? I think that slide is even cooler and that's so avoid the Mongols at the top. I want to see the Mongo footage. I want to see that broader is the only manmade structure. From what I understand that you can see. Apparently that's horse shit. I said that too. It sounds like it is. Here it is.

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       Oh yeah. Yeah. There's the Mongolia [inaudible]. Cool. You look at and go, oh, winter with the snow on it. Okay. 10 cars this go. Oh. Oh. [inaudible] never chip. All right. How much is, yeah, what's that? 10 10 yeah, it's good change. Okay. Will you do that a one? Yeah. Yeah. Where's my chain? Let's go have a little, no, no. 10 10 [inaudible] James [inaudible]. No, one 10 12 times here. I'm [inaudible] the Great Wall. Give me one of them. Okay. And then we're either, okay. All right.

Speaker 7:          00:32:08       It sounds to me like you asked her a 10 I gave her a 10 it was a dollar for the postcards. Right? But she was saying, yeah, 10 Oh, okay. Very good. Have you go back? I think it was a miscommunication. No, she, she thought you were paying 10 bucks. That's what it sounded like to me. 10 cars. The woman knew fully what was happening. Oh listen, I trust you $1 and get it. All right. How much is he guys? 10. 10? Yeah. 10. 10 yeah, like change, change, change. Okay. What you do that like 10 times? He seems like the Taller,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       okay, so she and change. She did say change. I change. What can we all love? She's pushed you to look at her. She's kind of like, she slapped you with your knuckle. Her knuckles. She's every bit as wide as you are by the way. And then where are you should probably eat you. Yeah, like no one's around. I just saw, I just spent three weeks in China and she probably would eat you by drink. My horses will give you that too. Is that the compensation? That was it. Yeah. That's actually not bad deal. That wasn't a bad cold metal dude. You won. You won the bronze. Ah, I just got back from China on Monday and it's, I have to say, the nice thing about our country is the prices. The price. You don't have to, how much is this a 200 are you kidding me?

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       That you know, they'll give you like the highest price. You want to buy something and you know it's only a couple of dollars and they'll say, how much is that? $80 he was like, no way that that can be $80 and then you get them down. You're like halfway. Why don't you just tell me what you need? But some telling me the price you need. [inaudible] oh yeah, part, it's partnering. But don't we have that here with car sales and certain why's it gotta be like that? Why can't you just give me the price? I don't understand it. I heard it's my charge. What you need on the little extra over and just tell me what to say. That's, I literally, that's how I do it.

Speaker 6:          00:33:55       Cry, go. Listen. I know you want to make some money on this. I'm not going to kill you. I'm not, I don't have any energy to haggle. If you want to take a little bit advantage of me, it's fine. Just give me a price I can live with. I don't want to hear that. I got completely destroyed and it's a hundred bucks extra, whatever. Yeah, like whatever. I don't want to do that. But some people love it. They don't, they don't want to buy anything unless they can haggle. They like, come on z, you gotta help me out here. Give me something, give me a little something like it. Yeah. It's like there's a thrill involved in the negotiation. You can walk away knowing that they saved $5 or whatever. If you think about it though, that's kind of exactly how Wall Street works. I mean you, you think something's worth something and the other person thinks it's worse to this. I mean with this take derivatives are that way. I'm betting on the company going up. You're betting on the company going down and he's betting on the company staying where it is. So let's look, there's, there's a financial instrument that reflects that. I'll buy, I'll short it or I'll go long on it. That's exactly how, you know, huge sums of money are made and lost and every day

Speaker 4:          00:34:54       you're absolutely right. I was just, when I was in Hong Kong, I got to go on Bloomberg financial television. Whoa. And I was interviewed by like their four main host and Bloomberg financial news goes all over the world. And uh, for some reason this guy that the guy that, uh, coordinated the shows had a link with Bloomberg and I'm on there and it's there for Maine worldwide hosts and they're all like, all these questions kept and they had to, they're asking me about the markets,

Speaker 2:          00:35:22       you know, you know, that's a sure sign of the apocalypse when I'm on Bloomberg television and they're asking, they're just throwing all these financial

Speaker 4:          00:35:30       questions at me. Like I asked you what did I think of, uh, Ben Bernanke? He retiring and I said, I think now he has to turn in

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       his skin suit and go back to lizard form. And the guy goes, reptilian. And I go, yeah, there's like, I mean, they were like such serious, I mean there was a, there was a Steven Seagal

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       is Asian will not stop. He does not know way better than Steven Seagal looks like. And I hate tie. He looked like an athletic Steven Seagal Cowen. How dare you? A little bit there. He looks fantastic. He's a good looking at me. He's a good looking guys call. How dare you, how dare you to Steven Seagal. You look like a good little Steven Seagal. I hate being called Steven Seagal. Sorry. Yeah. Okay man. And the podcast goes down hate if those skills were necessary.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       Knock, knock, knock, knock. Who's there? Steven Seagal. Steven Seagal. Who at Showbiz. Oh God showed the Showbiz joke. Anyway, I'm on this financial thing and they're throwing these questions at me. It was uh, it was ridiculous. And the, the attractive Asian woman tried to get all philosophical. Let me hear that with me. A lot to say about how many killer before this. Yeah, it's actually something I thought of the last time I was on your show. I said this thing about pockets started all our financial problems. And so, um, um, let me buy you a drink and I haven't been to groundwater for the Douche bag. Please. There we go.

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       The guy pushed it is, he goes, he goes, what's up, what's up? They all, they're all calling. Ooh. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       Probably the last time you're going to have a Canadian. Others, right. But see what that guy did there. He goes, what's the worst pump comeback Glen you have for a heckler? And I said, it's too filthy to say on television. And he says, what's your second best one? So I mean he, the dude should have left it alone. And this is, I'm on live television and I'm trying to be clever and quick in this barrage of questioning that guy and that. And then they all get like, Whoa, we're concentrating on were abandoned for markets.

Speaker 3:          00:37:38       Well you fucked up then son. Oh, I could get over is a, in this video is how weird are dresses that girls, both of their vaginas, that is a [inaudible] mind, right? This strange dresses she's got on, she's got this little thing. It's draped over the opening of the vagina. Just so clever. Like the parts that we're going to show is right up to the gateway of the vagina. And then from there there's nothing but a breeze. Nothing but a breeze. And to cross legs and this tiny, the thinnest possible type of cloth we can make the thinnest lightest most times see through. You could see pubic hair right through the fucking thing that's there. Hey man, you're getting a little too detailed and it's just weird. It's just weird. Our women are allowed to do that. It's so rude. No wonder why alimony laws are in the position they're in, in.

Speaker 3:          00:38:29       We're at a severe disadvantage. Disadvantages by their attire. They're there. They're there. They're fucking dangling. A carrot there dangling the carrot. It's rude. I never realized that it's total dangle. There isn't a move. I don't want that. How about the fact they've got shoes on that make their ass do something that it never does in real life. You're leaning forward is if you just begging for someone to fuck the doggy style, like all day long, you're just accentuating your ass. You're leaning forward like you're just, you're giving step one to a five step process of doggy style and you're already at step one everywhere you go. Genius. Why? Why isn't the man who invented high heels? Why isn't that a household name that that's the most genius thing? Because you can get guys will spend, I put myself in debt buying girls dinner. Who looked that good and high heels and the heels come off in their back of your house and everything else changed and you're like, aw man.

Speaker 3:          00:39:17       That's just somehow that's a huge difference. I mean, I'm totally different. That doesn't do a damn thing to me. Really doesn't do anything to me. I don't get it at all. I mean, if a woman has beautiful legs, the legs are beautiful and like if she's barefoot just as hot. Well, when [inaudible] walked with confidence and heels, not like those big stripper fuck stiletto things, but like, like Nice, nice, nice high heels. We see a woman who was like walks confidently and know what I'm saying is like it. Yeah, it is definitely a debilitating, yeah. It's like a man who's really crappy. Caveman drew up. It's like a man is really good at the trapeze with skill he's acquired.

Speaker 3:          00:40:04       Oh. What I'm saying is that a woman can have not such a great ass when and they, the right heels. You can get very fooled where you, oh, I see. Wow. Yeah. It definitely accentuates. Things come off and you're like, oh, well that wasn't exactly what I did. Like lingerie does do shit for me. I mean, I guess it does. If it looks good, it looks good. I mean, but if like, you know, is it necessary? No. No. I noticed when a woman dresses well and cool, like some girls dress really cool in an effortless way. I find that very attractive. You're a weird motherfucker. That's why you're into fashion. Yes, I am turned to the left fashion. What if a girl showed up at your house with velcro shoes on and a fanny pack, but she had a banging ass banger. Yeah, it wouldn't really bother you.

Speaker 3:          00:40:43       Bother me at all when you're talking about a girl computer, burlap sack. I don't give a shit. Forget that. In moments when she was naked and it's like, guys, I've always been the kind of guy like my friends back. Nah, I would have did it, but I couldn't get past her feet. Shut the fuck up you baby. There are some feet. They're really will fuck you up. She could have holes. All right. She's got to go back and ask if there's an evolutionary thing for that though. Someone's got some crazy fucked up feet. You're like, Hey, am I going to have to carry you? That's what I'm looking for. Food. It's going to be a certain point in time where you're not going to be able to make it. Are you going? I wonder if that's true. It's 100% what it is. Cause I do. I also did be feet. How can we not weirded out about her elbows? I like petite arched feet that I think are an arched foot is very sexy. A petite foot. Really? That's so weird. Yeah. Yeah. That's not good. I liked the arch. A a flat foot on a, I like the foot of a woman who

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       I can go hiking. A woman who's got some sturdiness to her. Yeah, you have to have a little tiny fee. Fucking Weirdo. He wants these checks to be like barely able to talk. Okay,

Speaker 8:          00:41:43       brow. Excuse me sir. You just led me into, I can't give you chances to high. Can you do food?

Speaker 3:          00:41:50       I'm going to happen. They have to have a German accent on in her life and he's the cow. We're married. What's the ideal way? Right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       He'll wait for me. Another dimension. If you weren't married, what's the ideal way? About 80 pounds?

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       No, no, no, no. It's a breeding thing I need, I need about one 15 is good. One 15 one 2015 but athletic. I like athletic. I like broad shoulders, small waist and a and high insertion calves.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       It's funny, man. The the skirt thing, it's a, it's a very weird thing when you see them walking down the street and especially in Hollywood, like on Melrose, you'll see people walking on the street where their skirt and these are not sluts. I shouldn't even use that word. We shouldn't slut shame. It's really not nice. Yeah, and women who want to have sex with people, they don't slots. No.

Speaker 3:          00:42:36       Mary Helen just enjoying their life. Lord, I hate myself for using their angel from the Lord. What I should say, these are, these are not prostitutes.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       These are just girls like to dress in style and sexy and they're wearing these shorts that are just, there's just a little canopy over your vagina. I mean it's dangling, right? I mean right there you're talking about maybe three in chart to get work done, maybe three inches and they have a skirt that like the lower part of their ass. It's a normal thing to see the lower part of a girl's ass and a skirt in Hollywood. It's a normal thing. Exactly. It's ridiculous. It's,

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       it fucks the whole game up. It completely ruins distracting. It's, it completely ruins our ability to form rational thoughts and figure out if we were at before the podcast you were talking about how important it is to keep your mind on the right things. Yeah. In a way some societies are like, you know what? All women are going to be completely covered cause nobody's getting any fucking work done. Maybe that's where the burger came from. Burger King, we need to build a fucking pyramid, goddammit. We don't need to be staring at my ass all day cover these veterans. We've got work to do, cover them. Cover covering lab. We got to build pyramids. We gonna push rocks. Nobody wanted to push push rods. Yeah. They just want to stare at chicks and ministers. We'll hook up eventually. If you have enough attracted people and the of the opposite sex in the same room for long enough things are going.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       Yeah. Even if you're not in the same room, it's exactly, they smell each other. We're fucking Weirdos. Um, it's interesting because everybody will remember when you were in high school, when you were learning about Rome and the collapse of the empire and it was always about the, the excesses. It was always Caligula and the vomitorium, which apparently allegedly weren't real. Apparently there's no real evidence that there was vomitorium that they really like stick a fat down there there. Oh yeah. Tour. Let me, let me make sure that's true because, uh, I believe I read that, but it could have been another of those, I've read articles, that's one of the problems with fucking the internet as you'll read, like really convincing articles and then you start like saying it like it's Gospel truth. And then you read an article that's totally contradict, contrary to that, totally the opposite conclusion. And that's very convincing to, and you're like, God, that's why books are.

Speaker 6:          00:44:49       That's why historians who do a lot of primary research and really work on their source material though, that's why, that's where you should get the bulk of your information. Professors and and, and history.

Speaker 1:          00:44:58       Oh this is interesting. Vomitorium is actually a passage situated below or behind a tier of seeds in an amphitheater or stadium through which big crowds can exit rapidly at the end of the performance. So it's actually the idea is like the idea of a vomitorium like that's I it sounds like it was ignorance. It sounds like a, whoever was talking about, I didn't understand that that was a, from a Latin word, which means to spew forth meaning how to get crowds in and out of places. Well, so like we like decided that it was, there was a room that they would go after dinner and vomit, but for sure someone's done that right. For someone, for sure. If someone stuck a feather than it throats that they could keep eating. Sure why not if everything's happened that's happened. I had a really cool,

Speaker 6:          00:45:46       this, this professor at Oxford Philosophy press professor was talking about the rise of Christianity and why it took hold. And one of the things he said is in, during Rome, Rome was, you know, had, had conquered so much of the world, um, and Rome was kind of bursting at the scenes with Greek philosophy with their, their, their, their elite were taught by Greek, uh, tutors and, and their documents officially were written in Greek. And so Socrates and Aristotle, all the great philosophers had a profound effect on the Roman empire, their justice system. They're there, their property, right laws and things. And at the end of the day, regardless, the Roman empire was crumbling from the inside out. It was to came from the inside out. And along comes this radical rabbi, uh, Jesus Christ, Christ Jesus of Nazareth who comes along and with this radical idea and his apostles, you know, later on took these ideas into the Roman empire. But it took hold basically, you know, the theory was because people were looking for something more. The idea that it's not just about reason, it's about faith.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       There's two articles that are hilarious. Back to back, just to prove what we were just talking about. One of them was Jesus, a Roman invention and the, there's an article on Huffington Post that there's a guy who, uh, is a, a biblical scholar, allegedly who is a, has these revelations threatening to undo Christianity and that he believes that he's got proof that they're, that the, the, the idea of Christian was a, a creation with the idea of Jesus Christ was a creation by the Romans. Well, it lasted, that's for sure. Yeah, but I mean it's possible there could be, but it's fascinating. There's that and, but if you further, by the way, Huffington post has one of those weird things where tries to get you to not back click, wow, those are so gross. Why would we try to scroll backwards? It just resets the page. Scroll backwards or hate that shades. It only, it happens only on the, when you use the swipe thing on a laptop to go backwards. But it doesn't, if you actually use the Arrow, but you've got to go out there and use the arrow. But you go to a Catholic answers and then the title of the article is, no, the Romans did not invent Jesus. So it's like you could find whatever you want to find. You could find the Romans invented Jesus. You could find that Jesus was a real historical guy.

Speaker 6:          00:48:05       Well, if it, yeah. Christianity filled in the, uh, power vacuum after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Constantinople, his wife was a Christian Constantine. Yeah. Uh, and uh, some reason that what caused that, why they decided to submit it. Yeah. Christianity is not in Italy, decided to accept the idea that Christ was Lord, you know, cry that, that he was, he was more than just flesh. But do you ever see the God who was there,

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       um, God who wasn't there was a documentary [inaudible] 2005, disproving? Well, uh, apparently, uh, according to the documentary, disproving the, uh, the, the actual birth and life of Jesus Christ. The saying that it was just a myth.

Speaker 6:          00:48:49       Well, well either way, what I think is actually interesting and kind of radical about the idea of was in Rome, the entire ethos and Credo of the, of the country was, might makes, right. I mean, there's statues were muscular, it was all about domination and there was the week and there were the strong and they had a whole pantheon of gods that, you know, kind of supported something of that and, and, and their gods also, we're kind of gods that were a little bit out of reach if you didn't, don't pray to them too much cause you might anchor them. They were always a little bit out of reach, you know? Yeah. I mean, they were, they were, they were their own. Yeah. They were their own kind of entity that you could sort of sometimes have communion with, but you had to be very careful because they were jealous and they would do things to you.

Speaker 6:          00:49:29       The idea that you and your wife, right, sure. They would do. That's what Zeus did. Write a song to leave it. But, but what, um, what Christianity came along and said was, which is interesting and I'm, I'm just, I'm not, I've never been very religious but love, love, love thy enemy. Uh, um, and the idea of forgiveness, um, and the idea of love in general, those are very, it's interesting how powerful and soft, but how powerful and resonant those ideas are and how they stayed powerful, uh, help the needy, help the weak. The meek shall inherit the earth. Those I talking like a preacher, they're very enduring ideas in the beauty Birtle era when that it's put on. That was, that was a radical yet even the example of whether it's true and I love of him being Sacral, you know, crucified and torture and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Those ideas are all like ideas that everyone has. If you're a moral person, if you love your friends and neighbors, if you, you, you realize after life and years of experience what's good and what's bad, you know, when it works out, it seems to work. I want, I'm nice to people write that shit down. I mean this, they say that that was, you know, there was anything other than that. Well, it did though have an effect on history and it did change things. No one knows. No one knows where the fuck of it came from. No one knows where any of these obvious tampon. And not only that, by the time you are getting them the, the, the way they'd been broken down from ancient Hebrew to Latin, to Greek, ancient Hebrew, there's still struggling with most of it. It's like three quarters of the words in ancient Hebrews like some debate about, because they had numbers and numbers were letters, the letters or numbers and the numerical value to the words. So anybody saying that it means anything. It's like, boy, you sure that's a, you need a lot of fucking scholars to sit down and break that shit down for you to be confident about what you've read in English. But what the Bible says, stop.

Speaker 2:          00:51:20       I believe in God, but I think, uh, all the evidence took the fucking air out of the room. All the evidence, uh, uh, points that God's in asshole it'd be exist. Why would he put the three major religions capital in the same spot? And then I've traveled all over the world. Why couldn't he have put like the Jews capitol in Hawaii, like the Christians in the Caribbean where, why would he have more than one where everybody, everyone would be happy to visit the other person's place. Christianity, Christianity,

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       Islam come from the, I mean the Old Testament is recognized in both, in both religions. Right. As, as the first book. Do you know all over stone's son converted to Islam? No, I didn't do he really, that's what you know, you raised your kid, right?

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       Awesome. Yeah. You knocked it out of the park. That is the old white American Dad. Super fucking storm. I think I'm going to convert to, there's only one way. See the writing on the wall. Don't ask you what this fucking breeze is going. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       I'm joining that team. Hello? Uh, well, um, uh, Cat Stevens decided, I guess he got really Christian then he decided to be a Muslim. Yeah. I mean he, he went deep and he basically stopped recording. I know for years. Didn't he do a new album recently? Yeah, we did a couple of years ago. That's a strange cat man. Who knows man, more than one guy has done it more than one guy, smarter than me. He's converted. I don't to all sorts of things, man. I've met brilliant people that converted to Mormonism. I'm like, Huh? I mean, I don't know what it is. I don't know what's going on. I don't even want to ask. I don't. I'm too slow. But it's the, it's the, it's, it's the ideas that I was talking about where those go simple ideas that seem like they're, like you said, I don't know where they came from, but the fact that they lasted and, and maybe they, I think they always existed with human beings. Like it's, you know, it's things that people learn. Everyone learns. If you're in a tribal situation, everyone learns comradery. You all learned that. You don't want your family members get eaten by a lion. We all learn how to keep each other together and we all feel the rush of survival. We all love each other. There's a little bit of a difference. The differences this, and this was, this was the, the essentially what the Christians, I believe, uh, the idea at the example of Christianity contributed was idea that yes,

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       tribes will say that about each other, the mangoes and everybody else. The difference was that along comes this, this guy, whether you know he was God, he existed. The idea was all of us are of the same moral worth. We all come from the same father. No matter what your skillset, no matter what your skin color, no matter what your background and that idea it has lasted. And that idea is the cornerstone of our justice system and everything else. That that is the contract.

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       That's what every hippie figures out when they get high, what happens is every hippie figures that out when they get high, we're all the same man. We are all the same dude. You eat a pot Brownie, that's exactly what you'll figure out. Figure out where all exactly the same. So it's like, you know, the idea that this was some mass magical thing to figure out, like come on. Well, everybody figures out that it was given forum, like the Bible gave it forms, sort of, you know, it also just was wrapped up by a bunch of bishops and content team to try to control people. But you still need symbols I guess to, you know, to fall back. I couldn't do the pagans were too hard to pin down. These motherfuckers are worshiping the moon and shit and like stop there, there to make too much sense.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       You know, they would celebrate during the summer solstice and the winter solstice. They all these celebrations they would not budge from. So Christianity had to say, ah, let's see, listen to this. What a fucking coincidence. Odd Jog. Fucking God was born in the same day as you went and sold to one of the odds. You guys gotta join us, join up with us. Come on. We up the fucking same thing. We call it Christmas. We said we'll put a tree out, you know, and they started like incorporating pagan aspects into their, where are we running naked this April? Jesus was supposed to be born in April. He wasn't born in July was kind of December, you know, it's pretty wild.

Speaker 6:          00:55:09       I always forget about like one of the enduring qualities of at least Catholicism is the idea of confession. That is a very strong, strong thing to be able to go to a priest once a week or every day and confess your sins, right.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       And be absolved of them. Wow. And it's totally anonymous. Talk about the first therapy. There is clearly that that was bullshit. Biggest things. People wasn't the first. There you are crazy that that we, that was invented purely to control rebellion to figure out who's doing what. Wrong. To figure out who's or trying to overthrow the Catholic church. Oh, a hundred percent dude. You weren't even allowed to do you mean? You mean like being able to confess fashion? They want to know what the fuck you did. They want to keep tracks on everybody. Tell us what you did or you're going to fucking fry in hell. But now you don't have to fry in hell. Congratulations. Go see a few of these. And we got all the information we need from you. So if you were hanging out with Martin Luther, the Anabaptist, you were thinking about taking over the Catholic church because the fucking Catholic Church wouldn't let you print the Bible out in a phonetic form. No one could read the Bible. You had to rely on priests until Martin Luther came along and so they, they were fucking flight and people on fire for that man to him. Martin Luther was branded a heretic and he had to leave wherever. Germany, Germany, yeah, I know Germany,

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       but I can't, I'm trying to think of the town. Good way to fucking find out what people are looking, but I like, oh, it's the real, it's really what it was invented for. It's, it's a total, a hundred percent position of power and control. That's all it is. You mean this guy is either way, either way. It worked and it kept people very loyal to the church and continues to be to keeps people scared. You know, there are priests that are out there that are listening to you and not telling people things.

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       I liked it. Lenny Bruce, he had a, he had a priest outfit and he would go around Miami and like he would take confessions and talk to people. He just, there was a little period, I don't know where you bought it or had it made, but it's hilarious. One of Lenny Bruce Biographies. So he's just, you know, Jewish guy and he's dressed up like a priest, want to people's houses, listening to their confessions.

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       They just, the idea of it, you know, you get absolved. You not only that, you could absolve people and get a free pass through purgatory, have to do some bad shit if you donate money to the church. That's right. There was selling free pass.

Speaker 4:          00:57:19       Uh, I was in, um, uh, Naples, uh, in September, Italian city dropper and there was a church there. Oh, really? Corrupt. I saw a guy, uh, uh, trying to snatch and an iPad out of some older Australian couples backpack and the wife saw him again away from there and to do, just shrugged, like, uh, you know, I guess I've lost money touch. You know why? Like I'm a thief, that's what I do. But in Naples, there was a church of a souls in purgatory and there was all these like, uh, you know, skulls in front of it and whenever it was made in the 13 hundreds or whatever, but these like rich Catholics there, they were concerned about the soul stuck in purgatory. So they spent all this money and made this, uh, this church for them. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       purgatory was even invented to try to convert pagans because they were, the Irish believed in the land of fe. They live, but they believed in this land where like fairies and elves lived, that it was like just over there, you know, probably because of mushrooms, they're probably eating mushrooms. I mean, it's most likely if you tried to figure out like why you would think that ELLs were in some like nearby dimension that you could reach. And so the Catholics had convinced him, oh Nah, that's purgatory. Yeah, we know about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's when you go, when you're not a good guy. I've got to stay there for a little bottle and a half in so you don't have to go all the way to hell. Well, I'd also like family can buy you off that. Yeah. The penalty box for Dante is divine.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       The divine comedy was all about purgatory, right? That was the great work. The divine comedy. It's amazing what people wouldn't fan to control. People like the stupid shit that they [inaudible] ology story. Well that kind of stuff. I mean, when you got to direct, when you know there's a direct path between the Christians trying to incorporate the Pagans, the pagans, not wanting to be altering of the timelines of it, you know, like, Oh, our celebration, same as your celebration. Let's figure out how to make this happen. I'm less cynical about, I'm actually a little bit more of a fan of the idea that I, that those ideas

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       carried, uh, carry forth and have lasted so long because there is, there is truth to them. The idea that we're all the same moral worth. For example, uh, the idea of [inaudible] fucking lecture.

Speaker 7:          00:59:32       That was the interesting thing about gets intellectually interesting, so smooth. That was the interesting thing about China was am I lagers chrome belief system is so different that they are like their, their holidays are different. Their whole mindset and like all these things that we just accepted our reality. There's a whole different mental world going on in the channel

Speaker 6:          00:59:53       Dow, right? Confucius, that's the idea of being balanced, balanced as huge harmony, being in harmony with everything around you. Do you ever hear that, that they did this great study where they had Chinese people look at that fish tank and Americans look at a fish tank? No. When they asked them to describe it, they, Americans described the fish and the Chinese didn't net. The fish were just a part of, they described the relationship between the seaweed, the stones, uh, the fish, how much water was in the tank. They were looking at the whole thing and how it all related to each other. The fish were just a part. There were no more important. For example, then the stones, when they asked Americans to describe how many stones or what kind of seaweed the Americans had no idea because they were just looking at the fish.

Speaker 1:          01:00:34       This is the way they came up with a December 25th date for Jesus. They, uh, that the, the, the world was created. This is awesome. Laughing. Um, the, they tried to figure out, um, when from the idea of when he was conceived and to go from there. That's, that's where it was a, that's where they started it out from. It came from the point of conception, which was, um,

Speaker 7:          01:01:01       and didn't the Pagan holiday involve a tree. So, and we just incorporated that tree.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. I'm trying, I'm trying to find this thing. Shit.

Speaker 7:          01:01:15       Well, again, the Internet again. Sorry. I'm Brian [inaudible]. You can't talk about Chinese people and fish without a me telling this story. Uh, Joe, are you ready for this?

Speaker 1:          01:01:29       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the information? Yeah. No, I don't. It's, um, it's, it's kind of ambiguous. There's a lot of debate on this. This is not something that like anybody really assure of when this, uh, this dude was actually born, the church leaders decided that they needed a Christian alternative to rival popular solstice celebrations. They chose December 25th as the date of Christ's birth and held the first recorded feast of activity in Rome. Um, so the idea was they reckon the world was created in the spring equinox and four days later on March 25th light was created since the existence of Jesus signaled the beginning of the new era or a new creation, the biblical chronographs [inaudible] assume that Jesus has conception would have also fallen on March 25th placing his birth in December nine months later seems logical. I mean, they created the earth and then four days later

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       light Duh Duh. What? Okay. It seems like a good day or a problem with that very historic, keep in mind that it is the Internet. So we're not sure if it's a hundred percent true. Yeah, this is all I want to hear. Tom Rhodes. I tell the story please.

Speaker 7:          01:02:32       So I was just in Hong Kong a few weeks ago and uh, I remembered this story of something that happened to me the very first time I went to Hong Kong was like 12 years ago. And I'd never been to Hong Kong and China and I was really excited and wanted to see it. I was staying at the Shangri la hotel, the most opulent, fancy, luxurious hotel I've ever been in my life. I mean above, beyond Fivestars, just swink. And so the first day I just walked and walked and I wanted to soak a as much of Hong Kong and my eyeballs. I could just see the city and I'm walking around. And when I got back to my hotel room at the end of the day, they had put a goldfish in a little goldfish bowl on my desk and it had a note and it said, traveling is sacred, but no one deserves to be alone. That's why we've provided the goldfish. It's awesome to be your friend and keep you company during your stay here. Thank you. So two nights later, Fatboy slim is doing a concert on the Calhoun side of the harbor. I love Fatboy slim. I'd never seen him. I had a, you know, somehow

Speaker 2:          01:03:48       got some ecstasy or whatever it was. And uh, it was, it was such a great night. These Chinese people were just so stylish and fashionable. They looked like he had fallen out of fashion magazines. I just had such a great time dancing in the middle and a Fatboy slim was just electrifying that night. And I drank tons and I got really, really drunk, you know, life of a car. Uh, that night

Speaker 7:          01:04:15       when I'm sleeping back in my hotel room, I shit the bed. I'm like, Huh,

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       awake, you know, that kind of a wet or drunk sleep. And I thought it was a Fart, you know, and I looked, I blow it out and it's like wet ass p goes all over the bed. And I had never, I'd never should've been before. I'd never should've been in my welcome to the team. I just absolutely say I have absolutely ashamed that it happened. I felt the title. So the next day I went and I walked all over the city. And you know, uh, when I came back to my hotel room,

Speaker 7:          01:04:49       they had taken my golden.

Speaker 2:          01:04:52       You didn't even bother. Nobody deserves to be alone except for you. You been shitting Hickory. Bad Shit and x freak. That's the problem. Actually. See sexy until you shit though. It's such a lovely thing. They put a little goldfish in my room. That's nice man. Beautiful. So Nice. Hey, someone makes a really good point on this message board. How the fuck did Christianity, uh, sure. Everyone being equal and yet still slavery?

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       That was exactly the debate. The Abraham had slaves. Uh, so the, the, the slaveholders would cite the Old Testament, but you're right. I mean, that was in fact, right? It's also what Martin Luther King and a lot of a lot of abolitionists used to as, as fuel to fight the slave trade, which was what? That we are all have the same father. Am I not a man? The, the abolitionists always reciting those kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       But why would they, uh, going if they're going by the Old Testament, the old testament's the real deal, the new testament is the one that's got clear fuckery attached to it, right? Well, so if you're going to go by the word of God, then oldest shit, you can get less.

Speaker 6:          01:06:00       I don't know the fuck. The fundamental difference was this, the young Ted seat that Christ said, the good news is all of us can be essentially, uh, Jews are okay, are, are, are children of have the same father. So it's not, the Old Testament was very much for the, you know, in, in taught in the temple and ms for this small group of people called the Jews. But along comes Christ who says, you know, you can't tell people, talk how people read the book of Leviticus about it, how to quarter a calf. It just, you know, there's just all not to eat off spray. None of this shit is relevant. What monitors matters is that you do want to others as you'd have them do unto that Christ guy. That's the idea. That would be the idea. Oh, let's just all allegedly Joe Rogan's going to hell because Jesus, it's individualized

Speaker 1:          01:06:45       mating. Fascinating thing that in 2013 just this conversation is very dangerous to some people. This is a dangerous topic. Yeah. People get angry at you for discussing whether or not a Zombie existed, whether or not a guy died and three days later came back to life because he was mad.

Speaker 6:          01:07:04       I'm not making that argument, man. I'm not having any, I'm not all I'm talking about. Yeah, no, I know. Historical figure, but it's talking about that. I'm just talking about what was, what Christianity's tenants are. That's all me up

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       and thinking about how many people are going full bore for the, you know, historical, Biblical version. There's the Gallup poll most recent that they did in like the late two thousands about someone. They asked him, dude, how old do you believe the earth is? Do you believe in the Biblical version of creationism? And like 46% said they thought the earth was less than 10,000 years old as stated in the Bible. Well, that's more proof that if that statistic is right, that's scary. It's not, I'm sure, because it's, first of all, it's a statistic, which means that the only people that answer idiots, right? So you're, you're getting idiots that answer these fucking, these, these questionnaires, nobody, nobody will though life or a job or time you always hit no thanks. Yeah. Nobody does that. So it's, but out of those people that are dumb enough to answer that form, 46% think the earth, 10,000 years old. That's amazing. I've had debates with people who, you know, who I thought were fairly intelligent, fair minded people who just insist that what they read in the Bible is literally true. Yeah. There's a lot of people like that.

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       I liked him, met people in Australia who called Easter Flying Zombie Day.

Speaker 1:          01:08:20       That's a good name for it. I went super bunny day two, giant fucking evil bunny. I like the idea. I like the idea of trying to give you candy. If you leave on symbolism and beats something, then okay. Yeah. It's, well, you know, and it's also a unique way for people to turn their life around. You believe in this one guy's teachings and this one guy's teachings really still, you know, the way they're translated in sort of an employee, you know, sort of use today in the best aspects of Christianity. Very beneficial for a lot of people. And so having something like that, whether it's based on a real person or whether it's based on an idea, it's very beneficial to alcoholics, you know, like 12 step programs.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       How many fighters do you think of? The guy was right. Jesus was just like a brilliant comedian and just very misunderstood. It's right that like plank in the eye line. I mean that's, I had to have been a joke. I don't think that was totally a joke. One good minute turning wine into water snacks was dog shit. I think it was just a really preachy guy. Constantly telling everybody how to live their life. Like to where the jokes, where's the jokes bro? What am I, how many fighters strong opens, strongest spiders.

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       There's this, what'd you say Joe? A large percentage. Yeah, probably more than, um, like the average person, if you took the, uh, they say that atheism is on the rise in America and uh, you know, some guy wrote an article about a by 20, 41 or something like that. There being no more religion. I think that's a big fucking leap. But the idea is that atheism is on the rise. Um, I don't think, I think in with fighters though, you're dealing with a lot of them of course, almost more so in boxing than an MMA. But in, even in MMA, a lot of them are coming from poor backgrounds. A lot of them are coming from uh, places where people were, you know, the strong religious footholds. Right. You know, Iowa and shit like that. Like wrestlers, a lot of Christians, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:10:14       I saw that Tyson documentary last week. And uh, I love at the beginning when custom Mata takes him under his wing and he's teaching him and he told him that he had to convince him cause he had low self esteem coming from the street and everything. But he is one of the main factors that he's telling me. If you don't have the warrior spirit, you'll never going to be a winner. He, I have to believe in yourself as the, you know, the mythical warrior.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       Yeah. Champion. In a way that's may work. A lot of boxers find solace in the idea that there's something bigger than, than, than, than fighting for it. I've heard many fighters say they're doing the Lord's work. It's fascinating. Yeah. I'm doing God's work. I'm, there's not just one guy, many guys saying I'm doing God's work. [inaudible] no, I don't believe he is. I mean, he might be a little bit, but, uh, I don't think for the most part it is period tires personally. Um, you know what, I've said that and people give me a hard time about that. I mean, only GSP knows what he should or shouldn't do. Um, I think the guy is just an amazing representative of martial arts. He's like such a true martial artist and such a great champion for a long time. I mean, he was at the top of the sport in an incredibly talented stack division.

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       And he dominated that division for a long time. But I think every fighter has got a life time inside the octagon. There's a amount of time that you can spend in there. George has fought more minutes inside the five and a half hours than any fighter ever. That's a, that's a long time and he's taken 50% of all the blows he's ever taken his entire career in the last three fights. Wow. 875 the shots I believe too as well. The one of the things I was talking about was how in the lead up to this fight was how difficult he is to hit. And Johnny Hendricks hits really hard, but he's difficult to hit, which was fairly true. Once he got loose on the feet. Um, like say I would say in certain rounds, like in the third round, it was hard for Johnny hit him in the fifth round, was hard for trying to hit him.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       George got loose, but Johnny still like when they got close was able to land some horrible shots on him while George is going for the take down. Johnny hit them with three or four absolutely brutal elbows to the head and then a couple really hard uppercuts as is trying to hold onto his leg and take them down and Johnny blasted them with like it leased to flush upper cuts on the chin with in the kitty. It's hard. Anybody who thought that George won that first round, I'm like, well, I don't know what you judge a fight on. You know, look, Johnny blasted his leg over and over again with these from the college look so hard. Knees and people try to pretend that those don't count or something. I don't know why you're not scoring that like those are debilitating. That's a smart move. It's damaged, it's real.

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       It's happening right in front of your face. But because it's such an easy thing to do, just need someone in the leg. People don't think it's a big deal. It's almost as good as a leg kick. It's almost as good as electric depending on how good it looks. So painful. Yeah. And the way Hendricks throws him, it might be as good as a leg kick. He fucking really leans into those knees. So He's hit him. He hit him with horrible fucking elbows when he was trying to take them down, he hit him with a horrible uppercut. We was holding onto a single, at least one or two horrible uppercuts and then blasted his knee. And you know, I mean, and took them down once. I mean, it's just like, I don't know what people are looking at. I mean, I dunno. I know you people love towards CPA.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       Look at his face. At the end of that fight, George gets busted up in a lot of fights and still dominates them. You know, he, he has that kind of skin. So some people just don't like Bj. Penn never gets cut. He's just got this incredible skin. Yeah, he's got, he's got a lot of scar tissue. So I played. Yes. But I think that there's gonna come a time when George is going to have to retire. So when is that time going to be? When a guide to me starts talking about retiring and thinking about getting out, that's when he should get out. I agree. And when a guy does a post fight thing, it says, look, I gotta I gotta stop. And it could just be the pressure of forget about all the shots that he's taken, all the brutal five round fights that he's been in.

Speaker 1:          01:14:09       Just the pressure of being at the top. I guess your while you don't want to fucking deal with that shit anymore. He's made a ton of money and even if he's not going to retire, the idea of stepping back and chilling out for a bit, like he said in the post fight press conference, it's probably a good idea. My, my feeling also is that, you know, if he's be, if he's blurry in one eye, if his, if he's having trouble remembering, I don't want to see a human being that beautiful have a problem with his brain and a problem with his eyes. And what is your brain and your eye worth? It's not worth $12 million. It was worth a lot more than that. And I want to see a guy like George saint walk away while he still can not carry down on a shield. You know, fighting is a young man's sport and there's a certain amount of years.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       Dana White's at GSP versus Hendricks rematches on track, you know, and also it turns out that George is getting sued by his ex manager. He's got a lot of shit going on, which can really fuck with your head. You know, there's some million dollar lawsuit hovering over his head. Yeah, I think George is a great guy and I think he's an amazing example of what's possible with hard work and discipline. And he's a real champion, a true champion. I like to see a true champion go out on top and there's just not many of ever done it. He's the only one that I couldn't remember his Marvin Hagler. Marvin Hagler is the only fighter that never came back, went out in a fight that most people believe he won. He fought sugar ray Leonard. And a lot of people believe that he won that decision. It was if it was a close enough fight that it wasn't the worst robbery in history, but a lot of people believe that haggle should've won and Hagler stepped out and that was it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:39       That was such a great period in boxing, man. There was so many great fights. You know, I always think that like Pacquiao and Mayweather, not, I think they deprived us of like two great fights and rematches. I mean there was so many haggler Thomas Hitman, Hearns uh, the uh, what was the Cuban guy? Smart man, sugary load, the Roberta [inaudible] epic fights. Then Duran Duran vs packet would have been an amazing say, similar style, touching their belly like fucking beer. They had similar bearded man. That would've been a war. Duran had more of a beard, you know, but pack yet with that goatee looks very devil like you see Duran, like those old pictures of him and his eyes. If you're at a game, bread pit bull, you know, let's talk to the pin through that though. He had that same literally the same eyes, like just, just ferocity. He was a bad motherfucker. Dude. Everybody. I've talked to him as a real boxer. They always say my favorite bag. I was like, boom, boom, man. Seeing his favorite fighter. Roberto Duran. So many boxers who are real great boxers. We'll, we'll talk about Duran. Like, you know, there's a lot of people that people forget like Aaron Pryor. I remember when your car got cocaine in the corner before the 13th round. I don't remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Panama Lewis, the guy was eventually, uh, he, he got kicked,

Speaker 1:          01:16:54       kicked out of boxing for a, another fight where, uh, I think it was a Billy resto and uh, I forget the guy's name, but um, he took, took the padding out of someone's gloves. And so there's this young up and coming kid who, uh, fought this, this, you know, experienced veteran. The news is expected to beat and instead he got busted up really bad. Like I said, both eyes swollen lots vision is, I had to retire from boxing, but after the fight, they grabbed the guy's hands and they could feel there was no padding on his knuckles. Oh my God. It was just taped up knuckles. That's all he had and he just fuck this guy up. And for people who don't know a boxing glove, it's fairly thick. Yeah, it's, it's still dangerous. You could certainly get knocked out, but there's a lot of padding like when a knuckle hits you like, especially when it goes over your eye, whereas a raw knuckle goes right into your eye and he's just getting smashed.

Speaker 1:          01:17:47       Man. He got smashed and after the fight it turned out that Panama Lewis had done this and Panama Lewis was the same guy that gave the, the, this, this bottle that Aaron Pryor was like a serious cocaine addicts and the Aaron Pryor, like I said, uh, you know, it was like leading into one of the later rounds and panel. I said, no, not that battle. The one on one I made and he brings a body, gives it to Aaron Pryor and Aaron probably just goes out there like a fucking man possessed and destroys Alexis are grail and knocks him out in the next round. That was fights were sick and the word on the street was always that, not, not that I was on the street when I got the word, but the word in the boxing gym where I trained at was that everybody always knew that it was cocaine. Panama, Louis literally gave him cocaine, God. And he went out there coked up. If you haven't seen, if you haven't seen Aaron Pryor and Alexis Arguello fight youtube that shit because

Speaker 4:          01:18:34       I love that so many fights are on youtube. I don't know if we talked about this before. I read this brilliant book last year called [inaudible]. It was a flame of pure fire about Jack Dempsey and the roaring twenties. And he was such an interesting character, but it's great as, as I was reading this book, you can go back and look up the fights on youtube. So I'm reading about this, you know, these fights and like the 19 teens and uh, you know, even before him, the, uh, Jack Johnson fight in Havana where this French Guy Colten [inaudible] or whatever his name was, it was, uh, knocks him out and you get, Jack Johnson is on the floor and he like, he, he lifts his glove up cause it was, he wanted to block that sun from his eyes while the guy's like counting him out. The idea was that he took a dive, right.

Speaker 4:          01:19:16       And then, but uh, like a Dempsey and Furpa, this Argentinian guy, the first round, you watch it on youtube, there's like a football gets knocked down five times in the first round or maybe it's like seven. Damn. She's clobbering him and then he comes back over over and then allowed to get up for po knocked. That was so many rules were made after this fight for, for apoe knocks Dempsey out of the ring. He landed on the sports writers table and the sportswriters helped him get back up. You know, he was so beloved and get back in the ring. So from that fight it a fighter could never, uh, he has to get back into the ring on his own ability. You can't be helped. And then also in that fight, he's knocking for bow down and he's standing over him and as he's trying to get up, he just plowed him every time he's chatting. And it was also that fight. They made the role. When a guy gets knocked down, you have to, you know, back away and go to a neutral corner cause back then you could stand over a guy

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       and as he's trying to get up, you can just keep on. Yeah. That's most of the old fights. If you watch most of those old fights, they would stand over you as a county [inaudible] tutto fights, which by the way, makes more sense. Yeah, it really does make more sense. I mean, if a guy fucking knocks you down, why, why do you let him get up again? Why can't you stand over him? You, you're, you're the one who knocked him down. Pull up Dempsey FERPA. That the first like minute and a half is just, it's insane. [inaudible] murderous puncher to man. God Damn, those guys were tough as shit.

Speaker 4:          01:20:36       You know how he started in like a, he was born in Colorado and he lived in the, uh, like mining camps in Utah and he would go to, uh, like bars and mining camps and say, who's the toughest guy here? And that's how he, like as a teenager, he just walking into a mining camp and people would all bet on it and he'd make a little money, but like, he was just pure bad ass.

Speaker 3:          01:20:58       Wow. That's a hard way to make a living, hone into the mining kid. Who's the toughest guy here? Mind Jimmy's Jimmy Burke's uncle already Burke. He used to do that. He, when they were, where he worked on the railroad tracks, when they would lay the railroad and uh, those, those camps, he was 16, but he grew up with a father, was a pro boxer, uh, fought for the title. So he would fight grown men. And that's how we learned how to fight boxing back then was a real Spec, a very popular sport. It's the way it wasn't in Mexico. If you're, if you're a great boxer, you're a national hero. I mean they, they show up for those fights. That's what it's going to be like in America. But America, nobody even knows who the heavyweight title holder is. I know. If you looked at, have you seen who that best American heavyweight is?

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       Well, let me just, no one knows who the Klitschkos are. They don't know. The average person doesn't know it's a fight. Fans might know. It's amazing. The average person has no idea that heavyweight champ. It's so corrupt. Well no, because he's boring as fuck. If he was exciting, like if he, if he was, you know, like a Manny Pacquiao, everybody knows who Manny Pacquiao, Manny Pacquiao, always 145 pounds. Everybody knows who he is. Why doesn't everybody know who the heavyweight title holder is? Cause he jabs and hangs on to grabs and hangs on. He's a jab and hold Goliath fights or more exciting. Well he's boring. Yeah. Mike Tyson was a heavy fighter. Fights. We're super excited. Yeah. It's just a matter of the style of the fighter and Klitschkos have this very intelligent, safe style. And it's very hard to beat them. They just jabbed the shit out of you.

Speaker 3:          01:22:21       And they're tall as fuck. They use their reach advantage and never get close. They don't get stupid and start winging punches with you. Right. You know, there, especially in iron man. Yeah, I mean in the way Mayweather, what I noticed is that he stands on the outside and he takes one shot. It's really like one left watch. It's not like flurries and combinations cause that's always dangerous. If you watch him step back, he's not staying in a phone booth. He's moving movies, stepping back, Bang, come in, Bang. And he might, he might hit you with two sometimes. Like, like he'll, he'll lead with like that, that, that upper, that, that upper hook, that up hook or whatever app or punch a particular, what do you call it? Upper cut. Sorry. He'll, he'll upper cut and then maybe come over to the right. But that's it. And then he pulls back. But for the most part he stands back and take pot shots. He's really good at it. Did you see that Mayweather fight? Uh, there was some Mexican guy, Canelo Alvarez and the Mexican guys. Dad gets up at the pre fight press conference. No, no, none. He keeps going in a different guy and he's calling, keeps calling me. Whether like a talking about that fighter is a front runner. He's the front runner and all that.

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       He's a different guy. You're talking about a Garcia. Danny Garcia who's a dad is like, it's really colorful character.

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       What was that with Mayweather. He was saying then it's no dude who's like Mayweather, like a similar, he's black. I always like him or never let your dad is very temporary towers Connor. He actually fought. They fought. They fought. He fought Mayweather.

Speaker 1:          01:23:45       Yeah. Subdued is really good. Yeah. Mayweather's just smarter than all of them. That's what he is. He's the smartest one of all of them. He knows how to not get hit. He knows how to just pot shot you hit you with jabs, uses reflex, uses smart boxing and you, he doesn't get hit. You get hit and he doesn't get that amazing. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:24:00       He's won the game. That's what a lot of boxes that come from boxing fighter fighter families. Um, they, their, their fathers and uncles have learned, you know, there's no upside, there's no upside of eating out of a straw when you're 35 cause your head, you've got Pluto pugilistic dementia, at least start with not getting it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:15       He's got his trainer, he's trained or Rogers is fucking cousin or his uncle, his uncle and his trainer Rogers. He was a good fighter. Black Mamba. Yeah. Roger May where there was a bad mother fucker. Yep. But he's got problems from fighting. They all do. Look at Freddy Roach. She's like one of the greatest trainers ever who used to be a really tough fighter. He's got problems too. He's got Parkinson's trauma related Parkinson's. Everybody pays man. There's no free rides. And my thoughts on the guy like George Saint Pierre, ours, it would be beautiful to see a guy like him go out on top. I agree. But if he feels like he didn't put forth his best effort and he wants to go one more against Johny Hendricks and show what he could really do, you know, but somewhere down the line we're going to have to have this conversation.

Speaker 1:          01:24:56       Whether it's this fight, whether it's the next fight, whether it's two, three fights from now, it's going to be a certain point in time where George, who has more minutes inside the octagon that any fighter ever, that's one statistic that you looked at five and a half hours. And then you also look at the one that he's taking 50% of the shots in the last three fights. Those are two, this disturbing statistics. Not Disturbing, but I, here's the best way to describe it. There are two things you should look at. You should look at those two things. And that's the reality of this sport we live in. And the best that we, that we, uh, that we watch. But the best way to, to make sure that this doesn't happen is to discuss it. That's the only way. If we keep this shit in the dark and no one talks about it and no one ever brings up the fact that hey, you know, you're not gonna be able to take shots like that forever. There has to be a point in time. You could safely do it for a certain amount of time, as long as you're careful, as long as they have good defense, as long as you're smart with your training. But there's gonna come a point in time, you probably shouldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       I was kind of shocked that the, that they counted the number of times he's taken a blow. It's 875 times in the past, in, in, in the five and a half hours he's been in the octagon. That does not count the number of times he's gotten hit in the head in training camp and training camp. You know, I've

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       talked to enough fighters where you're, you walk, you walk away with a headache, man. Of course. You know, of course you do. You're not, you're getting hit in the face. Look at his face. Wow. Yeah, dude, trust me. There's something going on. You gotta be careful, you know, and he was talking up to the fight about losing memory. He lost memory during the fight. It's not cool. Yeah, I don't like seeing that. And He'd also told me on this podcast that he, um, hit me and he wonders what it is that he like misses time sometimes. And he actually was wondering like, you know, not saying that it was aliens, but it could be possible that, you know, when people talk about missing time from abductions, that that happens to him. You know, this is something that he's had from the time he was young.

Speaker 1:          01:26:41       I'm like, man, I don't know. I mean, maybe it's possible. It's possible. It's aliens, but it's also, there's other things to think about when you start talking about like missing time. When you start talking about there's, there's, there's a real issue with cognitive function. If you're talking about like periods of your life that disappear. I don't think anything's worth that, I don't think. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what it is. It might be nothing. It might be a nutrition thing. And I'm not, obviously not a neurologist. I'm not a doctor. I don't know what the fuck he's actually experiencing. I don't know if maybe it's just a Deja Vu thing. I don't know what the fuck it is, but when someone starts talking about things like that and also talking about possibly retiring, all those things, she'd be taken into consideration and it should be approached very carefully.

Speaker 1:          01:27:26       We also know that continued head trauma for football and boxing and things does cause problems. There's no way around it. I mean there's no way, it seems like everybody who does it for a certain amount of time, there's a certain number of times you can get hit. There's just where you start feeling that you have damn like chocolate. Dal is the perfect example. Chocolate Dell used to have a fucking iron jaw. It was one of the things that was so scary about him is that he could knock you out and it was really hard to get him out of there. He has so much fucking heart and so such an intense high drive to finish the fight and he took tremendous shots like right on the button got rocked and plastic. You write back and knocked you out happened all the time. He would just scare the fuck out of guys cause he would just charge you and he was just throwing bombs your way and taking everything you throw at him and spitting it out.

Speaker 1:          01:28:20       Hit hard. Huh? Like what he did to Tito. Like watch, watch this thing. What? He stops Tito. He just fucking attacks him. I mean he was a man. He was tall dude. He was a Berzerker Lucas, look at this. This is a ferocious attack. God put put up Chuck Liddell versus Bob Ballou put that one on. You want to see another one like that? Chuck Liddell was one of the scariest champions ever. He was one of the scariest guys ever cause he beat guys even that were like more skilled in him. He beat guys that like he probably shouldn't have beaten. He just, he beat everybody. You know along the way learning, you know how to become the champion. He was just smashing people. He could just uncork that right. He's been on rice has me. I mean, of course it got towards the later end of his career where he just couldn't take shots anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:29:12       You just couldn't take them anymore. And essentially what he described it as, his brain knows what's coming. He's almost like he's too tough for his own good and his brain knows what kind of punishment that he's going to get because it's happened so many times before because he would just bite down as a mouth piece and just fucking deal with it and get to you and blast you out. You know? And his brain just wouldn't let him do it anymore. So He'd get hit and his brain would go like check please. Wow. Yeah. That's, that's, that makes a lot of sense. Cause they, the same thing with, um, Vandelay Silva. Like he, he just, he goes right out now, you know, when he gets hit, uh, not as bad. I think vandelays Chin is probably a little more durables. And Chuck was, trucks was at the end, you know, chuck at the end.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       Uh, he just, he was really in good shape. He's still at heart, you know you still get hit hard. Still have the desire, just couldn't take the shots anymore. There's also the idea that if these guys are learning and they're working with boxers as they learn how to punch the way Johnny Hendricks says, I don't care how strong your jaws, you're not taking a shot from Johnny Hendricks. He puts people to sleep cause he hits so hard and if he connects, see you later. If he connects flush. Yeah. That's the key is like how hard is he actually hitting you? Is he ever hitting you like dead on the Monday? If you watch this past weekend, Tyron Woodley knocked out Josh Koscheck. He hit him with a right hand. That was as as hard a punch as a human can throw like as hard upon body. By the way, built like a super hero.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       It doesn't even look real. I mean come on. We've talked about three podcasts in the roads. Clear. We're in love with them. Let's keep talking about, I'm never get tired of that. He hits so fucking hard that like if he hits you flush, man, very few people are going to be able to absorb that. But every now and then you say that there's some Mark Hunt type dude that could just take it one. Let's just start there. That's a whole different thing. Those are, those are some tough motherfucker got friends who played pro football. I said Samoan somehow it's just a whole different thing. You have like thicker bones. Oh my God. They're like bigger people. Plus they have, they come from a whole long line of Warriors, Polynesian people, you know, some molens come from a New Zealanders to come

Speaker 4:          01:31:08       long, long, some bad mother fuckers. Apparently Galleries Tanga barely smos are not to be fucked with. I, years ago I lived in San Francisco and there were these guys that, uh, these Samoan guys that worked at this garage where I got my car fixed, but there was this one guy who I though it was this really gentle, wonderful guy. He was the one that I, you know, kind of considered like my friend, you know. Um, and I took my car there one day and he wasn't there and I'm like, you know, wherever, so you know, whatever his name was. And uh, his friend goes, oh yeah, he's in jail. He gotten to, he was playing pool and somebody pissed him off in a bar and he beat the guy to death with the, with the, the pool, the ball Samoan. You just grabbed a ball off the, off the billiards table and be the guy who does with it and they seem like the nicest gym.

Speaker 1:          01:31:56       This guy, oh my God, guys aren't until you got pissed off and they've got a pool ball in there. Imagine that type of thing. Look at that little don't reach, look at the way he used to just, Oh my God. Yeah. He was a murderer dude. He was a murderer. Um, chuck at his best is one of the scary John Macarthur looking at reach. And so that was Larry landless. Yeah, chuck was fucking, it's got a wide head man. Chuck was brutal. Yeah. But every guy gets to a time like, look, if you could repair the human body, if you could get chuck Liddell back to the, the, the, the ability to absorb punishment that he had when he was 20, he would be dominating again today. He'd be smashing people. He would be smashing Pete. He was, yeah, he was, I mean it was guys who could beat him.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       I'm saying it's boxing rampage beat it in pride and he went into that fight, injured, but when rampage beat him in the UFC, he was probably, chuck was probably already starting to show signs of wear. Rampage knocked him out and then, uh, Rashad Evans knocked him out bad with one punch and then rich Franklin knocked him out. So there was a lot going on with chuck Keech. Our Dean dropped him. There was a lot going on, which he had clearly gotten to a point where he's taken to me shots. But if you can get them back to when he was like in his early twenties and his first fight in the UFC, he would be a top contender or the champion [inaudible] guys. They're boxing now as much better than it was then, isn't it? He didn't care. He would, first of all, his boxing wasn't that bad.

Speaker 1:          01:33:24       He had good counters. It's just his attack was so ruthless. I mean he was chocolate dough was trained by John Hackleman is a, a very knowledgeable trainer and Chuck's capable of being as technical as anybody, but he doesn't, he hits you and he knows you're hurt and the swarm has come and bitch. It's locus over the hills. It's lightning and thunder to fucking earthquake. He can't stand up for and knuckles are flying towards your fucking face. What do you like it or not? There's not a lot of technique involved in, I mean there's technique, but there's not a lot of strategies. I should, what I should say, he's just uncorking power shot after power shot. And if you, you know, 10 if you connect to his chin somewhere along the line, yeah, good luck stopping him. Good luck. He could take a fucking tremendous shot, man.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       God, look at him knocking out random and is that an annulment? Yeah, that was randomly not Olympian. That's Mike Tyson's. Better looking brother, right. Not Random and out with a leaping left hook. Yeah. He, he, he was a fucking monster man. He was a murderer. Spent a lot of times he wasn't dude's out when he was at the peak, when he was the best. He was a fucking ferocious fighter. He's one of the main reasons why the UFC became so successful because watching him fight was like watching a fucking war. You would watch, it was like you two are going to stand in the middle of the cage, is going to impose his will on you and just put knuckles to your face. Shins. Yeah, that's him and Vandelay. This was already after chuck had had probably, you know, he was probably in the twilight of his career when him and Vandelay went at it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       He just didn't quite have as much pep to his step as he did, but it was still a fucking amazing fight. What a fight. I got that fight. So tough. Look at Vandelay that's on the wall. This is fight a big picture of it. It's like, like when the, they made the, um, that Jim and my back, my, uh, garage, look at them taking those shots. Man. They took photos from classic fights and to me this was like one of the all time who won this fight. Chuck wanted decision was a great fight though, but it was like, to me it was like such a classic because this was the fight that we always wanted to see. When Vandelay was in pride and chuck was running the UFC, everybody wanted to see chuck versus Vandelay, you know, so much faster than you think to like he can knock you out by moving backward.

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       Like look at the Randy coture knockouts. He knocked out Randy while he's moving backward. Like if you slide that video back a little bit, the one when he knocked out Randy, he not, yeah, it was right after this. He knocked out Randy, like Randy was charged at him and he would slide back and uncork these punches. There wasn't a lot of wind up in the shot that he knocked Randy out with. He was just loose. He was loose. He just was a wild man. Like here it goes. Watch. This is the one, this is when he fought. Look at this, how he knocks out. Randy backs up, boom, boom. As he's backing up Randy's charging and as he's backing up he clips him with like, you know a 100 millisecond right hand that takes your fucking face ages. He was awesome. Awesome man. He's one of the reasons why the UFC became so successful because watching his fights, you were guaranteed.

Speaker 1:          01:36:29       You're going to see fury, you're going to see primal fury. You're going to see one of the wildest men alive. I like that. You described him one time with the greatest way you went. You said he's a wolf and somebody said, what do you mean? He said he's the Kinda guy jumping a fire and say, let's see who burns first bitch. It's the craziest way to describe that. Yeah, he would take you into DC is going to burn first and for the longest time he was successful doing that because he could take a tremendous shot. But ultimately his wild reckless nature led to him taking quite a few shots and you know, he look, the UFC took care of him. You know, he wanted one last fight. He got it with Franklin and then he decided that's it and now he has a job. He like, he's like an ambassador for the sport.

Speaker 1:          01:37:10       It goes all over the country tours basis towards gyms. Right. You know, he, he's got like a great gig in the UFC now. They take care of them. And I love the fact that they told him like this is, you know, enough is enough. He got to a point where, you know, chucking and Dana had a long standing relationship and before chuck was in the UFC or before Dana ran the UFC, chuck was a being managed by Dana as was Tito. Danny used to manage them. And you know, when we started writing, you know that, yeah, on my, I did a podcast with Brendan Schaub, that fighter and the kid with Dana in his office. And he talked about how he had already boxed Tito and it didn't go well for Tito cause well Tito wasn't a boxer, a wrestler, he would take guys down and he says, he said that in an MMA fight, Tito would pull his head with a spine and

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       everything. But he said, yeah, but he challenged him to a boxing match and you know, and it was, it was funny, he, Dana's still gets create like the fact that I said to him, what keeps your edge? Like what drives you? He goes, I want this to be the biggest sport in the world. And I said, you're the most bristly dude. He answers his tweets and fights with people on Twitter. And somebody was like, why do you do that? And he goes, because it's fucking fun. That's why. And I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the fighter and the kid, cause I'm on Fox, they bleep out. Fuck. They believed that every, you know, he's literally like every other word is fuck. But um, he's got such an edge. That guy, he bleep it out. It's so annoying. You need to stop doing podcasts on somebody else's when you don't need a wing.

Speaker 3:          01:38:37       You don't need anybody that ever beeps. You stop your stupid nonsense. It's so dumb. It chose me. That's so dumb. And you know what? Not on my podcast and on the Brock Callen show, it's gonna make people avoid that goes against the reason of having a podcast. Yeah. I didn't know these people, man. It annoys people. I get a lot of mail about it. I'm sorry. I always, I'm always having to apologize for it. Yeah, it's gross, man. The idea that someone could fucking tell you what you can or can't say. Yeah. It's a, it's against podcasting. Exactly. Exactly. The whole point of this is that we can do what we want. How? Yeah. Why'd you let a corporation do that? I don't. I didn't know they were going to do it. Bail on that. My mistake. Do you have a contract? Yeah. One year.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       You son of a bitch. Yeah. After it's over. Tell them the only way you're doing it. Again, as if, let's say it's a podcast Fox, let's do this, right? Maybe I'll come over to your network. I'll make a network. All right, I'll make one. There we go. I'll get the prime accounts show and your network. Yeah. Just so you can use my office. You can use this. I'm moving out here. I'm going to be your neighbors soon. Good. You know that's happening. I use the studio. Listen, man, you gotta be on your own. This is this. This doesn't make any sense, but everybody thinks they have to do it with somebody else. Everybody thinks like, oh, I gotta. If I was in the Fox, more people, more eyes going to the way you get eyes on you as the Goddamn Internet man. It's the people that enjoy it and they tell people they enjoy it spreads, and that's a job.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       That's it. That's all you gotta do. Make something that people like. Boom. Right. It's that easy. Don't need Fox or HBO or showtime or why would you meet them if you're going to do a podcast, if you want to do a show, yeah, you need Fox. Yeah. You know, if you want to do a drama or a sitcom or a talk show, look and look at one hour specials. Now nowadays you can start doing almost your own thing. Yeah. Yet, I mean, look, yeah, you definitely can. You can release some on the Internet. A lot of people have done it, but the bottom line is anybody that's telling you to not swear my name, what kind of game we plan. Exactly. What a silly game. Really plan. I lost my bad wolf. Lost my mind. By the way. It's not TV. You don't have to work.

Speaker 3:          01:40:25       It's not the FCC. The FCC is not involved. So if the FCC is not involved, why in the world? I'm loving my podcast and I, you know, I do it real small. I don't have any commercials. I don't want anybody telling me what to do. And I'm like talking to people around the world. This guy does bishop, you ever heard of him? I have, but listen, man, you don't need to have, just because you have commercials, it doesn't mean anybody can tell you what to do. Nobody can tell you what to do. I have a lot of commercials. Nobody gets to tell me what to do. You don't allow it. It's real simple. The idea, someone would allow it or that you need to your language, but it's not necessary and there's this thing in your head where, you know, I don't have anybody telling me what to do so I don't have commercials.

Speaker 3:          01:41:02       You can have commercials too. You just don't let them tell you what to do. It's like they don't have to be mutually exclusive. Yeah, the, we're brainwashed. I stand corrected, but it's a silly thing. It's a silly thing like, do you think that corporations wouldn't want to have anything to do with you because you're swearing the corporate. Every time I do a corporate GIG, they're like, don't use the f word. They fucking love it. I'm just going to talk to you like a normal human being. Guess what they say? Fuck too. Oh my God and shit and things like that. It's even more cause it's suppressed. These people were all buttoned down. They're not allowed to talk about this shit and all of a sudden you're talking about sucking your own Dick. You're talking about, you know where I'm going to be swearing by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       November 29th and 30th and wise guys in Utah, Salt Lake City. I'll just tell you what, she now love it. There you have you done that club? No. I hear great things though and I hear Salt Lake City like one of the best places to perform because people are so fired up for anybody to come into town and just start talking some shit. That's what I'll be doing. So much buttoned down, you know, thinking there is so much, you know, really strong, which by the way, Mormons or if you're going to give me a cult that's going to be my neighbor. I'll take more men all day. Some of the nicest fucking great. We help you and everything. They have a great sense of community. I mean they believe some wacky shit, but they're nice. Absolutely that Wacky Shit, whatever it is with them, it seems to work a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:42:20       They are. They do a lot of help for non Mormons. Whenever there's disaster, so I'll be in Salt Lake City November 29th November 30th I'm at the state theater in Austin, Texas. November 30th Austin tells is going to tell you this guy, Dez bishop, it really interesting guy. He's American plug you and you can tell I'm sorry. Please, please plug away Tom Rhodes and fucking hilarious comedian Austin, Texas. If the people in Austin, especially, I know what kind of comedy you freaks like and Tom Rhodes is your man. He's, you're an old school road dog dude. You and I had been friends for fucking, God knows how long we met each other when we were on NBC together. We had the Tom road show back when it was long Herod days. That's right. Yeah. We hung out together and one of those functions, it was a, it was, I think it was, it was in New York City.

Speaker 3:          01:43:03       They had this big announcement of the season at the Lincoln Center and all the people like stars from the show, from each show would come across the stage. Let me, let me give you a calm. We inhibit an after party, a big swanky affair and uh, thank God you were there because it was all like acthar people and stuff. Thank God you are that you and I like we're, yeah, we have steel. We were like, we're hanging out. We, you know, you've got to go to these things and you drank any hob nominees. There are nice people for the most part, but they're all actors. And then I was like, Tom Rhodes. Yeah. He's like Joe Rogan. Like oh fellow comedian. Give me a hug. 1818 years ago, 17 years ago. Tom Rhodes was, I've always thought of you because I told you this already, but I worked really hard at my stand up. I was a new comic. I got up and I did an okay job in front of people with some stuff. And you looked at me and you were such an established comic and you literally looked at him at me and you, you went,

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       you went, you're a screen bro, you're a screen. And that was a seminal moment for me because I went, if I, if Tom Rhodes said that and I know you meant it, I was like, I'm doing something right. I'm in the right direction. That's pretty cool for you know, and you, you didn't have to say that you just went out of your way. You don't remember it. Cause you obviously, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:44:07       close. We had a good comedy man. I'm, you know, and I'm not afraid to tell a young guy that, you know, I think he's got a good future.

Speaker 1:          01:44:13       You are, you've always been like that. And I love that. I love guys like that. You and Stan hopes like that. I'm like

Speaker 4:          01:44:20       the warrior spirit man. You gotta, you know, every warrior needs to eventually move onto Wiseman and you know, you gotta when you see a young warrior and you know the guys, you know these approaching standup from like a pure place and you know it's, I think it's good to encourage people.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       I think it is as well, but it's so I love it just because I, the older guys did it to me, you know? Yeah. They did to me as well. I don't look at it in terms of like an old warrior, a young warrior. I look at it terms of I love standup and when someone's doing good standup, I enjoy it. I like it as a, as a person in the audience. Right. I enjoy it. I'll never, I'll never stopped. I've met people that did, I met, I've met a lot of people that really love standup, then became a standup and then didn't love it anymore. Right. Terrible. When you see the light.

Speaker 6:          01:45:01       I did a Gig, I went to the Friar's club in La and I get in there and with my friends, I'll tell you why because somebody asked me to do, I get there and it's literally like scattering of people in suits and I can hear them eating and I look at my buddies and I go like this. I say, dude, I'm just telling you I'm going to do 40 minutes just on birds. I'm doing 40 minutes on bird humor only. I get up there. My friends are howling crickets, everybody else's like, what's this guy doing? My friends are dying. Right. You decided to tank it on purpose. I was just being esoteric and fun and crazy. I get someone over to a table and a guy says to me, an older man says, you got a lot of guts and a lot of imagination kid, you're going to go a long way and it was red buttons. Wow. Pretty cool. He's nice.

Speaker 1:          01:45:46       I've been better if somebody else told us store instead of you telling them about yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:45:50       Well I, I wanted to tell you about that. This guy does. Bishop man, he's really interesting dude. Uh, he's originally from New York. He's his, his parents. Uh, he's got deep family ties in Ireland, so he went to school there. That's where he started being a comedian. He's gone on to have a, a brilliant television career in Ireland. Uh, he's living in Beijing now for the past year cause he wants to learn mandarin Chinese and do stand up comedy and Chinese. Wow. So like I did shows in Beijing with him at this really cool place called the bookworm. It was a, it's a bookstore where like a full service bar in the center and it was, it was really great. See plays that held like a hundred, you know, the weekends were sold out. It was really cool. Multiethnic, multinational people. But his story is amazing. I arrived there the first night and I went to this Chinese, uh, language, local open mic night, did he? He puts on and hosts and here's this guy that I know and he, he's, he's doing comedy in Mandarin, Chinese now.

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       How many room full of Chinese people? How many Chinese comedians are there? It's brand new. They're brand new, brand new, there's illegal, there's a guy named Joe Wong who apparently he was a comic in Boston and he did Letterman and now he's moved back there. Whoa. Uh, and he's like the, he's there like, you know, whatever spiritual leader of comedy steel, the shit out of people's hands. [inaudible] Chris rock stuff. That's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:47:19       You did that in Holland who did it with Bill Hicks material didn't Dutch. Wow. Yeah. And uh, he was becoming really popular but then it got out what he had done. Well it was actually like doing all Bill Hicks is act and other buddy. He's like, this young man is kind of really a lot of interesting things to say. He's got a very bright mind and people are like, wait a minute, I heard

Speaker 7:          01:47:39       that shit before. Show path ideas, man. It's amazing. He's, you know, and after he told him eat, we're talking afterwards and he's like, yeah, I'm kind of like, yeah, I feel like I'm back at open mic night level. The guy's been a comedian for almost 20 years and he's like, yeah, you know, I wish my Chinese is better. He's like being a typical comedian, not giving himself enough credit. And I'm like, I'm like, dude, I just watched you do 10 fucking minutes and China and get laughs. That's incredible. Don't, don't be coming off going, I still got some work to do. I mean, he did all your books. What are you, Tom, has standup change to topped it all this year, these years? Like, or do you still look at it in the same way? And I, you know, I mean, it's a, I mean, you know, you have tough times in your life when you're up and down, but I mean, I've, I've always loved it.

Speaker 7:          01:48:25       I think as far as contemporary comedy, I think it's way better than it used to be. Uh, like back when I started, I think there's way more originality and edginess and a dark humor. I think like back in the, in like the late eighties, uh, there was, there was a lot of like, conformity. It felt like a lot of guys were trying to be Jerry Seinfeld and get on telling me to where there wasn't a lot of ferocious voices. And I think that's why like, you know, Bill Hicks stood out so much in the era and that, you know, like a prior was just speaking pure truth, you know, that kind of thing. I think now there's, there's way more dangerous, interesting stuff happening in comedy. So I mean, as a, as a comedy lover, I love it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       The only thing that's missing right now is clubs. There's not as many clubs as they used to be, but I think as far as like ideas, there's more information now that are, let's get into the comedians. There's more stories. There's more to the audience, more things that you could read. There's more, I mean, you're getting crazy stories you could talk about on stage all day long on Twitter. Every fucking day your Facebook is filled with some one nutty story after another Nadine's story that can ultimately be turned into a bit. If you have the time and the resources you can get on stage, you can kind of craft an act today. Um, you know, it's the fucking, there's a wealth of information that's coming at ya, but it's just harder to find clubs and a lot of places.

Speaker 7:          01:49:45       I don't know. I think, uh, don't you think a

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       lot of clubs are opening and in some places and I think the worldwide comedy scene definitely theZ is exploding right now. What if you're in like Saint Louis, what do you got? You gotta like is an Improv, their funny bone is a funny bone. I mean if you want to like start out, they have an open mic night. What's the scene like? They do, you know, is it more than one club mean ideally you want several clubs cause most likely gonna burn one of those bridges. Yeah, because you're, if you're a comedian you probably would like temperamental. You're impulsive, stupid shit you drink. People still don't really come to comedy as much. I mean like I was talking about bill burr about this. Like, you know, I was watching him the other day and that show we did and, and I, and I said, you know, you now of course bill does theaters and stuff, but for the most part, for a long time, I always say that there are people out there, they'll make you laugh way harder than any movie you've ever seen yet. They still can't sell out on a Friday. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:50:39       few weeks ago. And he said, he goes, I call that period killing in obscurity when you're just like killing and you haven't, you're not selling tickets. Right. And you're uh, we all go through that. Y'all go through that moment before anything really hits for you where you're like, God damn like this, this stuff. It sounded pretty good. I'm getting into a groove here, you know, I feel like I'm actually like a legit headline. I wouldn't mind telling someone to come see me. You know, it takes like 10 years before you feel that. But once you do feel like no one knows who the fuck you are. Like, you know, you could be, you're in a hotel somewhere and as yeah, you can be as good or even better maybe than some people that are on television, but nobody knows. Like Diaz is a perfect example of that.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       For the longest time, Joey Diaz was absolutely murdering it and no one knew. I think you're a good example how funny you are. A lot of people don't know and they think of you as an actor. They don't know how funny you are as a standup. Yeah, you're fucking hilarious. Dude. I've tooken my friend Justin is, he uh, came to see us in Vegas. He was raving about how funny you were. He was crying. He kept repeating your lines and shit. That's one of those things where like, people know you now more I think even because of the Internet than they knew you from TV shows. You did lab mad TV or this podcast actually has been a hugely instrumental in getting people, at least to my shows and stuff. But to think about crazy it is all the movies that you've done, all the different things that you'd done.

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       And there's still a lot of people that didn't hear about. Yeah, but then you will not mention any names, but we all know certain people who sell a lot of tickets and then you, you know, your friends go back and come back from seeing them. And I go, what the fuck did I just watch? Right? Like, oh my God, that's terrible. And you go, well, you know it's different when you're on a show. You've got writers and like, sorry, you know, but there's a lot of people that are like killing on stage to 50 people a night. That's right. The owner's mad at them. Can't figure out that you got to do fucking everything. Pressed morning, you're going to do every radio shows on the Friday, three radio shows in the morning, two in the afternoon, still have full, no one's, hey man, it is about, it is about the Internet. I've learned that from you. Like now that I've been tweeting and stuff. It is, you get people to your shows

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       a lot easier. Well, that's a nice thing. But you know what's really about the Internet? You're entertaining people. Yeah. You're giving these people for entertainment. The reason why you have this connection with them, they're coming to see you with a co in the clubs is you've already entertain them. They enjoy your, your work, they enjoy you. Whatever you put out they've taken in. And it's true. If it makes them feel, it's more personal that

Speaker 4:          01:53:07       come up to me in London after shows and they've heard me on your show and they've, you know, they've heard my podcast and it's like, they know you. Yeah. It's not just like a little seven minute TV spot. These people know like serious details about your life. Yeah. Philosophy in the way you,

Speaker 3:          01:53:21       he would never be able to get this sort of a connection with people if you just did Letterman a hundred times. Right. You wouldn't, they would never get you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:53:27       We're also at an age now, the three of us were, uh, and I've noticed this, a lot of guys are, they don't have guidance and they don't have a responsible older male to teach them certain things. And we're the age that their father would be. And I, I noticed and I start, I'm starting to take it very seriously. Like, you know, when people listen to me on this podcast or on my podcast or whatever, they're really listening and they're, then they're paying attention and, and in a way you feel responsible. You feel like, you know, I'm way more careful with what I say. I'm way more careful with the information I give out. I've got to make sure I know it. Remember Joe are now, right?

Speaker 3:          01:54:03       We used to start this pocket. I just be spewing shit. I'd be like, add another then research truth. People would give them so mad at me. They would send me the fucking text messages. Michael County spreading decipher, right. It's just called talking shit, talking shit. Yeah, we've heard something but you heard it wrong or whatever. And you start talking and then people realized, oh, 8 million people are listening to you. It's like I'm to fucking start paying attention what I say here because uh, well that's the thing with technology now everybody can call you on your shit instantly change. Like the iPhones are totally little answering machine and they, oh, by the way, oh by the way. Oh and by the way, my shirt open and my person I told you that story about at the time,

Speaker 4:          01:54:44       uh, I was with my wife and we're, well, we're like talking about Guantanamo Bay and I'm like, what are, I wonder what the top 10 torture songs where they top songs that we talked with these people with. She whips it up on the phone. Two seconds later we got the list. Like number one was a song called fuck your God by d a seed

Speaker 3:          01:55:03       biocide did some death metal things. That's totally appropriate, but like the rest, the rest of the songs made absolutely no sense whatsoever. It was like, um, queen, we will rock you was one of them will have that Brian May guitar riff. I could listen to that over and over. Don Mclean's uh, American American pie was more God is that this is it. Fuck your God.

Speaker 6:          01:55:26       Tyree meow mix TV. Commercial. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:55:29       Yeah. Me, I'm Yam. Yam, Yam, Yam, Yam, Yam. Yeah. Oh, that's great.

Speaker 3:          01:55:35       Enter Sandman by Metallica. I can listen to that over and over. I can't think of Metallica and not think of Jim Barney the dinosaur that grower. Why gymbaroo loves Metallica. Yeah, Zee. Yeah. Well I remember that first for them all to, yeah. Yeah. Now he is. When I first met Breuer, he would fucking, it would just be like rocking out to himself. He was singing Metallica solvency. What happened? I got the roses. You know about this. Well, what happened to axel rose? Did you just go crazy? I think everybody goes crazy when you get that famous. I think that's what's happening to Kanye West. That's what happens to lady Gaga. That's what happens to everybody there. They're too famous. It's almost unmanageable. That's what happened to Madonna and I think, look, they hang onto it better than probably any of us would, but they still crazy. You go crazy, you go crazy. How could you not go crazy? Everybody goes crazy. Imagine being lady Gaga. Can you imagine like what is that like? I know of

Speaker 6:          01:56:24       a woman who dated a very famous celebrity. I won't mention, she was saying, she was telling me that he got to a point where he just couldn't really, he was just like, you get so famous that he would have like these sex parties and he would just, she ended up getting sucked into that for text and she's banging his friends and he'd be sitting on the couch like Nero watching this shit just got crazier and crazier and it got crazier and crazier and then he couldn't, he couldn't come unless he was like, unless it was, she was doing crazy shit. Like hang her tongue on another guy. Really feel bad for that guy. I know she kept having an amp it up. He would really hit an exterior. He was really conservative, like people thought, but when they'd get together it was just fucking on and he just, then she had to finally break up with them because finally she was in a rotation.

Speaker 3:          01:57:14       Hold on a second. When you say, when you say he's conservative, like his appearance or his public persona was very accomplished. Famous, famous guy. Okay, so you remember that Bob Crane guy from Hogan's heroes? He liked it. He was banging chicks, all of that. Buddy didn't want to give it up. That's why he was getting tired of off the rails when he was murdered by his buddy who he was banging girls with you. I don't know if anybody was ever convicted to that. It was, I don't believe that was a fun movie. It's a really good moment. You're still, what's it called, Greg Kinnear? Autofocus. Yeah, I think so. Really? It's about a lot of fun really. And speaking of Lady Gaga, did you know Bradley Manning who took all those military secrets and gave him the Wiki leaks and endangered the lives of American service men and women all over the world?

Speaker 3:          01:57:55       Uh, when he would, he had these disks on his desk. A statement or question is, none of that is he had these disks on his desk and when, so when like sensitive information will pop up, he would pop the distant and download all this information. Right. So he labeled the discs. Lady Gaga. Yeah. And so like people walk by his desk and it was fucking guys listen to lady Gaga that way. No. I think that lady Gaga should also be implicated for treason. That's all I'm saying. I'm just want to make a case for you that we'll look stream. So I want to make a case for that right now. She should be implicated. Yeah, I think she's, she's treasonous little bit. A little bit, man. Treasonous yourself. Radley. Many wants to get a sex change. Chelsea, Chelsea manning. He's a cutie. He's a little cutie pie. How dare you write petite. I know you're going to do all that. Then what the to that want the government to pay for yours? That's what he wanted.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       Yeah. Well maybe, I don't know. Who knows how long he's wanted that, but I couldn't imagine what it would be like just to be in the position that that guys in, you know, just to be in the position to have this information that you think needs to get out. So you release it and then they keep you in solitary naked for like years. For years. They're like, guy was, I mean he was going crazy. Is that what I did too? Yeah. Psychological torture. Yeah. Yeah. They did some and they kept them. They keep you in solitary for them. Nothing to joke about when you're really thinking about it. Yeah. Torture. For years, they kept him in solitary. They kept in solitary Froedtert own time and you know, now who knows? I mean, they might not even be true that he wants to have a sex change.

Speaker 1:          01:59:25       They might've just released that. Who the fuck knows? Right, right, right. Yeah. Who knows. I mean, it might just be like, check, check out what we're going to put about you in the news. You know, look, you want to have a sexual [inaudible] character. Yeah. Maybe this is working for the government just did. Did he have the chance to actually give a a speech? I think that his trial, he mentioned the fact that he was wanting to have a gender change, that his trial, I'm saying did he give a speech about why he did it or I don't know. The whole thing is really strange, man, because it's changed our whole idea of what the government is between the Bradley Manning wikileaks thing and the Edward Snowden thing. It's essentially changed our entire idea of what the government is like. In one fell swoop. It all became this giant spy network, which we never would have imagined.

Speaker 1:          02:00:09       We never would have imagined that his reach and all that. Now it's amazing how things have changed. People don't realize what a big impact that really has had on the confidence of the American people because now all the people that were like borderline believing and Alex Jones and wondering what the fuck is really going on with the new world order now it's all like on paper, like the gut, the Obama, they're only collecting better data and that turns out to be bullshit and everybody could. Apollo press person has some sense. It's ridiculous. It's like there's so, it's so obvious now that there's this giant spy network and everyone's sucked into it. The whole world is literally connected to this, these chords and no one wants to admit it and tapping in on Angela Merkel, the PRI, everybody, every world leader, their personal cell phones. Yeah. We knew everybody's, we've also have known forever that both sides were always spying on each other.

Speaker 1:          02:01:02       That's why the president goes into his tent, which it scrambles all kinds of information. Mike Swick told me that he was working at the embassy in Russia. Mike WIC, um, before he was at Mike's spoke MMA fighter before he was an MMA fighter. He did security at this embassy and he said that they used to find things that the Russians had put in the buildings that were powered by the motion of the building. The subtle sway of the building was what powered these devices that they use. He said it was so far beyond anything they had. And you know what's really interesting, a lot of the shit that they got that the Russians got a lot of shit that the Americans got during the space race was from the Nazis. It was operation paperclip. We took all the best Nazi scientists from Germany and just knock a [inaudible] and changed the last names.

Speaker 1:          02:01:50       Old Bit, well, bit fiddled around, little bit, exonerated them, gave them positions of power, like the head of NASA. Wernher von Braun was unknown Nazi who? The Simon Thall weasel way. Was it Simon Wiesenthal Center Center for uh, uh, they said that they would punish him for crimes against humanity. They said they would try him if he was alive today, they would try Wernher von Braun for crimes against humanity. That's what there's the head of NASA. The head of NASA was a Goddamn Nazi, like a real Nazi. There's, there was a documentary on these people that had been through the camps and were describing where if I'm was like an expo, say on were winter von Braun, and they were talking about how they would see him while they were looking at people hung, they would hang the five slow as Jews outside of this Berlin rocket factory every day to make sure that everybody worked hardest.

Speaker 1:          02:02:40       And they would see von Braun walk past the bodies like to say that he wasn't a Nazi. They're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He was a Nazi. He was there while all this was going on. He was a part of all this and this guy, you know, he had the tattoos and everything and he was describing this and it was really intense. It was really intense to think that, you know, just because someone is like really good at something, we'll take them over here, put them on TV, Polish them up, give them a haircut, smile. Wernher von Braun, the head of NASA says we can be on the moon inside 24 months. We got along, we got a lot of German physicists led, including I believe Albert Einstein because of the antisemitism that was arising in the early thirties already. And they came over and it wasn't, it really just because they were awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       I mean, we had to control them. They would, they, the Nazis had created some incredible devices. BMW, they were creating incredible fucking engines for, for jets. I mean they had some amazing engineering and machine gun I think was wasn't Nazi invention. So there was a German invention operation paperclip. Um, they, they took a gang of scientists, it was in 1945 and they brought them all over here and put them to work in a bunch of different segments of our, a military industrial complex. But also in NASA. They designed missiles. They designed everything. They did all kinds of shit over here, but the, the space race was greatly, greatly aided by these people. Like we literally didn't have a program until we, until we brought Wernher von Braun over here. Huh. That's amazing, man. That's some amazing shit. That's just how they did things. They say, Hey, yeah, either bad guys, but look, they know a lot of shit about rockets.

Speaker 1:          02:04:23       It was also a race for world domination. I mean, there were I the conflicting ideologies, man, and it was winner take all and a lot of ways. Oh yeah. Well you have, it was a scary time. Everybody's rushing to make the nuke. I mean, if they, they make the new first, they win. Yeah. We got, you know, if we all, we all die a fire. If it wasn't for that Bhagavad Gita quote, motherfucker that was crying earlier. If it wasn't for him, somebody else would've got it. Probably would have been the Nazis. They probably would have figured it out. No question. They were on their way. That was, that was the whole thing. The Manhattan project was basically a race to get the bomb before they did. She apparently though historians say that they were further, they were actually given up on trying or they were further away than we thought it allegedly.

Speaker 1:          02:05:07       Yeah. American propaganda. We got 1,800 technicians and scientists along with 3,700 family members. Those with special skills or knowledge or taken to detention and interrogation centers, such as one code named dust bin to be held and interrogated and in some cases for months. And then they took these motherfuckers and slowly brought them out and started reintroducing them. A lot of brainpower. Wow. A lot of brainpower. That's amazing. They're still catching those guys, man. They're every now and then the fine second, Argentina and places like that. A lot of them went down there. A lot of them went to South America actually. They flee. I mean, you gotta think and they've chased down a lot of them. Man. They, they're, they've been,

Speaker 7:          02:05:49       and they found out into the field a lot of, they, they, uh, I mean there's a lot of Germans that live in Argentina. My mother's from Buenos Aires. I've been to Argentina to citing Spanish. There's so many. Uh, I do not. Um, what's your background? Uh, ethnicity? Uh, I'm actually, um, are you a Nazi, your Army Nazi, blah? I'm Italian and Irish on my mother's side and English and French on my father's side it, and it's, most of the immigrants down there are Italian or Germany, German and there's, they still have like German language, newspapers and some areas really vast, large German popular. Yeah. That's where a lot of people went and hid out and then were hunted down eventually. Jesus Christ, it's quite a scary thing. They just move to these towns and just repopulated a bunch of fucking sociopath, psychos do the tango until just how many catches on.

Speaker 1:          02:06:40       All of them are not a bad place to go down to two and not a bad place today.

Speaker 7:          02:06:44       Well, women are stunning. It's a great steaks.

Speaker 1:          02:06:48       I had a friend who just got back from Columbia. I was like, oh my goodness. He goes, it's like 10 to one women to men that women are beautiful women in the world. He said they have these incredible bodies and they're dying to meet American men. You said it's the most ridiculous thing ever. He goes, every American man, she'd just go to Columbia. Well I'm a, I can't do that. Well you're married but a single. But someone who is not happy. So what I'm saying, someone who doesn't live the perfect life like Bryan County, they're having, they're having problems. They hear get this. So Columbia has a lot of those video chat things and guys will spend a lot of money on this video chat things. Here's the problem. Guys are flying down there to meet their girlfriends, their cyber girlfriends and hanging out there and getting all hung up and marriages it getting ruined.

Speaker 1:          02:07:30       Everything else. Oh, I'm like, so there's been a lot of problems. Yeah. Careful of the cyber chat cloud. The webcam there. Sirens, man. They are sirens. They will, they will. You listen to, how are we not even men? I mean they're probably not even women. They're probably men for the most part with fucking fake pictures. I'll use the gross you video chat with like think about, well the Nigerians, how much the money they pulled out of lonely men. They've done an amazing job. It's an amazing thing they've done. Like what, what do they scamming old men. There's this one show, uh, that was exposing this guy that got sucked into this Nigerian scam and I think he gave off $250,000, which was like all the money he had saved his entire life and he couldn't meet this girl tried to meet her. He flew all the way to Europe and uh, she ducked him, you know, like they had an email exchange and they were supposed to meet at a certain place.

Speaker 1:          02:08:20       She doesn't meet him. Of course, the only, she only speaks through email. She sends pictures and only speaks through email. He's never actually spoke to her on the phone. So it's poor fucking guy flies all the way to Europe and she gives them some kind of hootenanny excuse, you know, oh, this happened, my family. And this was like, it's very hard for me right now. I don't know where I'd be without you. Thank you for understanding. And then, you know, he just keeps, sends money since he's more money Dominique. Oh, he's dumb as fuck. But he's also just sad and old and lonely and uh, you know, he was an older man and she was young and beautiful and in the pictures. So he flew back again. The guy flew to Europe twice. God, twice. Nothing older. People shouldn't be allowed on the Internet. There should be guidelines.

Speaker 1:          02:08:57       Know somebody should keep an eye on older people. You know, I get these, I get those emails. Like I'm, the tears are coming from my eyes. I have no money. My grandfather got, um, he got addicted to buying things out of catalogs before he died, before he died. Um, he, he went through a real bad period. He only lived for a year after my grandmother died. Took care of my grandmother for 12 years and my grandmother had a stroke. She had to like take care of her day in, day out for 12 years. And then when she died, he was dead in a year. And in that one year period he went off the rails. And one of the things that he did was he would buy things off of catalogs who would just call and just to talk to anybody just to talk to people on the phone.

Speaker 1:          02:09:40       He was like really lonely, sad man. Well he was used to having his wife with him like all day every day. And his family lived like an hour outside of town, you know, they lived in, it was a substantial drive. So they would come to visit him on the weekends or when they could, but they couldn't be with them all the time and he didn't want to leave his house. He wanted to stay in his house. So it was this crazy situation where the only way this is going to work with these guys going to be happy and to be living with somebody who doesn't want to leave his house and he was getting dementia and but category we have, they have to take catalogs from him cause he was just constantly ordering things on catalog. Yeah. It was sad shit man. People do that. They say people go to funerals like that just so they can be around people. Wow. So when people go and they don't have any friends anymore, you know, like get to a certain age and where's your friends are all gone. Yeah. That I think about that a lot. That's I that that just must be so hard. I blocked my, I remember my, you

Speaker 6:          02:10:33       know, he's married to the guy for 55 years, 60 years, and then he was gone and I walked into the, to the casket and that was it, man. That was it. That was somebody she had been with for 55 60 years and they were just gone. You know? And that adjustment is, is a weird thing, man.

Speaker 1:          02:10:47       Yeah. And also the reality that you're going to go to, I mean, you know it, I know what we all know, but it seems almost abstract until you see it in front of you and then you go, oh, this is what's going to happen one day. It's just going to not be here. I'm going to just be gone. You're going to be gone. She's going to be gone. Everybody's finite. We just, it's just so hard to recognize that while it's all happening while you're living your life, it's so hard to appreciate it.

Speaker 4:          02:11:12       All right. Well until people start like my father, uh, you know, died in 2009 and my sister died in 2011 hardcore. Two of the people I love the most in the world is at 10. So I mean you never, life just seems like some endless thread. It's just going to keep going on and on and until you get punched in the heart and have somebody very dear to you who you love and you know, taken away from you that doesn't don't on you. Is your sister younger or older than you? Younger. Yeah, she was 37. Got Breast Cancer.

Speaker 6:          02:11:39       Oh No.

Speaker 4:          02:11:41       Yeah. Where's that at? My father was killed by a drunk driver. Nano. No. Yeah. So I mean, you know, one you can understand and the other one is senseless and both of them are senseless. What is causing breast cancer? Bryan County, you've probably known this gotta be there. The food or a mass produced food. You know, like in Europe, my wife is from Holland and she always points it out. Like there's, there's a lot of foods that were sold in America that had just a day. The governments in Europe don't allow on the, on the grocery shelves, just certain ingredients and shit.

Speaker 6:          02:12:10       The, the incidence of breast cancer and in Japan was very, very low. And when they started changing into more of a western diet, it did rise. Uh, so that, that would suggest that diet plays a large,

Speaker 4:          02:12:22       it's got to have something to do. Fish oil and stuff like that. Pollution. This is probably a fucking slew of factors. Nutrition, pollutions,

Speaker 6:          02:12:29       brass water. Tim Ferriss went to, uh, to where they live the longest in, in Okinawa. And, uh, what he was actually looking at is what they don't eat. And one of the things about those, Oh, can I add this up? No Pussy. But there they have, um, like they talk about they have a very, very diet, um, and all this stuff, but the, the blue potatoes, not rice, and there's all these theories, but a huge part of it is their sense of community. Um, they find that, that people who have a purpose and never retire, and a sense of community, like when they're really a tight community, they live longer. And so when most health professionals are looking at health, they're talking about graphs and while they eat this and this pro, no, in fact, human connection when, when you, when people feel supported emotionally and connected. And I'm not saying this was the case with your sister, I'm not saying that cancer, I'm not sure.

Speaker 4:          02:13:20       Oh, I, I that never even crossed my mind that you would be in playing totally agreeing with what you're saying. Because like, when people retire, let you see a lot of people retire or their wife dies or whatever, like they die a few years later. Think your theory

Speaker 7:          02:13:32       makes perfect sense.

Speaker 6:          02:13:33       The outliers with a mountain Gladwell's, yeah, it's been a little while. He talks about this town Rosetta, which is Italian town. There's an Italian town called that they were marble. Uh, they, there was a marble query and next nearby. And when the mobile query in Rosetta in Italy was no longer had any marble, they moved to a part of Pennsylvania where they had a query nearby. They formed their own town. And in the 50s, a heart disease was an absolute epidemic epidemic in this country. One of the things they found was in, in, um, Rosetta people were just as fat. They cooked with Lard, not even with olive oil. They were dying of old age. And they said maybe they come from an hardy stock from this town Rosetta. So they looked at people who had emigrated from other towns in the United States, from Rosetta. No, they were dying of heart disease too.

Speaker 6:          02:14:14       Why weren't people dying of heart disease and Rosetta, why were they dying of old age? Even though they were fat, even though they didn't eat very healthy necessarily, or they ate a lot of sugar and pastries? Well, the conclusion was probably that they had such strong community, such a bond. Even if you were a guy who is a nerd or a guy who is whatever was, wasn't winning and things, there was such a support system for people. Um, there were parks and people would talk to each other, uh, going to and from work and there were community things that they would do and it was such a strong community. They look forward to hanging out, they look forward to hanging out. And that plays a factor in jail. Enjoying your life, enjoying your life. It's everything. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:14:54       It's everything. Enjoying what you're doing, having a good time, but then also having that sense of purpose and not, you know, like yeah. Boy or something. And then you retire and then you have, you have nothing to do in your mind is occupied.

Speaker 6:          02:15:05       Well, I think with stand up, like, you know, I talked to guys like you, like I'm never quitting. I've never,

Speaker 7:          02:15:10       that's always been my, my thought as well. It never even crossed my mind to not do it. Yeah. Carlin never quit. No. You know, I mean, even Richard Prior, when he was on his deathbed, came back, did more stand up. It was just on stage. He couldn't even walk, can barely talk. I've worked with them. I did like five weeks with them. Really? Yeah. The comedy store when he was, when he made his comeback before he died, I saw him on to, I think it was his 50th birthday. My father is the reason I'm a comedian and my dad loved comedy and he had Richard Pryor albums. And so like, I used to listen to them. Uh, like in my, my dad was such a fan. He had cassettes and drove around in the car. And by listening to prior as a kid with my dad, so, uh, my dad was living in La and prior was, it was after he got sick and he, you know, he was in a wheelchair.

Speaker 7:          02:15:58       Two guys had to lift him up in the wheelchair and put him on stage at the comedy store. But it was still such a thrill to be in the same room with this guy who is like, the reason I'm a comedian and like this, this ultimate loving bond I had with my dad. And like, you know, love of dirty jokes and comedy and laughter and humor. And I think, and in prior could barely keep his head up. And you know, he was so, uh, Bill [inaudible] and uh, but he did do a 20 minute Hong Kong and licking pussy. I would get my dad to pay attention to me. He was busy and so

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       under so much pressure. And the way I would get them to, I remember as a kid is I would recite movies and comics. That's, and, and cause I knew I could recite them and he would laugh. And that was a, I knew it would kind of relieve the pressure of his crazy fucking job. And what was his job? He was a banker, you know, and uh, I think he did other stuff, you know, for the government. I don't know, but he was gone a lot. You know, he had this, he had to solve all the problems, I think. And I always felt that way. But, um, he just, I could always see the stress on his face. I could always see that the, the insanity that he was going through. And I, and I remember one time he would relax is when he would laugh at me. So I would, I would quote Monty python or I, yeah, I've got really good at memorizing. So, you know, whatever man. What a joy. I hope I have a son who entertains the shit out of me. [inaudible] I got a video I'll show you. My son doesn't, he's two and a half. He will, he sits at the drums for one hour at a time and he doesn't want to get off.

Speaker 7:          02:17:25       You guys call those loads and there now Tom Rhodes. Yeah, I'm getting up there. Get up there. Yeah, because by the way, it comes a point in time when he sperms no good. No more. You'll be a good dad, Tom. Yeah, I can't wait. My wife wants to wait. Uh, you know, I'm ready to go. She wants to wait for what? She's just enjoying this, traveling the world, doing cool gigs all over the world and you don't even have a place to stay. Right. You're still down in the hotel thing. She's constantly booked Europe, Asia, you know. Great. And I may in New Zealand at the New Zealand comedy festival and then I did like a best of the fest tour. Like, oh my God, who doesn't want to go to New Zealand? It's great. And your wife loves it. My wife loves it. She loves comedy. She's, you know, on the planet.

Speaker 7:          02:18:06       One woman on this planet has to travel, loves to hang out and like a drink and you know, laugh with comedians cause that's what I've, you know. Wow, that's cool man. She, she's, that's great too. That's a very rare thing. I don't know of any other guy that's doing that. I don't hear it bro. Especially a high level guy, like maybe the guys that are in the beginning when they're just starting out. But like, you could do it in the beginning because you're not, unless you're independently wealthy, your family or money living on the fucking couch and the couch, the couch and people's, you know, all those friends couch that first 10 years of, you know, taking buses and hitchhiking to gigs and sleeping on people's couches. It's like now where it's come in, life is, it's sweet. It's great. You know, I got gigs in while going back to London, I'm doing the Soho Theater and like February I got a Gig in Barcelona, I'm doing a tour of Holland at the end of January.

Speaker 7:          02:18:55       It's just like, it's awesome. And then they're just like arguing so much work in the states. I mean I, I can only, uh, you know why pay rent on a place I'm never at. Yeah. So you work more in Europe than you do in America? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's about, no, it's 50, 50, 50. You know what I mean? Like I'm in the states 50% of the time and then 50% of the time outside or a high tech nomad brother, you'd probably go international more than anybody I know. Then if that's the case, if you're like 50 50, who else do you know that does like 50% of their stuff internationally? Hello? I've been doing it for a long time. No. Yeah, you have stand up. Does a bit international, but not that much. Eight cities, like I stayed up absolutely kills me when he talks about like, you know, I'll be like, you know, cause he's, he's pretty adored in England and he's doing these nice, you know, you know, theaters and, you know, selling some nice tickets.

Speaker 7:          02:19:44       And, uh, he talked to him about it and he's, he's like, he thinks everywhere is like Mexico. He's just like, you just complaining about things. It's horrendous. He just, he thinks so little of a, some of the places that he goes, it just kills me. I'm like, didn't you enjoy the food? He might not be being theatrical. I think he is. I think stand up. He loves to be a contrarian and um, you know, cause I mean there's certain aspects of travel that I just, I, you know, like, uh, it depends where I'm at in the world with time off. Uh, and we'll, we'll go somewhere and we'll rent an apartment somewhere exotic. Like last November I did the Jakarta comedy festival and my wife and I went to Bali for two months. That's Indonesia for anybody who doesn't know. And then, uh, like in June we went to key west for a couple of weeks.

Speaker 7:          02:20:32       In September we had rented an apartment in Rome. We've done, we've done that the last few years. What is your favorite place to, uh, uh, I, you know, I uh, San Francisco, Sydney, Amsterdam. But if you were to retire somewhere, do you think there's a country you would go to if you didn't live in the states? Ah, I uh, I mean I always liked Paris, my wife, her favorite cities, Rome. And she's really been the last three years in a row. We've gone to Rome to the first two years. Like seeing monuments and all these, uh, you know, paintings and things. I wanted to see this last time we went there. It was great. I just pretended like I lived there for like a week or just like going to nice restaurants. And when you're pranking roam, where do you perform? I haven't performed there. I'll just go on their own on trips.

Speaker 7:          02:21:20       I should set up a Gig there cause I've been, I love going there. Yeah. You don't ever have the desire to like have a place where you know, like this is where you put your family photo and this is where you put your underwear. You know what I did that I, you know, I threw everything in the storage when I moved to Amsterdam. So I had everything in storage for five years. And then you look for five year, five years. Wow. Yeah. And I had a, I was on television for three. I had uh, my own late night talk show for two years on Dutch television in English and it was subtitled in Dutch. And uh, and then when that finished the same network, let me do one year as a presenter on a travel program. So I had a wonderful life there, but when it finished and I love making television and I moved back, I moved to La, got everything out of storage and I looked at my shit and I'm like, this is, what am I, my empire of $20 purchases?

Speaker 7:          02:22:11       I mean, everything. Was there anything that meant anything to me? It was like a book or a CD, you know? All those are like 20 bucks. He is my empire, $20 purchase it. The things that did matter are the family photos and then like, you know, things from your life, family and little, your comedy career, a little memorabilia and stuff. So like when I threw everything back in storage, uh, I got rid of like most of like the furniture and shit like that and just got it even smaller to like what was really important to me, like my book collection and different, uh, you know, archives of videos and photo years ago you had a place in Korea town. That's what, that's when I got came back. Uh, that place was great. And you came over that one night. We had a great night. There was this girl who I went to high school with WHO's an old friend of mine.

Speaker 7:          02:23:00       You and her got into like this insane argument. I don't know what she said about she's a, I, I, I, I forget what it was. But you like schooled her on something that she was misinformed about and you guys, uh, I don't remember. You don't remember that too much? I remember there was, we got really high. There was one I read, I saw you. I like the comedy store or somewhere. There was one crazy girl that had some PR. I don't remember what the idea was, but it was so wrong on in like, and she was like saying it as if it was fact. I don't remember what it was though. It was something like that. Yeah, I forgot what the thing was, but it was something that was [inaudible] we're having, there's this great party at my house. I had this, uh, I had very little furniture.

Speaker 7:          02:23:43       My friend, really good friend Charles Esl who lived in the building. He was in a band and he was like a character comedian did a little stand up, but he also had a band. So I let him set up his, uh, his, his band stuff in my living room. So I, there was a drum kit and a instruments there and I just let these guys, I'd left him. The key is one of my best friends. So when I'd be out of town half the time and he could go in there and I had this massive CD collection and stuff and he would just beat on the drums. No, no, he has abandoned would go practice. They'd go pri, they get an apartment and my apartment in Korea town and that's where you came over. And I had this great, like, it's empty living room quick, just like a musical instrument.

Speaker 7:          02:24:24       We're having a really nice party. And then you and this girl got a, you know, one inch from each other's noses and I don't remember it confronting, I don't remember it. Right. I think the girls had said something that was, um, it was, uh, just not true, not even close to being true. I remember her just being a little crazy and thinking, man, Tom Hangs out with crazy people, but maybe I made a crazy, I'm still good friends with, uh, uh, I'm still good friends with a, uh, a good portion of people I went to high school with. Wow. That was a, a, it was from a small little town, uh, Oviedo Florida. There was a lot of really good people. I mean, some of them are, you know, uh, or you know, have different beliefs and different ideas about things. But so the little goofy is that we transfer. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not all of them. No, no, no. I'm saying there's a couple that are goofy. Um, that girl was one of the hottest girls in my eyes. Fall out. Well that's the problem. That's also the problem. When you're really hot, you'll get away, get away the same right across.

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       And I think that she had probably gotten away with saying whatever she wanted for a long time. You were one of the first people do, um, you know. Yeah. It seemed like it was, it was just, you know, I remember were high at the time, which really destroys bullshit. Nothing destroys bullshit like marijuana. And when someone's bullshit in your high like, oh, come on man. Tony would say that right? To Stop. Like it's so obvious. This is not true. This is not a true thing. You lay man, is that, Oh God, it's everywhere. There's honorary missing. Telling me two plus two is 18. I'm like, what the fuck are you stop making all this noise Scientologists in about people in la that are aren't used to being told no, you're wrong. What you're saying is just absolute horseshit called on it. Right. You know, or how about this, you're lying.

Speaker 3:          02:26:11       Stop lying is a little bit of that going on. Oh my God, it's unbelievable. You know, one of the things I was saying to a friend we were talking about, uh, the one thing that I don't like about people that are struggling, especially struggling his actors, it's the arena that they're forced to compete in the arena. They're forced to compete is an arena where they're constantly going to auditions where there's this weird social thing going on where there's one person who's in control, the casting director and there's a director who's observing you and your whole thing is about getting these people to like you quickly in a brief amount of time. And so they adopt like really obvious democratic left wing sort of tendencies and things to say. And they adopt, you know, a very left wing mindset because that's the majority of the people in Hollywood are fairly left wing and they start spewing out shit that they think people want to hear as opposed to having a real thoughtful opinion on something that's, that's a very good point.

Speaker 3:          02:27:04       Very few people have the luxury of having a real thoughtful opinion. It's all about getting someone to like you. It's all about getting into the door at is so, so, so true man. Terrible way to thinking about that the other day. That is so true. That becomes this, this way of you have to, you have, you're bullied into speaking a certain way. Cause if you don't, you're going to be considered a shithead or you know, not on the team man. You're not on a ton of team and you see it all the time. Well the left wing aspect of it is very strong kills ideas. Schubert, I forget what he calls her love. She calls herself a, you know, a liberal conservative or whatever because he wants to work in shows like, you know, he's sure he cracks, never go to an audition with a Mitt Romney shirt on there.

Speaker 3:          02:27:47       Not a single fucking person would ever hire you. And that's something that they would really, it would prejudge you for sure. I'm going to go get this Guy Outta here. That is a hard game though. Acting man. I know there was a, when I lived in that building and Korea town, there was a actor guy that lived in my building, uh, you know, it's starting to get up there in age for an actor or whatever. And I guess his was work kind of dried up. And uh, for some reason when I would see this guy, he would tell me everything about his life. For some reason he thought we were, you know, whatever. Great friends. I told the guy very little about me. He just would always just spew all this information himself.

Speaker 7:          02:28:22       And I remember him telling me, cause it was a bar downstairs in that building and him telling me one night the, uh, I'm getting out of show business story, I love the, like you and I were talking about never even considered stopping doing this. But like, so I, it kills me when somebody gives the, I'm getting out of show business speech, I've given my all, I've done thickness and then the phone is he the guy he, you know, cause nothing had gone on for him. He hadn't worked in a couple of years. And then he got this little roll on, um, a deadwood, like say I don't, maybe one line or you know, he was on a horse or something and then like a, and that, you know, that rejuvenated his spirit. But I remember the guy telling me sometime after that that this girl had dumped him and he's just, he's just incredulous. He can't believe it happened. And he just keeps saying to me, but I was on deadwood, man. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          02:29:17       Like, who, who could dump me, God, I was on this town, allows you to reinvent yourself and reinvent, invent your own reality, man.

Speaker 7:          02:29:28       Do we not want to be involved in life with someone who that people do that? All of them, but thing to say. Yeah. Yeah. Dumb. It was another time where there was a little cafe on the corner and he was a, it was like a sunny Sunday or something. He was sitting in front of their reading the Big Sunday newspaper and he had the homes section. He's looking through and I'm just being a smart ass tonight. Um, you know, I walk up to him and I go, hi, your career must be doing really well. Now if you're looking at the, at the home section and he looks up from his paper and he just goes, no, just day dreaming and you know what I'm going to do one day when I can afford a house, I'm going to build walls so high to keep the shit in this city away from me.

Speaker 2:          02:30:06       Oh. It was like was just like the most venomous guy. God, that anger. Like, it's a sunny Sunday. Loosen up your tongue so hard. I got to get him. No, I've got a great story. I had this is to build a wall

Speaker 7:          02:30:17       separate all this come from, I knew a guy, I'm acting class and you know how long I was an acting class years. I loved it by the way, for a lot of reasons. Mainly because it was just fun to be in a just, there's a lot of greatness and Joe would always make fun of me, but there was a guy, really good guy, normal guy. So I thought, and he was, and he, I hired him to shoot me to shoot this audition. So I go to his house and he's got this great camera and on his wall is a dream board and on his wall is

Speaker 2:          02:30:49       his, no, no, no, no. He's put his face, he's put pictures on his face on the cover of vanity fair and those magazines. And he's got slogan's saying, you're the guy, you're the one and it's a dream board. And it was big. It was good. Covered his whole wall man. And he's a good guy. And he's like, he's a normal guy in a lot of ways. He's just been told the wrong things. Jay Davis. No, it is not. I love that. It's almost like, like, you know, go to a girl's and she's got too many stuffed animals on the bed. That's like the male equivalent though. This guy, he thought it's show business so much that even know he was trying to visualize his future and it never, I remember going, oh, it's never gonna happen, Bro. No matter what.

Speaker 6:          02:31:34       Davis Jay Dad was very nice. He's a great guy. He's a good dad, like sweets. You know, the reason he did is j so enthusiastic like Jason Bourne. Yeah. Is just an enthusiastic guy who's just loves everybody. But, but uh, this guy handsome, tall, you know, suave and just, I was like, you're a Dork, bro. I gotta help you take that down. Write down his picture, his face over celebrities faces on Vanity Fair and people magazine. I'm not kidding. That's how he, he can visualize himself doing that. Well, I don't know, Joe, stop bringing me.

Speaker 2:          02:32:14       Say you're going to run into that guy and he's not going to have made it and he's going to go, you're the reason. I'm not saying I wouldn't be taken down by secret

Speaker 6:          02:32:23       guy and I want, I want the best for him. I love the guy actually. He's a great guy. It's just nuts. He was told what happens sometimes is people are told something enough times and they forget to stop and think. It's exactly what you're talking about with the Fox thing. It's like, who says you can't swear and why are you doing with somebody? Why is, why are you doing with the court? You forgot the idea of a podcast. You have to keep thinking because you'll make choices sometimes because you're told that this works. Who said it works? I can't visualize running pumps back in the NFL are fighting in the octagon. Don't have it. No matter what I do, ain't gonna happen. I'm getting fucking knocked out because my bone structure for a thousand reasons, I don't have it. Okay, tried, didn't work. So you know, you've got to you, yes you should dream big, but you should also be realistic with who you are.

Speaker 1:          02:33:13       So when you're saying someone told him that all you have to do is use the power of positive thing. Correct. Use the ID wage thinking Rosie the law of attraction,

Speaker 6:          02:33:23       all that shit. And what happens when you read enough books about it and it's written enough. You seen enough books written, you start to go, this must be this, this is a truth.

Speaker 1:          02:33:32       There was a girl who came to the pod to the comedy store. She was friends with Kelly, Kirsten. Very nice girl. And uh, one day, uh, the day I met her, she was in the back hanging out with Kelly and all the comedians. I was just joking around. And, uh, it was like right around the time that, what the bleep did they know, oh boy, that's on, in the movies. And people just had decided that they were going to visualize their life. And she was talking about it. And I hadn't seen the movie yet, but she had just told me, um, that she, she was following the secret and her life was going to be from here on out a masterpiece because she was falling the secret. And she was very nice. And I, you know, I didn't want to argue with her and I wouldn't argue with someone about that because I don't even, I'm not sure what I believe when it comes to the power of positive thinking and I don't know how much of reality, just because you can touch things and bang on them with a hammer.

Speaker 1:          02:34:21       I'm not exactly sure how much your intent has to do. I'll give it to, I'll give you, let me just break it down. Nothing wrong with pots of thinking at all until it gets in the way of critical thing, right? So, so make sure, if you want to be positive, we should all be positive. We were just talking about this button. Make sure you don't lose sight of critical thinking to be able to decipher the meaningful difference between things. It takes some thought and experience and practice. This role. I ran into her a year or so later, maybe a year and a half later at the the, uh, UCB and I was like, how's it going? How's everything? She's like, you know, I've been using the secret, but it just doesn't work. She's like, my life is just as much of a message as ever before.

Speaker 1:          02:35:02       And she was just, it was really weird because she was a real confused and she wanted to ask me about it because we had had this conversation about it and there was essentially the last time I'd seen her, you know, and then she was like, it's just not, everything is a mess. I keep having these bad people in my life. I keep dating the wrong guys. I keep my, my dad's sick was like all these things that are going on, but I never would have created if I wanted to secret as you keep making bad choices twice sports and stand up and things are so important because if you come up against objective reality, yeah, there's that. You can tell a joke and if you're not funny, they're not going to laugh. You can study Kung Fu on a mountain. If you try to punch somebody hitting a face who's been boxing and doing Moitai, you're going to get cracked in the mouth and you're going to feel the difference.

Speaker 1:          02:35:45       There is a place in in life, we're objective. Reality must be embraced and if you live in La long enough and you start reading books like that and you don't surround yourself with people who tell you the truth, people who have friends who tell you the truth, it's definitely that you'll create your own reality. You also need something that shows you the truth and that's where like something like a martial art or even like playing chess or anything where it's like it is a, there's a win lose situation here. There's a reality. You're as good as you showed to be good. You can decide that your poetry is the most amazing poetry ever. If you can get three other idiots to agree, you could believe your own hype easily, really quickly, not hard at all, but you can't. If you go and play basketball and you can't score a ball, you can never think you're a great basketball player.

Speaker 1:          02:36:26       You like, that ball is not going in here. This is not happening. I've keep throwing it. I keep missing the hall, so get a good code, 30 to nothing, three fucking games in a row. This is bullshit. You know, no matter what my mom says about that being a good athlete, these guys are me. Yeah, that's, that's an objective reality. And refining your approach. The whole point is you fail. Figure out what you're doing wrong. Get somebody to teach you the difference and then refine it and go back, go back it. There is some aspect that requires a positive approach and confidence and thinking and almost hubris. It all. There's a part of that that's real and that's where it gets really weird. It's like it's not an either or situation. There's a bunch of elements to success in life and one of the elements seems to be like a belief in yourself and a belief that positive things are going to happen.

Speaker 1:          02:37:14       And a belief in you know, hard work and a belief in like even if you're proven wrong sometimes and you see what went wrong, you've got to believe that you can recover from that and keep going. When you go on stage, like every time you go on stage, you've done it before, you've done it many times before so you know that you can go do it. And the crowd, you know Roars Brian Cowen and you get on that stage. But there's one point in time in your life where you didn't fucking know this, know whether it was the first time or it might've been like deepen your first year. You know, this is like a, a year in, I was like, what am I doing? It's a fucking guy. I'm still terrible. Like this is brutal. It's a brutal fucking occupation. Hit or miss. Not only that, it requires so much self examination that you never want to do as a young man.

Speaker 1:          02:37:56       Right, right, right, right. One of the most amazing conversations I've had in a long time was with an author named Dan Coyle, who wrote a book called the talent code. And he went and I had them all of the podcasts and trop and bitch and I thought he was going to [inaudible] a guy named Dan Quayle oil. Well, no, Dan Quayle wrote a book called the [inaudible] oil. It was called potato, it's called. He's, it's an amazing book called the talent code where he went and studied all the hotbeds of talent, like the schools that put out the most world champions. And he and he kept meeting the same coach over and over again. Uh, yeah. It was never a guy who gave big speeches or anything. He was just a guy obsessed with information on what he called deep practice. The idea of practice, what you're bad at, practice just beyond your reach and, and practice very hard.

Speaker 1:          02:38:47       Well that's that Malcolm Gladwell thing about the 10,000 hours thing. I mean, which, you know, comedians all hit that. Yeah. Well Dan Quayle it takes it to another, like there's a woman who's 77 in Russia. She owns one court, teaches in group classes, put out more champion, more tennis champions than anybody else in. And it's because, and she's really starts all steroids. Yeah, no, it's just the way she disseminates information. Um, the, and there are music people would teach you that there's this cello player in San Francisco who puts out more worldclass cellists because he just has a way of communicating what Prac, how you should practice. Yeah. That's a big thing, man. Learning how to learn things. It's big and a lot of people don't ever do it. And learning how to teach kids things. Like one of the things that I'm realizing when a, I, I'm a volunteer with my kid's class and I watch like how little children were talking about like five-year-old's absorb information and how some of them just don't get it.

Speaker 1:          02:39:41       They just don't get it. And guess what? They don't get any extra help to ones. The ones who don't get it. There's 30 fucking kids in this class. There's one lady who's teaching these kids and if the kid doesn't get it, he just doesn't get it. I didn't get it. And when kids don't get it, they get into this spiral of they're behind because they didn't get the first thing. The second thing comes along. They don't get that either cause that's based in the first thing. They're standing there like staring. It creates shame. Creates, creates a stupid, that's a terrible way to teach people. Like kids need to be talked to like individually, like one on one. They need to learn things. They definitely need some group time, but they need to learn things and it needs to be broken down differently for different people.

Speaker 1:          02:40:19       And we don't do it. We don't, we don't teach people how to learn. We don't teach people how to get good at things. We don't teach people how to discipline themselves and we make it so that people could just sort of skate by on life. Well also what happens, which is a very damaging idea, is the idea that Oh, some people are born smart, others aren't because you didn't get it. And that, that what happens is then you get gifted programs and these kids are separated over here and these kids over here are the dummies. And My, my very good friend of mine, Hunter Motto wrote this book, The straight a conspiracy motherfuckers friends with all these authors. I'm very, very smart. I'm brutal. Wait Til, well, before we end, I know we have to, and I want to get your take, I'm sorry to jump in.

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       I want to get your tank if we can on, on Robbie Lawler and, and, and that fight with, uh, with uh, Rory Mcdonald. And why, how did you find how you explain Robbie Lawler's renaissance? I mean, he's such a Badass discipline maturity, you know. Uh, he's, he's training with really tough fighters on a regular basis. You know, he's been working with the same striking co Co uh, coach Matt [inaudible] has been working with him for a long time, but now he's at, at t and t now, uh, at and t in American top team, att. And um, that's a great camp and a lot, a lot of high level guys from the trauma part, all those, so many. So many guys even don't even know. I mean there's got slews of them all talented people and so he's just putting it all together, you know, it's just, it's just a matter of him finally being focused and also spending a lot of time at 185 pounds and I'll drop it down to one side.

Speaker 1:          02:41:43       Oh right. He dropped down. I'm telling you, man, he knocked out Josh Koscheck and the first round and then there's Roy MacDonald fight. Dude, he fucking hurt Roy McDonald. He's one of the first, I mean he heard them in the clinch to hurt him when Rory was shooting for a take down and going for the single, he blasts him with left hands. He heard him when he got on top of him. He hurt him really bad in this one exchange in the third round. He had them fucking rocked. It was a bad fucking moment for Rory, but I'll tell you what, man, Rory can take it. That kid is so tough. He's so good and he's so technical, but Robbie's just so God damn ferocious. I was so impressed with Roy, especially in the first round about how he avoided Robbie's charges. I watched that fight just like, like the punches would come to his nose.

Speaker 1:          02:42:25       Right. He knew just how far to get back. I watched that fight with a, with a guy who took a bronze medal in the Olympics in boxing. Tony Jeffries, who teaches Brennan shop and he was, he was watching Rory and he said, he was like, he was like, that guy's got the best footwork I've seen. He said, as a, from an MMA fighter. He said, his foot works unbelievable. He's super technical. Just Lawler was just a little too much for him that night, especially in that one round when he heard him, but it was still a really close fight. You know, Roy, he's a bad motherfucker, man. On the phone. He's, by the way, he's going to get even better. He's still young as shit. He's 24 years old. After this fight, he's going to come back even stronger. And here's my, here's my next question. Uh, Hector Lombard fights.

Speaker 1:          02:43:01       Johnny Hendricks. What would happen? Oh, Jesus. The world would explode and I agree. Madness. Can you imagine that? Imagine powerhouses like that. Well, there's a lot of guys out there for him now for Hector Lombard and for Johnny Hendricks. Say, how about Tyron Woodley? Tyrone Woodley, he's a fucking monster man. Him Versus Hector Lombard would be the most muscular contest ever. Like the two most muscular man. 170, so stacked. It's crazy. Yeah. What's up with your friend Nate Marquardt? Is he going to retire now? I don't know. I uh, I just exchanged texts with him and, uh, I, I don't know. I don't want to speak for him. Um, I, I don't know, I just think that at Nate's been fighting for a very long time, a very high level and, uh, a lot of hard sparring too. A lot of hard sparring. You'd sparring party, sparred with Shane Carwyn for eight years.

Speaker 1:          02:43:49       Good luck. Yeah, that's an interesting story. Like when they asked GSP to with Shane Carwyn, he's like, why? Why would I spoke with them? Why? Because to learn 70 fucking pounds by Shane. Carmen hits like a, like a fricking mule kick. Yeah. It's like getting punched by a telephone pole at the end of a telephone pole. Just Dong Dong. It's got the biggest hand. Shane's got the biggest, thickest hands I've ever seen. Big His hands ever in the UFC. I believe it. Yeah, he had like three XL or four XL gloves. They're ridiculous. They're like these giant canned hands arms. It's a tough guy, man. He and you know, and for the longest time Nate and him were training partners and they would spar. And the idea that Nate who would fight eventually in his best way class at 170 pounds to be fighting a guy who was one of the bigger heavyweights.

Speaker 1:          02:44:31       Crazy. That's how smart he was or how good he was. Nate, Nate is when, when I talked to Brendan and train with him for eight years, and Shane the, when they talk about Nate and you know, I mean, and remember Nate's GSPS main sparring partner for a long time, I believe was named one of his biggest trading partners. Uh, you know, they, they, they talk about Nate and hidden hushed tones. He was as bad as like, I mean, Nate is a bad motherfucker, man at his best. If you go back and watch like the Tyron Woodley fight, when he fought with me in strike force and knocked him out, it was Nate then my one of his finest performance. It's incredible. He beat a lot of good guys at 185 pounds to me. Stop Martin Kampmann and 185 pounds. Um, Wilson go Veja I stopped flying a hundred feet.

Speaker 1:          02:45:13       Yeah. Knocked Damien Maia with one punch. Yep. Name was a bad mother fucker. But it goes back to the GSP thing. It's like they all have a certain amount of time in this game. Yeah. There's a certain amount of shots you can take. There's a certain amount of time. It's chill son. And I said, what are you going to do? You've been competing since you are nine years old. Like well how do you replace the juice of competition? And he said, I have no idea. I mean that's a huge part for, I think a lot of guys who are extreme winters, extreme athletes, you know, which I consider cage fighters to be, no doubt. Um, I think that substituting that all that you get from that is very, very difficult man. Yeah. Well there's also the fact that that's how they define themselves. You know, it's like, could you imagine if all the sudden you just weren't funny?

Speaker 1:          02:45:56       Yep. Like you would go on stage and you just eat shit. You just weren't funny and people found you just tasteful and they would boom, didn't drag me off the stage, man. Yeah. You try to figure out like what is, what went wrong here? Do you do? Yeah. What do you do? Well with a fighter, that's what it's like. It's like, it comes a point in time where your body is just, it's taken its, its share of blows and that's it. You start to see it, they start to have these breakdowns started to have these injuries and knee injuries, back injuries, neck injuries, elbow injuries, shoulder surgery. All this stuff starts to happen. The weird wheels literally start falling off. Yeah. You know, and until they figure out a way to make it so that, that doesn't happen, you know, until it's always, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:46:37       Been the deal with athlete's foot, great football players and great baseball players. What, when, when, when the crowd started cheering, um, what do you do now? And that's always been an issue for a lot of athletes. It's a deal with the devil. You know, you, you, you have 10 incredible years and then the rest of the time, by the time you're 32, you're a veteran and it's time to quit. A lot of times, you know, [inaudible] you've got to, I always, that's why I think than a lot of ways you've got to feed your brain at the same time. Yeah. You get, definitely got to feed your brain. But I think as also like what's going to happen if they figure out a way to fix things, like what's going to happen in the future if the consequences of fighting or not as extreme. Like, like if one day they get to a point where they can regenerate neuro tissue and speed up injuries, traumatic brain injuries just re rehabilitate your brain to 100% probably a better and better body probably get better and better or or not. I mean, one of the things that they find with people is that, again, I'm sorry to bring up Dan Coyle again, but you know, you stop developing like a, people type 80 words a minute and they don't get any better. People play golf and they stop at an 85 handicap because most people will get good enough and then stop it. To get that much better requires a whole different level of practice, a different kind of practice.

Speaker 1:          02:47:53       You've gotta be obsessed. You've got to get a fucking crazy person. Well, you remember when you're first starting out, when you're doing comedy and there was guys that were with you in the open mic days and they just fucking kind of dropped off and grow. They didn't mess with it. Exactly. You got to do, I love that spirit when you're, when you're a young comedian and it's like, Eh, you're looking for a joke everywhere. Yeah. What's funny about a tree? Oh man, we can write about a table or you know, microphones. When I used to drive newspapers, I had this, a van that didn't have any radio in it and uh, it was the best thing ever because this, this monotonous work that I would do and it was high on Dunkin donuts, coffee and fucking Boston cream donuts had this mad sugar rush and I was up at five o'clock in the morning throwing newspapers out the window and driving around by myself. I would get all my material. That's where I get all my,

Speaker 6:          02:48:38       I don't play music in my car a lot of times because I know, all right, if I, if I'm driving, you know, and it's nice because at the end of the day I feel like I accomplished something when I surprise myself with an idea that that to me is coming up with an idea and surprising myself with a bit like the other day I came up with something, but it just, it's such a good feeling. It's better almost then performing it in some ways, you know? Yeah. Well it's a gift. It's a gift for your time and focused. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:49:02       You, Tom and focused gives you this gift. You know, when you sit in front of a computer for hours and hours and you just got this one line, you're like, ah, one line. That's one line. Just that's all you need it. That's all you need. Then you take that one line, you cut and paste it into your little folder and you're like, Bam. Yeah. If you don't show up that thought, that line doesn't get written. If you don't sit in front of that computer, that line doesn't get written. I love that idea to show that what you just said is that if you've got to show up, got to show in a way, if you keep showing up, something will be revealed to you. That's the whole point of Pressfield's work. You know, the war of art. That's his whole thing, you know, showing up. So thing.

Speaker 1:          02:49:36       Did you ever see the podcast? I've read both his books. He's amazing. Oh Man. Really, really cool guy. Yeah, we did a podcast together. Me, him and Aubrey. I think it's amazing. Is Red is nonfiction stuff. I've read, well I've read both now, but uh, mostly the nonfiction stuff is what I'd read for the nonfiction. I didn't read the legend of Bagger Vance and stuff. Be read his fiction stuff though about like the Romans and the Greeks and he's got a lot of really wild shit, man. He's awesome. But just this whole thing is about having that habit to just work to get it done. And it applies to like anything creative, not just to writing but like the pre pretty much anything you would want to do, whether it's practicing music or you know, creating a film. Just fucking actually go to work. And that's what a lot of people don't going to because the world is filled with weak bitches. That's how we're going to end this. Ladies and gentlemen. Tell be a weak bitch. Get it together.
