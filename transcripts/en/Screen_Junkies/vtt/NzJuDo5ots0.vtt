00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.500
From the horse-faced director who starts shooting
before finishing scripts,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.850
based on a children's cartoon designed to
sell toys

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.000
comes a movie designed to sell toys,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.320
toys you can't even tell apart - except for the black one.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.119
"This looks like a cool place to kick it."

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.040
Together, they will unite with this stuttering
teenager.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.000
"No no no no no no no no!"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"No no no!"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.500
"No no no!"

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.200
"Oh, no no no!"

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
"No no no no!"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.230
"No no no no!"

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.000
"No no no no!"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.600
"No!"

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.809
to defeat a bad guy who doesn't appear until

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.200
almost two hours into the movie.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.820
But in the meantime, there's gratuitous porny

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.000
shots of Megan Fox,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.449
weird racism,

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.000
"Hey, mommy!"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.159
and robot fights that erupt around random

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.000
hot girls Michael Bay was trying to pork.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.429
This summer, you will say:

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.900
what

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.000
the hell

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.200
is happening?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.230
Until they give the bad guy the thing he wants,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.790
and then it kills him.
Seriously.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.000
It's f*cking stupid.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.940

BATTLESHIP.
I mean, TRANSFORMERS.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.390
C'mon, they both look the same.
Oh man, The Ninja Turtles are f*cked.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.130
Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands
of heart-breaking true stories

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.970
comes this fake one.
Jack is an unrealistically sexy peasant,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.130
and Rose is a first-class suicidal pair of
boobs.
