Speaker 1:          00:00          It's just, it's very easy to just to just say, you know what, that's enough for me and find what is like for me. Yes. Everybody's, everybody's humor is different. I, I love, I love, there's a, there's a, there's a viral video. It is, uh, this old guy trying to hover board. He's like, fuck, he's gotta be like 69, 70, and you know, his grandkids there and he's like, lemme lemme try it. Lemme lemme try it. And his man gets on his hoverboard and taste. If you saw Mike Tyson following a hover board, his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's. I've never seen somebody hit their head harder and my life. And I didn't laugh out of wanting to see his old man hurt herself. I laughed because it was stupid to try to get on his hoverboard in the first place. And when he got up, he tells the kids, why is it moving like that?

Speaker 1:          01:11          I played this video, everybody, because that should made me laugh. Some people will watch and go, oh, no, no. Some people will watch it and go, oh, whoa, Whoa, oh. And other than just DAB by 11 because everybody's humor is different. Yeah. Everybody's fucking hammer is different. My humor is different. Fall in makes me laugh. I don't care who you are. Falling makes me laugh. I don't give a shit who you are. If you fall in front of me. No Shadow. I'm holding a laugh. There's no shot. There's no shot. You don't stand a chance. If you fall in. Pardon me? There is no shot that I'm not. That was something son has got to come out. Right. Falling is funny. I still think it's hacky. I still think far too funny when my kids fart. I laugh. I still until this day is the funniest shit ever to me.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Guy Goes that Vu stick. Get out of here. Stay gas. My little son, 17 months when you fart, I laugh. Something, something within just the ability to just be fucking silly and stupid. Oh yeah. It doesn't always have to have a meaning behind it. Some shit is just stupid. My eight year old farts on cue. She thinks it's hilarious as well as Jeanie. She'll tell you, listen, I got to talk to you about some. They'd go and she starts laughing. She thinks it's hilarious. She'll fall down on the couch. The best thing in the world, she can't stop laughing is the best thing you're talking about as a kid. That's all you got. Cause you only bit as a kid, you got nothing else but farts. That's all you get. That's all you got to make people laugh. You should enjoy it. Yeah. This shit, I still think it's funny folly, but falling is number one for me. Falling is number one. My wife fell down the steps. She got so mad because I didn't rush to help her. I laugh. She had a wine glass. Wine was all over the, Oh my God. One of the wars falls I've ever seen in my damn life got up. Her shoe was on one step. The other shoe was all follows. Funny. I like it.
