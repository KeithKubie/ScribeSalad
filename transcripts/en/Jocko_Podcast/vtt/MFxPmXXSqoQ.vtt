This is Jocko podcast number one 78 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.410
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo that evening.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.590
<v 0>Honorable Mother and father.</v>

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.780
<v 0>The difficulty of the journey you made to see me was clearly evident in your</v>

7
00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:24.980
disheveled hair and in the hollows under your eyes.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.330
It made me want to bend my knees and worship before you

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.540
in the wrinkles on your brows was vivid testimony of the pains you took to raise

10
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:38.414
me.

11
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.620
Words could not express my feelings and what little I did say with superficial

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.970
in the extreme.

13
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.310
<v 0>Yet,
although acutely conscious of how little time we had,</v>

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.580
I saw on your eyes and in your gaze all you wanted to say but couldn't

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.040
when you took my hand.

17
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
I experienced a sense of profound peacefulness unlike anything I've experienced

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.910
since joining up,

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.100
like being a baby again and longing for the warmth of a mother's love.

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.950
<v 0>It is because I bask in the beauty of your deep devotion that I can martyr</v>

22
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:25.950
myself for you
foreign death.

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.010
I will sleep in the world of your love,

24
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.590
honorable mother.

25
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.020
Even if I was never able to fully accept the love you gave me,

26
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.690
I received so much wisdom from you

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.770
and father,
your silent words are carved deeply into my heart.

28
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.140
With this,
I will be able to fight together with both of you,

29
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.440
even if I should die.
It will be with a peaceful spirit.

30
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.960
I mean this with all my heart.

31
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.670
The war zone is where these beautiful emotions are put to the test.

32
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.390
<v 0>If death means a return to this world of love,</v>

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.700
there is no need for me to fear.

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.280
There is nothing left to do,

36
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.850
but press on then fulfill my duty.

37
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.620
<v 0>And that is the final letter written by a man named captain,</v>

39
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.133
uh,
Daci

40
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.700
<v 1>okay.</v>

41
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.690
<v 0>To Korea,
who's written obviously to his parents,</v>

42
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.730
and he was assigned to kamikaze special attack group number one.

43
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.880
And he did carry out his mission,

44
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.130
a suicide attack on one of the u s navy vessels,

45
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.170
the vicinity of Okinawa on the 28th of April,

46
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.430
1945 he was 23 years old,

47
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.910
which is actually pretty old for a kamikaze.

48
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.380
Here's another last letter home.

49
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.150
This one's from ensign.
Kiyoshi.

50
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.970
Ogawa no father and mother.

51
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.340
It has been decided that I also will make a sorority as a proud,

52
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.380
as special attack core member.

53
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.131
<v 0>Looking back,</v>

55
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:35.300
when I think of your raising me in your arms for more than 20 years,

56
00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:37.220
I am filled with a sense of gratitude.

57
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.790
<v 0>I truly believe that no one else has lived a happier life than me and I am</v>

59
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:47.350
resolved to repay the emperor and my father for your kindness.

60
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.950
Beyond those boundless white clouds,

61
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.130
I will make my attack with a calm feeling.

62
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.540
<v 0>Not even thoughts of life and death will come to my mind.</v>

64
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.970
A person dies once.

65
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.270
It will be an honorable day to live for the eternal cause.

66
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.630
Father and mother,
please be glad for me,

67
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.713
<v 1>okay.</v>

68
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.180
<v 0>Above all,
mother,</v>

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.500
please take care of your health and I wish for everyone's prosperity.

70
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

71
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.730
<v 0>Father and mother,</v>

72
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.420
I always and forever will be living near you and we'll be praying.

73
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.520
I will go smiling both on the day of my sorority and forever.

74
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.920
<v 0>Ben Ensign Ogawa was the pilot pilot of the second plane to hit the USS Bunker</v>

76
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:53.984
hill

77
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.090
and that kamikaze attack killed 393 in wounded 264 and took the aircraft carrier

78
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.810
out of commission for the duration of the war.

79
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.260
<v 0>Most of the comma cozzies were young.</v>

81
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.600
They were sometimes 17,
but usually 18,
19,
maybe 20 years old.

82
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.410
They all wrote final letters home.

83
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.010
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.010
<v 0>The letters generally spoke of their commitment to the emperor,</v>

85
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.690
their commitment to the Japan,

86
00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:36.020
their commitment to their parents and it's actually theirs.
Theirs.

87
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.940
<v 0>There's a lot of these letters.
There's thousands of them in.
It's,</v>

89
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.070
it's actually when you sit there and read them,

90
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.100
it's actually kind of sickening to read these letters.
These young boys there.

91
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.880
<v 0>Oh,
there are brainwashed.
And I know some people find some,</v>

93
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.810
some level of honor in the kamikaze pilots.

94
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.550
You know,
they sacrifice for their country.
They,

95
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.350
they put service above themselves for their emperor.
Um,

96
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.910
I've a hard time with that.

97
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.200
These are kids,
right?
These are pawns.
And,

98
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:21.140
and actually they weren't even that effective.

99
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.160
They had a hit ratio of about 14%.

100
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.920
They,

101
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.920
there was 2,800 kamikaze pilots that were killed and they killed about 4,900

102
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.420
sailors,
US Navy,
sailors.

103
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.960
<v 0>And God bless all those brave sailors,</v>

105
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:50.070
every one of those losses and deaths as a tragedy.

106
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.170
And the U s navy in World War II,
in the navy in general,

107
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.330
in World War II was a nightmare.

108
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.210
Uh,
the kamikaze sank 34 ships,
which is,

109
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.040
which is horrible,
but it actually wasn't a game changer.

110
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.760
But
these suicide bombers,

111
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.810
you've got to think about how they ended up in that situation.

112
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.090
And I don't like suicide bombers at all.
And I,

113
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.060
I guess I have a biased against suicide bombers.
Fine.

114
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.430
There was a lot of suicide bombers in Ramadi,
and some people,
like I said,

115
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:37.780
some people try and glorify a suicide bomber,

116
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.270
whether it's a kamikaze or whether it's a modern day suicide bomber.

117
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.420
And they try and glorify him,
but there's no glory.

118
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.460
The modern suicide bombers are either cowards that are afraid to face their

119
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:58.130
enemies in battle.
And what's really sad is that that's,

120
00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.631
that's rare.

121
00:07:59.631 --> 00:08:03.950
More than likely the modern suicide bomber that you're dealing with is an actual

122
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:08.540
victim himself who is,
you know,

123
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.250
usually a young kid been manipulated and lied to and,
and,
and,

124
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.113
or,

125
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.700
or I should say also coerced through threats.

126
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.130
And that's,
that happened all the time.
It was like,
Hey,

127
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.860
if you don't carry out this suicide mission,
we're going to kill your family.

128
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.130
<v 0>And so you might as well,
you might as well do it.</v>

130
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.570
So that's what you're dealing with.
But some of them,
you know,

131
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:38.060
sometimes people just get straight up brainwashed.

132
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:42.730
And it's the same thing with the Japanese kamikaze.
He's a pro,

133
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.680
I would say a lot less on the coercion side.

134
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.260
You know,
like it wasn't like they were holding their family,

135
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.440
but they did a great job of,

136
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.750
of brainwashing this,
these kids.

137
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.400
And Yeah,
I'm no expert.

138
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.420
I should have said that straight out of the gate.
I'm just giving you my opinion,

139
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.070
my,
my thoughts about it.

140
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.930
There's some Japanese documents that I think paint a pretty clear picture of

141
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.400
kind of the,
the,
the foundation of what the Japanese military was taught.

142
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.820
<v 0>And it's why they were,
why they fought to the death.</v>

144
00:09:27.821 --> 00:09:31.540
And there's a lot of propaganda that you can look at to the propaganda that,

145
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:32.560
you know,

146
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.910
explains Americans as these evil people that we're going to come and rape their

147
00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:41.200
women and news better to die.
So there's that.
But there's,

148
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.030
there's a more foundational thing I think,
um,

149
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.200
that that was printed in World War II and it was called the imperial rescript to

150
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:57.350
soldiers and sailors,
sailors,
and a rescript.

151
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.930
Is that an official guidance?

152
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.020
It's like this is the word from the boss and it included in,

153
00:10:04.121 --> 00:10:07.570
it's something called the send Youcan,
which,

154
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.640
which meant instructions for the battlefield.

155
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.900
And what's weird about this document,
um,

156
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.150
is it's got a lot of really a lot of stuff in it that when you're here,

157
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:23.230
it sounds,
for lack of a better word,
it sounds good.

158
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.670
The kind of thing that you think,
oh wow,
that's,
that's,
that's honorable.

159
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.470
That's good.
It's very idealistic.

160
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.350
And,
and I think if this document,

161
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.380
this imperial rescript to soldiers and sailors,

162
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.520
if it actually would have been followed the,
a lot of the problems,

163
00:10:42.521 --> 00:10:45.430
a lot of the atrocities that were committed,
we wouldn't have happened

164
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.950
because of the document as you're going to hear,
is a,
is a,

165
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.850
it's a fairly positive document.

166
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.570
And I think sometimes people take and they hold up that attitude,

167
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.240
that kind of Bushido attitude.
I'd hold it up on a pedestal.
And like I said,

168
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.100
I get it because when you,
when you look at it on its own,
you think,

169
00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:18.610
wow,
this is,
this is a good thing.
This is a positive thing.

170
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.950
But what you can't forget is that it's this attitude of this attitude and this

171
00:11:28.601 --> 00:11:32.950
culture of extreme obedience,
right?

172
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.000
Extreme obedience.
I talk all the time about how you got a question,
a question,

173
00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:40.240
your leaders,
right?
And I talk all the time how if,

174
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.320
if you're told to do something that's unethical or illegal or immoral,

175
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:49.030
it is your obligation and your duty to disobey.

176
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.460
So they,
they didn't have that attitude.

177
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.960
Their attitude was 100% obedience.

178
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.170
They also had the strong attitude of ethnic superiority.

179
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.680
So they,

180
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.890
the Japanese people thought that their race and their ethnicity was superior to

181
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.130
everyone else's.

182
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.910
And that attitude led to things like these comics,

183
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.680
kamikaze pilots,

184
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.810
and it led to atrocities like the rape of Nanking and like unit seven,

185
00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:26.270
31,
uh,
just horror,

186
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.420
horror show atrocities with the darkest evil imaginable

187
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.050
and know podcast 60 rape,

188
00:12:36.051 --> 00:12:39.380
a Nan king podcast one 30 through one 33,

189
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.180
unit seven 31.

190
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.710
If you listen to those,
you don't,

191
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:50.700
you can't listen to those and feel normal when you're done listening to it.

192
00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:54.430
You can't,
it's,

193
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.440
they're disturbing to listen to when you see how evil human beings can be to

194
00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:01.940
other human beings.

195
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.340
So
like I said,

196
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:11.880
when you hear this imperial rescript

197
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:13.610
<v 1>okay,</v>

198
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.440
<v 0>it,
it,
it sounds positive.
A lot of it sounds good,</v>

199
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.450
but it,
first of all,
it wasn't followed
cause some,

200
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.100
some of the positive parts of the code that they clearly did not listen to.

201
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.930
And then other parts of the code
that are positive,

202
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.560
like anything that's positive.
If you let it go too far,

203
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.030
then it becomes a negative.
And that's seems to me what happened,

204
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.390
at least in some sense,
an imperial Japan.

205
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.340
So I think this document kind of reveals how they framed their mindset.

206
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.130
And there's,
like I said,

207
00:13:56.131 --> 00:13:59.280
there's lessons in here to learn and think about things that you can take away

208
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:01.890
that you say,
hmm,
that's a good policy.

209
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.830
But yeah.

210
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.210
<v 0>You can also see that when it's taken to the extreme,</v>

212
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.840
it becomes the framework for imperial Japan to become the sadistic evil that

213
00:14:14.911 --> 00:14:18.030
they originally believed that they were fighting against.

214
00:14:18.031 --> 00:14:19.980
So let's get into it.

215
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.930
The imperial rescript to soldiers and sailors,
sailors.
Here we go.

216
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.420
Introduction.
The battle is aware.

217
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.450
The imperial army acting under the imperial command displays its true character

218
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.620
conquering whenever it attacks winning whenever and engages in combat in order

219
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:42.750
to spread Codo.

220
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.790
And so Kodo is the imperial way.
That's what it means.

221
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.320
And that's the,
that's how they describe it.
But what's interesting is it,

222
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.790
it literally means like a fragrance,
like a smell.
So it's like the scent,

223
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.120
the spirit,
the heartbeat.
So that's what Kodo is.

224
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.710
They want to spread the Koto far and wide so that the enemy may look up in awe

225
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.160
to the August verse,
virtues of His Majesty,

226
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.590
those who marched to the battlefield therefore should endeavor to exalt

227
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:17.300
throughout the world the glories of the empire by fully realizing what the

228
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:22.301
country stands for and firmly upholding the moral tenants of the imperial army.

229
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.300
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

230
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.300
<v 0>the imperial rescript to the Armed Forces is explicit while regulations and</v>

231
00:15:30.241 --> 00:15:34.650
manuals clearly defined conduct in combat and methods of training conditions in

232
00:15:34.651 --> 00:15:36.630
the combat zone,
however,

233
00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:40.800
tend to cons because soldiers to be swayed by immediate events and become

234
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.000
forgetful of their duty.
Indeed they should be wary

235
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.580
indeed.
They should be wary.
They're less,

236
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.790
they run counter to their duties as soldiers.

237
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:57.030
The purpose of this code lies and providing concrete rules of conduct in the

238
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:02.131
light of past experience so that those in the zone of combat may holy abide by

239
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:08.221
the imperial rescript to enhance the moral virtues of the imperial army.

240
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.460
So hey,

241
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.460
combat is going to be tough and you may forget your morals that they're talking

242
00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:21.810
about moral virtues.
And so we're saying,
hey,

243
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.350
combat is going to be hard.
It's going to be chaotic,

244
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.630
and when you get in that tough situation,

245
00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:31.140
you may forget your morals until this guide right here is going to help you keep

246
00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:35.430
you on track.
That's what it's going to do.
That's the idea here.
Chapter one,

247
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:41.270
the empire Japan is the cocoa coop,

248
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.380
which means the empire,

249
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.670
the 10 which is the emperor of Japan,

250
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.730
rules over it everlastingly in a line unbroken through the ages as the successor

251
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.710
in the high and broad cause established by the imperial ancestor at the time of

252
00:16:58.711 --> 00:16:59.940
the founding of the empire.

253
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.160
Imperial Benevolence is extended to all without favor,

254
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.310
while the imperial virtues enlighten the world,

255
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.670
<v 1>okay,</v>

256
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.330
<v 0>the people to handing down from traditions of loyalty,</v>

257
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.930
filial piety and F and valor from generation to generation and enhancing their

258
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:25.381
by their moral peculiar to the empire have assisted the throne,

259
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.330
a perfect national unity under the throne,

260
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.800
which has brought about the present national prosperity.

261
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.690
So they they,
they go that this,
this goes back to like a racial thing,
right?
Hey,

262
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:42.940
this,
this is an unbroken,

263
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.600
unbroken line of royalty for thousands of years and,

264
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.810
and that's why we're here and they've been so benevolent.

265
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:56.280
That's why we're living a good life right now.

266
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.280
Soldiers on the field should seek to achieve with unshakeable determination,

267
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:03.270
their mission of depen,

268
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.780
of defending the empire by laying to heart the essential character of the

269
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:07.770
national policy,

270
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:14.790
the army under command of the emperor assist in furthering the imperial fortunes

271
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.300
by enhancing the glories of the empire through the embodiment of the lofty

272
00:18:21.461 --> 00:18:22.660
spirit of valor.

273
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:23.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

274
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.520
<v 0>This spirit is the basic factor in realizing universal peace.
Hey,
we're,</v>

275
00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:29.940
we're fighting for peace over here.

276
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:35.190
That's what we're doing for does this spirit of justice combined with valor and

277
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:40.250
of valor tempered by Van Benevolence in conformity with the imperial wishes.

278
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.060
So this is all good,
right?
That's where we're at.
This is all good.

279
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:47.830
This is a benevolent leader.
You've got the,
the,

280
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.930
the spirit of the army is actually just the reflection,

281
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.580
the arm of this benevolence that's going to go out and bring the spirit of peace

282
00:18:56.581 --> 00:19:00.360
to the world valor.
But then we get into it a little bit.

283
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:05.130
Valid requires strictness.
While benevolence must be universal,

284
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.640
should there be an enemy who dares opposed the imperial army?

285
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:13.641
The army must resolutely resort to force of arms and deal him a crushing blow.

286
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.400
We took a little one 80 heritage way.
Hey,
we're all about getting our piece on,

287
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.540
but if you oppose,
if you dare to oppose the imperial army,

288
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.110
you're gonna get a crushing blow.
That's how we're rolling.
However,

289
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.770
even though force may compel the enemy sub to submit,

290
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.160
should a lapse of virtue should elapse in virtue occur by the striking of those

291
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:41.490
who do not resist or by failure to show kindness to those who surrender.

292
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.800
It cannot be said that such an army is perfect.
So there we got,
we got,

293
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.220
we're going to take care of the people that if you surrender your good,

294
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.250
if you don't resist,
you won't be harmed.
Right?
So we're like a benevolent army.

295
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.700
If you stand up to us,
we're going to crush you.
But if not,
it's cool.
Yeah,

296
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.960
we're gonna.
We're gonna take care of you.

297
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.750
Here's modest in its strength on Austin.

298
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.760
[inaudible] in its kindness.

299
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.880
The imperial army becomes an object of admiration when it quietly displays it's

300
00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:19.240
valor and benevolence.
So here we are.
You know what I'm saying here?

301
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.970
You gotta be humble.
I say that all the time.
Gotta be humble.

302
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.800
That's what they're saying.
You got to be modest.

303
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.560
You gotta you got quietly display your strength,
right?
Sure.

304
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.260
Just be modest.
Yeah,
we agree with that.

305
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.660
The mission of the imperial army lies in making the imperial virtues,

306
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.700
the objects of universal admiration through the exercise of justice,

307
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.260
tempered with mercy.

308
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.170
Obviously the folks Nan King did not get this message

309
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.030
discipline,
and actually they truly didn't because if this didn't,

310
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.310
this wasn't released when the rape of Nanking took place.

311
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.170
This hadn't come out yet,
so they,

312
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.170
they truly did not get the memo of this correct.
At that time.
Discipline,

313
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.610
the essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of

314
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:16.710
complete obedience to His Majesty.

315
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.133
There you go.

316
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.070
The essence of discipline in the imperial army lies in the lofty spirit of

317
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:27.290
complete obedience to His Majesty.

318
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.220
High and low must have deeply engraved in their minds.

319
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.310
The solemn knee of the right of command.

320
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.480
Those above crew should exercise the right in all seriousness.

321
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.470
While those below should obey the commands in utmost sincerity.

322
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.860
Essential the victory and requisite for maintaining peace is the condition we're

323
00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:53.861
in the entire army United in the bonds of absolute loyalty moves as one in

324
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:59.450
response to a command,
so we're,
this is where we're getting into it.

325
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.470
You know,
even the,
even the in the u s military,

326
00:22:03.471 --> 00:22:08.240
you got to obey the lawful orders of the people appointed above you the lawful

327
00:22:08.241 --> 00:22:12.320
orders.
That's the oath that you swear is that you'll obey the lawful orders.

328
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.820
It doesn't just say,
oh,
bay,

329
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.110
especially on the battlefield is the utmost observance of the spirit of

330
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:21.740
obedience necessary.

331
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.510
The spirit of the soldier is best exemplified by those who silently do their

332
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:31.511
duty joyfully braving death in obedience to a command given at a time when they

333
00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:34.640
are undergoing undergoing great hardships.

334
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.190
There's no more important time that you need to obey.
Then on the battlefield,

335
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.490
next section,
unity.

336
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:48.730
The army looks up in all to his majesty as it's August head.

337
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.300
<v 0>It will be United in compliance with the imperial will as one in spirit and in</v>

339
00:22:56.961 --> 00:23:00.050
body and in single hearted loyalty

340
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.570
and keeping with the basic principles of command and army unit should form a

341
00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:10.571
solid yet genial group with its commander as its center.

342
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.960
It is essential that each man high and low dutifully observing his place should

343
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:21.530
be determined always to sacrifice himself for the hole in accordance with the

344
00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:23.330
intentions of the commander,

345
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.690
by repurposing every confidence in his comrades and without giving even the

346
00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:33.170
slightest thought to personal interest and to life or death.

347
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.480
So,
Hey,

348
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.410
I'm a firm believer.
In fact,

349
00:23:43.411 --> 00:23:48.080
I think that's what makes a good player is someone that puts the team above

350
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:51.920
themselves,
no doubt about it.
That's also what makes a good leader,

351
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.450
someone that puts the team's mission and the people on the team above

352
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.170
themselves.
That's,
I agree with that.

353
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.820
<v 0>I guess we're going a little next level here,
maybe a little bit.
Yeah.</v>

355
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.350
You,
you gotta beat.
See there's a,
here's the difference.

356
00:24:10.351 --> 00:24:14.130
I think it's in this word determined always to sacrifice for yourself for the

357
00:24:14.131 --> 00:24:16.590
hole that's going to the next level,
right?
It's not like,
Hey,

358
00:24:16.591 --> 00:24:17.520
I'm putting the team first.

359
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:20.670
It's like my goal is to sacrifice myself for the team.
That's where I'm heading.

360
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.580
That's what I'm trying to make happen.
That's a little different.

361
00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.560
It's the little next level
cooperation.
Next section.

362
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:33.561
Cooperation of soldiers not only should be United in mind in carrying out their

363
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.441
tasks,

364
00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:38.580
but should also display the spirit of cooperation by forgetting themselves for

365
00:24:38.581 --> 00:24:39.510
the sake of victory.

366
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.770
Every unit should carry out its mission with responsibility upholding its honor,

367
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.760
placing confidence in others and assisting one another,

368
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.370
volunteering to face hardships,

369
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.580
exerting all its strength and cooperation and fighting valiantly to achieve its

370
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:01.700
objective.
Teamwork.

371
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.080
That's what we're saying.
We're talking about teamwork.

372
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.080
We are going a little next level here because we're talking about forgetting

373
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.270
yourselves for the sake of victory.
That's a,

374
00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.680
that's a little next level.

375
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.010
Volunteering to face hardships while everyone does that in the military exerting

376
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:23.330
strengthen cooperation.
Yes.

377
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.720
Everyone does that in the military fighting valiantly to achieve its objective.

378
00:25:26.721 --> 00:25:28.790
Yes.
Everyone does that in the military,

379
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.323
<v 1>but</v>

380
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.800
<v 0>for getting yourself for the sake of victory,
that I,
that's again,
this is like,</v>

381
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.170
Hey,
I'm putting the team and the mission above me.

382
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.310
I get that we're not going to forget ourselves though,
right?

383
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.340
We're not just,
we're not just saying,
okay,
I don't exist.

384
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.510
We're not giving up our personal spirit for the collective spirit.

385
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.500
We're not doing that.
Well,
let me rephrase that.
We're not doing that in America.

386
00:25:57.501 --> 00:26:02.210
That's not what we're doing.
We joined together the collective spirit,

387
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:06.290
but we're not given up ours.
Next section.

388
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.710
Aggressiveness
can't argue with aggressiveness.

389
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.340
Aggressiveness should constantly prevail in combat,

390
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.080
which must be carried out with bravery and determination when attacking,

391
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.770
be determined and positive.
Always taking the initiative,

392
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:27.420
fighting vigorously and stubbornly vowing not to cease until the enemy is

393
00:26:27.421 --> 00:26:30.990
crushed.
I've got no issues with that

394
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.271
in defense.

395
00:26:33.271 --> 00:26:37.740
Always retain the spirit of attack and always maintain freedom of action.

396
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.970
Never give up a position but rather die

397
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.250
in pursuit.
Be Thorough and inexhaustible.

398
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.770
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

399
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.570
<v 0>so,
Yep.
Never give up position.
It's better to die.</v>

400
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.550
And I think we talked about,
but we definitely talked about that on the podcast.

401
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.850
Like when is it intelligent to make a tactical retreat?

402
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.320
There are times without question and there's been times throughout history where

403
00:27:06.321 --> 00:27:11.321
tactical retreats giving up positions has caused victory.

404
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.450
The imperial Japanese army is not talking about that.

405
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.940
They're talking about it's better to die.

406
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:21.660
<v 1>Okay.</v>

407
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.040
<v 0>Continuing on act boldly,
intent upon victory,</v>

408
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.930
be fearless and comm.

409
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.310
Meeting the situation courageously undergoing hardships with indomitable

410
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.510
perseverance so as to overcome all obstacles.
Okay,

411
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.990
I'm good with that.
Right?

412
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.700
That's what you gotta do in dominal.
Perseverance,
overcome all obstacles.

413
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.770
Good.
The next section,
conviction to win.
Faith.

414
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.970
His strength,

415
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.500
he who has faith in combat is always the victor.

416
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:05.610
The conviction to win grows from constant and rigorous training to develop the

417
00:28:05.681 --> 00:28:10.681
strength to conquer the enemy by every possible effort and by improving every

418
00:28:10.811 --> 00:28:15.240
moment,
no issues with that.
Get better.
Yeah.

419
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.040
Train hard,
rigorous con.

420
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.300
Rigorous training is going to definitely get to get you ready for Tufts

421
00:28:20.301 --> 00:28:24.030
situations.
Got To have faith in what you're doing.
For sure.

422
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.030
The destiny of the Empire rests upon victory or defeat in battle.

423
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.680
It's a heavy weight to bear.

424
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.930
Do not give up under any circumstances.

425
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.540
Keeping in your mind your responsibility to keep untarnished the glorious

426
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:47.541
history of the imperial army with its tradition of invincibility.

427
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.321
Yeah,

428
00:28:52.321 --> 00:28:57.321
that one's a stretch or taking a stretch now because I promise you that no man

429
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.290
and no army is invincible.
So we're getting a little stretch.

430
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.960
They're going a little too deep.

431
00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.100
Next section,
chapter two,

432
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.460
and part one is called piety.

433
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.810
The gods look upon us from above.

434
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:23.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.150
<v 0>Be Worthy of divine protection by being pure in heart.</v>

436
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:32.070
Just inaction,
profound and sincere in your piety.

437
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:37.350
Constantly mindful of the loyalty you,
oh the emperor,

438
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.070
end of duty to your parents.

439
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.070
So we're talking.

440
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:49.120
That's the first most important thing is your devotion to the emperor.

441
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.553
<v 1>Okay?</v>

442
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.640
<v 0>That's,
that's,</v>

443
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.240
that's the most important thing that we're talking about and the gods look upon

444
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:58.660
you from,
from above.
The gods are related to the emperor.

445
00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

446
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.960
<v 0>The,</v>

447
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.430
the next section is filial piety.

448
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.790
So now we're talking about reverence of our parents,

449
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:14.791
loyalty and filial piety as one form the law from form the essence of our

450
00:30:15.371 --> 00:30:16.660
national morality.

451
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:18.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

452
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.420
<v 0>A loyal subject is always a dutiful son</v>

453
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.070
endeavored to manifest the best traditions of our forefathers by bearing in mind

454
00:30:27.831 --> 00:30:29.060
the wishes of your parents,

455
00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:34.061
thereby fulfilling the sacred duty of a loyal subject on the battlefield.

456
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:42.120
Hey,
respect your parents.
I can get behind that.
Nothing wrong with that.

457
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.450
Try and be a good kid,
but sure.
No objections,

458
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.000
solutes and manners.

459
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.320
The solute is the expression of a sincere feeling of obedience

460
00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.590
and is also a symbol of unity between those above and those below.

461
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.790
Solutes must be strictly executed on the field.

462
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:10.100
If a soldier is filled with a sense of decorum and strict in practicing good

463
00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:13.760
manners,
it shows that he is a strong warrior.
To me,
this is weird.

464
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.100
It's just weird cause salutes.
You know,

465
00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:23.750
salutes are a a definitely a time honored military tradition throughout the
world

466
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:30.140
and in the u s military,
you don't salute a lot in the field for sure.

467
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.650
In the seal teams you did.
Don't salute.
I mean very rarely,

468
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.560
there's not a lot of sweating going on basically because you're not walking

469
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:40.790
around when uniform all the time.
So there's not a lot of saluting going on.

470
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.770
But yeah,

471
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:47.830
so there's a lot of different ways to show respect and saluting is sort of the

472
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.590
most visible I guess way.
But it just,

473
00:31:51.591 --> 00:31:53.840
it just kind of interesting to me that they're so into it.

474
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.650
Let me put it to this way.
This,
this is,
um,

475
00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.870
you know,
when you see like a military movie,
which I'm sure you've seen some.

476
00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:07.820
Yes sir.
When you see like the new guy officer,
right?
And he says,
Hey,

477
00:32:07.821 --> 00:32:10.220
you better give me a solute sergeant.
Right?
Yeah.

478
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.820
And everyone knows that that guy's not a good leader immediately.
Right.

479
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.400
Cause you don't get all freaked out because someone doesn't salute you the way

480
00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:18.100
they showed.
Sure.
So,

481
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.280
so now we have the whole military is acting like that.

482
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.790
The whole Japanese military is like,
hey,
you better salute.

483
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.020
That to me is a little bit,
and I get it right.
It's the,

484
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.000
it's the military tradition.
It is.

485
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.780
It's not a show of a BD as far as I'm concerned.
It's a respectful thing.
Like,

486
00:32:35.781 --> 00:32:39.500
Hey,
you know,
their yard,
you're,
you're a senior officer or whatever.
Boom.
You get,

487
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.130
you crack

488
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.820
<v 2>this salute.
It's all good.
Isn't it?
Like a symbol</v>

489
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.480
of like just extreme discipline,
like know your place,

490
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:55.400
like know your role,
know your place.
Uh,
it does I guess signify that,

491
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:59.060
but really it's just about respect as far as I'm concerned.
You know,
boom.

492
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:03.590
You see someone that's senior to you,
boom,
you crack a salute,
I'll good.
Right.

493
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.180
But let's say like the kind of the functional use,
um,

494
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.360
of that respect is like,
you know,
I'm gonna come,
I'm gonna,
you know,

495
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.100
appear before you kind of thing.
And it's basically recognizing,
Hey,

496
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:18.410
I'm beneath you.
You're above me.
You know,

497
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.910
this is how we're functioning together right now.
There's my,
you know,

498
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.230
affirm,
what do you call,
like a conservation.
Conservation,
yeah,
yeah.
There is,

499
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:31.940
there is a that's there and it's,
and it's a way,
to me,

500
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:35.900
it's all about tradition and respect more than anything else.
Yeah.
You know,
um,

501
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.080
that's what it is.
It's about tradition and respect.
You,
you know,

502
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:43.160
you see someone that's senior,
an officer,
if you're an enlisted guy,

503
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.070
used to be all the officer's boom,
get them up.
That's the way it is,

504
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.320
but it's,

505
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.480
to me,
it's not like this crazy thing.

506
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:57.230
Like I never yelled at anyone for not saluting me.
Right.
Yeah.

507
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.910
You know,
and you probably couldn't find a lot of seals that would,

508
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.050
that have done that.
Uh,
now could you say that,
oh,
this there's,
you know,

509
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:11.051
you could see some kid that's being legitimately trying to be disrespectful,

510
00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:12.650
right?
Yeah.

511
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.870
And maybe that person could get tightened up.
Yeah.

512
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.760
But yeah,
like on a few good men remember when he's like,
hey,

513
00:34:22.761 --> 00:34:25.970
whatever happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room and then the

514
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:29.070
guy puts his hands in his pocket.
Oh.
Dassey who,
who,

515
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.260
who puts their hand in the pocket?

516
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:35.300
His name was downy or doc Dawson.
Dawson.

517
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.010
Dawson.
Yeah.
It,
and who is he doing that to?
Tom Cruise.
Oh,
Dang.

518
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:44.420
Tom Cruise wasn't getting the respect,
so there you go.
Yeah.
There you go.

519
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.940
Good.
Good example.
Yeah,
but see what I'm saying?
No.
Um,
it's like,

520
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:54.350
but what does that respect kind of,
kind of reflecting the overall functionally,

521
00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:57.560
it does seem like that.
It's like,
okay,
no knowing your place.

522
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.140
I'm here to kind of recognize that,
you know,

523
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:03.830
just in this small detailed way that that apparently will be unnecessary in

524
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:06.050
certain scenarios.
Yeah.
And I guess,

525
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:08.540
I guess what you're actually talking about is just good order and discipline.

526
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:13.100
Yeah.
Okay.
That's the way it is.
You know,
we just,
we just have this tradition,

527
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:14.360
this is,
you know,
this is what's happening.

528
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.360
Same thing with like polished shoes or,
or you know,

529
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:21.500
your uniform being squared is good order and discipline.
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Right.

530
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:24.200
So it's like there's no questions,
there's no wiggle room or whatever.

531
00:35:24.201 --> 00:35:27.790
Like we're here to do the job like from a to Z and I'm just saying,

532
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.890
if you're freaking out about solutes than,

533
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.920
than you probably need to look at some other stuff that's going on around you.

534
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:38.040
You might be freaking out about the wrong thing is all I'm saying.
And

535
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.530
<v 0>if you're good,
like if you're a good officer,</v>

536
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.130
it's not like people are trying to avoid saluting you.
Yeah.
They're,

537
00:35:44.131 --> 00:35:48.660
they're down there like,
you know,
hey,
here's a salute.
Let's do it.
All right.

538
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:51.270
Getting back to the book.
The way of comrades in arms,

539
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:55.410
comrades in arms that United in life and death for the imperial cause should

540
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:59.730
display full mutual trust should always endeavor to improve each other,

541
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:05.090
assist each other in distress and restrain each other against excesses in order

542
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.420
that they may joint fully fulfill their duties as soldiers.

543
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.020
It's all solid.
Hey,
we're going to trust each other.

544
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.630
We're in a worked always to improve each other.

545
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.650
We're going to help each other if we got a problem.
These are all fine.

546
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.120
All good to go.
Initiative.
Next.
Next section.

547
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.610
Initiative in exemplary conduct.

548
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.290
This is interesting because we're not just talking about an initiative because

549
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.580
initiative is good.
We want people to have initiative.

550
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.580
This initiative in exemplary conduct.

551
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.530
Leaders should be zealous in giving a worthy example in everything.

552
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.870
If there is disorder above those below will be unruly.

553
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.320
Action is prized on the field.

554
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.460
Leaders should provide an example by acting more courageously than others.

555
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.383
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

556
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Good.
I mean,
can't,
can't really argue with those.</v>

557
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.970
You got to have discipline.
You got to have order.

558
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.840
You got to set the example.
Can't,

559
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.790
can't argue with those next responsibility.
Duty is sacred.

560
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.363
<v 1>No</v>

561
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.750
<v 0>one's responsibility is extremely heavy.</v>

562
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:25.100
Each and every task must be performed with the utmost care until all a veal

563
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.510
available means are exhausted.

564
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.200
Those who have a strong sense of responsibility,
our bravest,

565
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.260
<v 1>okay.</v>

566
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.390
<v 0>Of the brave on the field.</v>

567
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.170
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.
Doody sacred.
You got responsible.</v>

569
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.470
You gotta be responsible.
You got to take care with doing your thing.

570
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.580
Can't really argue with that one.
Next one.

571
00:37:51.581 --> 00:37:56.260
View of life and death from the lofty spirit of self sacrificing service to the

572
00:37:56.261 --> 00:37:58.910
state must prevail in life and in death.

573
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.190
Do your duty with heart and soul regardless of life or death.

574
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.420
After exerting all your powers,
spiritually and physically,

575
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.580
calmly faced death,

576
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:14.610
rejoicing in the hope of living in the eternal cause for which you serve.

577
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.510
You see little kamikaze activity creeping in right there.

578
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.550
<v 0>Honor.
Next section.
Strong are those who have a keen sense of honor.</v>

580
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:33.150
Meet the expectations of your family and home community by making effort upon

581
00:38:33.371 --> 00:38:36.670
effort.
Always mindful of the honor of your name.

582
00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:43.070
If alive,
do not suffer the disgrace of becoming a prisoner.

583
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

584
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.263
<v 0>Being deaf.</v>

585
00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:50.090
Do not leave behind a name soiled by misdeeds.

586
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.360
No surrender.
I was reading some,

587
00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:57.270
and I forget the the facts off the top of my head,

588
00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:59.970
but the number of the number of Japanese

589
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:06.580
military that were taken prisoner was like this tiny number.

590
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.610
It was like,
I don't know,
30 40 50,000 something like that.

591
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:16.340
And I say it's a tiny number when you compare it to the amount of Germans and

592
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.530
[inaudible],
there was millions of Germans that were,
you know,

593
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.930
taken prisoner at one point or another.
And again,
don't quote me on the number,

594
00:39:23.931 --> 00:39:24.620
but it's,

595
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:29.620
the disparity is huge and this is why they were not going to be taken prisoner.

596
00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.693
<v 1>Okay,</v>

597
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:36.900
<v 0>next.
Simplicity and fortitude.
Hey,
of combat.</v>

598
00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:40.530
Keep things simple.
Fortitude.
Yes,
you got to have fortitude.
Here we go.

599
00:39:40.531 --> 00:39:43.530
Let simplicity guide your daily life on the battlefield.

600
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.980
Promote habits of fortitude and a high morale.

601
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.730
Can't argue with that.
Life on the field must be playing.
Consider privation,

602
00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:58.020
your daily lot in endeavor to be thrifty,
luxury,

603
00:39:58.021 --> 00:40:02.730
saps valor.
Oh,
I like that.
There you go.

604
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:05.880
Luxury saps valor.
Theo Vaughn,
are you listening?

605
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.380
Luxury can have those luxury days too often.

606
00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:16.140
This is this idea of simplicity of course important.
And even,
you know,

607
00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:20.190
I talk about simplicity from a,
you know,
from a,

608
00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.030
from a communications viewpoint and from a planning viewpoint.

609
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.040
But in life simplicity is a very positive thing.
You know,

610
00:40:29.041 --> 00:40:33.900
you've got the,
the modern day minimalist movement.
Are you familiar with that?

611
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:38.430
Yes.
Where you don't own anything.
Mm hmm.
Or as little as you can.
Yeah.

612
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.170
Though the cool,

613
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.200
one of the coolest things about going on deployment in the day aims Burger,

614
00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.730
one of the coolest things about it is you be,
everyone's a minimalist.

615
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.050
It's just you go on deployment,
you have like whatever,

616
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.910
five bags in in the bags,
you have three,
you know,

617
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.920
three pairs of pants,
two pairs of boots for tee shirts,

618
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.580
got your weapon,
got your body armor
like you're,
it's so awesome.

619
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.270
And it feels really good when you're able to get away from all that stuff that

620
00:41:20.841 --> 00:41:25.841
you got piling up back in your big house with the big closets and you got all

621
00:41:26.211 --> 00:41:29.240
that stuff in there and all that stuff weighs down on you.

622
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.700
So when you get to do,
you know Tony BTF where he used to joke about,
you know,

623
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:35.534
when you out,
like,

624
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.930
you know you got problems going on and meal at home and everyone's just like

625
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:43.420
bothering you and he's like,
get on a,
you just get on a c one 30 boom,

626
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.350
everything's fine.

627
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.920
And I agree with that.
You would get that feeling of everything's fine.

628
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.550
You're guest,
hey,
there's nothing.
All you have to worry about as the bad guys.

629
00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.890
Right,
right.
It's very easy.
It's very focused.

630
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.920
You don't have all this other stuff going on and you don't have all this other

631
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.190
literal stuff.
You just got what you need.

632
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.850
You don't break if you don't bring it,
if you don't need it,

633
00:42:07.851 --> 00:42:11.890
you don't bring it because you want this other stuff.
Yeah,
yeah.
Right.
So you,

634
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.650
you keep it,
keep it simple is what you keep it.

635
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:20.360
And that's what they're saying here.
And you know,
of course,

636
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.530
I doubt,
I doubt that the emperor was living,
you know,

637
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:28.910
a simple life of privation in the palace,
right?
No.

638
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.550
But if we can convince all the people,

639
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.300
if we can convince everyone that they should just be living like in the dirt,

640
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:40.220
cool.
More from me.
So there's a little bit of that going on.

641
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.430
Trying to keep the people with the positive mindset even though they don't have

642
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:47.000
anything telling them that you don't want anything cause it's going to SAP your

643
00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:50.150
valor.
You want to live it lead,
right?
Yeah.

644
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:52.400
Luxury saps valor.

645
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.060
True statement though.
True statement,
right?

646
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:03.690
What happens to rock and roll bands
there at valor gets up to me.

647
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.630
No,
they come out with a good album,
right?

648
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.990
Good hard album.
And everyone goes,
yes,
that's,
that's uh,
that's it.

649
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.110
Kick ass album.
And then the next thing you know,

650
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.880
they're living a life of luxury and their music gets soft and weak.
Yeah.

651
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.770
Maybe it's saps their valor saps their grit.

652
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.180
Next up.
Integrity.
Integrity is the foundation of the spirit of the warrior.

653
00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.550
How can a man who cannot conquer his worldly desires devote his life to the

654
00:43:34.551 --> 00:43:39.260
country,
be austere in your daily behavior?

655
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.500
Dealer deal with matters justly so that you will not be ashamed of your conduct

656
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.390
in the sight of God or man.

657
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

658
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.480
<v 0>Hey,
cool,
right act,
you know,</v>

659
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.530
keep control over your desires.
Got It.
Let that sounds like a good idea.

660
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:03.410
You know,
act in such a way that your debt,
people,
you know,
this goes back to the,

661
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:06.380
Hey,
imagine you're being at someone's video,
you at all times,

662
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.590
and then how do you really want to act the way?

663
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.800
If everyone was watching you all the time,
how would you act?

664
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:18.050
You want to make the right decisions so that you can stand up before other man

665
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:22.250
or God and be like,
Yep,
I'm,
my actions were fine.

666
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:23.870
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

667
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:28.490
<v 0>so that's what,
that's what this is saying.
Can we argue against that?
Not really.</v>

668
00:44:28.491 --> 00:44:31.620
What was interesting is you read some of those kamikaze letters.

669
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.160
<v 2>A lot of them specifically say</v>

670
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.110
there was no,
I have no,
I have no woman in my life.

671
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.340
They specifically say that like I've read a bunch of those letters.

672
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.120
I don't know how many but a lot.
And there's a decent percentage,
I don't know,

673
00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:51.840
maybe 10% which is a lot when you think about it.

674
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.840
But a lot of the letters in them who knows them,
the actual percentage.

675
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:56.970
But if you read some of those letters,
you'll see,

676
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
you'll see these young 18 1920 years olds bragging to their parents.

677
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.340
I have no female in my life.
Oh they say and then a positive story,

678
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.430
Paul,
the most positive possible way that I have.
No.
They'll say,
you know,

679
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:15.420
I have no need for money or women.
They say these things.

680
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.890
So they're actually telling their parents like I all I have is you.

681
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.001
Right.

682
00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:25.920
They're more looking to honor their parents than they are looking to have a

683
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:29.910
girlfriend.
Yeah.
Which to me is,

684
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.280
is really jacked up.
You know,

685
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.950
when you're 18 years old,
you have a girlfriend.
Sure.

686
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.230
Am I wrong?
You know,
to each their own,
I guess,
Bruh.
Come on.

687
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.390
You're 18 years old.
An 18 year old needs a girlfriend.
Yeah.

688
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.320
No,
not if he's like committed to the cause.
You know,

689
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.760
I always felt that like,
especially at 18 if you're committed to like,

690
00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.420
I don't know if it well again to each their own for sure.

691
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.600
But it is not uncommon for an 18 year old dedicated to,

692
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:09.300
uh,
what's the cause,
color,
whatever,

693
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.860
in whatever situations you need to get jammed up because they got some,
oh no,

694
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:17.850
that's true.
I'm not saying the girlfriend's won't won't jam you up.
Oh yeah,

695
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:22.560
they will.
So especially when you're 17,
16,
18,
14,
13,

696
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.370
1920,
24,
it evens out at about 30.
Let's fix,

697
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.470
that's where you get a grip.

698
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.830
That's where you get a grip probably because of yourself to be honest with you.

699
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:36.750
But what's 100% as yourself?
That's not the girl.
Yeah,
it's you,
but yes.

700
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:40.170
So the,
you know,
like,
uh,
I don't know.
He 18.

701
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.830
What did he do at 18 military?
I would imagine,
uh,

702
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.260
I know in football it was like that.
The girlfriend,
you know,

703
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:50.570
it's like getting in.
Okay.
But no girls whatsoever.
Are you talking like,
yeah.

704
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.990
Oh yeah.
Just an ins from girls.
I'm not saying actual ads.

705
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.380
Take it into the next level.
Echo Charles.
No,

706
00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.490
but I am saying if you're trying to demonstrate or illustrate the your loyalty

707
00:47:02.431 --> 00:47:07.410
to parents,
the cause,
whatever.
Yes.
You say like,
Bruh,
I don't even,

708
00:47:07.411 --> 00:47:10.710
girls don't even like,
you know,
waiver,

709
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.150
my dedication to the cause,
you know,
I get that.
I get that.

710
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.150
That's what this is saying.
Yes.
I'm just saying,

711
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:22.220
I don't think I necessarily agree with the 19 1820 year old male human having no

712
00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:30.430
female interaction.
Yeah.

713
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.010
To me that just sounds like not the best idea.
Well let's put it this way.

714
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.950
I agree with you,

715
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:44.710
but I agree with this because I feel like that's just what they're saying.

716
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.740
No,
definitely.
No,
I agree with you.
Yeah,
I agree with you.
It's,

717
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.020
and I think what hit me weird was the,

718
00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.800
the kamikaze pilots that are just like so happy that they don't have a

719
00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:57.634
girlfriend.
I'm thinking,

720
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.620
are you really that happy that you don't have a girlfriend?

721
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.960
And if you are that happy that you don't have a girlfriend,

722
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.360
they kept you in lockdown.
Right?
They kept you in a serious lockdown.
Yes.

723
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.210
Because do you remember?
I mean,
when you're a boy,

724
00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:16.720
when you're 10 years old,
when you're 11 years old,
12 years old,

725
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.810
like you already looking at girls like,
oh,
I want to hang out with that,

726
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:24.400
that thing right over there,
that girl,
I want to go like talk to that.
Right.

727
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.900
Talk to that thing.
You know what I'm saying?
Like it's a,
I know instinct.

728
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:34.000
Yes.
That is fully there as,
as a dude.
Right?

729
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:36.790
But at the most cases,
at that point,

730
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:41.500
I would argue that in most cases you're not consciously thinking of a
meaningful,

731
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.500
productive relationship necessarily.

732
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.610
You just have a sort of a feeling in a sort of like attraction or draw towards

733
00:48:48.611 --> 00:48:53.470
this thing and that attraction and draw towards this thing.
Yeah.

734
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:58.500
Yeah.
We'll get in the way.
Or at the very least come right.
I get you out.

735
00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:03.280
I'm saying I hear you.
Yes you gotta be.
And definitely if you're 17 years old,

736
00:49:03.281 --> 00:49:07.000
you gotta be careful that the girls don't pull you off track.
Yeah.

737
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.050
And by the way,
I'm saying this in one direction,
same thing,
opposite direction.

738
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:13.780
I guess I should've said that,
but wouldn't,
you know,

739
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.320
girls will get pulled off track by,
by boys.
Yes.
You know,

740
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.540
so I guess what we're talking about is getting the relationship going.
Yeah.

741
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.330
Okay.
I agree with you.
If you are fully committed to the cause,

742
00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:32.470
one thing that could fall away from your commitment would be,
look,
I'm not even,

743
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.920
I don't care about girls.
That's where I'm at.
Okay.
I get you.
I'll give it to you.

744
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.100
Actually,
you kind of have to because you were like that.

745
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.020
Even when you said when you were overseas,
you didn't like,
you know,

746
00:49:43.021 --> 00:49:46.090
you didn't want to think about your family,
you to where you want to do.
Right.

747
00:49:46.091 --> 00:49:51.091
So what would he even made it better technically in this specific way is to not

748
00:49:51.371 --> 00:49:53.400
even have a family,
not even to have a girlfriend,

749
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.710
not even the ultimate commitment.
Exactly.
Right.
So,
yeah.

750
00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.200
So that's what they're going to say,
you know?
Yeah.
No,
that's,

751
00:49:59.201 --> 00:50:04.090
that's the ultimate commitment.
You are correct.
I don't agree with it though.

752
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:09.580
Well,
ironically,
I don't agree with it.
If you're just,
well,
you,

753
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.320
so you see their point.
Yes,
sir.

754
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:14.140
And I see their point and that's why I kind of lived that way when I was

755
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:14.741
overseas.
Hey,

756
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:16.990
I don't want to look at pictures of my wife and kids while I'm here.

757
00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:18.400
I want to focus on the mission at hand.

758
00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.300
But that's a lot different than coming home and and saying,
oh,
I don't wanna.

759
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.040
I don't want to have any,
a female in my life.
Yeah.
It's a lot different.
Yeah.

760
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:28.100
Or if

761
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.590
<v 0>you're a female saying,
look,
I don't,
I know what's going to be focused on,</v>

762
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.150
I guess.
I guess that happens,
you know,
on the other way to,
yeah.

763
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.070
Fully you a female that's committed to her career,

764
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.480
so she doesn't want to have kids.

765
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:42.500
She doesn't want to get married because she's focused on the career.
Yeah.

766
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.020
Yeah.
Which is actually cool,
but it is an extreme way to way to get down.

767
00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.070
All right.
Well,

768
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:55.010
I don't believe there's any conduct that you need to be ashamed of if you have a

769
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:59.480
girlfriend is what I'm saying.
There you go.
All right.

770
00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.730
Chapter three,
counsel,
concerning field service,

771
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:10.670
a moments negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe.

772
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:15.530
Be Constantly on your guard.
Do not despise your enemy or the natives,

773
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:20.810
not be negligent after a small success.
Okay,
let's just go through somebody.
Okay,

774
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.760
so a moment's negligence negligence may result in an unexpected catastrophe.

775
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.410
That's a great point.
Pay Attention.
Be Constantly on your guard.

776
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:32.750
Great Point.
Pay Attention.

777
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:38.240
Do not despise your enemies or the natives.
Great Point,

778
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.721
right?

779
00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:42.920
We're going to go fight with honor and we're not going to abuse the natives.

780
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.290
Do not be negligent after a small success.
Great Point.

781
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.560
That's when you're going to get arrogant and your ego gets out of control and

782
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:56.120
you get caught.
No,
that carelessness brings disaster.

783
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:02.960
Great Point.
So there you go.
That's just opening up.
There's,

784
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:03.943
here's how we roll.

785
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.720
I wonder if this document was written like as a reaction to Nan King I if they

786
00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.760
had a little like,
oh we,
we let that happen,
we got to tighten up.

787
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:17.000
I wonder if they actually did that.
The U s military does that kind of thing.

788
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.600
Like something will go,
hey,
the prisoner abuse happened in,
in Abu Ghraib.

789
00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:23.060
They made all kinds of rules and regulations about what you do with prisoners

790
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:25.370
after that.
Yeah.
I wonder if this is the same kind of thing.

791
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.750
They tried to tighten them up.

792
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.170
Century duty is important upon the century.
Rest of the safety of an army.

793
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.380
He also represents the discipline of an army.

794
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.550
Those on century duty must devote their entire person to the task,

795
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:44.870
which must be sternly carried out.
Accord the century,

796
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.280
high respect.
Cool gotta be on guard.
Next,

797
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.840
ideological warfare is an important phase in modern conflict.

798
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.560
Destroy Propaganda and fabrications of the enemy by your unshakable faith in the

799
00:53:01.431 --> 00:53:06.431
cause for which the empire stance and endeavor to spread Codo which again,

800
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:10.280
that's the spirit of the empire.
So

801
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.230
they're telling you to watch out for the enemy propaganda and how you overcome

802
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:17.510
it is by having unshakable faith.

803
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.710
Next up.
Rumors arise from a lack of confidence.
Do not be misled,

804
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.850
not be agitated by them.

805
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:31.110
Firmly believe in the strength of the Imperial Army and deeply trust your

806
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:31.944
superiors.

807
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:34.283
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

808
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.630
<v 0>Deeply trust your superiors.
There is no be wise on the end of that.
And yeah,</v>

809
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.520
I notice like the American manual said,
said,
trust your spirits but be wise.

810
00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.320
Also rumors arise from a lack of confidence.

811
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.120
I disagree with that.

812
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.360
I think rumors are arise from lack of knowledge and lack of hearing the truth

813
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.220
because the way you overcome rumors is to tell people the truth.

814
00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:00.870
That's how you stop rumors.
Tell people the truth.
Ah,

815
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.190
not number six,
be mindful to protect enemy property and resources,

816
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:06.040
requisitions,

817
00:54:06.041 --> 00:54:09.750
seizures and destruction of goods and similar actions must be executed in

818
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:13.320
keeping with the regulations and always under the orders of your commanding

819
00:54:13.321 --> 00:54:17.790
officer.
This is incredible there literally saying,
Hey,
you know when you,

820
00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.260
when you defeat someone,
you've got enemy property.
You need to treat it well.

821
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:26.200
You can't seize it.
You can't destroy it.
There you go.
This is like guidance.
Mm

822
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.820
seven be gentle

823
00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.690
and protect innocent inhabitants in the spirit of benevolence,

824
00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.170
in accordance with the true ideal of the imperial army.

825
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.300
Like I said,

826
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:47.280
maybe this is a reaction to what happened in Nan king cause there was no being

827
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:51.450
gentle and no protecting the innocent there who was a complete opposite.

828
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.700
Number eight those on the field must not indulge in wine and women or allow

829
00:54:57.701 --> 00:55:02.701
desire to be cloud their consciences thereby damaging the prestige of the

830
00:55:03.581 --> 00:55:08.581
imperial army and causing the dissipation of a body dedicated to service.

831
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.880
So that one is written for Echo Charles.
Yeah.
No.

832
00:55:12.881 --> 00:55:16.630
Why no women does it just going to get,
it's going to jam you up.
They will

833
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.600
<v 1>concur.
Okay.</v>

834
00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:29.350
<v 0>They should exercise self control lest they per smirch the pure character of</v>

835
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:34.450
warriors.
Nine control your anger.

836
00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:38.140
Good to go and suppress your grudges.
The ancients said,

837
00:55:38.141 --> 00:55:39.670
consider anger your enemy.

838
00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:44.850
A moments of violence often leaves because for a long regret it's great advice.

839
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:48.970
Control your anger,
control of your emotions,

840
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.900
the severity of military laws designed to specialty to uphold the good name of

841
00:55:52.901 --> 00:55:55.480
soldiers and to preserve the dignity of the imperial army.

842
00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.800
Always remember the oath that you made and the deep emotion that you felt when

843
00:55:59.801 --> 00:56:00.634
you left home.

844
00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:01.620
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

845
00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.090
<v 0>call to mind how your parents,</v>

846
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:08.091
your wife and your children think of you and avoid exposing yourself to crime.

847
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.533
<v 1>Okay,</v>

848
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:11.603
<v 0>good guidance.</v>

849
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:13.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

850
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.010
<v 0>Two achievements.
Achievements of soldiers in service.</v>

851
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:20.370
Foster the tradition of respecting Marshall attainments,

852
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:25.510
cultivate and train the warriors of virtues and arts.
Remember that,

853
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.840
do not allow yourself to become board is the saying of an ancient general.

854
00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:39.340
So,
Hey,
look,
we're telling people to train,
train warrior arts,

855
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:43.300
train the virtues of the warriors.
This is all good stuff.

856
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.490
And,
and remembered that.
Two D don't allow yourself to become bored.

857
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:53.340
When's the last time you were bored?
I a time member?
Yes.
Yeah.

858
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.490
I'm not really one getting bored over here on my side either.
Next,

859
00:56:57.491 --> 00:57:01.390
do not allow yourself to worry about the fate of those at home in the event of

860
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:04.270
your death,
but devote yourself wholly to service.

861
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.180
Be always ready to meet death without regret.

862
00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:08.920
By settling your affairs beforehand,

863
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:14.240
a soldier is always prepared to expose his corpse on the battlefield.

864
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:15.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

865
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:19.910
<v 0>Let his family know that at times,
even his ashes may not reach them.</v>

866
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:23.190
So there's,
you know,
again,

867
00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:27.690
there's some kamikaze attitudes sneaking in there that you,

868
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.500
you may have to lay it all down next to the,

869
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:35.530
there is nothing more to be regretted than to fall victim to a disease on the

870
00:57:35.761 --> 00:57:36.594
field.

871
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.440
Be particularly mindful of your health so that you may not be unable to serve

872
00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.700
because of excesses.
So,
so you've got to keep track of your health.

873
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:52.020
Don't get sick.
Lay to heart.

874
00:57:52.021 --> 00:57:56.290
The saying of an ancient warrior.
My sword is my soul,
my horses,

875
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.173
my fortune.

876
00:57:57.810 --> 00:58:02.340
Always take care of your arms and supplies and give humane attention to animals

877
00:58:02.341 --> 00:58:04.830
on the field.
Solid.

878
00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:06.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

879
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.330
<v 0>Take care of your gear and your gear to take care of you.</v>

880
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:14.310
Have you ever heard that before?
Yes.
From me.
Okay Sir.
That's a good one.

881
00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:17.640
Yeah.
Seems good.
It's a true one.
Seems true.
Yeah.

882
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:23.430
Virtue in the battlezone is the source of strength in combat.

883
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:29.100
Always consider the interests of other units and do not monopolize billets and

884
00:58:29.101 --> 00:58:31.680
materials.
Remember the saying,

885
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:34.410
a bird taking flight does not muddy the water.

886
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:35.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

887
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:40.490
<v 0>Let the good reputation of the valorous imperial army long remain the cause of</v>

888
00:58:41.821 --> 00:58:45.480
fond recollections in an alien land.
So there you go.

889
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.070
They're telling everyone to,
you know,
have it be virtuous in the,

890
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:51.150
in the combat zone.

891
00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.780
Bird in flight does not muddy the water.

892
00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:02.120
I think it just means as you elevate,
then you're not,
you know,

893
00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.670
you don't need to get mad because it's not muddying the water.
It's good.

894
00:59:04.671 --> 00:59:07.970
You're moving forward.
Yeah.
Could be wrong.

895
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:12.920
Very obscure.
A bird taking flight does not muddy the water.

896
00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.170
Let the good reputation

897
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:22.030
of the valorous imperial army long remain the cause of recollections and alien.

898
00:59:22.421 --> 00:59:25.790
The land.
Yeah.
I think that's what it means.
Like,
Hey,
this is where elevated,

899
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:28.520
where,
hey,
we're in this land.
We're here,
we invaded,

900
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.850
but we're not going to muddy the water.
We're,
we're in flight.

901
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.960
Next.
Do not boast of one one's achievements,

902
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.390
but give others credit.

903
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:45.100
But to give others credit is one of the most respected traditions among
warriors.

904
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:48.280
Hmm.
This is straight out of extreme ownership.

905
00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:52.430
Straight out of the dichotomy of leadership.
No,
you don't.

906
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:55.610
You don't boast of achievements.
You give your credit to your team.

907
00:59:55.611 --> 01:00:00.230
Do not begrudge others their promotion or cherish resentment because your

908
01:00:00.231 --> 01:00:03.980
services are not recognized,
but instead reflect upon your own shortcomings.

909
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.990
This is,
this is solid.
That's solid advice,
right?
Oh,

910
01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:13.400
you got promoted.
I didn't.
I'm just going to get mad at you.
No.

911
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:15.140
Instead I should look at myself and say,
okay,

912
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:17.180
what did that go do that I didn't do?
What could I do better?

913
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.380
What am I shortcomings?
Yeah.

914
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:20.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

915
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.710
<v 0>Next,
be honest.</v>

916
01:00:22.711 --> 01:00:27.150
Always consider exaggerations in lies dishonorable.

917
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.260
Cool.
Where,

918
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:33.030
where 100% on board with that always bear yourself as a member of a great
nation.

919
01:00:33.031 --> 01:00:36.810
Treading the path of righteousness and seeking justice so that you may enhance

920
01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:38.730
the prestige of the empire.

921
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.170
Totally positive date in the seal teams for a little while.
They were trying to,

922
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:51.200
it was,
uh,
it was something along the lines of I will not dishonor my team,

923
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:54.050
my unit,
my navy,
or my nation.

924
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.800
This is the same exact thing they've got written right there.
You know,

925
01:00:57.801 --> 01:01:01.670
you wanna you wanna make the,
the empire look good.

926
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.980
You want to damage the,
the,

927
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:05.130
<v 1>yeah.</v>

928
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:09.710
<v 0>Reputation.
Next.</v>

929
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:17.090
Also do not show a lack of consideration for international courtesies.

930
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

931
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:23.960
<v 0>And finger about that.
Yeah.
Hey,
when you go to another country,
Hey,
don't,
don't,</v>

932
01:01:23.961 --> 01:01:27.500
uh,
you know,
take in consideration there their customs and courtesies.

933
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.810
That's a good thing to do.
And the last one for this section,

934
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:38.220
should you receive the order to return home alive after briefing 10,000 deaths?

935
01:01:38.221 --> 01:01:40.830
Think of those brave souls who will not return.

936
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:42.680
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

937
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.680
<v 0>be determined to become an example to the people by being careful in word and</v>

938
01:01:48.501 --> 01:01:51.710
deed,
renewing your vows to serve the country.

939
01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:00.870
Nothing wrong with that.
And then this is how this thing ends.

940
01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:02.693
The conclusion,

941
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.600
the conclusion is above all the above originate from an n in the imperial

942
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.213
rescript

943
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.060
let them serve as a guide in putting into practice this battlefield morality.

944
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:22.920
So that all may be perfect in obeying the imperial commands,

945
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.170
soldiers and officers on the field,

946
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:28.140
lay heart later heart,

947
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:33.141
the import of the above by fully realizing the significance of real service to

948
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:39.240
the state in order that you may carry out your duty as soldiers,

949
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:44.630
thus responding to the boundless imperial benevolence.

950
01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.053
Okay,

951
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.930
so like I said,
there's

952
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:58.490
parts of that document that you can't really argue with and it's a powerful

953
01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:02.490
document.
It's a powerful code.
And that document

954
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:07.830
obviously helped guide the actions of

955
01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:09.610
<v 1>yeah.</v>

956
01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:13.930
<v 0>Of the,
of the military in Japan and of the nation of Japan.</v>

957
01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:20.500
Who were
highly committed to this cause.

958
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

959
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.400
<v 0>Completely committed to this cause.
Got One more letter from a kamikaze.</v>

960
01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

961
01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:32.800
<v 0>Dear mother and father.</v>

962
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.310
Now what has been decided that I will participate in a sorority as a member of

963
01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:38.830
the kamikaze special attack core squadron.

964
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.590
I am deeply satisfied that nothing will surpass this as the long cherished

965
01:03:44.591 --> 01:03:49.250
desire of a military man to die in attacking an enemy ship together with his

966
01:03:49.251 --> 01:03:50.084
aircraft.

967
01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.530
When I think of my 23 years of life,

968
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.330
I've not been able to repay anything for your kindness.
However,
with a smile,

969
01:03:59.331 --> 01:04:04.130
please forgive me from the beginning I offered myself for the country.

970
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:05.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

971
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.690
<v 0>The war is plunging into an increasingly critical period,</v>

972
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.510
but I believe

973
01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:12.620
<v 1>okay.</v>

974
01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.000
<v 0>In victory for the empire,</v>

975
01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:18.410
I believe others will follow after me smiling.

976
01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.430
I will make a body crashing attack against an enemy ship.

977
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.010
I am resolved that I will repay a tense,

978
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.550
a 10 thousandths of the emperor's kindness.

979
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:34.210
I have not been as thankful as today to be born a Japanese person.

980
01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:35.940
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

981
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:40.440
<v 0>I lie.
Humble subject.
Live not in vain.</v>

982
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:45.770
Having seen both heaven and earth prosper in this glorious age of vine.

983
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:50.190
This is an old poem and it is my state of mind.

984
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

985
01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.380
<v 0>Please give regards to my teachers at elementary school,</v>

986
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.110
junior high school and teachers.

987
01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:57.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

988
01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.560
<v 0>In College,
all of the relatives and the villagers.
Finally,</v>

989
01:05:02.561 --> 01:05:05.800
I am praying for the welfare of everyone in the family.
Bravely.

990
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.340
I will fall knowing the way of Samurai

991
01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:13.590
for the emperor who gave blessings,

992
01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.260
naval ensign,

993
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.970
<v 1>Schangiel Duh.</v>

994
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:28.450
<v 0>And at 1245 on April 6th,</v>

995
01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.180
1945 and [inaudible] took off from crew Shira airbase

996
01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:42.070
and carried out his suicide attack off the coast of Okinawa.

997
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:47.763
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

998
01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:51.030
<v 0>And when you hear this code</v>

999
01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:56.000
and when you hear these letters,
you have to think to yourself

1000
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:02.410
who could,
who could defeat

1001
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:04.210
<v 1>okay.</v>

1002
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.830
<v 0>On the enemy.
That is,
that determined what,</v>

1003
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:12.490
what a warrior culture could have the values and the courage to contend with and

1004
01:06:14.331 --> 01:06:16.580
to actually defeat,
uh,

1005
01:06:16.581 --> 01:06:21.581
people possessed with such willingness to make sacrifices,

1006
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:30.640
such a willingness to die for their cause.
That's what you have to ask yourself.

1007
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:31.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1008
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:36.650
<v 0>That's what I ask myself is what,
what people could oppose.</v>

1009
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1010
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.300
<v 0>And fight against this,
this warrior breed.</v>

1011
01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.360
And the answer to that question,
and this isn't,

1012
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:52.950
this isn't a theoretical answer,
but it's it,
it's a factual answer.

1013
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:59.090
The warrior culture that faced and defeated this fanatic society

1014
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:03.630
was he United States of America,

1015
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.040
and it was our own hardened to breed of warriors from the army,

1016
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.850
Navy,
air force,
and Marines,

1017
01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:18.540
the American warrior culture.

1018
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:20.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1019
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:25.460
<v 0>The American warrior culture is what went from island to island and beachhead to</v>

1020
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.580
beachhead and pillbox box to pillbox fighting and sacrificing

1021
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.900
not only with a willingness to die,
which they certainly had,

1022
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.740
but with a stronger willingness

1023
01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:49.493
to live,

1024
01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.333
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1025
01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:59.090
<v 0>To live and not to live a life of subservience and obedience,</v>

1026
01:07:59.611 --> 01:08:04.500
but a life of something much more powerful than all of that.

1027
01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.230
A life of freedom

1028
01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.300
and that culture,

1029
01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:21.780
that American culture of individual freedom has proven out to be the most

1030
01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:24.880
powerful force in the world

1031
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.230
and for us to be able to protect that freedom.

1032
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:38.000
What we do is we voluntarily impose discipline on ourselves

1033
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.900
and we have the things that this book talked about.
We have,

1034
01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:47.470
we have conviction to win,
we believe in loyalty.
And responsibility.

1035
01:08:47.471 --> 01:08:51.790
We live with honor and valor and we work together to protect each other,

1036
01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.570
but we don't do that because we're mandated to do that.

1037
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.560
We do it so we can defend our way of life.

1038
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.900
We make sacrifices to preserve our culture because our way of life offer

1039
01:09:14.971 --> 01:09:15.804
something,

1040
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:23.200
something that is the apex of human existence,

1041
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.213
freedom,

1042
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.860
life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1043
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.040
But that's why we fight

1044
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:48.780
and that's why we win.
We don't fight for glory.

1045
01:09:48.781 --> 01:09:50.400
We don't fight for personal gain.

1046
01:09:50.401 --> 01:09:53.820
We don't fight to impose our will on to others,

1047
01:09:53.821 --> 01:09:56.430
but we fight for freedom,

1048
01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:04.380
freedom itself.
That is our ideal.

1049
01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.950
That is our standard

1050
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:15.270
and we will never ever surrender that ideal.

1051
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.190
The ideal of freedom.

1052
01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:30.070
Freedom is our code

1053
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:42.390
and I think that's all I've got for
tonight.

1054
01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.440
Echo Charles.
Yeah,
it's good.

1055
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.240
We are trying to maintain our freedom.
Yes.

1056
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:54.840
In order to do that,
we all know that we have to,
you know,

1057
01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.060
impose some discipline on ourselves.
Yes sir.

1058
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.120
That means putting in the work yes.

1059
01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:06.990
Means trying to get better.
Sure.

1060
01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:12.860
I know you've got some things that might help us as we head down that path.
Yeah,

1061
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:13.883
very much so.

1062
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.500
<v 2>But the,
the imperial,</v>

1063
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:24.950
the emperor kind of seems like that's the part that kind of jammed everything

1064
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:27.480
up.
Like this whole code,
like the whole,

1065
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.250
what does this manual called perial.
Rescript yeah.

1066
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:35.860
For soldiers and sailors.
Yeah.
It's,
it's like,
man,
this is all good.

1067
01:11:35.861 --> 01:11:39.390
This is all good.
And to except that one spot where they were like,
yeah,

1068
01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:42.700
the emperor is like a line of p kind of as if to say,
okay and,

1069
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.100
but at the end of the day,

1070
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:49.050
like you got to listen to this like one kid where as at the end of the day,

1071
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:55.260
what we do is individual freedom.
You ain't for nobody else.
Yeah.

1072
01:11:55.350 --> 01:12:00.270
Like we were collectively protecting this freedom that we have and we do that

1073
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:05.130
together.
But once we have that freedom,
it's not about,
for someone else,
it's for,

1074
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.430
it's for the individual.
It's for life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1075
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.890
That's what we're doing over here.
That's what the,

1076
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.400
that's what Western culture is about.

1077
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.690
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And</v>

1078
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.130
<v 2>you know,
the fact that you have all this code written and everything,
right.</v>

1079
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.770
You have these people raised the boost cheeto mindset and all that.

1080
01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:27.340
But like the marines are going onto the beach at Guadalcanal.

1081
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.580
<v 0>Yeah.
That's what's going to happen.
Yeah.
And,
and,</v>

1082
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:36.360
and going into a four to five island,

1083
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.750
you're at a complete disadvantage.
Don't,
don't,

1084
01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.120
don't let anyone forget that.
Yeah.
When you're going against,

1085
01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:46.920
when you're on the office against a defensive position,

1086
01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:51.600
you are at a complete disadvantage.
That's the way it is.
Yeah.

1087
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:56.670
And
so,
so this,

1088
01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.040
this warrior culture that sometimes we put up on a pedestal because it sounds

1089
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.903
cool.

1090
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.000
It sounds cool to be imperial rescripts sounds cool when you put this code out.

1091
01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:13.890
Right.
But what you,
what you just said is correct.

1092
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:19.340
When that code is not based and not the foundation of it isn't freedom

1093
01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.240
<v 2>doesn't turn out good.
Yeah.
And it's essentially like,</v>

1094
01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:33.550
it sounds cool because you know how you,
it Kinda ties into it where you,
okay,

1095
01:13:33.551 --> 01:13:37.830
so does millennials' freedom,
we'll say,
right.
We'll start with that discipline.

1096
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:42.190
Sounds cool.
Yep.
And equals freedom.
That whole thing sounds cool.
Whatever.

1097
01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:45.400
So this Bushido thing kind of just seems like just the discipline part.

1098
01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.610
So of course that part of it sounds cool,
but when you look at big picture,

1099
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.080
you know how not cool that is like especially like to have to bow down to like

1100
01:13:53.081 --> 01:13:57.700
some group of people.
That's the way it is.
Family,
you know?
Yeah.

1101
01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.300
So you step back,
you look at that,
you're like,
man,
this isn't cool.
Actually.

1102
01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:04.280
This is like kind of bad.
Especially when you get,
um,

1103
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:10.390
corruption for sure.
Which is kind of,
this is one of the,
I forget the same,

1104
01:14:10.391 --> 01:14:15.010
but it's like absolute power is absolute absolute power corrupts.
Absolutely.

1105
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.620
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the men,
so you kind of consider that.
And that's a,

1106
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.880
that's a big picture thing too,
cause he no one knows come out.
I mean,

1107
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.790
I wasn't saying no one comes out of the gate corrupt,
but that's not true either.

1108
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:28.210
But when you can have something like this where it's like,
hey,
the emperor there,

1109
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:32.470
you know,
they're benevolent,
they're defined,
you know,
all this stuff or whatever.

1110
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:36.520
And it's like,
yeah,
okay,
that sounds cool.
But man,
after a while,
big picture,

1111
01:14:36.521 --> 01:14:40.000
you're like,
God damn well you're not divine.
You're just a person.

1112
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:43.180
And the whole absolute power corrupts absolutely is like,

1113
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:45.190
that's a very high likelihood and all this stuff.

1114
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:50.170
So given that that they can just say whatever they want,
they can be like,
hey,

1115
01:14:50.171 --> 01:14:54.110
I don't care.
18 year old kid out of high school or whatever,
Oh yeah,
we need,

1116
01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:56.620
we need to use you as a bullet.
That's really what they're doing.

1117
01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:59.110
Especially like the numbers,
the numbers are like,
Bro,

1118
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:04.060
you killed one Japanese person for like every one point something other person

1119
01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:04.810
like enemy.

1120
01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:09.280
So it was like bow two bullets are worth more than you really in a way,
you know?

1121
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:14.110
And some like person can just sort of make that determination with your whole

1122
01:15:14.111 --> 01:15:17.350
life Brown and oh man,
that doesn't sound good.
Yeah.

1123
01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.840
<v 0>In this,
that's why this whole,
this whole thing,
this,</v>

1124
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:26.090
it just boils down to,
it just boils down to,
and it's such an overused word,
man.

1125
01:15:26.091 --> 01:15:29.750
It boils down to freedom.
That's what it boils down to.
Yeah.

1126
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:35.110
Like when you are a man and you're from Iowa and you're in the marine corps and

1127
01:15:37.281 --> 01:15:41.840
you're going onto that beach,
your wheel as a free man

1128
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:48.430
is stronger than the will of this guy over on the other side that is not truly

1129
01:15:51.231 --> 01:15:55.940
free.
Yeah.
And that,
that right there,
that's the,
that's the,

1130
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:59.330
that's the crazy thing about this is you can take this,

1131
01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:04.390
this entire warrior culture where these people are born and raised and taught

1132
01:16:06.141 --> 01:16:10.400
this and you seem,
uh,
you know,
there's,

1133
01:16:10.401 --> 01:16:13.610
there's training videos for the kamikaze,
but even just the,

1134
01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:18.170
just the militant life that these,
the militaristic life that they led.

1135
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:24.250
And meanwhile you take someone that was a shoe cobbler and Boston and you take

1136
01:16:25.131 --> 01:16:30.131
another guy that was a farmer in Iowa and you take another guy that worked on

1137
01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:35.291
the railroad in California and you put them together in a foxhole and their will

1138
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:39.920
to fight as free men.

1139
01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.830
He's stronger than someone that was raised since birth to be a warrior

1140
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:48.940
freedom and the,

1141
01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:53.941
the individual human will to do what you want to do with your life as such is

1142
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:59.720
the most powerful force.
And it gets left,
it gets left behind.

1143
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.930
And if you leave it behind,
you might win for a little while,

1144
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.310
but you're not going to win in the long run.
And that's the,

1145
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.640
that's the force.
If you that to a personal level,

1146
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:16.510
that's the force that you can use to drive discipline in your life because you

1147
01:17:18.261 --> 01:17:21.970
want you,
you don't impose discipline on yourself for,

1148
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.670
for the sake of discipline.
Yeah.
That's going to be,
you can,
you can do that.

1149
01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.880
You can do that today.
You can do that tomorrow.
You can do that next week,

1150
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:33.980
but you can't do that for two years,
three years.

1151
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:35.270
You need,

1152
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:40.270
it needs to be the foundation of the discipline needs to be the desire for

1153
01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:42.074
freedom.

1154
01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:43.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1155
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:47.930
<v 0>That's what it has to be rooted in.
At least that's for me.
For me,</v>

1156
01:17:47.931 --> 01:17:51.470
that's what it's rooted in.
Yeah.
And like,
okay,

1157
01:17:51.471 --> 01:17:54.920
discipline for the sake of discipline.
That sounds cool.
Yeah.
Right.

1158
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:58.760
Sounds awesome.
Dig into it a little bit,
right.

1159
01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.640
Not Be digging into it a little bit.
And what do you find?

1160
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:04.220
It's gotta be disciplined for freedom

1161
01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:09.460
and it,
and it's,
it's functional on the battlefield

1162
01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:11.963
<v 1>and</v>

1163
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:15.270
<v 0>it's functional in your life.</v>

1164
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1165
01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:20.310
<v 0>You know,
it's the same thing with the same thing with the Nazis.</v>

1166
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.310
The Nazis were a Marshall,

1167
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:28.710
a martial culture,
you know,
that's what they were,

1168
01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:32.310
but they were subservient to the fear.

1169
01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.670
And guess what happens when you take,

1170
01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:39.990
guess what happens when you take a kid from North Carolina

1171
01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:46.180
and you take another kid from Florida and you take another kid from Tennessee

1172
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:51.010
and you take those kids,
they're not professional soldiers.

1173
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.690
They're going to go to bootcamp.

1174
01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.970
They're going to get trained in whatever they're going to get trained in.

1175
01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:59.560
They're not ready.
They're not Hitler.
Youth raised to fight.

1176
01:18:59.561 --> 01:19:00.400
You ever seen little,

1177
01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:03.700
little Hitler youth training with weapons when they're 12 years old?

1178
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:07.270
Like meanwhile this kid was in Tennessee working on a farm.

1179
01:19:07.271 --> 01:19:11.500
This other kid was in Brooklyn working in a pizza shop,
working in a restaurant,

1180
01:19:11.501 --> 01:19:13.000
whatever.
Hmm.

1181
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.600
So you take these folks that are fighting for the fewer,

1182
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.380
you put them up against someone that's a group of people that are fighting for

1183
01:19:24.381 --> 01:19:28.890
freedom
and freedom is going to win.

1184
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:36.150
Thank you.
Are Right about,
yeah,
it's interesting.
Yeah.

1185
01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:42.210
Like the freedom to do Jujitsu by the way,
and the freedom to get any kind of,

1186
01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:45.560
gee you want,
but you're going to get the best gifts.

1187
01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:47.880
Almost qualified as a rough transition as well.

1188
01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.770
I'm just saying that's the first thing that came to mind at that point when you

1189
01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:56.720
said that.
Nonetheless.
Anyway,
we're on the path.
Yes.
Discipline.

1190
01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:00.930
The Path is the path of discipline that ends in not ends in,

1191
01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:04.920
but results in freedom.
Yeah.
So on this path,

1192
01:20:04.921 --> 01:20:09.420
many activities,
many things to do and to not do.

1193
01:20:09.421 --> 01:20:10.620
By the way,
you know what,

1194
01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.330
what you were talking about earlier with like the salute thing.

1195
01:20:13.930 --> 01:20:15.450
Look at that for a second.
Right?

1196
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:20.820
If I'm a guy that's like,
has an attitude local,

1197
01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:24.850
not saluting anyone.
Yeah.
I'm,

1198
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:26.760
I'm not disciplining myself.
Well guess what?

1199
01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:28.980
The night I'm not gonna do anything in the military.

1200
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.210
I'm going to get kicked out of the military.

1201
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:33.960
Actually I'm going to lose the freedom to serve.
Yeah.
Whereas if you,

1202
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.190
if you discipline yourself like,
Hey,

1203
01:20:35.191 --> 01:20:37.380
I'm going to show respect to the people that are above me,
the chain of command,

1204
01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:41.540
yeah,
I'm going to do a good job.
Yeah.
I'm going to discipline myself.
Yeah.

1205
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:46.020
Guess what?
It's ridiculous.
This is going to sound so ridiculous.

1206
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.800
For the most part.

1207
01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.370
I can pretty much do whatever I wanted to when I was in the military.

1208
01:20:53.730 --> 01:20:57.090
As crazy as that sounds,
as crazy as that sounds,

1209
01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.080
my bosses always gave me what I wanted my,

1210
01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:06.270
I could just kind of do,
do what I wanted to do.
It was crazy.

1211
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:07.591
It was crazy.

1212
01:21:07.591 --> 01:21:12.390
When I look back on it now and in my bosses would give me what I want and help

1213
01:21:12.391 --> 01:21:13.950
me and support me.
Why did they do that?

1214
01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:16.530
They didn't do it because I was manipulating what they did it because I was

1215
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:20.370
working hard and supporting what they wanted to get done and it's like a

1216
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:25.350
positive thing.
It's not negative at all.
It's like it was awesome.
But if you,

1217
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:29.730
and if you have that attitude in life like,
Hey,
I'm gonna work hard.
I'm gonna,

1218
01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.310
I'm gonna Discipline Myself.

1219
01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:33.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1220
01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.210
<v 0>I'm going to submit in situations that require it.</v>

1221
01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:43.720
I'm going to subordinate my ego in situations that require it now so that in the

1222
01:21:45.051 --> 01:21:47.810
long run I can get the freedom.

1223
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:49.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1224
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:53.730
<v 0>So often people,
they don't want to,
they want the freedom.
Right now you have,</v>

1225
01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:58.370
freedom isn't going to come right now.
Don't get it.
Yeah.
You have to work for it.

1226
01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.860
You have to fight for it.

1227
01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.700
You have to impose discipline on your life so that you can end up with it.

1228
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:08.960
You have to work hard.
You know,

1229
01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:13.070
you have to work hard to get to a point when you get the freedom.

1230
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:15.200
But if you don't work hard,

1231
01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:16.870
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1232
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:19.000
<v 0>Do you want to end up with it?
You just won't.</v>

1233
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.270
You'll always end up being a slave to,

1234
01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:26.350
to your paycheck.
You'll be a slave to your,

1235
01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:28.930
you're jacked up friends.

1236
01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.280
You'll be a slave to the manipulative partner you chose.

1237
01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:37.630
You know,
you,
you'll be a slave if you don't put discipline in your world,

1238
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.710
be slave,
did drugs,
he'd be a slave to drugs.
You'd be a slave to alcoholic,

1239
01:22:41.711 --> 01:22:44.080
can be a slave to food.
You can be a slave to doctors.
Yeah.

1240
01:22:44.081 --> 01:22:48.470
You can be slave to all these things.
Yeah.
So

1241
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:52.670
it's just,
you gotta think about freedom.

1242
01:22:52.671 --> 01:22:55.430
You've got to have that in the back of your mind,
but you can't,

1243
01:22:55.730 --> 01:23:00.440
you can't live your life thinking that it's going to be given to you.
Oh No.

1244
01:23:00.441 --> 01:23:03.380
It's not.
Freedom isn't free,
as they say,
is this,

1245
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.250
freedom isn't free in a country.

1246
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:11.680
<v 2>And freedom certainly isn't free in your own personal life.
It's not free.
Oh No.</v>

1247
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.410
Yeah.
Like we,

1248
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:17.650
and we talked about this early on where you're going to have to pay the price,

1249
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.260
you know?
Yeah.
When,
you know,
pay now,
pay later,
whatever you say.
So the,

1250
01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.320
the whole pain now,
I think that's the way to go.

1251
01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.420
Paying now is definitely the way to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1252
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:33.090
You always get a pay and it's a constant thing and that,

1253
01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:36.720
that parking kind of be intimidating,
you know,
where it's like,
like let's say,

1254
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.380
you know,
Bill,
the real obvious ones like eating correctly and exercising,

1255
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.500
right?
Like that's what's good about those as they,

1256
01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:48.640
the physical activities that have physical,

1257
01:23:48.641 --> 01:23:52.870
visible manifestations,
right.
If you eat like crap,

1258
01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:54.850
you're gonna feel like crap.
You're going to look like crap.

1259
01:23:54.851 --> 01:23:59.470
You're going to perform my crop.
Yeah.
If you are inactive,

1260
01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:04.660
are going to move like crap,
you're going to be sick.
So yeah,

1261
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:08.290
those are real clear.
Yeah.
Examples.

1262
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.670
So it's like so clear where you can be like,
okay,
I'm going to paint now,
right?

1263
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.340
How am I going to pay now and what price am I going to pay now?

1264
01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.480
And that's with like,
yeah.

1265
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:20.460
Not eating things that you're so physically compelled to you.

1266
01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:24.580
Um,
for the most part,
uh,
exercising,

1267
01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:28.540
which can be a pain literally.
And so,
you know,
no one,

1268
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:32.620
most of the time you don't like want to exit.

1269
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:36.640
Like that's not a natural thing,
I think to like,
I would say that's true.

1270
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.110
I would say actually,
you're right.

1271
01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.620
I would say that you're right to the point where a normal human being is

1272
01:24:41.621 --> 01:24:44.590
genetically programmed.
If they can conserve energy,

1273
01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.280
then you want to conserve energy because otherwise if you didn't have that

1274
01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:51.490
instinct,
you waste all your energy as a caveman and you would die.
Right.

1275
01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:55.660
Because you'd starve to death.
So No,
I think we're genetically programmed to,

1276
01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:01.170
to lean towards less activity on energy conservation is what we're probably

1277
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:07.170
genetically programmed to do.
Yeah,
yeah.
Genetic.

1278
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.210
I'd get it if you're sitting in an office all day and the new moon,
okay,

1279
01:25:10.211 --> 01:25:13.410
we'd go for a run tonight.
Yeah,
of course.
He didn't sit in an office all day,
so,

1280
01:25:13.411 --> 01:25:17.740
you know,
so there's gotta be some instinct to do that as well.
But yeah.

1281
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:18.850
But most of time to,

1282
01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.970
if you're going to go for a run or go lift or something like you're already

1283
01:25:21.971 --> 01:25:26.230
familiar with,
like the payoff of that,
you know,
no one,
I mean,

1284
01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:30.520
it's pretty rare.
Maybe if you want to go play,
play in the pool or something,

1285
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:32.320
I guess.
But that's different.

1286
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:35.770
Like no one's just genetically yearning to go.

1287
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:40.120
Do metcon or something or run like a marathon or something like that.
Well,

1288
01:25:40.121 --> 01:25:43.150
that's why I kind of threw that out there a little bit because sometimes if you,

1289
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.220
for me,
yeah,
like some of those are,
you know,
but,
but for real,
right.

1290
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:50.980
Let's say you,
let's say you couldn't work out for two days.

1291
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.620
Do you have like a little like thing that smacking would get?
They're jerks too.

1292
01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:58.180
Oh yeah.
Big Time.
But then so there's,
right,

1293
01:25:58.181 --> 01:26:01.570
but that's for someone who are you connecting that to off.
Okay,
I got it.

1294
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:04.280
And it's like,
and it through,
and we talked about this too,

1295
01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:08.030
where that's kind of a good [inaudible] don't you just like to just go get some

1296
01:26:08.031 --> 01:26:11.130
though?
Yes.
Only for the payoff.
So I'm not as,

1297
01:26:11.131 --> 01:26:13.460
I like to get some just to get signed.
No,
because you're you,

1298
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.410
and that's like a lousy,

1299
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:21.700
like it was gonna say that that's like one of the benefits of work and this

1300
01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:23.150
dude,
we're just talking about working out.

1301
01:26:23.150 --> 01:26:26.900
But this goes for kind of everything where if you familiarize yourself over the

1302
01:26:26.901 --> 01:26:30.610
years of the payoff,
like your body kind of accommodates that.
Make your buddies.

1303
01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.630
Like if you don't,
you get endorphins and you get addicted to it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1304
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.150
And that becomes Holly.
Yeah.
That'd becomes how you work.
So,
but let's say like,

1305
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.520
okay,
let's say I'm,
I don't know,
35 years old will say,

1306
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.750
I've never really worked out ever.
Right.

1307
01:26:42.751 --> 01:26:45.260
It just live a normal life for what I had just never really worked out in every

1308
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:47.710
like lifted weights,
never went for runs.

1309
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.120
You'll have less of a desire than someone that's been worried about their whole

1310
01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:53.930
life.
Trey,
go workout for the first time.
A hard one.
Do want to Jockos workouts.

1311
01:26:54.010 --> 01:26:56.600
And you'd be like,
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

1312
01:26:56.930 --> 01:27:00.080
You're going to be thinking about while you're doing it and the next day when

1313
01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.840
you're all so you can be late.
But I don't want to do that ever again actually.

1314
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:06.260
So it's different.
But if you're you or someone who's like,

1315
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.600
you know an athlete all their life or something like that.

1316
01:27:08.601 --> 01:27:11.300
Someone who who reap the benefits,

1317
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:15.350
they know they're familiar with with the payoff.

1318
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.210
Yes.
When you don't work out for one day,
two days,

1319
01:27:20.211 --> 01:27:22.700
well you know however many days.
Yeah,
you're going to be like,

1320
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:27.170
your body is going to be like,
hey,
like we need that workout now kind of thing.

1321
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.940
For short term,
short term payoff,
we need that workout.
So the,
again,

1322
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:35.450
the benefit of getting into working on a regular basis,

1323
01:27:35.451 --> 01:27:37.280
you get short term and longterm path

1324
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:43.560
and that's what our path is by the way.
Anyway,
same thing for Jujitsu.

1325
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.570
It's a big one.
If you take off,

1326
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.850
do you did like you've been out of Jujitsu for a little bit cause you're,

1327
01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.510
you're hurting right now eating it.
Yeah man.
Yeah.
You're,

1328
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.580
I just walked out to the gym.
I kind of looked at maths.
I got all excited.
Right.

1329
01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:59.400
Yeah.
You should be back.
I'll be back in a week.
All right.
Back on there.

1330
01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.430
Well no,
sorry,
two weeks.
I'll be back on the maths of pop.
Just this boom.

1331
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:06.280
There it is.
So while you're doing,
just if you haven't started,
you too,

1332
01:28:06.330 --> 01:28:10.920
if you haven't like,
cause you know there's a number of people who are like,
Hey,

1333
01:28:10.921 --> 01:28:13.470
I hear all the things I'm on the fence.
You know,

1334
01:28:13.471 --> 01:28:15.480
they just haven't made the plunge.

1335
01:28:15.481 --> 01:28:19.230
They haven't taken the step to even just try it.
Because usually places you go,

1336
01:28:19.231 --> 01:28:22.590
they'll give you it's free.
Try for free.
Free.
Yeah.
That's,

1337
01:28:22.591 --> 01:28:26.610
which tells you that you did see is good because they don't say,
hey,

1338
01:28:26.611 --> 01:28:30.120
try this for free.
They don't try and get your money.
Oh yeah.
Come on in.

1339
01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.750
It's like giving away free crack at the school yard,

1340
01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:36.060
but it's the good kind know reacts.
It's cracked.

1341
01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:40.740
That makes you like a better human being.
That's basically what Jujitsu is.
Yes.

1342
01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.630
It's like,
uh,
it's like,
uh,
an addictive drug that makes you better,
stronger,

1343
01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:49.140
smarter,
faster,
more calm,
more patient.

1344
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:54.450
Just a better person here.
Brings more to your perspective,
that's for sure.

1345
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:57.960
Opens up your perspective big time.
Yeah.
So there's people,

1346
01:28:57.990 --> 01:29:02.460
if what you're saying is correct and there's someone right now on the fence,

1347
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:06.150
<v 0>should I or should I not?
Maybe I should.
Maybe I won't like it.
I don't know.</v>

1348
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:11.130
It's sweaty dudes.
I don't just go train goal for free.
Yes.
Try the one day.

1349
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:14.250
You can even,
I would even say go try the one day with it.

1350
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:18.960
I mean I would never recommend having a defensive attitude towards it.

1351
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:21.070
I would never recommend that.
But Brett,

1352
01:29:21.071 --> 01:29:23.370
it's better than not going to give yourself an attitude of like,
hey,

1353
01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:27.510
if you don't like it,
go prove that it sucks.
Yes,
exactly right.
Prove.

1354
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:29.440
Prove that it sucks.
Yes,
exactly.
Ranch.

1355
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:34.800
But when you fail to prove that it sucks and you realize that it is awesome,

1356
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:39.180
it is awesome.
You can be like,
Dang,
where am I needed g and best gs.

1357
01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.890
Not only in America.
In the world.
Yeah.

1358
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:46.950
Factually worldwide they are made in America are from,
they are from origin.

1359
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:50.400
So origin main.com is where you can get your geese.

1360
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:54.810
There's other stuff on their flash cards on there for Nogi Rash Guard for the

1361
01:29:54.811 --> 01:29:55.710
Jujitsu.
Also,

1362
01:29:56.130 --> 01:30:01.130
when you're not on the [inaudible] Matt and you still want to have the comfort

1363
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:05.520
and the glory of American made products.

1364
01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:08.220
I mean we're talking a lot about freedom today.

1365
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:13.200
Why not get a pair of jeans that were made under the umbrella of freedom right

1366
01:30:13.201 --> 01:30:16.440
here in the United States of America up in the great state of Maine,

1367
01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.820
grown here in America.
Right?
Why would you not do that?

1368
01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:24.450
So I want to check out genes,
checkout tee shirts,

1369
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:26.940
checkout all that clothing.

1370
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:31.920
And then also if you want some supplements for your body,

1371
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:38.520
nutritional supplements,
if you,
if you're working out all the time,

1372
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.560
you're going to need some joint warfare.
A joint warfare helps your joints.

1373
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.200
Krill oil also help your joints.

1374
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.850
And actually both those things also help your just overall life.

1375
01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:54.000
Yes,
get on those.
Discipline and discipline.

1376
01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:59.001
Go discipline is for me to pre mission situation.

1377
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:01.051
It's not,

1378
01:31:01.051 --> 01:31:06.051
but don't get it confused with the traditional preworkout stimulant that gets

1379
01:31:07.651 --> 01:31:10.320
you all amped up by some eyes was reading someone saying,
Oh,

1380
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:13.760
I don't want to take a pre workout before Jujitsu.
Correct.

1381
01:31:13.761 --> 01:31:18.240
As a pre workout and I don't recommend taking a pre workout before Jujitsu this,

1382
01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:23.160
this has 15 milligrams of caffeine because that's what people worry about.

1383
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.830
My is going to be pumping,
right?
No,
this is gonna.

1384
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.600
It's gonna get you cognitively and physically ready to rock and roll.

1385
01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:33.720
Once climbed and and discipline go,

1386
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.640
which is the pill form when you need,
when you need imagine.

1387
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.750
Okay.
You know what you feel like when you're in the zone,
right?
Yes.

1388
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:46.470
Just imagine you could get in the zone like basically on demand.

1389
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.130
Sure.
That's what's happening here with discipline.
Go.
Yeah.

1390
01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:54.510
You can feel it and it gets you in the zone.
It's it.

1391
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:58.830
You know what trips me out is I'll take discipline.
I was going,

1392
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:00.070
you know,

1393
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.080
<v 2>speak with a company.
I'm going to be sitting down,</v>

1394
01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:07.290
there's 20 like smart leaders in a room from a company that got a lot of stuff

1395
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:14.860
going on,
big company.
And I go in and I've got,
I gotta be honest,

1396
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:19.350
I'm like juiced up on like three discipline go,
you're ready to go.

1397
01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:24.430
But I get in there and I'm,
I'm,
I'm just feeling great,
right?

1398
01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.990
And I get out of there and I'm like thinking to myself,
I'm like,

1399
01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:32.560
you know,
I should have recorded that.
There's no,
I'm not kidding.

1400
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.550
There's times where I go to,
I've worked with a client and I think,
man,

1401
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.770
I should have recorded that.
I have do phone calls,

1402
01:32:38.771 --> 01:32:42.700
sometimes a client and I'm like,
I should've just recorded my end sir.

1403
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:47.760
Because I'm telling people really important things about planning,

1404
01:32:49.721 --> 01:32:53.290
about leadership,
about decision making and it's getting lost.
I mean,

1405
01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:55.000
I told 20 people,
what about everyone else?

1406
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:57.730
I'm thinking of myself and I come out of there and I think to myself,
I'm like,

1407
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:00.760
I'm like,
yeah,
I was just in the zone.
I wonder what happened.
I'm like,
Oh,

1408
01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:03.580
I took three discipline goes and I'm ready to rock.
And Roll.

1409
01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:06.640
That's what happened.
So anyways,
it's flooded.

1410
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:11.600
That sounds like you're like all frickin like yourself.
Like oh my God.
Yeah.

1411
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.440
Yeah,
I know.
I'm so good at what I do and I felt like I cheated.

1412
01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.220
It actually makes sense though.

1413
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:20.900
You know like why you say when you're in the zone,
right?
And you said,

1414
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:22.720
you know like I don't know even like in my case,

1415
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:26.440
like you're from my friend who asked me like a question and then I'll be like,

1416
01:33:26.441 --> 01:33:29.980
wait and I'll kind of cover like all the aspects of the question like all

1417
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:33.040
fluidly and I'm like,
Dang.
I kind of said that kind of good right there.

1418
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.800
Not that I'm a great speaker,
nothing like that,
but I'm just saying,

1419
01:33:35.801 --> 01:33:38.940
given the question he asked at the certain time and the way I answered that

1420
01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:41.170
really feel good about it or really feel good about it.

1421
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.100
That's kind of like what you get into.
You know,

1422
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:46.120
like when you take the discipline,
it's like it's just,

1423
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.620
you just kind of flow with it.
I'm like,
like surfing or something.

1424
01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.340
I started to get a little like,

1425
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:55.420
is it possible to become addicted to that feeling?
Well,

1426
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:59.030
depends on what kind of quote unquote shit ain't talking to my cousin.

1427
01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.200
There's psychological addiction.
Yeah.
Like that's a thing.
So yeah.
Anyways,

1428
01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:08.230
that's the discipline and that's the discipline go.
Um,
and then we got,

1429
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:12.840
we got some milk and you know what is,
sure.
Yeah.

1430
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.770
It's more luck.
Happens to have 22 grams of protein.

1431
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:19.450
Yeah.
Yeah.
By the way,
and by the way,

1432
01:34:20.050 --> 01:34:23.350
MIT is my favorite kind of flavor overall in the world.

1433
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.980
And I have not had mint since I got strawberries at my house.

1434
01:34:27.010 --> 01:34:30.040
I gotta be straight up now.
I'll get over it in a little while,

1435
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:30.671
you know what I mean?

1436
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:34.250
But right now it's just the hype is still behind the Silverado,

1437
01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.530
the strawberries,
strawberries,
slayer.

1438
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:42.010
How good is it anyways?
Yeah,
that's that.

1439
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:46.510
Get the Malke get the warrior monk kid for your kids or your kid milk.

1440
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:50.350
It's a,
that comes in strawberry and chocolate.
Once again,
the strawberries,

1441
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:55.420
unreal the chocolates.
Fine.
It's good.
Your kids will like it.
The strawberry,

1442
01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:58.580
they'll be coming back for more.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah,
it's dessert.

1443
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:00.800
And then of course you've got Jocko white tea,

1444
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.540
which is good for you.
It tastes good.

1445
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:10.400
And the most important thing is that it gives you an 8,000 pound dead lift,

1446
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:14.900
which is not Jabie.
No,
it is 100% guaranteed.

1447
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.690
Like 100% yeah.

1448
01:35:16.691 --> 01:35:21.530
Like every single person that's ever had it has got an 80,000 pound up.
Yeah.

1449
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.220
So we're good there.
Give that a try if you want.
Yeah,
yeah.
Big Time.

1450
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:29.570
All that stuff that we just talked about.
Is it origin main.com if you want it,

1451
01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:34.640
you know,
and the t we offer the tea as well.
Where on our store?
Oh,

1452
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:36.920
I didn't know we had a store Jellco you do have the store?

1453
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.920
It's called Jocko store.
Anyway.
Yes.
So yeah,

1454
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.980
Dakota store called Jocko store.com this is where you can get a bunch of rash

1455
01:35:46.221 --> 01:35:49.670
guards,
t shirts,
hats,
stickers,

1456
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.010
pretty much anything that you would use stickers in there.

1457
01:35:52.011 --> 01:35:55.010
Right now we have stickers,
bumper stickers.
They couldn't have,

1458
01:35:55.011 --> 01:35:58.160
everyone knows that.
Yeah,
it could be sold out and we don't know.

1459
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.460
Tell Jesse Jesse,
we'll get them into game.
Not,
oh the decals.
Okay.

1460
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:04.970
See the difference between bumper stickers and decals?
We have decals.

1461
01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:08.420
Oh well those are like more legitimate stickers.
Okay,
cool.

1462
01:36:08.421 --> 01:36:12.100
That's the ones I like.
Yes.
I need to be intent on that level.
Yeah,

1463
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:14.240
pretty much anything if you want to represent,

1464
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:17.120
you know the discipline equals freedom.

1465
01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:22.010
Like concept,
you know a guy and this is just,

1466
01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.010
you should know this.
I'm a guy there was,

1467
01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:27.760
I was speaking at an event and they were talking about like,
Oh God,

1468
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:31.430
we got some guys that are going to wear your tee shirt.
You know.
And I was like,

1469
01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.580
oh that's awesome.
And the guy was talking,
he was kind of,
I don't know,

1470
01:36:34.581 --> 01:36:36.110
he just had a look on his face like,

1471
01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:42.930
like I was like saying,
oh it's so awesome that guys are wearing,
you know,

1472
01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.840
the t shirt.
And so I said to him,
I said,

1473
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.620
it's awesome because like that's how the podcast is supported.

1474
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:52.790
It's like when you buy a tee shirt,
that's how the podcast is supported.

1475
01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:57.820
So it is cool and it's appreciated if you get a tee shirt or a hat or a rash

1476
01:36:59.751 --> 01:37:04.751
guard or whatever from the Jocko store cause then we can have the podcast.

1477
01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:11.450
Yeah.
And the good,
the good support.
Support you big tent.

1478
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:13.670
Good news about this too though.

1479
01:37:13.671 --> 01:37:16.010
It's not like the shirts and I said this from the beginning.

1480
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:18.440
I think this was kind of the goal when you know,

1481
01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:23.090
when you make sure it's you produce.
Sure.
Yeah.
It's,

1482
01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:28.000
it seems obvious to be like Oh yeah let's just get some shirts.
No,
no,
no.

1483
01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:32.750
I've made it a point to get like literally the shirts that like that I wear or

1484
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:35.540
that in which are we're proving cause I made sure it's before in the past

1485
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.240
actually had been making shirts since I was like six years old to be honest with

1486
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:42.140
you.
So I find when,
where are you making sure it's when you're six years old.

1487
01:37:42.141 --> 01:37:45.950
Calais.
But let me explain that a little bit so you get shit.

1488
01:37:45.951 --> 01:37:49.970
Well cause when I wasn't like you will run into silkscreen operation.
No,

1489
01:37:49.971 --> 01:37:51.500
but when you're six years old,
yes.

1490
01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.690
My mom is your mom was making sure to when you were six years old.

1491
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.110
Well you kind of filtered to us too.
So they did a airbrush.

1492
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:00.070
They did silk screen.
They didn't calling.

1493
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:04.050
I want to see some kid pictures of you with an airbrush tee shirt.

1494
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:07.920
Unicorn,
rainbow,
Shaka,
Shaka.

1495
01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:11.760
Maybe they're mainly a lot of flowers.
A lot of that kind of,
it was on quiet.

1496
01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:16.260
So there,
there is a,
she worked at a place called tropical shirts.
Yes.

1497
01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.840
Quiet a little y.
Um,
Brittany,

1498
01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:22.590
they shared a building with like a can of pineapple cannery and they make sure

1499
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:25.280
it was really interesting.
Anyway,
that's where we learned nonetheless.

1500
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:28.830
The point is I didn't get some just random cheap with cheap his shirt.

1501
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:32.970
I've got wearable shirts as many people and when I say many,

1502
01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:36.900
I mean more than I can.
I can't recollect like the last five people.

1503
01:38:36.901 --> 01:38:40.260
It's actually like,
it's actually a lot of people.
Yeah.
People tell me this too.

1504
01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:40.621
Yeah.

1505
01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:44.190
That it's the most like their favorite shirt to wear because it fits so good.

1506
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:47.730
It's like the soft,
the material.
It's not just like some rigid thing,

1507
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:51.600
you know they're good,
they're quick.
It's quality stuff is what I'm saying,

1508
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:56.490
so you know beneficial in Jocko,
store.com hay and also speaking,

1509
01:38:56.491 --> 01:39:00.150
the podcast is subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already.

1510
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:02.130
If you will subscribe to it.

1511
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:04.530
Then you just click a button that says subscribe and you did it.

1512
01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.560
You achieved the goal of the day you subscribed to the podcast and the more

1513
01:39:10.741 --> 01:39:15.180
subscribers we get that no,
whatever.
Subscribed to the podcast,
get in the game.

1514
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.060
The warrior kid podcast as well.

1515
01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:21.360
That one's coming out a little bit infrequently right now,

1516
01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:24.810
but we are getting them out.
I'm working on another one right now.

1517
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:30.150
There's plenty of lessons in there for everyone from Uncle Jake and then you can

1518
01:39:30.151 --> 01:39:33.990
also get some more of your kids soap from Irish oaks ranch.com

1519
01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.940
also we have a youtube channel.
Yeah,
good channel.

1520
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.110
I think if you're interested in the video version,
that's mainly what it's for.

1521
01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:43.680
Also Act,

1522
01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.680
there's some excerpts on there that we put out so you don't have to necessarily

1523
01:39:48.811 --> 01:39:51.570
listen to the whole thing every single time.
You see,

1524
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:57.770
whenever I meet someone that has a commute [inaudible] more than 40 minutes to

1525
01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:01.590
work and from work,
they're completely caught up on the podcast.
Yeah.

1526
01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:05.790
When I meet someone that has a commute that's like 10 minutes,
they're like,

1527
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:10.680
oh you're putting out these podcasts,
you're fast.
And I say,
well listen harder.

1528
01:40:11.690 --> 01:40:14.640
You know,
cause you can Sun Sun some apps,

1529
01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:19.020
you can play it at 1.5 or whatever,
two,
two times of speed.

1530
01:40:19.050 --> 01:40:22.310
I don't know that.
I would recommend that I've accidentally,
you know,

1531
01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:25.440
sometimes you accidentally press the button and it'll go faster.

1532
01:40:25.441 --> 01:40:28.610
It's kind of weird,
but if you're trying to rush it,
you can try and you also can,

1533
01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:31.050
you can get used to it to get used to it.

1534
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.120
But then the thing is with me a lot of times,

1535
01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:36.570
obviously I speak really slow with big giant pauses.
I'm sorry.

1536
01:40:36.571 --> 01:40:37.470
That's just the way I talk.

1537
01:40:37.471 --> 01:40:40.470
But then also sometimes I speak really quickly and put my words together and

1538
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:43.950
they kind of flow out.
If you are listening to this right now at 2.0 speed,

1539
01:40:43.951 --> 01:40:46.380
you'd be in a world of hurt trying to understand what I was talking about,

1540
01:40:46.381 --> 01:40:49.140
so that's when you got to be able to get back to that button,

1541
01:40:49.141 --> 01:40:54.141
hammer it down and get you to slow back down to a normal speed of 1.0 I'm pretty

1542
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:59.530
sure,
but yeah,
either way.
Youtube,
yes,
Youtube.
It's a,

1543
01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.820
we do have youtube channels,
so yeah,

1544
01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:04.600
check that out if you're interested in now also psychological warfare,

1545
01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:07.300
if you didn't know what that is,
to help with tracks.

1546
01:41:07.450 --> 01:41:11.740
Chocolate tracks getting us all through our moments of weakness.

1547
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:15.370
If they become prevalent,
which they do from time to time.

1548
01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.430
They do weigh less now by the way,
but you know those are the,
those are chuck on.

1549
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:24.400
Whenever you get an MP three you can get the psychological warfare album.

1550
01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:26.020
That's an audio.

1551
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:30.660
It's an audio reminder reminder.

1552
01:41:30.670 --> 01:41:34.900
If you want a visual reminder,
you can go to flip side,

He was on this podcast number one 15

1554
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:46.090
he makes things that you can look at.

1555
01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:50.440
Just say good things on them to remind you of what you should be doing.

1556
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:55.300
He just made a new one that says all your excuses are lies.

1557
01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:56.440
Yeah,
I saw them.
Those,

1558
01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.980
there's no a not all fancy cause there's nothing fancy about all their excuses

1559
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:06.440
are lies.
It's simple for the simplicity element.
Yes.

1560
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.330
So yeah,

1565
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:28.060
I haven't been talking about the worry of bars,

1566
01:42:28.061 --> 01:42:31.570
but those warrior bars are like key.
They're,
they're uh,

1567
01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:36.760
they're good to have on the standby scenario.
Oh yeah.
And even like,

1568
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:41.590
that's like a semi daily,
put a semi dailies that every other day.
Semi daily.

1569
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:46.330
It's not necessarily mean.
Yeah.
Semi Day.

1570
01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.910
Well,
my frequency with these warrior bars,

1571
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:53.860
protein packed food,
they're not like,

1572
01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:56.950
like,
you know how little power bars,
it's not like that.

1573
01:42:56.951 --> 01:43:01.690
It's like a protein meat anyway.
It's called the worry about anyway,

1574
01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:04.720
that's every other day I would say.
It's like,

1575
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.040
I don't even like to use the word snack because it doesn't feel like a snack.

1576
01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:12.940
It's like,
it's like a hybrid snack slash meal protein ish.

1577
01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:17.770
Anyway,
nonetheless,
there's a lot of cool stuff on there.
A kettle bells on there.

1578
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:21.550
All right.
You say artistic kettlebells,
even though they are artistic,

1579
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:26.580
but I feel like it doesn't capture the glory of the kettlebells.

1580
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.090
Nonetheless,
primal bills,
legend bells.
That's where I get them.

1581
01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:35.840
What do they call the star wars bells.
Oh,
they call them space bells are,

1582
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:42.460
uh,
I don't think they have a name for the group yet,
but yes,

1583
01:43:42.461 --> 01:43:45.820
I just got the Darth Vader one didn't come in yet.
Oh,
like a storm trooper.

1584
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:49.480
Darth Vader.
There's a Boba Fett one,
which is dope,

1585
01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:52.070
but I'm going to get all three.
I'll

1586
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.480
<v 0>report back to the less anyway,</v>

1587
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:57.050
on it.com/chocolate this Ricky get this good stuff.
A lot of good stuff.

1588
01:43:57.051 --> 01:43:57.980
I've got a bunch of books.

1589
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:03.310
The book to order right now is where the warrior kid three where there's a will,

1590
01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:12.800

1591
01:44:14.431 --> 01:44:16.350

I'll have to print more.

1592
01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:19.350
Don't forget about the first two and then the first two.
Yep.

1593
01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:21.390
We got way of the warrior kid.

1594
01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1595
01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:27.000
<v 0>From wimpy to warrior and then ABC away.</v>

1596
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.320
And then you got marked mission in Mars mission is your daughter's favorite?

1597
01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:35.910
Correct.
If she sleeps with it.
Hmm.
Strange.
Yeah.

1598
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:40.080
Not a stuffed down won't by the way,
it's a book.
The hard cover book,

1599
01:44:40.081 --> 01:44:44.150
not the most physically cozy,
which I'm not opposed to physically go,

1600
01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:48.660
but yes.
Sleeps with it.
Yeah.
Her favorite books,
J.
Dot.
Yes.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1601
01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:53.720
So that's where the where your kid and Mark's mission teaching good

1602
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:58.710
things to children and they needed these days.

1603
01:44:58.711 --> 01:45:00.210
And also you've got Mikey and the dragons.

1604
01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.830
That one is for a little bit younger crowd.

1605
01:45:04.831 --> 01:45:05.850
And then on top of that,

1606
01:45:05.851 --> 01:45:08.850
of course we've got the discipline equals freedom field manual for which is for

1607
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:12.540
everyone teaches you how to get after it.

1608
01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:17.160
The audio is on iTunes and Google play and Amazon music and an extreme ownership

1609
01:45:17.161 --> 01:45:19.740
dichotomy of leadership,
which I wrote with my brother Leif Babin.

1610
01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:22.390
You can get these books too,

1611
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:27.960
learn about leadership and you can do also get these books and give them to the

1612
01:45:27.961 --> 01:45:32.580
people that work for you or the people that you work for so that you all become

1613
01:45:32.581 --> 01:45:37.230
better leaders.
On top of that,
we have echelon front.

1614
01:45:37.231 --> 01:45:40.770
That's my leadership consultancy in what we do is we solve problems through

1615
01:45:40.771 --> 01:45:44.660
leadership.
If you've got a company,
if you've got a business,

1616
01:45:44.670 --> 01:45:47.210
you've got a team and you got problems at that team,

1617
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:53.030
the problems are due to one thing and one thing only and that's leadership.

1618
01:45:53.031 --> 01:45:55.430
So if you want to get those problems fixed at your team,

1619
01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:00.860
go to echelon front.com we've got the muster Chicago sold out already.

1620
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:06.950
In fact,
it might be on during this,
uh Oh no,
we're listening to it right now.

1621
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:11.330
So Chicago and then we've got Denver,

1622
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.940
September 19th and 20th we got Sydney,

1623
01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.630
December 4th and fifth extreme ownership.com if you want to come,

1624
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:19.820
they're all going to sell out.
So try and sign up early.

1625
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:24.080
Otherwise you're going to miss it.
The one in Sydney,
by the way,

1626
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:27.350
I think we,
I think the place that we got down there,

1627
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:30.530
I want to say it's less than 400 people.

1628
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:34.640
So that place is going to sell out quick.

1629
01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.970
Not to mention our first time going to Australia for a muster.

1630
01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.390
So it's going to get crazy quick.
So if you want to come try and sign up brother

1631
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:47.700
Eif online,
this is online training.
If you can't come,

1632
01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.730
if you can't come to the muster,
if you can't come to the muster or let's say,

1633
01:46:50.731 --> 01:46:51.870
and this is the reason we created it,

1634
01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:56.900
is because we work with companies that have 62,000 employees and they say,

1635
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:01.950
Hey Jocko,
can you train all of our employees there around the world?
And I say,

1636
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:04.750
no,
I can't.
No,
I actually say,
standby,

1637
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:08.970
let me talk to you in a month.
And then it's,
hey,

1638
01:47:08.971 --> 01:47:11.370
we created and it didn't take them out.
That took a lot longer than a month.

1639
01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.080
Took us about it.
Took us about nine months to get it out.
But it's online,

1640
01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:18.570
interactive leadership training.

1641
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:22.920
Get your whole organization on the same page and if you're an individual,

1642
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:23.860
you want it,
you can get it here.

1643
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:27.960
It's ETF online.com and we've got f Overwatch where we're taking special

1644
01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:32.961
operations in combat aviation leaders off the battlefield and putting them into

1645
01:47:32.971 --> 01:47:37.020
companies so that they can help those companies lead.

1646
01:47:38.190 --> 01:47:41.250
And a lot of times people think,
well,
what are some,
what are some uh,

1647
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:43.680
special forces guy going to know about

1648
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.560
manufacturing?
Trust me,
you put them in there.

1649
01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.990
It's not about manufacturing.
He'll learn about the manufacturing,

1650
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.753
but what he's going to know,

1651
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.810
what he knows how to do right now is he knows how to lead and he's going to turn

1652
01:47:57.811 --> 01:47:58.800
that organization around.

1653
01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:02.820
So that's f overwatch.com

1654
01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:04.500
<v 1>okay.</v>

1655
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:09.390

we're on the Inter webs,</v>

1656
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.340
which is also called the Internet by the way.
Hmm.
I already knew that.

1657
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:17.610
Nonetheless,
Twitter,
Instagram,
Facebook.
I met Echo,

1658
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:20.950
which was that last one face bull plot.

1659
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:27.020
I'm at echocharles chocolates at Jocko Willink and thanks to everyone out there

1660

they've went out there that has fought and does fight for our freedom,

1662
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:37.260
standing up against these

1663
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:43.860
evil regimes in the world and putting your life on the line to defend,

1664
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:49.350
to defend our ideal,
which is freedom.

1665
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.630
And here at home,

1666
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:56.720
thanks to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMT

1667
01:48:56.721 --> 01:49:00.540

1668
01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.670
service and all the other first responders.

1669
01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:08.180
Thanks to you as well for keeping us safe here at home and to everyone else out

1670
01:49:10.381 --> 01:49:15.320
there.
Remember this code that we talked about,

1671
01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.860
remember what it meant to people and remember the will that it instilled in

1672
01:49:24.731 --> 01:49:25.660
those people,
uh,

1673
01:49:25.661 --> 01:49:29.980
will so strong that they faced death without fear.

1674
01:49:30.610 --> 01:49:32.560
And then remember the will,

1675
01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:36.460
the will that overcame that code

1676
01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:40.260
was the will of freedom.

1677
01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:42.000
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1678
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.290
<v 0>The will that says,
I will bow down to no man,</v>

1679
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:53.830
the will to stand up no matter what kind of evil death cult there was that

1680
01:49:55.311 --> 01:49:57.770
attacked and tried to enslave the world.

1681
01:49:59.090 --> 01:50:04.090
That evil was overcome by the strength of freedom and the will

1682
01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:07.593
<v 1>to get up</v>

1683
01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.160
<v 0>and no matter what,</v>
