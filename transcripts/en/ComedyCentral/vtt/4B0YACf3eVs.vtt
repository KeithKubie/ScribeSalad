00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.070
Okay, Mavis L. from
Rancho Cucamonga writes,

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:07.073
"Amy, why do you talk
about your pussy so much?

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:10.209
"Are you scared we don't
believe you have one?

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:12.211
We get it.
You're disgusting."

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.247
I have to say
that I have no idea

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.615
what that is
in reference to.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.749
(snickering)

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.619
Uh, you know.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.220
No idea.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.622
You know.
We all know.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.259
I have literally
never in my life

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.128
said that word before, so...

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.197
What did you just say?!

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.665 line:85%
I said you're delusional!

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.665
What did you just say?

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.834 line:85%
Say it to my face!

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.834
I said "You're day-loo..."

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.537
(both shouting)

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.372
I said you're delusional!

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.641
You don't even know
what delusional means!

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.109
You don't know
what it means.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.177
You don't know what
anything means!

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.211
I'm not delusional.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.279
Yeah, you always
take her side!

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.780
No, you know what?
I can't, no.

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:48.714
(Kim)
Sit down.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.150
Good, good, walk out
like you always do.

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.285
I'm not, I'm not.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.419
Walk out like
you always do.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:54.554
No, because you know
why I'm not?!

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.656
Because, because
you know why I'm not!

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.325
And what you wrote
is very hurtful to me.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.593
I didn't say anything!

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.795 line:85%
It's very hurtful to me!

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.795
Prove it!

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.664
I didn't say anything!

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.265
Sit back down, Amy.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:07.533
Okay.
Come back.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.369
Sit down, Kim.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.705
Amy, are you seriously saying

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.408
that you've never
said the word "pussy"?

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:20.580
Andy, on my life... never!

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:24.617
Never have I ever said
that word on my life.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.319
On my children's lives!

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.620
On my children's
children's lives.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.755
Never have I said that word.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:33.359
That's family, and you
don't do that to family.

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:36.562
Wait, are you saying
your pussy is family?

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.731
She knows what
I'm talking about.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.500
Nobody knows what
you're talking about!

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.868 line:83%
You know what
I'm talking about!

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.868
Nobody knows!

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.569
Nobody knows.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.473
Okay, well, let's see what
everybody is talking about.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:48.774
Take a look.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.443
Close your eyes.
Okay.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.878
Give me your hand.
Mm-hmm.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:55.181
Guess where your finger
is right now.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.282
My pussy.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.650
My pussy tastes
like nothing.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:01:59.218
'Cause I ate pussy
for breakfast.

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.921
I hope this kid's ready
to (bleep) a ton of pussy.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.156 line:85%
Pussies.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.156
Pussy.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.257
Pussy!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.725
Stop talking out
of your pussy right now.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.193
If my pussy had
a voice,

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:08.327
it would sound
like Terry Gross

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.229
with just a mouthful
of crackers.

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.465
My character has a pussy.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:13.499
Pussies.

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:15.234
Can you not say... pussy?

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.336
♪ My pussy's (bleep) magic ♪

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.471
With a pussy on it.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.406
I don't see what's
so hard about...

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.541
just saying "vagina."

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:24.377
Will this fix
my garbage pussy?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.612
Are you that girl
from the television

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.681
who talks about
her pussy all the time?

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:30.750
Yes!

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:34.487
Kinda seems like
you say "pussy" a lot, Amy.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.755
Thank you.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.224
I see why
you would think that.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.360
And I, I want to
"sincereiously" apologize

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.764
to my fans if that's what
they thought I was saying.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.899
But I have grown a lot.

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:51.404
This has been a journey
with me and God.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:55.374
And everyone at the precinct
near my house.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.276
And I know what's in my heart.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.479
And it is my pussy.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.984
Okay, I mean-- and, and I do,
I do wanna say this.

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.819
I do wanna say this
about Amy, okay?

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.854 line:83%
I know that we have had
our differences.

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.854
Mm-hmm.

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.924
And I know that she knows
that I do hate her.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.960
Okay, but she also does
say that, like,

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:14.961
she has a good heart.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.796
Okay, and she says

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.731
she has a good heart
and family is family.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.566
Thank you
for saying that.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.802
Family is family.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:23.803
Family is family.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.338
(sobbing)
Family is family.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.540
(Andy)
That's nice,
that was kind of you.

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:28.906
We'll be right back.
