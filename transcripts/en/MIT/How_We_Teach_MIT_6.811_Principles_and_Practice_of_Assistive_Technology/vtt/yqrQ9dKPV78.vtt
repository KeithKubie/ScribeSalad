WILLIAM LI: My
name is William Li.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.820
I'm a Ph.D. Student in
computer science at MIT.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.840
And for this course, I
was a graduate instructor

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.140
for 6.811, principles
and practice

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.220
of assistive technology.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.994
And that meant I was one of
the c-instructors of the class.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:22.820
GRACE TEO: Cool.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.160
And my name is Grace Teo.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.310
I am a lecturer for 6.811.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.270
And basically our class is
about pairing students up

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.400
with clients with disabilities
to create a customized piece

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.820
of assistive technology
for them over the course

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.322
of the semester.

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:44.730
So the reason why I got
into teaching this course

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.450
is partly because of William,
because William invited me.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.850
But also the
background to that was

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.490
that over the summer
at MIT, I had founded

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.920
a very similar class
called Open Style Lab,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.760
where we teamed up
students with clients

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.450
with disabilities as well.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.440
Except that in that case,
we were asking the students

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.910
to create clothing for them.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.010
So this entire area
of designing around

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.710
a constraints of disability
is very interesting to me

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.220
because, first of all, there's
very immediate community

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.390
impact.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.130
I think because
of that too, then

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.890
the students have
a lot of motivation

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.050
to try their best to learn
because they see that they're

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.440
really impacting a
real person and helping

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
to solve a real problem instead
of just doing problem sets

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.006
or solving kind of
abstract challenges.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.040
And I think, to be honest,
one of the things I love

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.217
is seeing the students
get comfortable talking

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:51.890
to and talking about people with
disabilities over time as well.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.180
Because I think very
often in society

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.060
there's a huge amount of
discomfort surrounding

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.790
disability.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.660
And it's not that
people don't care

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.980
it's just that they don't
want to say the wrong things,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.140
you don't want to
be offensive, and so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960
equipping our students
with the skills

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.750
to be able to engage with the
community is really important.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.120
WILLIAM LI: So I was
fortunate as an undergrad

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.590
to work at a children's
rehabilitation hospital

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.230
one summer and learn about the
space of assistive technology.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.720
And I ended up doing that
in my undergraduate thesis.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.390
And so when I went
to grad school,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.500
I wanted to continue working
in assistive technology.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.410
And I was fortunate to be
able to do that here at MIT.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.980
So my master's
thesis was working

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.640
a lot in speech recognition for
people with different speech

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.960
challenges with
multiple sclerosis that

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.812
maybe affects their speech.

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.645
So I think it's a
really-- similar to Grace,

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:53.480
I think it's a really
fascinating area to work in,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.020
very personally meaningful,
but also very interesting

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.220
design constraints
and challenges

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.880
in working in this space.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.130
And so with respect to the
class, my master's thesis

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.660
adviser Seth Teller started
this class back in 2011.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.840
I was fortunate to
be the first teaching

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870
assistant in the class.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.450
And then to get involved
in it with a big team,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.300
including Grace for sure,
over the past semester.
