00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.070
For fun, let's try to
approximate the area

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.700
under the curve y is
equal to the square root,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.220
the principal root, of x minus
1, between x is equal to 1

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.480
and x is equal to 6.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.420
So I want to find
this entire area.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.240
Or I want to at least
approximate this entire area.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.250
And the way I'll do
it is by setting up

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.040
five trapezoids of equal width.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.980
So this will be
the left boundary

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.160
of the first trapezoid.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.830
This will be its right
boundary, which will also

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.710
be the left boundary of
the second trapezoid.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.370
This will be the right boundary
of the second trapezoid.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.810
This is the right boundary
of the third trapezoid.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.980
This'll be the right boundary
of the fourth trapezoid.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.420
And then finally, this
will be the right boundary

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.370
of the fifth trapezoid.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.310
And since we're going from 1 to
6, so we're traveling 6 minus 1

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.470
in the x direction, and I want
to split it into five sections,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.130
the width of each trapezoid is
just going to be equal to 1.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.700
And so if we say that the width
of a trapezoid is delta x,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.200
we just can now say the
delta x is equal to 1.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.220
So let's set up our trapezoids.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.696
So the first trapezoid is
going to look like that.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:22.820
It's going to go like that.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.861
Actually, it's going to
be a triangle, not really

00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:25.830
a trapezoid.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.175
Then the second trapezoid
is going to look like this.

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:30.800
I guess you could
say a trapezoid where

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.770
one of the sides has length
0 turns into a triangle.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.550
And then the third trapezoid
is going to look like this.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.390
And then the fourth trapezoid
is going to look like that.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.930
And then finally, you
have the fifth trapezoid.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.040
So let's calculate the
area of each of these,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.660
and then we will have our
approximation for the area

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.180
under the curve.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.140
So let's do trapezoid--
or I really should say

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.450
triangle-- this first shape,
whatever you want to call it.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.240
What is the area of
that going to be?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.120
Well, the area of a
trapezoid-- and you'll

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.950
see this will just turn into
the area of a triangle-- it's

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.973
the average of the
heights of the two

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.139
sides of the trapezoid, the
way we've looked at it--

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.990
or you could say the average
of the heights of the two

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.460
parallel sides, I guess
is the best way to say it.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.230
So f of 1-- that's the
height here-- plus f of 2,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.680
all of that over
2, and then we're

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.670
going to multiply it
times our delta x.

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:30.220
Actually, let me do that
in that same red color

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.090
to show you that this is the
area of that first trapezoid,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.170
so times delta x.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.930
And as you see right over here,
if you look at it, the f of 1

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.520
is just going to be 0.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.540
So you're going to
have f of 2 times--

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.540
so it's going to be this height
times this base times 1/2,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.250
which is just the
area of a triangle.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.910
Let's look at the
second trapezoid,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.290
trapezoid two right over here.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.740
What is its area going to be?

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.450
Well, it's going to
be f of 2 plus f of 3.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.100
f of 2 is this height.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.430
f of 3 is this height.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.930
So we're taking the average
of those two heights-- divided

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.650
by 2; that's the
average of those two

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.610
heights-- times the
base, times delta x.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.040
And then let's do
trapezoid three.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.070
I think you're
getting the idea here.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.220
Trapezoid three is
going to be f of 3

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.010
plus f of 4 divided
by 2 times delta x.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.260
And then-- let's see.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.490
I'm running out of colors.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.970
This is trapezoid
four right over here.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.080
So plus f of 4 plus f of 5, all
of that over 2, times delta x.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.770
And then we have
our last trapezoid,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.440
which I will do in yellow.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.740
So this is trapezoid
number five.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.465
I'll scroll down a little bit,
get some more real estate.

00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:58.090
So it's going to be plus-- I'll
just write the plus over here--

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.770
plus f of 5 plus f of 6
over 2 times our delta x.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.370
So let's see how we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.850
All of these terms,
we have a 1/2 delta x,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.010
so let's actually
factor that out.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.839
So remember, this is our
approximation of our area.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.561
So area is
approximately-- remember,

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.019
this is just a
rough approximation.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.180
It's very clear--
actually, you might say,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.930
this is pretty good
using the trapezoids,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.180
but it is pretty
clear that we are

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.530
letting go of some of the area.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.780
We're letting go of that area.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.450
We're letting go of some
of this right over here.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.270
You can barely see it.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.436
Some of this right over
here, you can barely see it.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.731
But we are-- this is going
to be, it looks like,

00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:39.855
an underestimate, but it
is a decent approximation.

00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:42.159
But let's see if we can
simplify this expression.

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.950
So it's approximately
going to be equal to,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.815
I'm going to factor
out a delta x over 2.

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:53.020
And then what I'm
left with-- and I

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.550
will switch to a neutral
color-- if I factor out

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.220
a delta x over 2, then
I have just an f of 1.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.319
And then I have two f of
2's, so plus 2 times f of 2.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.610
And I'm doing this because
you might see a formula that

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.330
looks something like this
in your calculus book,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.820
and it's not some
mysterious thing.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.980
They just really summed up
the areas of the trapezoids.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.120
And then we're going to have
two f of 3's-- plus 2 times f

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.240
of 3's.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.670
Plus we're going to have two f
of 4's-- plus 2 times f of 4.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.210
And then we're going to have two
f of 5's-- plus 2 times f of 5.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.980
And then finally, we're going to
have one f of 6-- plus f of 6.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.360
If you were to
generalize it, you

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.390
have one of the first
endpoint, the function

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.640
evaluated at the first
endpoint, one of it at the very

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.274
last endpoint, and then two
of all of the rest of them.

00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:43.940
But this is just the
area of trapezoids.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.560
I'm not actually a big fan
of when textbooks write this.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.180
Because when you see this,
it's hard to visualize

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.870
the trapezoids.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.800
When you see this,
it's much clearer

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.910
how you might visualize that.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.620
But with that out of the way,
let's actually evaluate this.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.540
Lucky for us, the
math is simple.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.300
Our delta x is just 1.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.630
And then we just have to
evaluate all of this business.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.740
f of 1, let's just
remind ourselves

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.160
what our original function was.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.570
Our original function was
the square root of x minus 1.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.820
So f of 1 is the square
root of 1 minus 1,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.470
so that is just going to be 0.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.760
This expression
right over here is

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.360
going to be 2 times the
square root of 2 minus 1.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.940
The square root of
2 minus 1 is just 1,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.360
so this is just going to be 2.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.840
Actually, let me do it
in that same-- well,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.050
I'm now using the purple
for a different purpose

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.360
than just the first trapezoid.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.568
Hopefully, you realized that.

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.280
I was just sticking
with that pen color.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.930
Then f of 3.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.479
3 minus 1 is 2--
square root of 2.

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.770
So the function evaluated at
3 is the square root of 2.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.150
So this is going to be 2
times the square root of 2.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.720
Then the function
evaluated at 4.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.740
When you evaluate it at 4,
you get the square root of 3.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.880
So this is going to be 2
times the square root of 3.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.700
And then you get 2 times the
square root of 4-- 5 minus 1

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.510
is 4.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.040
2 times the square
root of 4 is just four.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.680
And then finally, you get f of
6 is square root of 6 minus 1,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.770
is the square root of 5.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.910
And I think we're now
ready to evaluate.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.610
So let me get my handy TI-85
out and calculate this.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.210
So it's going to
be-- well I'm just

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.126
going to calculate--
well, I'll just multiply.

00:07:26.126 --> 00:07:29.594
So 0.5 times open
parentheses-- well, it's a 0.

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.760
I'll just write it, just
so you know what I'm doing.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.520
0 plus 2 plus-- whoops.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.880
Lost my calculator.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:45.490
Plus 2 times the square root of
2 plus 2 times the square root

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:56.630
of 3 plus 4-- I'm almost done--
plus the square root of 5--

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.570
so let me write
that-- gives me--

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.120
now we are ready for our
drum roll-- it gives me--

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.740
and I'll just round it-- 7.26.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:15.230
So the area is
approximately equal to 7.26

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.670
under the curve y is equal
to the square root of x

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.150
minus 1 between x
equals 1 and x equals 6.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.323
And we did this
using trapezoids.
