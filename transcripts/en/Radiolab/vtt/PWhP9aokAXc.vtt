1
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.220
[inaudible]. Yeah, we can do it little.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.133
<v 1>Yes, exactly.</v>

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.360
<v 0>So a couple of days ago we did this thing,</v>

4
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.010
we got Robert into the studio and I noticed that there's just friend [inaudible]

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.340
and we ambushed him and would be

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.250
the whole staff rushed in singing cake the whole deal.

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.360
<v 0>no, Robert famously hates his birthday.</v>

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.170
It's been such a long time trying to hide my birthday, everybody in that.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.180
But you can't really hide your birthday these days.

11
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.300
And I have had the extremely good fortune to work with this man for over 10

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:36.601
years.

13
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.601
So if you'll excuse us justice once we want to take this podcast to celebrate Mr

14
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.460
Robert Krulwich, we're Robert.

15
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.380
<v 1>Well we didn't just bring you in here for cake and to listen to things,</v>

16
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.470
to act in a real what you're sort of thinking, but we would love to,

17
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.430
to share some of your earlier work as the next podcast.

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.100
<v 0>No talk about it. That's our executive producer, Ellen Horan.</v>

19
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.370
She dug up a bunch of its old work from the archives and he eventually agreed to

20
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:04.090
let us play some.

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.170
And it's really interesting to hear this stuff because I'm not sure a lot of

22
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:12.940
people who listen to radio lab really get how much Robert Sensibility drives the

23
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:13.774
show.

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.680
Like his combination of theater and play and his desire to sound different than

25
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.740
other stuff on the radio and to ignore the rules, but in always,

26
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.760
always in service of a genuine attempt to understand or explain something.

27
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.140
And also it's just amazing how many creative lives he lived before he came to

28
00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:30.820
radio lab. Right? Like here's one,

29
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.590
here's a piece from 1979 which is just a few years after NPR began.

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm banks these days you have noticed they're trying out new systems.

31
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.330
More and more we're being asked to deal with machines instead of tellers.

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.450
And that's the way the banks want it. According to our business correspondent,

33
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.470
Robert Krulwich

34
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.170
<v 2>right here in Washington, a few doors away from national public radio. There's,</v>

35
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.160
yeah, listen to your offers.

36
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:56.750
You a chance at a colored television set and they have a treasure chest with 10

37
00:01:56.751 --> 00:01:58.520
Susan B. Anthony Dollars inside,

38
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.970
which could be yours if you are willing to stand there with three minute

39
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.520
demonstration of their new automatic teller system.

40
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.070
<v 0>I don't know,</v>

41
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.800
let's just try to have a period I went to stay strongly nasal cause I thought

42
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.660
nasal is powerful. I think if you have a nose you should use it

43
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.710
in the pieces.

44
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.940
A actually about how p banks are starting these crazy things called htms and

45
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:19.080
people are a little freaked out.

46
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.640
I've had some interesting problems with these machines. Uh,

47
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780
they have eaten my card from time to time. Do you mean they, they,

48
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.860
they mutilated and at one point, uh,

49
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.360
Robert in euro to explain why the banks were lobbying so hard for these ATS,

50
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.190
he almost bursts into song.

51
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.860
<v 2>Okay, great. Good. You send the check to Sears,</v>

52
00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:42.540
Sears deposit the check in its bank. The bank sends a check to a regional bank.

53
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.330
From there it goes to your regional bank is in your very own area.

54
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.370
They mail it back to your hometown bank,

55
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.550
which meals it back to you in a statement you get at the end of the month.

56
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:52.260
The check shows up in the packet, hopefully.

57
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.680
Now remember you listened to the whole thing through that is four different

58
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.300
mailings for just one check.

59
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.540
With all that postage now wouldn't it be the banks argue to stop mailing the

60
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.050
check from place to place place and try another system.

61
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.390
That system is called electronic fund transfer and already to cut down on

62
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:13.890
postage and on handling is more painful for me.

63
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.700
<v 0>Here's another one we listened to.</v>

64
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:20.000
It's also from 1979 this one is a report about,

65
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.030
well a report in quotes about interest rates.

66
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.950
There is intense pressure from two different groups for changes in interest

67
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:32.210
rates. One group wants them down, the other group wants them up even higher.

68
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.260
Both sides are powerful and important to our economy and the INS and outs of

69
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.980
their struggles are worthy of an opera. In fact, they are an opera

70
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.740
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

71
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.990
<v 4>And now from the Palazzos validate,</v>

72
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.960
we present this live performance of Alfredo.

73
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.090
Tucci is a mortal opera rato interest. So, and here is our host,

74
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.240
Seward chaplain.

75
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.030
<v 2>Thank you very much.</v>

76
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.290
There aren't very many operas that deal exclusively with the subject of interest

77
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:04.550
rates, but this one I think is the most magnificent of all to cheer routed,

78
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.630
widowed in a single afternoon after a traumatic event that according to his

79
00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.630
biographers Tanish Lao briefed scarred him for life.

80
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.280
Breech says the two Chu was walking along the road in the city when passing by

81
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.031
in Tram.

82
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:22.031
He saw the exquisitely beautiful Sylvia fire and as she rode by he knew that he

83
00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:25.730
wanted desperately to meet her. Although he was a poor composer,

84
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.310
he decided that he would send her a gift,

85
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.730
it would impress her and he chose wall to wall carpeting.

86
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.890
In order to get the money for the carpet,

87
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:37.400
though he had to get a household finance loan to his hotter,

88
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.380
he found out what the interest rates were.

89
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.580
I'm alone and as he writes in his Aria [inaudible], they were prohibitive.

90
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.630
Our first act today closely follows these real life events.

91
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.770
And as the act urbans where in the Italian Section of Louisville, Kentucky,

92
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.390
where Angelina will,

93
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.650
she wants a wall to wall carpet limbs at the interest rate is 18 and a half

94
00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:58.484
percent.

95
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.080
The scene begins if she gasps in astonishment and resolves not to buy the

96
00:05:03.081 --> 00:05:06.680
carpet. Non Carpaccio Blah. She and her friends, Nina,

97
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.180
tell this to the carpet seller.

98
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.620
Petty Gino Pedagogy no is greatly disturbed and says your value per say,

99
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.890
the businessman's demand is what he sings. I see.

100
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.770
We're now ready for the act begin as Angelina learns that she cannot afford her

101
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.883
car.

102
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.483
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

103
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.753
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

104
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.563
<v 6>no,</v>

105
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.110
<v 2>now they go to Penn Chino. He's not happy.</v>

106
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.160
<v 7>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

107
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.300
<v 0>so here's the thing about this.</v>

108
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.240
A Paul Volcker at the time was the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

109
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.370
And what I do in act three is I take, uh,

110
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.540
Paul and I from a press conference that he was here, which I was at,

111
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.990
and I cut him

112
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.780
<v 5>into the opera,</v>

113
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
ladies and gentlemen, where face to face

114
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.840
woo with economic difficulties, really unique in our experience.

115
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.020
The question of whether we should be putting another screw to interest rates is

116
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.130
it's just one of those walking on a razor heads right now.

117
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.540
<v 2>[inaudible] Alfredo,</v>

118
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:59.310
two chairs offset by this, the congress getting a standing ovation.

119
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.150
It's the car followed by Mr [inaudible].

120
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.970
<v 0>I can't believe that that was on national public radio. That was the crazy days.</v>

121
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.380
Yeah, we could. We did things then like I, I, I interviewed an anchovy.

122
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.070
They aired all that kind of stuff. So there was no one,

123
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:15.530
there was no gatekeepers who were like, no, no. After the upper,

124
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:16.640
we listened to a,

125
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.590
something from 1992 which would be just after I graduated high school and here

126
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.520
Robert Teamed up with a couple of actors and Comedians to do a sort of a yearly

127
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:26.060
recap.

128
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.893
<v 8>The thing.</v>

129
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.100
I'm Robert Krulwich and welcome to the second annual edition of Backfire.

130
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.720
This program has been a tradition on NPR since 1991 and this is the occasion

131
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:38.660
when we gather to review the events of the year in this case,

132
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.620
the year 1992 and once again, we were able to round up our regular observers.

133
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.580
Buck. Henry is a screenwriter and a pundit. You go to movies. The graduate,

134
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:46.911
by the way,

135
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.420
Jane curtain is an actress and a funded original cast Saturday night live.

136
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.141
Tony Hendra,

137
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:55.940
a pundit famous satirist and a pundit and all three of you now at double a

138
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.480
double punted in Tony's case. Let's have the first question and it's from me.

139
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.320
Robert Krulwich pundits.

140
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.200
What was the real explanation for President Bushes collapse?

141
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:09.650
This is now all the way back. A year ago at the state dinner at Tokyo.

142
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.170
You recall the event book? I do. Indeed. He collapsed

143
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.690
<v 9>Stan. More importantly, he vomited on the, was it the prime minister,</v>

144
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.300
the foreign minister and the prime minister, his lap, but Bush, as you know,

145
00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:23.970
is anonymous name. Anyway,

146
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.330
Bush is the sound that you make when you throw up,

147
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.180
so we could have simply been responding to someone saying, by the way,

148
00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:33.570
what is your name? And the Sushi came with it.

149
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.130
It is also as I have read my history,

150
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.790
accustom of world leaders from time to time to throw up on the lap of the

151
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.420
minister of a friendly government.

152
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.350
It demonstrates confidence in your host,

153
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.040
a sense of the excellent of the dinner being served and a tradition of

154
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.600
<v 10>giving back something you've been given,</v>

155
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.440
pushed down a continent politician of giving his all.

156
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.270
How then do you account for the surprised expression and, and,

157
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.060
and the lack of delight really on the face of the prime minister when receiving

158
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:12.060
this gift? Uh, from President Bush.

159
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.290
I think it was because it was done after the first course as opposed to after

160
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.660
the conclusion that in India,

161
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:23.250
you simply throw your dinner in the face of your host before. And just to get,

162
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.710
I'd like to point out by the way, there is some misconception here,

163
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.440
which is that this was a single event. It's actually a, uh,

164
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.530
apparently this habit of throwing up in the nearest stranger's lap is,

165
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.750
it was not just a question of courtesy.

166
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.830
It's something that a bush has done ever since he was a little boy. And in fact,

167
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.540
it's the origin of his, uh, of his nickname poppy. Ah,

168
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.680
because his mother mumsy used to refer to is in veteran habit of up chucking as

169
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.520
the pumping is original family nickname was projectile poppy.

170
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.520
<v 11>Yeah, he, this would go on.</v>

171
00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:00.990
We would do this like for for two hours and Manoli who was our, our our,

172
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.300
she would not even smile

173
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.810
where we were like this was the least listen to a program and all of NPR,

174
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.030
they reduced us from 12 a year.

175
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:17.190
So two a year to one only on New Year's Eve at 10:00 PM do you know what it's

176
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:22.560
like to be scheduled for 10:00 PM on New Year's Eve? That means you have failed,

177
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.370
but then this is how life works.

178
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.590
I'm sitting in my house and the phone rings and it's the White House and some

179
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:32.090
guy says, do you,

180
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.410
is your group available on like next March the third? I mean,

181
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:39.890
we want him in the East Room. I said of the White House. He goes, yeah. I said,

182
00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:43.040
well I don't think you do. I said,

183
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:47.720
maybe you should just ask whoever's idea this was to like vetted or something.

184
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.660
So I about two weeks pass and then the funding, he said,

185
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:54.500
well it's good news and Penn, I listened to it and yes it isn't funny,

186
00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.700
but the people who think it's funny is a person and this the president of

187
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.230
states. So that's the the end. And so we went,

188
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.550
we went to the east room and it was incredible. Really.

189
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.650
My wife was there and you look across at your wife and you're at the White

190
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.780
House, the president of laughing at these dumb jokes.

191
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:23.020
There's certain moments where you feel strangely blessed. You know, like,

192
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:29.250
like either you are really great giraffe in some previous life and this is your

193
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:34.601
reward or every so often God just leans down through the clouds and kisses you

194
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.613
and says like,

195
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.710
this will be just a chance for you to be in joy.

196
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.650
And so that night I just, that that, you know, Gosh they were,

197
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:54.100
it was a big deal. There's a couple pieces that you've pre

198
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.820
<v 0>Radiolab where a, like as a,</v>

199
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.450
as a young radio reporter, you know how you were in your nose phase,

200
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.830
you heard your nose face. Okay. I think we,

201
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.880
we all sort of start in some idea of what we should sound like,

202
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.980
what we should do, what's, what's permissible.

203
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.660
And then you hear this thing come out of the radio, uh, and you're like,

204
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.740
I didn't know you could do that. I just didn't know you that was allowed. Yeah.

205
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.980
I wanna play a one piece of yours that had that effect on me. Uh,

206
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.240
think you did this in 1981 or something. I heard it, you know,

207
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:28.150
years later when it was featured on this website. But, uh,

208
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:32.060
and this is pre radio lab. So I heard this. We hadn't met yet. This is, well,

209
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.750
it's just play it.

210
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.890
<v 12>The story of Lacrosse a lot is one of the great commercial rivalries in New York</v>

211
00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:41.891
history began when Sam Lawsky opened a moving company years and years and years

212
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.730
ago. Way Back, way back. I can understand even before my time,

213
00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:48.590
and I've been with the firm 22 years.

214
00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.280
<v 8>Peter precocial runs the office at the Cresa Lawsky trucking company in</v>

215
00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:53.090
Brooklyn.

216
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.810
<v 12>Why am I hitting? That was a big family, brothers,</v>

217
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:57.670
uncles and cousins and they were all

218
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.150
<v 8>very competitive. You know, competitive is putting it mildly.</v>

219
00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:06.860
The firms started in 1904 when Sam crowds the Lawsky and his brother Dave crabs.

220
00:13:06.861 --> 00:13:11.540
The Lawsky formed a hauling company called Sam crabs, Lawsky and bro.

221
00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.260
The Bro was for brother and they would move heavy things like church bells and

222
00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.570
statues and to help them. They hired their nephew,

223
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.200
Mike Grads Lawsky for 20 years. Everything was fine with the Sam,

224
00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:25.130
Dave and Mike until uncle Dave decided to bring his sons into the business.

225
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.570
Under the circumstances,

226
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.630
Mike had to disassociate himself from the uncles and start on his own.

227
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.670
That is Mike's brother who will serve as our narrator in this story.

228
00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:39.170
Now it is the late 1930s there are now two Cresa Lawsky moving companies.

229
00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:43.790
Mike's and his uncles is to remind customers that he was now in business for

230
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:44.360
himself.

231
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.500
Mike took out a series of display ads in the New York telephone book on the very

232
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:52.610
page where the crowds will, La skis are listed on the ad, said, remember Mike,

233
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.530
there was only one Cresa Lawsky. In addition, his brother says he put,

234
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.770
remember Mike on all the trucks, but it didn't work.

235
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.070
Too many customers could not remember which cries Lawsky was,

236
00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:07.610
which they just opened the phone book and call any crazy Polaski and that is

237
00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:09.770
when Mike got this incredible idea.

238
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.680
He'd taken it if he could move ahead of his uncle's in the telephone book,

239
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.820
people would see his name first and then they'd call him first instead of the

240
00:14:19.821 --> 00:14:24.350
other crazy Laski. So he decided to add a new listing in the telephone book.

241
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.450
He took out the V in Cresa,

242
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.020
loved ski and put in a you that made it Cresa Laos Ski,

243
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.040
K. R. A. S. I. L. O. U. Now that moved him one entry ahead of his uncle.

244
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.820
Students by the alphabet use always proceeded, Viz,

245
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.370
but Mike Kras allow ski as he was now called,

246
00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:44.870
was not prepared for the profitability of his cousin Milton Kozlowski.

247
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.760
Milton. Milton Kras Lawsky was another young son, son of David [inaudible].

248
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.790
In the early 1940s Milton started a new trucking company called Cresa Lao ski

249
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:58.880
with a UW, as was the case with Mike, but to move ahead of Mike,

250
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.920
he changed his first name from Milton to Mick,

251
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.750
m I C K Crass Lawsky with a you hoping that he would be ahead of Mike in the

252
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:14.620
listing, which of course he was the uncle's. Meanwhile,

253
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:19.621
anxious to catch up join forces with Milton or Mick and created the Kratza Laski

254
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.010
safe company.

255
00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:25.030
They dropped the V and has a Lawsky put in an oh so the uncle's Craz,

256
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:27.970
a Laski moved ahead of Mike's Krebs allow ski.

257
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.150
Mike was a quite upset as well.

258
00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:33.520
He might've been for revenge.

259
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.570
He countered with a Greek leap taking over the Atlas Safety Company,

260
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.760
which moved him to the front of the telephone book,

261
00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:42.820
leaving the case behind to the finer air of the a section,

262
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.660
but one year later the uncles who were on the same page, the act,

263
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:51.661
the safe company was a division of s crass Lawsky and brothers.

264
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.980
According to Mike's brother.

265
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.720
By the mid 1950s even though Mike still had only one moving business in Brooklyn

266
00:15:58.721 --> 00:15:59.890
and Metropolitan Avenue,

267
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.290
Mike Cresa Laski by this time had 18 listings under 18 different names in the

268
00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:08.130
telephone book. All the uncles had 13 listing. Yes,

269
00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:13.131
we had listings throughout the yellow pages and white pages for one company so

270
00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:18.750
that we could get all the listings ahead of the other relatives.

271
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.070
Could you do it for fun or no? This was not for fun.

272
00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:24.330
This was very serious.

273
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:28.560
There was no reason we felt that another member of the family that has just

274
00:16:28.561 --> 00:16:32.160
walked in should capitalize on the name of Christ. Sloppy.

275
00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.890
No final salvo was fired by the uncles. Actually,

276
00:16:34.891 --> 00:16:37.200
it was a cousin on the uncle side named Marvin.

277
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.650
He created the a acme [inaudible] safe company.

278
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.681
After that,

279
00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:48.030
the public was so completely confused that according to Richard Kozlowski,

280
00:16:48.031 --> 00:16:50.910
all the crabs, the Lawsky businesses began losing customers.

281
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.130
It does affect the business when people say who,

282
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.680
who are you and who do you belong to?

283
00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.180
Mike died in the 1960s his wife sold the business and changed her name from

284
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.670
Cresa. Lawsky to crass and then moved to Florida.

285
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.420
My ex brother Monro stayed in the business. He now calls his friend,

286
00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:09.600
whoever the empire safe company, he and his son,

287
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:12.660
Richard would like to use the name Creswell. Lawsky. It is after all their name,

288
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.830
but they don't dare because there was now a whole new generation of [inaudible]

289
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.030
moving into the phone book.

290
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.980
The original [inaudible] company has now been split,

291
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.470
so they are all over the lot.

292
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.860
There are now more sons and there are more names here with my colleague Margot

293
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.181
Adler.

294
00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:33.660
We're going to read you the latest set of listings from the current New York

295

<v 0>jet here.</v>

319
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:13.410
So after Ellen Horn and I and the whole staff ambushed Robert in the studio and

320
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.480
played up stories towards the end of the whole thing.

321
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.790
Robert went off on this insane digression and this happens all the time in the

322
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:21.121
studio.

323
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.150
Like he'll go off on something and unfortunately cut it out because it's not

324
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:27.120
part of the story we're telling. But in this case, we're going to put it in,

325
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.520
in honor of his birthday. And also because it just,

326
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.080
it just illustrates what an insanely curious duty is. Like.

327
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:38.790
He has this incredible curiosity that makes him like a heat seeking missile for

328
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:40.050
Weirdo adventures.

329
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.830
And that is what has attracted me to him and the entire staff to him.

330
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:45.720
And probably a lot of the people who listened to him.

331
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.240
So here's just a random digression of his, uh,

332
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:52.140
it's him telling the story of his first television piece for ABC News.

333
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.910
<v 15>One of the great things, I'm sitting on an airplane and the man next to me,</v>

334
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.760
you know, you just asked like, what do you do? He says, Oh,

335
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:02.320
I'm in golf ball retrievable. [inaudible] I say, what is that?

336
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.910
I'm in golf ball retreat. Like in golf courses. Yeah. You know,

337
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:09.030
we gather golf balls, that's a thing people make lots of money.

338
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.030
How much money do you make money while we make we make you know,

339
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:15.390
a dime for every ball that we recover, mn,

340
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.710
we pay that and we can sell it in Japan for quarter. I say, what's your problem?

341
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:23.740
He said, well, the problem we have really the only really one is is uh,

342
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.450
is gators. I said, what do you mean gators? Well, they, they,

343
00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:30.900
they live in the waterholes and the kids who who do this work are teenagers.

344
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.800
I said, well, do you mean you hire teenagers?

345
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.110
And then there's like wild animals that could eat them as well.

346
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:40.020
Obviously we have to remove the gators. I was thinking,

347
00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.210
where's the golf ball retrieval? What an interesting story.

348
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:45.350
That'd be a great story. Then. Then he suddenly talking about gator removals,

349
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.740
gator removal. That'll be great stories as well. Well, we use,

350
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:50.860
we use a guy named Mr. Campbell. He's out in Florida.

351
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:54.340
I mean there's a guy who's specialize. Yeah, he's he, he works Florida, Texas,

352
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:58.120
southern California. I said, well, I've got to go meet Mr. Campbell,

353
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.630
so I call Mr. Campbell.

354
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.690
The phone is answered by some person who's not Mr. Campbell.

355
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.820
It's his very angry wife.

356
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.500
He at age 80 has skipped that with some floozy and she is like pissed at him.

357
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.060
So she says, well, if you're calling, he's not here. He's out with her.

358
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.340
I said, oh, I am sorry.

359
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:21.400
I didn't know because I was thinking maybe he'd be a subject of an interview.

360
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.330
I would talk about, you know,

361
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.340
alligator retrieval and well did he ever mentioned the gross point zoo,

362
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.830
so being no fool.

363
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.920
I said occasionally and it turned out that when they had lived in Gross Pointe

364
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.150
Michigan, a very fancy suburb,

365
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.830
they hadn't created the law that he had collected the largest collection of

366
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:45.580
gators in, in North America, in his basement,

367
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:49.720
in a series of tubs that he had built and irrigated and every kid in the

368
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:52.780
neighborhood whose parents were all at general motors or something,

369
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.800
all knew about this secret thing. The police didn't, the adults didn't,

370
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.663
but the kids did.

371
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.640
And she said in the course of this conversation until the sowing incident,

372
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.300
what I said, what now you can imagine the fever.

373
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:12.330
I have gone from golf ball retrieval to alligator removal to now secret zoo in

374
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:17.050
basement of fancy suburb. And suddenly there's now the sewing machine incident.

375
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.310
It turns out there was a sewing circle at this house that Mrs. Campbell,

376
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.610
the aggrievance, Mrs. Gamble Ran.

377
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:30.030
And in this sewing circle they would bring singer sewing machines and one lady

378
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:36.150
turn on her singer sewing machine and its vibration caused the alligator in the

379
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:38.740
basement. All of the alligators in the basement

380
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.453
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

381
00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.360
<v 15>it sounded like a jungle riot from the basement.</v>

382
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.060
But you're saying they were upstairs sewing and below them, these alligators,

383
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.370
the alligators, half of them male go

384
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.160
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

385
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.480
<v 15>when this lady turns on her.</v>

386
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.080
So George Campbell figures out that it was a B flat.

387
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.500
So it was his theory that it was a B flat bed caused the balance.

388
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.730
Was that like the sound they make when they mate or when they fight or when

389
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.210
nobody knew a,

390
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:10.750
if it were true and no one knew why it would be true if it were true.

391
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.140
So I tell this poor girl Barbara [inaudible] from, from [inaudible].

392
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.070
ABC was your producer? Yes. She's like 23 or something.

393
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.580
So you know we're going to do, we're going to hire a marching band,

394
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.730
the high school marching band in full plumage and we are going to go to Florida

395
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.330
to a place that is packed with alligators, a wildlife reserve,

396
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.640
and I'm going to have these plumes high school people play be flat too,

397
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.400
and there's going to be everywhere.

398
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:45.040
So I get the high school band, they get on a bus, I get the ABC crew,

399
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.570
I get the very nervous Barbara Fatina who doesn't know what I'm doing and we

400
00:23:48.571 --> 00:23:51.270
all, we all go out to the Audubon place.

401
00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.010
We arrive and there's this mass of grass and you could see alligators

402
00:23:56.011 --> 00:23:57.210
everywhere. The band gets up.

403
00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.050
<v 17>This is from the TV piece still.</v>

404
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:04.410
The porter from the Cypress Lake high school marching band will now play a B

405
00:24:04.411 --> 00:24:06.120
flat on the French horn.

406
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.710
We have no response.

407
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.060
Mr Porto will now play a B Plat on the Tuba.

408
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.833
<v 16>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

409
00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.020
<v 15>and there's not a sound, not a rustle, not interest.</v>

410
00:24:37.021 --> 00:24:40.020
I'm looking at all these alligators. They don't win. They don't blink,

411
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:43.290
they don't move. They don't care. And Barbara F is looking at me like,

412
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.040
what am I going to do at that moment? A bus pulls in,

413
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:50.910
filled with French tourists who get out to go look at alligators.

414
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
They come down the thing and they see all these gaily dressed Americans in olive

415
00:24:56.851 --> 00:24:59.100
green and large plumes coming out of their head,

416
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.480
which they're not apparently a French.

417
00:25:00.481 --> 00:25:03.750
This is already a Fellini film that you're describing. And so they say, I,

418
00:25:03.751 --> 00:25:06.650
they say what's wrong? And now at this point I'm a little bit sad and,

419
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.100
and you know, and the son I've, I,

420
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:11.760
this prince about three 30 going on four o'clock and it's the winter time.

421
00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:15.600
So we only have til about six before they have sunshine. And I say to them,

422
00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:19.860
this is the situation. So they, they let this guy from the France says, Oh,

423
00:25:19.861 --> 00:25:24.730
you see this is the problem in Michigan, they had, um,

424
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.240
they was in dub in tubs, right? It was in dubs, in Boston, in [inaudible].

425
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.790
So the sound game at from the sewing machine down flew into the

426
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.550
[inaudible] grass and water and mud is a different thing.

427
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.240
You need to go to one of those parks.

428
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.160
[inaudible] well,

429
00:25:47.161 --> 00:25:52.161
they put old alligators in concrete [inaudible] like it's like the tubs.

430
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.550
So I said, okay, that's the thing to do. So now the people from France,

431
00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.510
they get in there bus, the bus, the musicians, they get in the bus, their bus,

432
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.740
George, his wife,

433
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.240
they're hanging on and the ABC crew and Barbara Feeding in the bus and we all

434
00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:10.230
drive to, I want to, it's on, it's in the piece. Lester pipers,

435
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.100
everglades wonder gardens on old route 41 now where you arrive and there's,

436
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.810
there are, there are 50 alligators in poured concrete sitting in islands.

437
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.200
My camera crew is so certain that nothing is going to happen,

438
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.860
that they get into the pit standing on these concrete islands,

439
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.390
not inches from these alligators.

440
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.920
And the sun is now kissing the tops of the trees.

441
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.450
So Fidelis says, Robert, we have one shot. I mean,

442
00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.830
do something. I can't go back to New York with nothing.

443
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.980
I have nothing. And the friends one, you just need to do,

444
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.570
<v 11>put it in the concrete. You may be fine. You saw the fringe.</v>

445
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.900
Everybody's there. Yes. And then so then we, um,

446
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.630
we're standing there and uh,

447
00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:58.210
<v 17>one more time. First the French horn.</v>

448
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.273
<v 16>Uh,</v>

449
00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.290
<v 17>okay. The Tuba</v>

450
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.320
[inaudible] there's a kind of quiet

451
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.860
and then there's a kind of a bubble knowing the first thing that an alligator

452
00:27:18.861 --> 00:27:21.710
does when it's about to Bello is it shakes its rib cage.

453
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.420
So all of a sudden it's like the whole pool of water turned to ginger Ale.

454
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.190
It's this plus a plus e plus e and then all the males were just half of the male

455
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.940
PT animals in this thing. All of them all at once. Make that

456
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:46.450
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

457
00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:51.070
<v 11>This is the sound that Mrs. Campbell sewing circle heard coming up through the</v>

458
00:27:51.071 --> 00:27:51.904
basement.

459
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.000
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

460
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.760
<v 11>they start to pray. She's from North Africa. I don't know what she's doing.</v>

461
00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.920
Did the French people [inaudible] told de George

462
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.630
and when that piece aired,

463
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.410
it was my first taste because it was so our people, you know,

464
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:19.080
like you get a base, you get an audience, uh,

465
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.410
like say four and a half million or something in a primetime show and then you

466
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:23.950
get all the people who are clicking through, right?

467
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.180
So those are called the butterflies. So I was given,

468
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:30.900
I still have the chart of what happened that night on television.

469
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.300
Like people were looking and clicking,

470
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:36.420
and then they see this man with the pole with the Tuba and the alligators in the

471
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.650
corner and the French guys and the audience goes, but you couldn't put,

472
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.740
you couldn't, but you can. I'm hearing like 3 million people every minute.

473
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.600
That time I had such a high, whatever. That score is like unbelievable.

474
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:49.730
I'm joining.

475
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.420
The next week I did something on the Internet and porn and it went actually the

476
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:56.880
actually opposite direction, which was a whole nother story.

477
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.570
But for that week I was like, you are king. I was king

478
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.320
<v 18>and he still is.</v>

479
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.940
<v 11>[inaudible] was this, it wasn't an unpleasant experience before,</v>

480
00:29:13.941 --> 00:29:17.390
you know, talking about myself. Is it something I don't mind doing ever?

481
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.910
<v 18>You just fell into it. Yeah. Thanks for listening. I'm by myself.</v>
