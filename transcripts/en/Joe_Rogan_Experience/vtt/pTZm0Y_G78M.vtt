1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.620
Man, boom, and we're live.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.520
What's happening baby? What's up Joe? How aii brother. I'm feeling great man.

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:10.590
Thanks for having me. You're looking great. Thanks.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.320
When you're looking around the large, I threatened Joe before the show. I said,

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.410
you need to start off and tell me how beautiful. I am. Strong and pretty.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.210
Wait, there's that your tee shirt company. Yeah, that's my clothing company.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750
It's also bunker branding and basically that's,

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.910
that's basically what this like a fist from your face.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.680
I'm just afraid that everyone's going to hear me breathe like a fat Gal,

10
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.840
you know? How much did you do any cardio? I do most suddenly. Yeah.

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.770
If you watch strong men on, on the experiment, so like when you pull a truck,

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.550
let's 70,000 pounds and you pull it for a hundred feet with a harness,

13
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.690
restraining your chest, like not expulsion, but your chest expansion.

14
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.340
That's the hardest cardio I've ever done. I played football for a long time,

15
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.270
so I mean I can only imagine.

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620
I was thinking that like you have to have some cardiovascular strength to do

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:00:59.790
some of those routines. Some of the,

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.490
some of the different challenges that you guys have to do for sure.

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
And normally like worlds, we'll start with like what we call load mentally.

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.510
So you'll have normally like four implements,

21
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.690
like you'll have two kegs and two sandbags and the kegs,

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.200
we'll both weigh 265 pounds and the sandbags will be three 30.

23
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.070
That's what we did last year, which was fucking brutal. But, um,

24
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.720
you'll have to load each one of them onto a platform that's about 60 feet away.

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.830
So, you know, if you get going, you can, it's not just cardio.

26
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.830
You have to have dye from strength to like, if you've got a weak diaphragm,

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.090
you're just going to fold.

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
I've seen guys blackout on and I've seen guys blackout at world's strongest man.

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.670
So what does that, how does it, how does one strengthens their diaphragm? Um,

30
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
what we do, the normal exercise we did, um,

31
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.660
it doesn't really have a name. It's just kind of something we made up.

32
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.730
You'll lay on your back and you take like a sand bag and put it over over your

33
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.790
or your upper abdomen and you'll expand. And you'll push out really hard.

34
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.650
And um, would you try and hold it for like say,

35
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.780
say like two minutes and you learn to take tight little breaths while flexing

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.590
your up upper abdominal abdominals. Whoa, I can spoke.

37
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.790
So you've got the weight on you right? And you just,

38
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.610
and you stay flexed and it's like, you know how you see fighters taking punches?

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.610
Like just to keep tight. Same similar thing. And so like me, I, I,

40
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.370
I have a big barrel gut, like a big chest and gut, but like it's solid.

41
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.470
I literally get like, I'll brag a little bit.

42
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.450
I've got side abs in the morning sometimes.

43
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.160
Actually I gotta say this I the best compliment I was ever given.

44
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.300
I put up a post and it was me drinking coffee in the morning just naked.

45
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:43.140
But like from like the hip up and somebody gave me a compliment.

46
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:46.170
That's actually comes from something you said. They said, damn,

47
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.790
Robert's got a really good dick root.

48
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.240
I think I vented Dick Route. Dick route is when those dudes, oh,

49
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.680
I don't understand why dudes do that.

50
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.130
They wear their shorts so low that you basically see the top of their cock

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.260
<v 1>and you see the root. We've got nothing else to show.</v>

52
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.330
So that's a weird weird move.

53
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.280
If you made a little Dickert that's all it comes up is just hey invented it.

54
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.830
I appreciate it. There was a very nice compliment.

55
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.180
Congrats on the Dick Root Bro.

56
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.700
It's just a weird thing that, I mean when did guys start doing it?

57
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.520
I get girls doing it, I get it. Right.

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.920
I just don't get guys pulling their shorts all the way down low.

59
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.220
Like that seems like you're just asking to get pants.

60
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.110
Like I don't understand like sagging I guess it like it comes out of prison

61
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.550
culture from what I heard.

62
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.200
I hate it now but I feel like I'm old man cause I used to do it as a kid used to

63
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.820
sag. Well I grew up in an area,

64
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.050
it was like it was a very low income area.

65
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.700
I don't know how to say that politically correct way to say it.

66
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.930
So like everybody was sagging. Yeah, like boxer shorts underneath.

67
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.980
You learned.

68
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.610
See when you start off with tidy whities and then everyone makes fun of you and

69
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.680
you're like, oh, right where I sit. You switched to boxes.

70
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.970
What a weird like style. Yeah.

71
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.640
I ran out of that by the time I was like 12 though. I was like,

72
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.680
this is ridiculous. Well,

73
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:12.760
my problem is like if somebody like grabs your pants, like you're done,

74
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.261
like you,

75
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:15.910
you're going to have to reach for your pants and then they're going to punch you

76
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:18.960
in the face. Like this is a tech. You're like asking your,

77
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.870
you're were like at a handicap. You sound exactly like my father right now.

78
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.190
Exactly what he would say. You're going to get your ass kicked.

79
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.140
I have friends that tried it like even 10 15 years ago, like guys my age.

80
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.020
I was like, Whoa, fuck, are you doing, it's still, they don't,

81
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.230
the thing now is skinny jeans and sagging, which is like, I don't know.

82
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.540
Counterproductive in a way I look. It just doesn't seem like it goes together.

83
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.760
Right. They're trying to combine styles and understand what they're doing. Yeah.

84
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.950
Well, I mean, if they've got a good enough dick route,

85
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.180
then maybe that's what it is. Like they just got to show the quad.

86
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.100
Like do you wear regular jeans or do you wear like stretchy type jeans?

87
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.580
Jeans. These are stretch. I love those man.

88
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.070
You can can't go back to regular jeans once you wear like rev towns or you know

89
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.100
barbells or any of those kinds of fuck all those regular jeans. You can't man.

90
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.690
No, I mean I ripped so many jeans just kind of sitting down. You know?

91
00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:13.930
I think with your size,

92
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.250
like it must be fucking so hard to just find clothes and northern I'm built

93
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.040
differently. Like my waste is a,

94
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.050
is like a 40 but my instinct is like a 34 and so normally like if you find a 40

95
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:25.781
waist,

96
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:30.781
it's like a 28 or a 30 like so it's like for a shorter like try the guys.

97
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.670
Yeah. So still say fat guys and no one gets mad. Have you say fat girls?

98
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:39.760
People like, Hey yeah, oh, am I selling sensitive?

99
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.530
But fat guys don't catch a break.

100
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.390
Fuck about fat guy with the fat guys fucking deal with it. That guys are happy.

101
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.240
They're fat sometimes to them. That's a difference. Like fat girls,

102
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.810
we'll pretend they're happy, they're fat, but they're really sad on the inside,

103
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.020
so there you go. But fat guys, if they, especially if they drank, they're like,

104
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.130
Huh? Like per pressure.

105
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.890
Burke Chrysler does not seem to give a fuck that he's fat. No,

106
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.320
he does not have a problem with it. No. Takes his shirt off.

107
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:07.610
The moment he gets on stage doesn't care. He'll do it on, on daytime TV. Yes.

108
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.940
Doesn't people get mad at him? Well,

109
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.580
if he doesn't take his shirt off people like, hey, come on.

110
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.110
You're the sac guy that gets naked. Get naked. Dance Monkey. Yeah,

111
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.020
take it off. That's part of your Gig. It's like, what's his name?

112
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.780
A Gallagher without a watermelon, right? No sledgehammer.

113
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.240
Get the fuck out there. Let's, speaking of him,

114
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.840
what are you guys thinking for sober October? We really haven't decided yet.

115
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.590
The Burt wanted us to do some dance contest and you can suck my dick because he

116
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:36.830
wanted to do that so he could just win without working hard to just take his

117
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:41.810
clothes off and crazy. Woo Right. No chance.

118
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.160
But this about this,

119
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:48.161
what if they found a way to like score a dance thing a in a like so there is no

120
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.210
judgment and it was like points based on athletic types of movements or

121
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:54.044
something like that.

122
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.860
I'm sure like the Internet could come up with a way that it's like,

123
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.270
cause I understand what you're saying and what you're saying makes total sense

124
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:02.570
about how like you earned that shit. You want it to be regulated.

125
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:03.450
Not Someone's opinion.

126
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.070
Last year cause last year we literally were killing ourselves.

127
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.060
We were working out seven hours a day and I was just trying to grind those guys

128
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.090
in the ground. I was like I'm just going to take you to deep water and see.

129
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.740
It was awesome man. I loved it. I fucking loved it. I couldn't stop watching.

130
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.960
All part was talking shit and that's when I was like, oh,

131
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.400
I cannot have this guy when this is not going to happen.

132
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.360
That's where you fuck up.

133
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.700
I knew Ra was going to be a problem because he's crazy.

134
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.890
I tried really hard but he just didn't have a lot of experience grinding like

135
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:32.720
that his best.

136
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.950
He hung in there like you're a vet with that shit. Yeah.

137
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.570
Burt's trying to win this with fucking style points. He can fuck off. No, no.

138
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:42.740
I think if if, if,

139
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.300
if somebody can come up with a way that dancing is like regulated in a point

140
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:51.440
system that does nothing to do with people's opinion to where like it's,

141
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.290
I don't know even how you would do that way.

142
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.480
It's like there's an athletic type of movement that's required for this,

143
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:00.140
so learning that takes this and gives you, that gives you points.

144
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.650
That's the only way it would even work where it wasn't based on someone's

145
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.500
opinion. It's too much time too. That's the part of the problem.

146
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.850
It's like learning how to dance.

147
00:08:07.851 --> 00:08:12.851
Like I did a movie once a zookeeper and I had to learn how to do this elaborate

148
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:17.090
dance with Leslie Bibb. That shit took forever,

149
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:18.420
weeks and weeks.

150
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.610
And you're like constantly training and drilling and going over the movements

151
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.970
and I don't even like that kind of thing. It's not like,

152
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.420
like if I'm doing martial arts and I'm training, I'm interested. That's,

153
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.580
I love that. I want to, I want to get better at it.

154
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.490
I didn't want to get better at dancing. I just want it to be over.

155
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.320
I just wanted to film the scene so I could fucking relax. Yeah, move on. Yeah.

156
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:43.250
So I don't know what we're going to do. We haven't decided. We're all waiting.

157
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.750
Yeah, I just said we should have a hold your breath competition. Oh,

158
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:52.310
that'd be cool. Yeah. Underwater. That takes practice. I mean,

159
00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:56.010
I think you guys have to be off to add something in. My favorite part of

160
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.530
<v 0>it was seeing you be like, no, fuck this.</v>

161
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:03.240
Like we'll all go to the gates of hell. That's me. Like if someone, if someone,

162
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.310
I love talking trash, right. That's my thing. And in strongman,

163
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.450
it's not very popular. Like when I got in. Oh No, they don't.

164
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.720
It's very old school. Like you're supposed to do your work,

165
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.430
not act like you're supposed to get paid,

166
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:16.890
not act like you're supposed to want any attention,

167
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:19.710
not draw any attention towards yourself. Really. It's like,

168
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.150
it's like karate in like 1961, like it's school,

169
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.770
you know, be respectful of the way. And I totally get that. I understand that.

170
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.210
And I mean,

171
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.020
I don't think anyone can get to the top echelon without having that respect,

172
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.030
but it's,

173
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.210
it's ridiculous for people who've never been at that on that, uh,

174
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.890
on that level to tell other people how they're supposed to behave.

175
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.370
If I want to talk shit, I'm going to talk shit. I too,

176
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.060
like I was told I was talking shit to you when we first started coming out.

177
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.300
That's just what we do. It's fun. It's talking shit is fun. And also it's like,

178
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.590
I feel like that makes it more entertaining and we want more eyes on the sport.

179
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.410
Exactly. I mean, that's what my, my argument about d UFC,

180
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.190
I always like it when people talk some shit. Right. And, and win or lose.

181
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:08.220
Sometimes you have to eat that. Like, what's that? The kid that been aspirin.

182
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.670
Exactly. A flat line. That was brutal. But I mean,

183
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:14.640
he also took that on the chin. He put up a post like right after that like,

184
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.310
well that sucked. Yeah. He takes on sham better than anybody.

185
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:22.070
He's got a great personality and massive all said, it's not even over. Listen,

186
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.510
he goes, I don't like that dude. He goes, if I see him at whole foods,

187
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:25.920
he's getting smacked up. Oh Shit.

188
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.550
I can't imagine the guy flatlines you with the fucking fastest ever.

189
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.820
Kao and UFC history and he's promising you that if you're looking for Brussels

190
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.910
sprouts smack in the face. Yeah. Oh Man.

191
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.460
He already gave him two extra shots of the face, which by the way,

192
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:41.280
people are giving him shit for. It's, that's his job. Yes.

193
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.830
It's go to the referee stops you. Well,

194
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.000
especially when there's a heated contest like that where you talk so much shit

195
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.570
and and salted Mazda dolls,

196
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.410
manhood he talked about isn't ethnicity taught these weeds.

197
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.010
He said a lot of shit that really pissed Mossville off. Right? And he's like,

198
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:00.600
why didn't he had a statement? I was like,

199
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:04.500
why is it okay to talk all this shit online about me before the fight?

200
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.430
But then after I knocked him out, I'm not supposed to showboat.

201
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.690
I'm not supposed to celebrate. Get the fuck Outta here.

202
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.740
If you've got a problem with it, stop him winters. Get to do what they want.

203
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.230
He's ice cold man. When he said it's not over,

204
00:11:16.231 --> 00:11:20.880
if I see this kid smacked off like, oh my God, that is so intense.

205
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:27.090
Savage that I loved though was so brilliant because aspirin always grabs your

206
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:30.300
legs and if you get that close to him, he's going to think like,

207
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:33.900
almost like he has to grab you. Right. It's his instinct. And you saw him,

208
00:11:33.901 --> 00:11:36.930
like I saw somebody put a video up in practice and he would,

209
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.650
he rounded up like out to the outside and then acted as if it was going to be

210
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:44.040
just a normal step. And then it's two quick steps on the knee. Oh,

211
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.730
and you see how stiffy was before he hit the, I'm sure you saw, but damn,

212
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:51.720
he was, his head was up and then one leg was up. I mean,

213
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:54.120
he was stiff though. That was a row

214
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.560
<v 1>here. Here he was practicing. Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.290
It was in an absolutely roomless Keio and it's the fastest ever UFC Kale at five

216
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.510
seconds.

217
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.980
But really he was out cold at 2:00 AM he just took the rough a few seconds to

218
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.160
get there. Yeah, whatever. Maybe three, I guess. Maybe. I mean,

219
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:15.040
whatever it took for him to run over there, it seems like two seconds.

220
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.270
Who was like one, 1000 totes over? Oh yeah.

221
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.640
Oh fuck. Well I used to got a lot of facetime before he got in the ring. Yeah.

222
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.170
And you ever thought about fighting as big as you are? No. Um,

223
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.170
I mean I messed around with like wrestling and stuff.

224
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:35.110
I know I work with John Jones with the supplement company for awhile. Oh really?

225
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.590
Yeah. Then I know a lot of fighters. I know a lot of old school wrestlers.

226
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.080
I've got a lot of like friends in the industry, but I'm,

227
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.450
I'm fucking old school wrestler wrestlers are pro wrestling pro wrestlers site.

228
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.370
Yeah, the totally different thing. It's just,

229
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.010
but still that would be a great avenue for you to write.

230
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.940
I did think about that for a while too. It's just a contractually it's just,

231
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.070
it's a shit show I'm sure like injuries and all that stuff too would take you

232
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:02.560
out of competition, but plus they want the, why am I now?

233
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:08.230
I started and worked my ass off just to get like a little piece of that pie and

234
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.830
when you go to the WWE or something, something like that,

235
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.920
you have to step back all the way, all the way to the ground level.

236
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.610
You have to earn your stripes and I understand that. But like I have,

237
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.860
I have a son, I have a family. I take care of people,

238
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:23.590
I can give up everything that I've earned,

239
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.700
like basically breaking myself for five years just to crawl back up and

240
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:31.780
hopefully, you know, end up where I am. But, you know, it's a cool thing.

241
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:34.390
I also almost a big fan of wrestling when I was a kid, you know,

242
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:37.840
back in the day. And uh, you know, like I love watching it go on.

243
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.810
One of my buddies right now, a guy who was a strong man with me,

244
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.800
his name's Bron Stroman and he's in the WWE. He's a, he's a bad ass,

245
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:46.330
so I love watching him do it sometimes.

246
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.750
Do you follow Pooja ski fighting and MMA? I haven't,

247
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.470
I haven't seen a lot of his MMA stuff. I know, I know him and I've watched him.

248
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.050
He's, he's freaking crazy man. He's fucking people up too, man. He's,

249
00:13:57.051 --> 00:13:59.920
he's really getting better. Like when he first started fighting,

250
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.220
he was just this giant dude who's just swinging arm punches and if he hit you,

251
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:09.270
he would fuck you up. But he got crazy and he decided to fight Tim Silvia,

252
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.000
who is a former UFC heavyweight champion. And Tim beat the shit out of him.

253
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:16.960
It was horrible. Like I don't know why he thought he could beat Tim. Sylvia.

254
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.070
He thought that Tim was washed up or older. How old is to know?

255
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.650
How long has he been out of the game? He's definitely in his forties. Yeah. Um,

256
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.440
I don't know. How old is Tim? Tim's dry and now you know,

257
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.040
like four pounds for today. See that's me. I'm foreign and pounds.

258
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.830
I can't cut both my legs off to make two 65.

259
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.970
I think that's so weird that they have a two 65 cutoff.

260
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.270
Cause heavyweight is supposed to be the biggest guy. Like in boxing.

261
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.770
You remember that Dude Value Webb who fought? He who did he fight?

262
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.740
He fight failed.

263
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.030
<v 0>He was like seven feet tall is his giant ass Russian dude.</v>

264
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.350
He was fucking enormous. His boxer, but he was well over 300 pounds,

265
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.920
seven foot tall. It'd be skinny at three. He was big man.

266
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.960
He had gigantic Titus or whatever it is.

267
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:07.700
When you move the pituitary gland tumor,

268
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.860
what does that see if you can find that guy value of who I think he fought

269
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.500
Holyfield I think Holyfield peed him for the title,

270
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.170
which is even crazier when you think of that.

271
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.820
Holyfield started his career at 109.

272
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:24.530
He started his career as a cruiserweight 95 pounds. I don't know. Yeah, yeah.

273
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:28.760
That's it. Here's the Guy Evander Holyfield and value of,

274
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.550
and this is in 2008 leave the size of that guy man.

275
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.180
And he get the fuck out of here. He's so big man.

276
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.210
But I think when a guys are that big,

277
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.800
like with that giant Titus or GI can't tie to say that they're always hurting.

278
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.700
Like everything hurts.

279
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:47.510
Your knees hurt your elbows and like you can't really move that good.

280
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.050
I know a lot of guys, Andre the giant was my hero growing up.

281
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.860
Like he was like my first real hero and um,

282
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.190
I knew a lot of guys who had known him.

283
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:59.990
I actually met a Roddy Roddy Piper like three weeks before he passed and I was

284
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:01.980
wanting to name him Andre the giant shirt. And we,

285
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.180
we got to sit in a VIP section at a, at a baseball game and he was ass man.

286
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.100
He was so cool.

287
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.330
I wanted to get that guy on the podcast and Tony Hinchcliffe was actually trying

288
00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:14.450
to set it up, but then he died. Yeah. He used to go to the comic store a lot.

289
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He'd even went on stage a couple times there.

290
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.830
He would just tell stories, man. He was awesome. He was,

291
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.490
he was like one of the first guys also to crossover into movies.

292
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:30.020
Obviously Andre was first, he did a few guest spots. Yeah.

293
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.930
But uh, he was a star of day live. Remember that?

294
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.860
Which is like the John Carpenter movie. That's a great fucking movie. Huge.

295
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.430
Yeah. So he was in that too. Cool. He was a fun guy, man.

296
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.930
There were actually, um, what I was, what we're doing the whole,

297
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:49.460
basically the reason I was here to talk about TV show this next season,

298
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:53.270
season two we're going to do we, so I'll start over.

299
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840
The whole TV show is based on us doing acts of strength throughout for strong

300
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:01.860
men throughout history. So what is the name of the show called?

301
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.900
The history strongest man and strongest man and ESPN show. It's on history. Oh,

302
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.680
it's on history channel. Oh, that's awesome. So, um,

303
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.530
one of the episodes is next season we're hoping to do is Andre the giant,

304
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.430
which we're gonna talk about.

305
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.760
But what we do is we travel to where a historical strongman lived or where he

306
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:21.310
did this famous feed of strength. And we,

307
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.710
we recreate those feats of strength and we kind of talk about who they are as

308
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.480
people and stuff and bring the light,

309
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:31.250
like a lot of the cool aspects that most people lose. So like it'd be cool to,

310
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.851
you know,

311
00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:35.510
take somebody like Andre the giant and like meet with his daughter and figure

312
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:38.750
out like little parts that people haven't really paid attention to and bring

313
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:40.970
that to light. We did. Um,

314
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.850
one of my favorite episodes we did was this Guy Peter Francisco, who was a,

315
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.040
he was born in [inaudible] think it was a

316
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.300
<v 2>Colombia. I'm, I'm, I'm on my mind. Mistaken paradigm and Cisco, there we go.</v>

317
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:59.010
The Virginia giant in Portugal. There you go. So he was born to like, um,

318
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.780
a wealthy family and was kidnapped and sold as a slave and he ended up,

319
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.520
uh, in, in America and at 16, he signed up to fight for a,

320
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.030
in the revolutionary war. He was six foot seven, six foot eight.

321
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.550
Just this giant of a man, especially 17, seven. Wow.

322
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.260
<v 3>Oh yeah. There was nobody that big back then. You know,</v>

323
00:18:18.261 --> 00:18:20.270
like a lot of people don't realize Jack Johnson,

324
00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:23.240
former heavyweight champion who they called the Galveston giant.

325
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.500
I think he was only six, three or six. Two or six pole.

326
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.120
Jack Johnson's y'all big. It was towered over everybody else. He fought. Yeah.

327
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.930
Like Rocky Marciano was 185 pounds, 89 pounds. Like somewhere around there.

328
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.450
He says he was only six foot tall.

329
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.120
But what that's what Google puts popped up from. It's like Wikipedia. Hm. Uh,

330
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.640
I think he's a little taller than that, but he was a giant back then.

331
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.700
They called them the Galveston giant. Well, everybody was so poor.

332
00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:53.120
Then they didn't have any food. You know the turn of the century.

333
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.040
Everybody's struggling. That's crazy. That's crazy.

334
00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:02.930
This was six two Jack Dempsey. Six one wow. And Marsianno I think it was five,

335
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:05.660
ten five times believe it was fun.

336
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.330
I think Marciano's five 10 185 pounds.

337
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.370
It's crazy because Jack Johnson towered over everybody and was fucking everybody

338
00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:17.240
up. I mean it's a food thing, man. No one had any fucking food back then.

339
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.240
If you look at the size of the people that fought during the civil war,

340
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.010
they were tiny ass people. Like really tiny, like 125 pound men.

341
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.650
I can't even go back further. All the scouts Fisher,

342
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.780
him like they make an out like he's giant.

343
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.360
Like look at the picture on the right, look, look at his back, look at his back.

344
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.160
He is, he is pretty direct. Pretty Gash war.

345
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.940
He's definitely jacked for, I mean look, he's,

346
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.380
he's big but I mean in comparison to a real heavyweight today,

347
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.840
like if you put him next to Anthony Joshua,

348
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.220
you know like Josh would be tolerant or Deontay wilder was six. He was he six,

349
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:53.720
seven, yeah. Or Frances and Gando, you know,

350
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.680
big giant dudes, real legit giant dudes. People that weren't that big back then.

351
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.980
So that guy, the wrestler, the Portuguese Guy,

352
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.740
I must've been unbelievable to see someone that big back.

353
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.020
<v 2>Same. Yeah.</v>

354
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.340
And what was cool is like there's a lot of cool things that you find out like

355
00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:10.360
George Washington,

356
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.080
how to quote on his gravestone that was said that there were several battles

357
00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:16.000
that we would not have had go the same way.

358
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:19.180
And we don't know if we would've even been able to win the war if it wasn't for

359
00:20:19.181 --> 00:20:23.650
him. Why it was a one man army for George Washington to stay that,

360
00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:27.250
that's huge. That's crazy. So it was cool to get to talk about him and,

361
00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:30.250
and all the things he had done and bring, you know,

362
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.300
show a little love for a guy who I'd never even heard of. You know,

363
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.820
like there was the story. He was on the battlefield and uh,

364
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.380
he was pulling people off of horses and like basically beating them to death

365
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.610
cause we ran out of bullets.

366
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.440
And then as he goes marching up towards this guy who pulls his musket to shoot

367
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:48.910
at him and the Musket misfires.

368
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.970
He takes the Musket from him and beats him to death with his own musket.

369
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.780
Oh my God. Stuff like that. Or when the, when the battle was over,

370
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.930
they had a canon stuck in the mud and this is one of the feats of strength we

371
00:20:58.931 --> 00:20:59.530
did.

372
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.470
They had a canon stuck in the mud and he didn't want the British to end up with

373
00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:04.920
it. So he just yanked the thing off of the wheels,

374
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.510
puts it on a shoulder and marches off with it. How much does it weigh?

375
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.530
It depends. Depends on the story that you believe. When we went,

376
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:14.050
I don't want to get too much into it, but when we went,

377
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:17.920
that's the biggest question was because anybody who's ever lifted a bunch of

378
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.950
weight and thrown things around, it's like, that sounds pretty crazy.

379
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.880
Cause cannons can go from anywhere of like, like a normal field.

380
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.800
Canon will be like 300 pounds,

381
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.230
but they've got field cannons from that era that are thousand pounds. And,

382
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.440
and depending on who tells the story, that's what you found,

383
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:38.830
which we try and figure out where the fuck would you even get that on your

384
00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:40.390
shoulder if it's in the mud,

385
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.650
<v 3>the mud. So you don't have a firm ground to push off against. Right.</v>

386
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.650
So we're in the port court squashing around the mud and you've got this giant

387
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:53.180
canny you're trying to throw in your shoulders, no handles, fucking amen.

388
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.460
Right after

389
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.830
<v 2>battle to the guy was the guy was a savage. It was, it was really cool.</v>

390
00:21:57.831 --> 00:21:59.660
And then afterwards the,

391
00:21:59.661 --> 00:22:02.960
he ended up a wealthy man and was taken care of and you know, and it was,

392
00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.660
it was a really cool story. So it was,

393
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.540
I was like actually pretty proud to get to tell that one. That's awesome.

394
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.710
A lot of them were like that.

395
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.470
How did you get involved with doing strongman competitions? Um,

396
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.120
I played football, I played football for a long time and then, you know,

397
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:20.120
football was done with me and I basically, I was just,

398
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.710
I didn't want to have a real job,

399
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.300
just to be totally honest. I'm not a,

400
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.450
not a nine to five sitting in an office guy. Anybody is.

401
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.330
I don't think so either. I really don't. That's terrible way to live.

402
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.790
And so in this people listening right now, they're like,

403
00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.810
that's what I'm fuck this place, get out. And I,

404
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.030
you can some telling you,

405
00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.960
I convinced one of my best friends to quit his job and come with me to China for

406
00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:48.230
a week and then of course you have to struggle and find your way.

407
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.750
But then after that it was, it was the best thing you've ever,

408
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:55.170
<v 3>we're done. Yeah, definitely better off being a nomad. Yeah. Is Fine.</v>

409
00:22:55.171 --> 00:22:58.500
Something you, you'll be, you'll feel, feel better. You know. Exactly.

410
00:22:58.501 --> 00:23:01.570
Like I was talking to a friend of mine today about Thailand at about, uh,

411
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.480
like when I went to Thailand last year,

412
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.770
kind of like reshaped my idea of like what makes people happy because everybody

413
00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:11.940
over there is wearing flip flops and fucking shorts. Everything is real cheap.

414
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.320
Food's real cheap, there's no extravagance and everybody's happy.

415
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.680
And like my friend John Wayne par, he says it's the land of smiles.

416
00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:21.930
That's what he calls it. And I was like, okay.

417
00:23:21.931 --> 00:23:24.590
He lived there and train there for a long time. But I'm like, well, I, I,

418
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.300
I didn't get it until I went there. And I'm like, God damn.

419
00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.110
And everybody's happy, but you'll drive by, you'll see like a fucking kid,

420
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:36.290
a baby sitting on the gas tank of a motorcycle while guys driving and the,

421
00:23:37.101 --> 00:23:39.150
the ladies behind him and she's,

422
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.340
she's holding onto the guy's waist and he's like,

423
00:23:41.341 --> 00:23:43.830
got one hand on the handlebars and one hand on a baby. And I'm like,

424
00:23:43.831 --> 00:23:46.100
what in the fuck am I seeing? They're

425
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 1>wearing flip flops and they're just, everyone's happy. No. [inaudible].</v>

426
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.850
You remember Thailand, but it's like that in parts of China, like rural,

427
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.580
rural parts of China. It's a lot like that.

428
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.940
I've seen like people tied to each other on a, on a motorcycle.

429
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.530
Oh Geez. What a terrible idea. So bad.

430
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.320
[inaudible] sent me a fucking horrible video yesterday of this guy.

431
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:09.560
These two guys are riding like assholes on a bridge,

432
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.430
like with motorcycles weaving in that traffic and one guy loses control of the

433
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:17.330
bike and he hits the cement barrier on the edge of the bridge and then goes off

434
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:21.770
the edge. Oh my God. Yeah. Just watch it. Bang, boom. When he flies off,

435
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.570
it's like all I've been seeing the last week two, we just did this. Here it is.

436
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.080
Jamie. Got It. Ready. Jamie's the fastest Googler in the west. You're on it.

437
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.030
See, these guys are fighting. Look at this. Oh, he touched too. Yeah.

438
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.110
You see him put his foot down and try and collect himself. Watch. Yeah.

439
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.110
And watch. When you see,

440
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.920
when they pull over and you get to look at how far this motherfucker dropped,

441
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.030
like he's done zero. That is, that is,

442
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.380
that's that guy's got his hand in his pockets. Of course it's Florida.

443
00:24:51.381 --> 00:24:55.130
It looks like it. Sure. It's Florida fucking asshole. So it's gotta be Florida.

444
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.900
It probably landed right on an alligator.

445
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.960
He would've been fine with. Now shoot up. I read a story in Florida.

446
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.030
Tampa, Florida course called it. Of course, man,

447
00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.170
it's is a fucking mess, man. I was there for two weeks.

448
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:15.410
I was scared shitless the whole time I've been everywhere. It's Florida.

449
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.760
I was like paying attention to everyone walking around, see like bat salts,

450
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.810
eating people's faces. Everything fucked up happens there. They, uh,

451
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:26.930
they just issued a shoot to kill on Iguanas.

452
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.340
They're trying to get people to kill his money.

453
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.660
Guan apparently there's so many guavas there that they're digging holes under

454
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:36.680
bridges and roads and roads are collapsing. Yeah.

455
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.960
Buildings are collapsing because they're digging.

456
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.230
They're digging trenches under the foundations. That's so crazy.

457
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:46.250
And they're big like five feet long. When he got, what's his smile on his face?

458
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.090
Florida Guana Hunter mistakes pool boy four Ilana shoots him

459
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.900
Florida. You gotta get your shit together guys. Come on. Not going to happen.

460
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:00.230
My sister lives in Florida. She's probably listening to this. Laura,

461
00:26:00.231 --> 00:26:05.210
get out of there. Run, run for your lives. Fucking goofy place to live, man.

462
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:09.640
It really is. It's so crazy. It's a goofy place to live. But for people like,

463
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.520
like chaos and party and it's fun. That's, that's, that's what it's all about.

464
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.580
Yeah. My friend Billy Corban, he uh,

465
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.780
made a cocaine cowboys one and two and he fucking loves it down there and he's a

466
00:26:20.781 --> 00:26:24.860
smart guy and he lives in Miami and he just fucking loves it. He, he,

467
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.770
he enjoys the chaos. Yeah. I mean,

468
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:30.650
I guess if you can separate yourself enough that you don't feel crazy on the

469
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.630
inside, cause I don't know how you can, I couldn't do that here now lay like,

470
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:37.640
I mean la is not even a quarter of that,

471
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:40.950
but like I lived in Playa del Ray and in Sherman oaks for two and a half,

472
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.070
two and a half years. And I was like, I gotta the fuck. I know what the problem

473
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.940
<v 3>with this place is,</v>

474
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.720
there's so much instability because there's so many people that want to be

475
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:52.440
something other than what they are. Right. That's a big part of this place.

476
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.460
Yeah. Whereas I, you live in Texas now, days are just, those are people.

477
00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:01.170
Those are real people. I fucking love Texas. They are, they are people.

478
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.620
They don't have any illusions to becoming famous from some fucking reality show.

479
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.000
Or if they do, they're the anomaly. They're not the norm out here.

480
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:11.340
It seems like everybody, well not everybody,

481
00:27:11.341 --> 00:27:14.190
but a Julian percentage of the people that came here came here with some dream.

482
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.240
They came up with some dream of being an actor or some dream of being famous.

483
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.470
Some dream of, you know,

484
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.360
of making it and then they got jobs and so there's this like weird instability

485
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.100
and this, this need for acceptance and this need for recognition.

486
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.460
And you know, you'd go to Montana, you don't get any of that.

487
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.450
You get regular people. You go to Colorado or Colorado is now filled,

488
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.840
was toners Colorado's guys. Now it's getting a little, a little different.

489
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.080
Well now, now that the shrooms are all illegal, their, yeah.

490
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.930
I'm wondering what's going to trying to bring in wolves.

491
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.420
My friend Johnny Hamilton told me they're trying to bring it,

492
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:51.360
they're trying to stop mountain lion hunting and trying to bring in wolves.

493
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.870
Really? What? Yeah,

494
00:27:54.871 --> 00:27:58.410
well they brought in wolves in the 90s to Yellowstone, I remember.

495
00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:01.860
And that went really badly. Right? Well, it depends on who you ask.

496
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.210
The wildlife people think it went really well because it did a lot of great

497
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:09.420
things in terms of like, it preserved, um,

498
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.960
a lot of plant species that were getting decimated by elk and deer.

499
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.041
The problem is like,

500
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.340
it happens so quickly that the elk and deer really didn't understand what was

501
00:28:17.341 --> 00:28:20.120
going on until they were decimated. And they, you know,

502
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.830
some places they've lost more than 50% of their populations,

503
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.650
but then other people say that they really should have never been that high in

504
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:26.484
the first place.

505
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.470
It's hard to understand who's cause like you try to be objective. But you know,

506
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.640
I hunt and I eat a lot of elk and deer. So for me,

507
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.340
I hear it from hunters that it's a terrible thing,

508
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.600
but then you hear it from people that are concerned with balance and wildlife

509
00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:46.350
ecology in a balanced ecosystem. They think it's a good thing.

510
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.930
And so it's a very, it's very controversial.

511
00:28:48.931 --> 00:28:52.470
They don't think there ever should have been these giant herds of elk, you know,

512
00:28:52.471 --> 00:28:56.770
like a thousand elk in a field. They think that's on. That's unnatural. Huh.

513
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.660
And that's akin to what, um,

514
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.060
apparently what they experienced when a lot of the native Americans were wiped

515
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:06.930
out by plague when the European soldiers arrived,

516
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.220
when they talk about these great herds of Buffalo, like millions of Buffalo,

517
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.180
they think that the reason why there were so many buffalo was because like

518
00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:19.380
literally 90% of the native Americans were killed by European disease.

519
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.940
And so these buffalo for the, for the, during that time period that happened,

520
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:27.900
they just bred, like my friend Dan Flores wrote a book on it. Really,

521
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:31.170
really interesting shit because most people just assume that that's just how it

522
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:34.050
was back then. The buffalo were everywhere and then the white man came,

523
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:35.010
shot all the buffalo.

524
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.480
But apparently the buffalo were only s all over the place because the white man

525
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:42.190
came and gave diseases to the native Americans.

526
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.670
<v 1>Right. That's fucking nuts, man. So the balance issue.</v>

527
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.460
So I don't know if it's a good idea to bring wolves around people that are on

528
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.260
mushrooms either. That too. If it was me, I'd try and pet it, you know?

529
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.820
But we're good buddy. I'm reaching out to the forest.

530
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.830
I have a friend of mine, she lives in, uh, a place, uh,

531
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.710
in the mountains above boulder. And, uh, there's MT lines in my neighborhood.

532
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.730
Like, uh, when I was living up there at mount mind ate my fucking dog. And uh,

533
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.710
she, uh, she was like, well,

534
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.980
I just set my intention when I go into the forest and I let the forest know I am

535
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.190
praying, said I'm here for you. She was a yoga instructor. She might be,

536
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:24.010
she might be a little crazy and rest in peace. She's still alive,

537
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.760
apparently still alive now.

538
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.310
My stay mountain's lying. Yeah. But it worked out great for secrete and Roy.

539
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:35.230
Right. There's already caught.

540
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.240
The Colorado already has some wolves that had been in Colorado. They're there.

541
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.550
They're entering in the fringes and from other areas where there they're

542
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:45.850
present. Like my oming, you know, in Idaho there's,

543
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.420
there's wolves that are neighboring Colorado that will eventually make their way

544
00:30:49.421 --> 00:30:52.960
into Colorado if they give it enough time. The reintroduction of wolves.

545
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:53.890
The issue with that is like,

546
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:58.570
it's abrupt and the animals might not know what's going on and they also make a

547
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:03.080
lot of money off of their hunting. Um, the, like the,

548
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.930
the tags and all the, the economy that comes from people that hunt there.

549
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.750
Colorado's a big hunting state. So it was a last, I heard it was those,

550
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.790
there was the big articles they were bringing in into Montana. Right?

551
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:20.510
The giant ones they're bringing in from Canada into Montana. Yeah,

552
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.000
but they're just wolves. Like, it's weird. It's weird. It's a gray wolf for,

553
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.270
it's a gray wolf, you know, it's just a wolf. It's like,

554
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.480
but they are bigger when they live in colder climates because it's a mammal

555
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:35.170
thing. Like mammals, like deers. If you'd like a deer in Texas,

556
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.550
south Texas, a deer, a big deer is like a hundred plus pounds, 150 pounds.

557
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.790
Whereas if you go to Saskatchewan, it's cold as fuck.

558
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:45.790
Those deer like 300 pounds when they're fully grown. Right. Like a big male.

559
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.940
It's like a 300 pound deer, which is crazy. Yeah. The more than double the size,

560
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:51.340
but it's because of the cold. Right. I had never thought about it.

561
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:55.540
That makes sense. I love Texas. What part you live in? I'm in new Braunfels,

562
00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.230
which is right outside of San Antonio. Oh, nice. I've never been in San Antonio.

563
00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.620
It's Nice, man. San Antonio was a cool, shitty.

564
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.960
We're actually right between Austin and San Antonio. Oh, that's great.

565
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.470
It's perfect. This is like that river walk area. Supposed to be dope.

566
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.630
That's cool. I mean, that's like the tourist thing, you know? It's like, um,

567
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.490
it's what they do. It's like go in and see the Hollywood sign. There's, if you,

568
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:16.810
if you want to have a good time,

569
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.930
just let me know when you're coming to Texas and we'll go and do some redneck

570
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:21.450
shit. Well, my Brent,

571
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.050
my friend John Dudley was just there with the black rifle coffee guys. And uh,

572
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.020
they went to some ranch that's just outside of San Antonio that the fucking

573
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:30.430
astronauts used to go to.

574
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.610
He said this least photos of Neil Armstrong with a fucking deer.

575
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:40.610
Hell yeah. Texas. That is a uniquely place. Like when other,

576
00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:43.910
I think when other people think of America, they really think of Texas.

577
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.630
Most people, I mean, if they're thinking America,

578
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:50.810
they'll say that it'll be Texas. But if it's, if it's like Hollywood,

579
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:52.100
they'll say California. You know,

580
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.090
those are the two some people like every once in a while I think New York,

581
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.440
but I think what people think about like crazy gun toting,

582
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.260
screaming at football, you know,

583
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:07.440
like that's Texas guaranteed 100% drive out of box.

584
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:13.100
I'm sure it's a fun place. You know, a lot of fun,

585
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:17.370
lot less regulations, a lot more um, self, uh, self accountability, you know.

586
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.420
Well, they have fucking zebras and giraffes and shit everywhere. They're loose.

587
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.040
Yeah. Running around. I work with, um, with, uh,

588
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.440
a car but just became a credited zoo that works a lot with confiscated animals.

589
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.880
Like they've got hundreds of animals that basically some redneck was like, oh,

590
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:39.620
I'm going to have a white line, can't take care of it. So they take it,

591
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.290
they just folks who they've got high in this abandoned house and uh,

592
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.550
they were in the house in Texas and a,

593
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.880
they're walking around his house smoking weed and they walked into a room with a

594
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:52.490
fucking tiger in a cage. Oh my God.

595
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.960
They called the police and they had to police come in and rescue this fucking

596
00:33:56.961 --> 00:34:00.940
tiger. But this was in an abandoned house. Oh Shit. The house. Oh my God.

597
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.660
There's a, just a T. I mean they weren't sure. Like here you find it here. Oh,

598
00:34:05.661 --> 00:34:07.460
you got these God damn pop up ads

599
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.150
to getting craftier and craftier with these popups.

600
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.950
And then you don't know if like clicking exits gonna download something. Texas.

601
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:18.920
Man, look at this. Texas manager's abandoned home to smoke weed,

602
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:23.060
finds tiger and stylish and stats fucked up, man. Yeah,

603
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:24.380
he thought he was hallucinating.

604
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:30.650
He said it was in a Reiki dink cage in the home's garage.

605
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.670
But it's weird when you treat animals like property,

606
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:37.340
you know when you can just do whatever you want with them. And that's how Texas,

607
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.780
that's how Texas views exotics. Anything that's not like if you're,

608
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:45.260
if you have white tail deer in Texas, they have pretty liberal tags.

609
00:34:45.261 --> 00:34:48.290
Like you can shoot a good number of them, but you have to get tags. Right.

610
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:50.690
But if you have like a, a black buck,

611
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.020
which is an African animal or a Neil guy or something like that,

612
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:57.620
you shoot as many as you want, right? Yeah. They just do whatever you want.

613
00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:59.450
You sell them to your friends. What does it say?

614
00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.050
It was secured only with a screwdriver and a nylons trap. Christ,

615
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.150
I hope this guy got some kind of fucking punishment.

616
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:10.940
The guy who own the fucking house, that's a dick move. Man.

617
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.550
That's a beautiful tiger. Yeah.

618
00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.700
This something really fucked up about seeing tigers locked up.

619
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.910
I don't even like the fact that they feed them. I mean,

620
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:22.520
I feel like you should just let something loose in there.

621
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.780
That's what I was saying. That's what I was saying. But from what I already,

622
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.610
Roland, exactly what I was told was that that was just not a PC.

623
00:35:31.611 --> 00:35:34.150
Like it wasn't acceptable, I'm sure. Do you ever,

624
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.850
do you ever see the footage of when the US soldiers overtook Baghdad? They had,

625
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.120
uh, they had zoos and Baghdad. And what they would do is the,

626
00:35:43.121 --> 00:35:46.290
the lions knew it was happening. So they would, uh,

627
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:50.700
let these goats out and these goats would be wandering around and then they

628
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:53.340
would open the door and aligns would sprint.

629
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.820
Cause they knew exactly what because it was feeding time. Goats had no idea.

630
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.130
They let the goats out and the goats to be like, oh,

631
00:35:59.131 --> 00:36:00.720
just hanging out being a goat.

632
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.940
And then they would open up this fucking door and US soldiers filmed it. Oh.

633
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.230
And these lions just make this fucking mad sprint to these goats and just maul

634
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:14.850
them. And that's how they ate. They both got pissed. People shouldn't be pissed.

635
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:18.330
That's what it is. If you watch a fucking up, you want it,

636
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:22.710
you go and see a parrot eaten seeds. That's what it eats. Right. You know,

637
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.920
may maybe really identify with seeds and you feel like that's brutal.

638
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.640
Myrtle murder of seeds. Yeah. That lion wants to do that.

639
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:33.690
That's what makes them a lion. It makes them happy. It's what they have to do.

640
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.500
You know, it's like there's a lot more, um, people getting published,

641
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.950
not publicity, but there's a lot more people showing that side of things.

642
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.260
At least I was, we were talking about right before we came on,

643
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.250
there's this Instagram page called nature's metal. Yes. I look,

644
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:52.020
I've taken badass taken down for awhile. He had a, he got back up,

645
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:56.460
but he's, he has one of the very best pages on the take it down.

646
00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:57.680
That's all he does. He didn't,

647
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.790
he had nothing to do with any of those situations.

648
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.410
It's not like he like had some kind of ulterior motive and came in and put these

649
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:07.100
animals in the situation. That's just reality today.

650
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.840
Instagram is cracking down hard lately. I don't understand it.

651
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.970
They take all kinds of stuff down for virtually no reason. Hmm. It's weird.

652
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.870
Odd. He's someone that's just to complain enough and they'll take it down.

653
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.590
They need to get that fixed where it's instead of like a computer.

654
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.290
I understand it's a lot, right? It's a, it's a lot of people.

655
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.860
So having a computer regulate that just doesn't work. No,

656
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.740
it's not just a computer regulate that. If someone can target you,

657
00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:34.800
like say maybe you could be doing something and they just decide you're

658
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:39.750
offensive and then just start it like make a targeted campaign to complain about

659
00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:44.490
your content. Yeah. So one of those tattoo girls, she got a, her,

660
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.480
her, her post removed just having her hand above her crotch,

661
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.460
like covering her crotch or legs spread and showing all their tattoos and they,

662
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.480
they took down her her page like she's, but she's covered up.

663
00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.900
Makes no sense. I mean she doesn't have pants on but you can't see anything.

664
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.190
Alright, fuck. Are we doing this? Americans are in legs. Fuck kind of shit.

665
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:08.280
Is this Texas needs to open the new Instagram. What's that?

666
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.130
I say that's different than what nature's metal is though.

667
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.490
He might've gotten trouble for taking life photographers copywritten works and

668
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.740
reposting because she's wildlife.

669
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.120
She's being wildly and that's her natural habitat. She's young. Jamie,

670
00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.900
I was talking about this with a friend of mine yesterday. Would communist? No,

671
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:29.790
like active enforcement. Let's copyright laws.

672
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:33.090
At what point if, if like, you know, youtube, some of the stuff is good,

673
00:38:33.091 --> 00:38:35.770
even on Instagram stumps stuff they let go and some stuff they don't.

674
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.730
At what point are people supposed to understand what is okay and what is not

675
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:42.040
okay? Yeah, it's hard, but you also have to think of it.

676
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.490
How many people are on Instagram? Let's just guess. I don't know.

677
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.630
Let's guess how many people you think I'm not either, but fuck. Let's see.

678
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.990
We think 100 million more than,

679
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.350
there's probably close to a billion, maybe 500 million,

680
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.360
like somewhere in that range I would say. All right,

681
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.200
I'm going to go with 300 million. 300 million in one place.

682
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.650
Jim, you go with a billion. Yeah. How many people are on Instagram?

683
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.820
1 billion people use Instagram every month. Jesus Christ,

684
00:39:11.821 --> 00:39:14.130
but that's 1 billion use. Yeah.

685
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.080
[inaudible] are on that don't even use it.

686
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.750
So it could be like two does that include the Russians

687
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.900
one bill yet? It's a lot. Jesus Christ. That's crazy.

688
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.190
Well Twitter still lets porn happen. He would still have porn on Twitter.

689
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.000
What do I say?

690
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.880
It's just because it has a 18 plus like warning or something like that doesn't

691
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.930
even my feed I I'll be scrolling through my feed like I've got to make sure my

692
00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:43.530
kids will never grabbed my phone cause if they're looking through my phone I'm

693
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.040
like hey the age they might be in there though.

694
00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:48.550
Because when you sign your account you say how old you are and you've built into

695
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.740
the system.

696
00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.540
I'm like sense a lot of those things are protections for people that are under

697
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:55.600
13 and I don't know why there's that Internet rule,

698
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.290
but like there is some government protections they need to be watching out for

699
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:02.650
the miners that are online and that makes sense. But does that happen?

700
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:06.280
Is that the case with like youporn or places like that? You just go there?

701
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:10.570
I don't know but come on. I don't know where the,

702
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:14.680
like if the kid like a kid knows what it is, I don't know.

703
00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:19.480
The line is the coupon. What is this point? How do you get there?

704
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.840
Here's a browser. Do you want to browsers? Well,

705
00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:29.080
when the virtual porn, a fucking world opens up,

706
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:32.140
that's when things are going to get very squirrely. Dunkin said it's too real.

707
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:37.480
Dunkin had an HTC vibe and he was watching porn with the helmet on,

708
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.200
which I only want to be a fly on the wall. Watch him standing,

709
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.930
standing there beating off, looking at a 17 foot tall vagina in front of him.

710
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.820
Haptic suit would be the next step and those are here so I don't know what

711
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:56.200
that's like. If they could sinked it up those, I mean I've done that,

712
00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.190
that place. We talked about the void. You ever do a virtual reality plays?

713
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.450
It's pretty dope.

714
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:06.450
They have a new one that I just saw in Vegas that some new one that was looked

715
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:12.190
like you going to a warehouse and you shooting at things but you a,

716
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:17.191
you put on this helmet and you enter into this room and there was two different

717
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:18.311
ones that I went on.

718
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:23.311
One was a star wars one and one was a wreck it Ralph one and it's crazy man.

719
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.910
You look around, I mean the entire thing is animated like your,

720
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.730
the above you below you, you see the ground, you see storm troopers,

721
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:33.980
they shoot at you, you feel the laser beams hit your chest because you're

722
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.720
<v 3>wearing a vacit that like vibrates.</v>

723
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:39.170
When you get hit and you walk into a room where there's fire and you feel the

724
00:41:39.171 --> 00:41:41.270
heat, it's, it's getting really interesting.

725
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.080
<v 2>When you're in that like a, say this room was empty,</v>

726
00:41:44.081 --> 00:41:48.370
would you walk around as if it was like an entirety? The entirety of the room?

727
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.680
<v 3>Yeah. You can walk around.</v>

728
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.640
They have it set up so that they have rooms that you go into where you open

729
00:41:53.641 --> 00:41:58.641
doors or doors open for you and you see the door open like in virtual reality,

730
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:03.660
but a real door does open while that fake door that you're seeing opens and then

731
00:42:03.661 --> 00:42:08.070
you go into it and then they have these plastic guns that you pick up, you know,

732
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.680
so you actually pick up the gun when you're holding it.

733
00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:14.220
It looks like a stormtrooper weapon or you know, like a star wars weapon.

734
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.820
That's cool man. It's getting weird. It's going to, it's going to be weird. But,

735
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:22.950
but I think what's interesting is like that kind of stuff is so much less

736
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.000
satisfying that to bring it back to like what you do then,

737
00:42:27.001 --> 00:42:32.001
like something that you have to really work for and it's really difficult and

738
00:42:32.701 --> 00:42:35.230
it's a very visceral, real feeling,

739
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.550
like the feeling of accomplishment you get when you do something virtual.

740
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.140
We'll never be able to compare with the feeling that you do when you do a

741
00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:47.340
physical, visceral thing to feel it in your fucking bones.

742
00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.810
<v 2>Yeah. You feel it. You live it. I, uh,</v>

743
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.110
when I was doing world's strongest man in Botswana, Africa,

744
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:58.110
I told my bicep and um, I just was getting beat up over and over again.

745
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.270
I was just so wrecked. My body wasn't accepting cause I,

746
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.390
I had went from football to strong man and in football we'd never done dead

747
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.050
lifts. It was all hand cleans and power cleans, which by the way,

748
00:43:08.051 --> 00:43:10.450
just quick little tip that dead lifts the fear.

749
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.060
If you're dead lifting to be a better dead lift are fine.

750
00:43:13.061 --> 00:43:16.210
If you're not doing that for deadlifts sake, then don't fucking do it.

751
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.540
The risk to reward ratio is a joke for deadlift, for deadlifts.

752
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:21.790
And a lot of people aren't going to like that. I'm saying that.

753
00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.740
But if you go into any NFL gym in any Division One College football gym,

754
00:43:26.741 --> 00:43:30.790
in any athletics where people are actually getting paid and it matters what

755
00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:32.020
they're doing, they're not dead lifting.

756
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.060
We their hand cleaning and power cleaning. Why is that? Because the,

757
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.350
the risk reward ratio, like there's,

758
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.540
it's so hard to be a great dead lifter and to not risk your low back and to be

759
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:47.410
using your upper back properly and you know, just there's so many little uh,

760
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.430
um, chances for you to get hurt, you know, hamstring stuff. That was,

761
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.850
that was me. Uh, my first world's strongest man.

762
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.320
I was the only rookie in the finals. Perot, China. How much weight is that?

763
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.420
That was 880 pounds.

764
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:04.430
<v 3>Me and my pink chucks</v>

765
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.250
<v 2>I way less than that now. I'm less of a bowling ball though.</v>

766
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:12.630
<v 3>Really? Wow. That. Well they made those waits.</v>

767
00:44:12.631 --> 00:44:13.920
Ridiculous looking too,

768
00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.970
<v 2>right? Well nothing. That right there is a something we overhead press too,</v>

769
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:22.110
so they'll take some of the weights out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean

770
00:44:22.111 --> 00:44:22.320
it.

771
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.530
It's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you have out there.

772
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.450
It's just like that and it's fucking brutal.

773
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.040
<v 3>So they take weight out of that round thing. And what is in that round thing?</v>

774
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.290
<v 2>Well, there's several different attachments to it,</v>

775
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:37.200
so maybe some of them way different. I've never like been a part of that.

776
00:44:37.201 --> 00:44:38.100
But uh,

777
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.280
like either that or it unscrews at the end and they take weights out of it and

778
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:45.330
I'm not positive exactly what we leave the NFL or you leave PR playing football

779
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.170
and you were you in the NFL? No, I had a brief shot at it. Never.

780
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:53.220
It never actually got to do it. No, I was. So what, what kind of transition?

781
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:57.180
Like what is the transition to get into strong man went from that to uh,

782
00:44:57.181 --> 00:45:01.260
I was security guard in Santa Cruz at this place called the catalyst,

783
00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.300
which is why I worked for like six years.

784
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:07.350
It's a really cool bar slash concert venue. So I was like spoiled.

785
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:10.840
I got to hang out with Rob Zombie and Willie. That shit. Yeah, it was cool.

786
00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:14.490
I will support Rob Zombie. I geeked out really hard for it. That's dope.

787
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.000
It was fun. Yeah. We're working on getting him here, dude. He'd be awesome.

788
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.670
I'm sure he would be. Yeah, he was really cool.

789
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.350
I'm sure he is really into horror movies, man, dude. And he does the best one.

790
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.250
I love his horror movies, man. They're wild. I'm a huge fan. Huge Fan.

791
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.190
He's like the Quentin Tarantino of whore. Awesome.

792
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.680
But it's such a weird transition, you know? Yeah.

793
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.470
Going from being a rock star to a horror film director,

794
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.240
he's just crazy in the head.

795
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:42.900
And his brother is actually the lead singer apartment 5,000 really? Yeah.

796
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.620
Oh Wow. There's a family. So it didn't,

797
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.440
I went to security and I was working there and a buddy of mine who I'd played

798
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:53.430
junior college ball with was just obsessed with strong men and I'd never heard

799
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:56.130
of it. I never watched it. Like when I was growing up, we were poor.

800
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.030
Like there was 10 of us in a three bedroom house and from high school on like we

801
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:04.770
didn't have electricity. So like we didn't watch TV. We, we would play outside.

802
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:08.670
We had a trampoline and electricity in high school on the weekends my dad worked

803
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:10.050
for Caterpillar Cashman equipment.

804
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.530
So on the weekends he'd bring home a little generator and he'd plug that in and

805
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:15.390
we'd have like three things we could use.

806
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.390
But that was like the hot water heater would work for the weekend.

807
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.420
And then like maybe the TV on Saturday night or something like s t g I f Ah,

808
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.000
I mean it wasn't, I mean, as a kid it's not that big of a deal, you know,

809
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:30.480
like you just go play with your brothers outside. So, but like,

810
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.380
I never knew what strong man was because of that. I mean, I had no idea.

811
00:46:34.381 --> 00:46:39.350
So he was obsessed with it and he kept trying to get me to do it. And then, uh,

812
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.880
w went home and googled it, checked it out. Actually,

813
00:46:41.881 --> 00:46:44.790
I don't know if it was Google, I might've youtube did back then. Who knows?

814
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.940
Who knows what we had. But, um, you know, I,

815
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:52.080
I was excited and went and tried it out. And first day,

816
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:57.290
the amateur world record at log press was like 320 pounds at the time.

817
00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.580
And I had no idea,

818
00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.690
but the first day I hit 330 pounds and just put it down.

819
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:06.180
And I looked over at my buddy and I was like, you know, how'd that look?

820
00:47:06.181 --> 00:47:07.830
And he's like, get the fuck Outta here.

821
00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:13.410
Like he's been trying his whole life to do this. Just came in and took it.

822
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.570
And then, uh, eight months later, I mean,

823
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:19.170
six months later I was competing in England and, uh, had my pro card,

824
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.500
two months after that, I was in China at that photo right there.

825
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.660
[inaudible] man, that was the only rookie in the finals.

826
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.130
So is it the log thing is it, did the awkwardness of like holding onto a log,

827
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.040
getting it into your

828
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.140
<v 0>hands and yeah. And it's, it's actually,</v>

829
00:47:32.141 --> 00:47:35.020
it's a lot healthier for your shoulders instead of being, uh,

830
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.140
how would you call that with your hands right there instead of protonated or

831
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.720
something? Yeah, we get which one is which.

832
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.130
I like it when trainers used that though. You know what you talking?

833
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:47.770
This guy's got his shit together. There's fat duty in French fries.

834
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:52.030
So, um, yeah, I mean, um, so it's better for you.

835
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.340
It's much better for your wrists and your shoulders. And also like,

836
00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:00.490
that's what my hair co's, Jamie Shauna's grip [inaudible] grip.

837
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:04.000
So yeah, neutral grip is much better for your wrists and shoulders.

838
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.410
Okay. Like so handles like this. They say that with bench press as well.

839
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:13.180
Like those benches, they have new bars that have handlers from rogue. Yeah.

840
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.670
Awesome. Awesome road. Makes good equipment. Yeah.

841
00:48:15.671 --> 00:48:19.350
I use all their shit at my house in here. I know it didn't pay me.

842
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.410
It's not free. I buy all of it. Zam here either. But they're the best.

843
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.420
It's the best shit. So, um, we went to worlds and then, oh yeah,

844
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.630
I totally lost the whole game. First of all,

845
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.240
you beat the fucking world record log pressed the first time.

846
00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.670
The world record amateur amateur world here with the,

847
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:43.420
that's hilarious. So it was good. My, that's the pro record right now.

848
00:48:43.421 --> 00:48:48.421
The American records had been mined for four years and that was 211 kilos.

849
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.370
And what does that pound fucking four 68 for like that.

850
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.210
Is this you here as me? Yeah. This is in Australia. In front of Arnold.

851
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:04.630
Jesus Christ sent home. Was there. That's his competition.

852
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.320
This is my competition. This is so this is a log press right here. Yup.

853
00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.070
That's a skinny log too. This was a hard log to use, but a,

854
00:49:12.071 --> 00:49:15.850
this was a buddy of mine had that record and he passed away and I wanted it to

855
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:19.600
be the one to take it from him after he had died and that that was this moment.

856
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.710
Jesus Christ. I looks at it and you show me. Show off a little bit too.

857
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.600
I like to do this after I get it up. Wow.

858
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:32.470
So that's the world record, not on American record. Who's the world record?

859
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.630
The world record. I like to hold it up there and talk shit all.

860
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.620
Every time you see a record broken,

861
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:42.070
the guy gets it to here and then he just throws it down. Don't count.

862
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:43.160
It doesn't count. So the,

863
00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:47.950
the world record is a 219 kilos, I believe.

864
00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.870
Something like that. Something, something right around there.

865
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.410
It might've been two to 20 how closely are you to that? I can,

866
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:58.210
I can break it right now. Oh, in January, Robert, I'm going to London.

867
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.110
I'm going to give London a little introduction to Texas a, uh,

868
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.210
what do you call it? Texas pride and Texas power lifting for sure. Wow,

869
00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:07.180
I'm excited.

870
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.070
So you go and you break the American amateur record right away, first,

871
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.390
first attempt out. And is that when you felt like, fuck I could do this shit?

872
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.380
Yeah. I went home and I told my, my fiance at the time,

873
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.760
we were living in a studio and we were just broke and I was volunteer coaching

874
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.400
and I was, uh, for high school, which is my passion in high school football.

875
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.990
And then I was working at that club at night, so I didn't have a lot of time,

876
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.970
but I was like, I can make this happen. Like with,

877
00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:39.410
with my personality and this is a platform, I can do this.

878
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.250
And everybody kept telling me there's no money in strongman. There isn't any.

879
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:44.151
And there really wasn't.

880
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:48.130
There wasn't like there was no money in strong man until I made money in strong

881
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.090
man, like really brought it into.

882
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.690
There was several other people but like what we did was we cultivated a whole

883
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:58.691
new era of strong men was before like even like Pooja Nowinski was a guy who got

884
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:02.660
a lot of attention because he looked just shred it. You Know Jack,

885
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.490
but I mean if you, if you,

886
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:08.150
he's got like a cribs episode that they did in Poland and he's got this tiny

887
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:10.970
little house with like little knickknacks and stuff he's so proud of.

888
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.470
It's really weird. It's crazy.

889
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.370
But like even then he's five time world's strongest man winner.

890
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.080
There's really no money in that.

891
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:20.940
I would've thought he would've been balling out of control. You would think so.

892
00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:21.883
Cause I know who he is.

893
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.900
I feel like if I know who you are and you do something on TV, you must be ready.

894
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.910
Exactly. That's, that's the rappers. The display. Yeah.

895
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.550
I'm flying in first class and then you'd catch the little bow in the back. Well,

896
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:34.700
I remember one of the weird things that I read about putting now skis.

897
00:51:34.701 --> 00:51:36.900
How Much Candy Heats, Huh? Yeah.

898
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:41.600
And then he really likes a candy in between workouts because he's blowing out so

899
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:46.070
much sugar than he would eat chocolate bars. I makes sense. We do a lot of like,

900
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.070
I do peanut butter and honey, stuff like that during competition,

901
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.740
peanut butter and honey or snickers bars and I eat peanut butter and honey,

902
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.550
you need a spoon? Like how you usually make the sandwiches?

903
00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:58.700
I see guys just pouring honey in their mouth. Like the Russian guys.

904
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:04.320
There's a Russian guy who was a Russian secret service for awhile and this Oh

905
00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.740
yeah, like you look in his eyes,

906
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:10.190
you're like this Martin fuckers done some bad things but he's the nicest dude in

907
00:52:10.191 --> 00:52:12.440
the world. He's, he's like the sweetest guy.

908
00:52:12.441 --> 00:52:15.410
He comes like he always comes over and talks to me and my family and he's,

909
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.620
he doesn't speak good English but he's really nice about trying to get his point

910
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:21.410
across and everything. But um, yeah that,

911
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.660
that guy has done probably scary shit.

912
00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.710
I'm sure there's a lot of that cause we compete with people from all around the

913
00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:30.920
world, you know, and you know, we, uh,

914
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.090
we tend to forget that everywhere else, there's a lot of, it's normal almost.

915
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.730
It'll be like that in some places, right. To survive.

916
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.850
And if you're a giant dude, it's probably the best way to make a living.

917
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.390
Exactly. Yeah. So they just squirt honey in their mouth. Yeah.

918
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.860
They'll just port like,

919
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:48.980
like a whole little canister of honey and just take that,

920
00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.770
you see guys do that right before they go lift and stuff. I'm, I uh,

921
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:54.770
the way I grew up in the, the,

922
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.940
the way I did things like I was always taught and it kind of worked with being

923
00:52:58.941 --> 00:53:03.290
broke, but like a warrior goes to war hungry. That's like in football.

924
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.620
I would never eat before a game ever. And then, um,

925
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.740
got an a strong man and I did that for a long time and I got up to 440 pounds

926
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:17.060
and I would, I would do an entire show, like five, six hours without eating.

927
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:20.750
But then during it I would snack a little bit, but I would never eat a meal.

928
00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:26.210
But then the resources and eats up your resources. Right, right. And See,

929
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.470
for me it felt like anything in my stomach just made me feel like slow.

930
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:35.460
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, too. That's the same with comedy too.

931
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.110
And I learned that from Kat Williams,

932
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:39.690
watching an interview with him just don't eat before you go on stage. I'm like,

933
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:42.430
that makes sense. Yeah. You're better off being hungry. Right.

934
00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.620
Josh do that to the best hunters. They hunt hungry. Yeah. So then,

935
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.380
but what happened to me was I lost 80 pounds.

936
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.610
I was four 40 I lost 80 pounds and when I got hurt in Botswana,

937
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:57.170
I lost all that way. And just because of the bicep tear. No, I,

938
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:01.830
I chose to do that. When I graduated high school, I was 370 pounds.

939
00:54:01.831 --> 00:54:03.210
So I'm always been a big dude,

940
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.670
but I got up to four 40 and just walking around it was laborers, you know,

941
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.940
I felt like fucking horrible. How you, when you did that log press,

942
00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.590
that log press, that was like, like four 25 ish,

943
00:54:16.591 --> 00:54:20.850
four 30 when I run that. So like I gained a little bit more after that. I just,

944
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.700
everyone tells you in the sport, the bigger you are, the stronger you are.

945
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.380
And that kind of holds true to static lifting. Like kind of,

946
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:31.320
it's not necessary all the time, but it kind of holds true.

947
00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.790
But we've got a movement,

948
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.330
like we're talking about pulling a truck and doing those events and all that

949
00:54:36.331 --> 00:54:40.890
stuff when you're four 40 and your body's not agreeing with that for 40,

950
00:54:40.891 --> 00:54:42.180
it just holds you back.

951
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.890
You know what I imagine the load on your joints to particularly lower back my

952
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.260
little buggies. Yeah. So that's what happened.

953
00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:52.980
I had got hurt and I'd felt like I was done cause my low back, I,

954
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:56.520
I'd have to take me like 45 minutes to get out of bed in the morning. Really?

955
00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:00.570
Oh yeah. That was messed up man. Really bad. And then an MRI,

956
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.560
I never got an MRI and didn't, I'm scared to

957
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:09.480
just fucking roll fix it. Uh, when I lost weight, it got better.

958
00:55:09.481 --> 00:55:12.480
And it's core strength for me now. Core strength and stretching.

959
00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.820
And also I smoke weed. Like a lot of,

960
00:55:14.821 --> 00:55:18.450
a lot of athletes are against it and a lot of people think that there's some

961
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:23.670
like negative connotation with being like someone who smokes weed. But I mean,

962
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:26.670
I'm watching guys take Vicodin like a skittles. I'm watching,

963
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.980
I've seen guys throw away their lives, their families,

964
00:55:28.981 --> 00:55:33.900
their career over a bunch of pills because they didn't want to smoke and it's

965
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.920
crazy, you know?

966
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:38.910
And we actually officially got world's strongest man to take marijuana off of

967
00:55:38.911 --> 00:55:41.190
the drug testing. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

968
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.260
This is drug testing and world's strongest man.

969
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.700
Are they making sure you're on steroids to test you though,

970
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.240
make sure you're strong. They test those kind of bitches.

971
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:55.590
Not Enough drugs in the scotch system.

972
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:59.760
Do you know who Robert Frank is the sound familiar? He's a, he's hilarious.

973
00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:04.680
A Instagram guy. I can't recall, but it sounds really familiar. Yeah,

974
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:08.460
he's, he's really funny, man. He's, he's like, he talks like this.

975
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.890
He's really fast. Yes. Yes. He's got this fucking hilarious rant about, uh,

976
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:18.690
someone getting the girl pregnant and taking responsibility and he, and he goes,

977
00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.800
he goes, I have to ask you. He goes, if you're trying to get jacked in, Dan,

978
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.100
what kind of gear are you

979
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.130
<v 1>on? I have to question your gear. If you get your girl pregnant,</v>

980
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.230
what kind of swears do you have?

981
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.050
That guy's got so much energy. I know he's another one.

982
00:56:35.051 --> 00:56:38.800
He gets sensored off of Instagram all the time. They pull his posts and they,

983
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:42.370
he's got a million followers and they won't give him a fucking blue check mark.

984
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.460
That's ridiculous. People understand that. That's our livelihood.

985
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:49.540
A lot of people that social media is how we feed our fucking family. Well also,

986
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:51.160
he's fucking funny,

987
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:55.150
but he's funny with toxic masculinity.

988
00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.840
Toxic because his opinions different. When I love,

989
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:03.280
that's it right there. He's not 10.

990
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:06.920
If red play that is red. He's funny, man. It's funny,

991
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:08.950
<v 4>which I stay the most curious. Okay.</v>

992
00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.870
The week x will flow every check out the call you check.

993
00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:13.830
We want a piece of my poll. I want to tell you a story.

994
00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:15.540
I've got a broker who can, I ruined his life.

995
00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.630
He said my videos give him the motivation to get you these.

996
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.520
Fuck hey showed up to the bar every weekend. We just got to talking to sleeves.

997
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.350
[inaudible] he doesn't host but different.

998
00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.100
Have you coach like fucking boss problem is what I would call them up.

999
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.890
Say she's pregnant now he's blaming me. Fringe reducer to the gate.

1000
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:29.670
First of all,

1001
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:31.830
who the fuck told you to go road talking to if that's how you roll.

1002
00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:33.150
There's plenty of other techniques proven.

1003
00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.820
You get the fruits in the sheets like a sticky belly or sticky lower back.

1004
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:38.140
[inaudible] you get the homes on the side or not.

1005
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.250
I've been told since I was four years old, days of old and next football,

1006
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:44.700
it's kind of [inaudible] around the baby's foot protected.

1007
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.530
That's what he's saying.

1008
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:48.480
Like don't cut me down to stop that pocket because you never know what you're

1009
00:57:48.481 --> 00:57:49.890
going to want the rocket. But when you tell us,

1010
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.080
oh the plus stuff on that ass cause I'll Robert fucking frick and I'm the way

1011
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.510
that it's put in a men's biggest threat.

1012
00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.140
I know you had to store it to get some big before. Oh no,

1013
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:01.200
fucking fours crushed up. My pay to floor stepped up

1014
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:08.340
so close to goal, so I should probably take the talk. Oh fucker. Yeah.

1015
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:16.060
<v 1>It's funny shit man. It's fucking funny shit.</v>

1016
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.390
And he can't get a a, he can't get approved and they,

1017
00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:23.020
they've gone through publicists. They've tried to get him.

1018
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:25.960
What does it recognize? What is it called? Verify. Verify.

1019
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:29.050
Try to get them verified. Try and get that blue check mark next to his name.

1020
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.140
It's silly, man. I'm, I'm, I don't know how that even works.

1021
00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:35.490
Somebody who's too big did mine too much muscle. Yeah. I mean,

1022
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.720
well you can do it because you're not making fun of things.

1023
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:41.170
He's making fun of things to talk about getting this car pretty strong.

1024
00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:44.500
Goddammit. Strong opinion. It's perfect. No, it's,

1025
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.560
it's silly that they do that though. You know, it almost, I mean,

1026
00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.320
if you look historically back, every time they've done that,

1027
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:54.370
those people have got more power. Like all you're doing is feeding that guy.

1028
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:57.370
So in 10 years when you look like the asshole that censored him,

1029
00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.200
he's going to be 10 times that. Well,

1030
00:58:59.201 --> 00:59:02.170
especially now that we're talking about them, which is good. Yeah,

1031
00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:05.110
it is good that this exists. It's fucking good. I think so.

1032
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.940
A lot of people appreciate it. Well,

1033
00:59:06.941 --> 00:59:09.530
I think this is a weird time where you can't, you're,

1034
00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:13.270
you're having people dictate what you can and can't see or what is in his value

1035
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.840
isn't, isn't valid. And it's just, that seems like nonsense to me.

1036
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:19.090
Like we're moving backwards, especially with something like that.

1037
00:59:19.091 --> 00:59:21.980
He's being funny. Like he's funny.

1038
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.750
<v 3>He makes me laugh.</v>

1039
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:27.280
<v 2>Well, I'll do my jokes. Yeah, we are tough. Fuck man. Even mad jokes man.</v>

1040
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:32.110
Even bad jokes by juice heads. Yes. It's fun. He talks about being a juice head.

1041
00:59:32.111 --> 00:59:36.760
It's hilarious. My first introduction to comedy, I loved growing up.

1042
00:59:36.761 --> 00:59:40.850
I was a huge fan of Richard Pryor and all that stuff out. Huge fan of,

1043
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.070
of Carlin. I just big fan of, I even liked a, what was his name?

1044
00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:48.710
Jeff Foxworthy. I Love Fox, which was great. And, um,

1045
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.460
my first time I ever got to see a show, I came in,

1046
00:59:51.461 --> 00:59:56.461
I move into La and a buddy of mine brought me to see you and uncle Joey and I

1047
00:59:56.921 --> 00:59:59.290
was like, holy fuck,

1048
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.360
I couldn't first Joe comes out there and you can't even breathe when you just

1049
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.770
got, you don't get a second. As I got down

1050
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.150
<v 3>an animal, he's got some shit right now.</v>

1051
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.840
Like if you get a chance while you're in town, you got,

1052
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.850
he's got some new shit that we were falling on the ground crying the other

1053
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:17.480
night. Oh yeah, I'll come check them out. And he's the best ever. He crushes.

1054
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:21.020
He crushes, I wouldn't know ones like funny or in bursts you might get,

1055
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.710
you know guys who are really good joke riders,

1056
01:00:24.711 --> 01:00:27.110
guys who are really funny guys who are like, they're,

1057
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:31.790
they're valid in terms of our culture. But no one's funny than Joey D, right?

1058
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:35.390
<v 2>No, no, no. The whole room, like it was like we were uncomfortable.</v>

1059
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:39.380
We could not stop laughing, you know, so Dan Perry, we are eating.

1060
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.130
Then when you went up it was like, so it was, it's a whole different style,

1061
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.000
but it's like super like along the way that I think about how like you're

1062
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.090
introspective and comparative with different things and stuff and the way you

1063
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:53.780
make people like look at something in a different angle and then you poke fun of

1064
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:55.880
the way that you originally thought about it. You know,

1065
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.500
that's at least how that set was. But it was, I mean, I,

1066
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:04.390
being in a live audience is so different than watching a special on TV. Oh yeah.

1067
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.430
<v 3>Better. Well, I met you in the belly room,</v>

1068
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:10.490
which is one of the best places to do stand up were the last tiny room.

1069
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:14.430
<v 2>Yeah, I did a set of them about, I've been on stage once and I didn't know.</v>

1070
01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.760
And the, yeah, the belly room. Yeah. I went up there and did the,

1071
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:22.100
it was story time and um, uh, tape Fletcher and uh,

1072
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.460
Oh man, I can't remember who else. A bunch of people just kept telling me like,

1073
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.410
like, just go up there and tell the story. Just go tell a story. And I was like,

1074
01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.890
all right, there's no cameras in here. Right. I can tell a real story.

1075
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.360
We're having a thought are we talking about, but um,

1076
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.280
they got me up there and I did six minutes. They gave,

1077
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.310
they gave me four and I ran on for six. I didn't know what the lights meant.

1078
01:01:42.311 --> 01:01:44.140
I was just talking, you know, I didn't know.

1079
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.680
And I told a story about being in China and we thought we were going to go to

1080
01:01:47.681 --> 01:01:52.360
jail in China and stuff and it was fucking hilarious what happened in China that

1081
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.350
year. You saw me in the picture,

1082
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.910
we got done with world's strongest man and we do like a celebration.

1083
01:01:57.911 --> 01:02:00.430
We all go to dinner and all that stuff. And I was,

1084
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.390
I was fucking excited cause I was the only rookie in the finals.

1085
01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:05.350
I was super excited.

1086
01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:10.351
So I'm hammered drunk like in China and then little things start to click.

1087
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:14.110
You see people all wearing like the communist uniform like that they have,

1088
01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:18.100
they were celebrating, I dunno if it's called communism day or whatever,

1089
01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:22.650
but they celebrate and, and like almost the entire city.

1090
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.690
We were in Sonia, which is a little island,

1091
01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:28.800
which is like their kind of vacation island. And um, but they were almost,

1092
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:32.490
everybody was dressed in those uniforms. And I'm drunk and like,

1093
01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:35.160
I'm looking around, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable and we finally,

1094
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:37.710
we'd get up to go and we all get on this bus.

1095
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.220
And the guy who runs world's strongest man is a very old man. He's,

1096
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.570
he's gotta be like in his nineties. Right. But he's, he's, uh,

1097
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.820
needs help moving around, all that kind of stuff.

1098
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.740
We get on the bus and uh,

1099
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:54.420
we're setting up in the camera crew left all that stuff on the front seat,

1100
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:56.760
which is, which is the older guy seat, you know,

1101
01:02:56.761 --> 01:02:59.900
and we make sure that he has that seat, you know, and um, we get in,

1102
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:04.910
we're trying to finagle like the nothing [inaudible] we're trying to be

1103
01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:09.120
assertive but nice to the the camera crew that they have to move back.

1104
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.650
And they were, they didn't speak English at the moment, you know, and they were,

1105
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:14.990
they were acting like they just didn't understand their,

1106
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.550
they being really rude about it. And uh, Nick [inaudible],

1107
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.060
who's actually on the TV show with me, um,

1108
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:25.020
he came over and he picked up the camera and he was like, you're moving.

1109
01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.180
And started walking back with the camera case.

1110
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.990
And then the guy got up and started yelling at us and English and he's totally

1111
01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:32.490
knew exactly what we were saying the whole time.

1112
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.330
And he's yelling at us and freaking out. And Nick puts the camera down,

1113
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.630
like towards the middle of the bus and then sits back down.

1114
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.170
The Guy Marches off the bus, comes back on the bus with three cops,

1115
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:48.230
three police officers and Chinese uniforms and I'm fucking scared shitless.

1116
01:03:48.601 --> 01:03:51.300
Like I've heard horror stories about Chinese prison, you know,

1117
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:54.150
it does not sound like the place to be. And the guy,

1118
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.610
the guy and the cops are getting really worked up about the fact that he touches

1119
01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:02.490
equipment and that Nick's called him an arrogant American.

1120
01:04:02.491 --> 01:04:05.880
All this stuff like freaking out and the police officer, literally,

1121
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.770
nobody ever believes this, but it was like in 300 almost fucking exactly.

1122
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:11.843
He goes,

1123
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.620
this is China and he's screaming at a bus full of the world's strongest men.

1124
01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.000
He's fucking scared. All of us into thinking we were going to go to jail.

1125
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:22.290
This is China.

1126
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.400
And he's screaming at him and nick best like Kinda sits back in a seat and puts

1127
01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:29.640
his head down and he realizes like, you know, we better shut the fuck up.

1128
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:34.020
So we all like Kinda tucked our tails in and sat there and then the older guy

1129
01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:35.460
got on the bus, took a seat,

1130
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.500
then the camera guy kind of pretended like it didn't happen. Went in,

1131
01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:42.940
sat back down, the police officers left, but the, in the entirety of that,

1132
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:46.740
that situation, like I fucking, I could've swore I was going to prison.

1133
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.960
Scared to death. You do not want to get locked up in an Asian prison? No.

1134
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:54.840
Especially China. No, no, no, no. Not that.

1135
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:58.920
And especially that spot because like it was, it was their vacation island,

1136
01:04:58.921 --> 01:04:59.940
but it's fucking dirty.

1137
01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:03.780
Like the stories you hear about kids shitting in the streets and stuff.

1138
01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:07.740
It's not everywhere in China, but on the island it was everywhere.

1139
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.250
Like the kids just stop, pull, open their little shorts and take a shit.

1140
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.110
Ari told me, saw that in the mall until people just walk in the mall walking.

1141
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:19.180
They just stop, pull their pants down and shit on the ground. Yeah. And I went,

1142
01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:24.100
what on the floor? Yeah. Yup. That's what they do, man. It's crazy.

1143
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.950
It's so crazy. So who comes and cleans up the shit? I don't know.

1144
01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:30.460
I don't think anybody, when it's outside, there's, there was just everywhere.

1145
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.980
Wheeling. Yeah. You see human shit everywhere,

1146
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:35.470
all over the place in the smells like it. And we almost,

1147
01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:40.660
I think there was 30 of us, like 26 of us all got stomach flu or stomach,

1148
01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:44.740
uh, in intestinal parasites. Oh, I bet everything has got shit on it.

1149
01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:46.480
If people are just shitting on the street,

1150
01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:48.130
there's probably shit everywhere you touch.

1151
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:52.600
They were burning tires for the streetlights. It was nasty man. What? Yup.

1152
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:56.860
Yup. The island. It's, it's gorgeous too. I'm telling you like the photos,

1153
01:05:56.861 --> 01:06:01.780
the pictures Sonia island is gorgeous. Burning Tires for street lights.

1154
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.350
Yup. That's, and these motherfuckers want us to switch to electric cars. Yeah.

1155
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:08.350
They're over there burning tires and China.

1156
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:14.230
Well at least in 2013 they walk man days. It's crazy. Crazy.

1157
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.060
Where else have you had to travel for strong man? Um, I did, I've done Africa.

1158
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:22.190
Dubai is, is one of my favorites. It's, it's,

1159
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:27.630
it's creepy sometimes like just realizing I don't like not feeling like I'm in

1160
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:30.510
control of what happens to me, my destiny, you know,

1161
01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.380
so like when I'm in Texas I feel great and I'm like 90% of the people around you

1162
01:06:35.381 --> 01:06:37.300
are armed. If some shit happens, they got it.

1163
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.070
My girl actually like she rides horses and she managed the gun shops.

1164
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.440
Like I'm straight, you know, I don't have shit to worry about.

1165
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.030
But like when you're,

1166
01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:49.480
when you're in like the Middle East or when you're in China or anything like

1167
01:06:49.481 --> 01:06:51.910
that, you just have this feeling inside. You're like,

1168
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:56.140
it could fucking go wrong crack. But uh, when we go to Dubai,

1169
01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.220
we actually do world's ultimate strong men in Dubai and we're going to do

1170
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.250
another competition. They're October 25th, which is,

1171
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.420
it's the highest paid strong man show that exists. It's a really big show.

1172
01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:11.170
It's a lot of fun. And we go out there and they fucked up.

1173
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.620
They gave me the keys to a Ferrari and I just fucking went crazy.

1174
01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:19.620
I went through downtown going like one 20. There's also no cops to theirs.

1175
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:24.900
Doesn't have any cops. They might have a few like in certain areas, but it's,

1176
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.020
it's basically they use cameras everywhere. So if you,

1177
01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:33.430
if you speed or if anything happens or you steal or anything like that,

1178
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:34.300
it's all on camera.

1179
01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:39.570
Like there's literally cameras everywhere and that's how their judicial system

1180
01:07:40.001 --> 01:07:42.040
works. They don't use police, they just say,

1181
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.590
oh well let's look at the camera footage. Exactly.

1182
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:48.130
Locked that motherfucker out forever. Yup. Yup. And when we were there,

1183
01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:51.820
like it was craziness going on with the royal family and stuff like it was,

1184
01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:55.630
it was pretty tight. I'm going back in October.

1185
01:07:55.631 --> 01:07:58.920
I don't know if you could Google it. It's crazy.

1186
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:02.980
You look at that place like what it was like in 1970 versus what it is now.

1187
01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.150
Like some of the before and after footages. It's insane.

1188
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.160
There's so much wealth there. Yeah.

1189
01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.440
I mean they have built the biggest building in the world.

1190
01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.240
They're the tallest building in the world. Rich Khalifa.

1191
01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:16.100
I Shit my pants at the top of that building. Not Literally, but like

1192
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.490
<v 0>I hate heights and I went up there and like I couldn't walk.</v>

1193
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.320
How many floors is it like I'm 30 I don't know man. We get on the,

1194
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:29.060
we get in the bottom of the elevator and Eddie Hall, who's, who's also in the,

1195
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:32.960
in the show with me, it's me, Eddie Hall, Nick Best and Brian Shaw.

1196
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.160
First of all, how the fuck is that elevator going to carry all you assholes?

1197
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:41.240
Exactly. We get in, they closed the door to go up and Eddie farts. Oh No.

1198
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:46.241
I was like this motherfucker know 130 something floors smelling this guy's ass.

1199
01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:51.050
You know, it was horrible. And Eddie's the worst. He's English.

1200
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:56.051
So he's eating like porridge and she'll drink a tea in fart and I will put tape

1201
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:59.600
Fletcher's farts up against any man who's ever left. Oh my God.

1202
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:02.390
The worst back in the day when he was fighting, he used to,

1203
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:06.410
I think he just over consumed protein and then he was legendary, legendary.

1204
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.750
And he would laugh. He would laugh and he'd be like, oh we gotta grind.

1205
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:11.720
Cause you know the fog was coming.

1206
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:16.370
He would laugh first and then it would come up. Jesus, that's the worst.

1207
01:09:16.371 --> 01:09:19.970
When they enjoy the fact that you're like, God damn it,

1208
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.430
he doesn't do it anymore though. He must've cleaned his diet up.

1209
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:26.090
He's never got me either. Remember I loved,

1210
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.390
I loved going out with Tate because like normally when I go out,

1211
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:30.830
especially in la or something,

1212
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:35.180
I just draw away too many weird eyes feel like I just like need to like hide in

1213
01:09:35.181 --> 01:09:38.790
the corner. But with Tate it's like the bash brothers walked in. Right.

1214
01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.460
It's not as big as me, but he totally normalizes me. So awesome.

1215
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:46.470
We still going into the comedy store as my favorite man. I used to go in,

1216
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.520
actually I saw a lot of the transition from when you started coming back and I

1217
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.890
saw the culture changed. Man, you, you did a lot for that.

1218
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.700
So that place fucking changed the entire culture. That back room. That's crazy.

1219
01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:02.030
It was awesome man. Well that's my spot. You know,

1220
01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.370
I wasn't there for seven years. Yeah, yeah.

1221
01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.660
And you and I was there just before and then just after,

1222
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:09.950
and I used to go in there a lot.

1223
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.220
I used to go hang out a lot and I'm telling you, just,

1224
01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:16.520
just the way the comedians interact with each other is totally different.

1225
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.610
When I first went there it was very like, like, oh well I've,

1226
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.160
I've had this and I can do this.

1227
01:10:22.161 --> 01:10:25.970
And it was basically like Hollywood at the comedy store, you know?

1228
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:29.150
So like if you're like waiting to audition for a commercial and these,

1229
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:31.520
these people were all telling each other how cool they are.

1230
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.090
That's what it felt like. Then now, now, I mean not now.

1231
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:36.860
I haven't been there for like maybe a year or two,

1232
01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:39.360
but then after that it became more like,

1233
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:42.380
like what we do like with talking shit to each other and it's like,

1234
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.290
it's a camaraderie thing. It's not like I'm better than you.

1235
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:48.290
It's like we can all talk shit. We're all on the same level. You know?

1236
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:52.520
That's very important to me that I think that that it probably comes from

1237
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:56.410
martial arts, but it's also just my, my own philosophies.

1238
01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.780
Like I want everybody to do good. I don't want to be the only one doing good.

1239
01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:03.710
Right. I don't understand that. I've never understood that I want,

1240
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:07.610
I want like when I go on sh elected, go on the road,

1241
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:12.690
I try to bring the best people alive. I want everybody to have fun. I want this.

1242
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.780
The audience have a great show. I want people to kill. Yeah.

1243
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.350
And I try to help comedians and I really want to support them.

1244
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:22.890
I'll try to get them all on my podcast. I try to tell everybody they're great.

1245
01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.830
Try to tell everybody to go see him. Yeah.

1246
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.150
And will you see what that cultivates too? Everybody got better. Yeah.

1247
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.150
I mean Joey probably exactly the same. Now he's, he's a better than him.

1248
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.610
He's always put the same part of when Joey became a monsters cause he got all

1249
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:38.610
this love, you know, and realized he could just be himself up there. Yeah.

1250
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.550
Like when they stopped taking coke and all that stuff. Yeah. That helped.

1251
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.870
But even when he was doing coke, he's fucking amazing. Yeah.

1252
01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:46.650
I can't imagine him not the employment I can,

1253
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:50.370
I can hear him tell the same story five different times and still crack up every

1254
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.170
fucking time. He's an American original.

1255
01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:57.210
There's not a whole lot of people like that guy, so that place, uh, yeah, it's,

1256
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:59.880
you know, it's just insecurity when, when,

1257
01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:03.210
when people realize they're loved and that there's real comradery in a,

1258
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:06.780
a brotherhood and sisterhood and that you really do care about each other.

1259
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.990
Everybody like that places all hugs man, go there. But he's hugging. Yeah.

1260
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:14.460
And it wasn't that way. I know. I know. Every time I give you a compliment,

1261
01:12:14.461 --> 01:12:18.390
I see you kind of like wince a little bit when people like, like,

1262
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.250
like yourself or I'm the same way.

1263
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.460
Like whenever I do something well and someone tells me, I'm like, Nah man,

1264
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.200
I should have done this this way or this.

1265
01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:27.240
I'm always that I should want up myself guy.

1266
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:29.550
But you really changed the fucking culture there, man.

1267
01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.420
And you've made a lot of people better. The same with the podcast, big ops plan.

1268
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.870
It was all. Thanks brother. Thank you. Well, I feel very lucky. You know, I'm a,

1269
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.580
I'm a very fortunate person, so I like to spread it fucking from,

1270
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.690
from where you started to where you are now. The hustle man, that's inspiring.

1271
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:49.380
I always feel like I need to do more and I need to like extend myself in

1272
01:12:49.381 --> 01:12:53.820
different areas and stuff. I look at like so many people out there now,

1273
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:58.290
we actually have access to, I mean, you can see like, uh, Jocko,

1274
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:02.670
like this dude's up at four 30 in the morning and I'm like complaining the fact

1275
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.220
that I only got six hours with this guy, you know,

1276
01:13:05.221 --> 01:13:10.110
like you really learn your level of hustle in reality versus where you put

1277
01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:13.530
yourself in your head. You're like, I'm killing it. I'm working so hard.

1278
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.180
There's nothing more I could be doing.

1279
01:13:15.181 --> 01:13:18.840
And then this motherfucker up four hours before you killing it. But those guys,

1280
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:23.270
they've their fuel, you know, guys like Goggins him, Jocko, those guy,

1281
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:27.580
Cameron Hanes, those guys are fuel. Yeah. Like if you ever start thinking, ah,

1282
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:30.180
maybe I'll slack off. Maybe we'll take a day off.

1283
01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.390
That's look at Jocko fucking hairy gorilla arm.

1284
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:38.730
But that four 30 on his iron man watch it just says attack. Right?

1285
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:43.020
I was showing someone that today, this a, this lady that at the, uh,

1286
01:13:43.021 --> 01:13:44.780
the clinic that I go to, she was, uh,

1287
01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.030
talking about how her boyfriend's into Jocko. He goes,

1288
01:13:47.031 --> 01:13:49.980
she'd go to his fucking Instagram page every morning that you see,

1289
01:13:49.981 --> 01:13:54.370
you see that four 30 watch and it's like, fuck, I gotta go. I gotta get go into,

1290
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.550
what am I doing? Yeah. It just,

1291
01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:01.140
but it really is fueled like you feel charged up when not when I listened to

1292
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:02.250
like Goggins talk.

1293
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:06.420
It's like a lot of soft motherfuckers want you to stay in bed. Fuck that shit.

1294
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:10.590
That shit. You gotta get up and go get attack, stay hard. And you're like,

1295
01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.610
I'm gonna to stay hard, David. Oh yeah.

1296
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.950
Yeah. I love it man. I love it. It's nice man.

1297
01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.350
It's cool that we actually have that nowadays. Yeah, man,

1298
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:21.610
this didn't exist before. I mean,

1299
01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:26.050
you think about before the Internet and podcasts and social media and stuff like

1300
01:14:26.051 --> 01:14:29.230
that was, you ended up find that inspiration, right? Hard to find.

1301
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.950
And sometimes you'd think you'd have an inspiring person in your life,

1302
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:35.770
but really out in reality, it was just some shit bag.

1303
01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:39.550
It was like just close enough that it look like that when you stepped back as an

1304
01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.190
adult, you're like, oh, okay. Yeah. There's a lot of faking it. Yeah.

1305
01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.660
A lot of people fake like they work hard. Right.

1306
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:47.050
Actually somebody was trying to tell me the story.

1307
01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:51.040
I've heard you talk about it on here, about that guy who pretended to be a, uh,

1308
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.970
an MMA like guru or whatever and ended up murdering his girlfriend.

1309
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:58.820
<v 3>Yeah. Well, no, he murdered his girlfriend's husband. Okay. Yeah.</v>

1310
01:14:58.821 --> 01:15:03.290
Someone was pretended to be a black belt and a any rolled with them.

1311
01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.650
And uh, you know, like when you roll with somebody, there's no faking it.

1312
01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.020
Like with karate, you can kind of fake it.

1313
01:15:09.021 --> 01:15:13.220
Like there's guys that like are athletic and they can throw some kicks,

1314
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.070
like just like learning on the streets, just hanging out with their friends.

1315
01:15:16.071 --> 01:15:16.970
They know how to throw some kicks.

1316
01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.910
This is people that know how to throw a wheel kick that I've never taken a

1317
01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:22.910
martial arts class in their life. And if you see him throw a kid it's like, wow,

1318
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.950
that guy's legit and but you don't know unless you see them actually fight.

1319
01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.120
So the problem with that is inspiring a lot of karate sparring,

1320
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:36.320
you're kind of polite and you're not trying to hurt each other. He just like,

1321
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.120
and you could kind of fake it a little bit,

1322
01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:40.730
you could throw some shit in the air and fake it and touch each other.

1323
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:44.170
But in Jujitsu you have to roll. It's, it's,

1324
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.900
you know the guys grabbing your arm, arm, drag news, taking your back,

1325
01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:50.600
you've got to defend correctly. And Eddie was like, man,

1326
01:15:50.601 --> 01:15:53.870
I don't know what the fuck is going on, but that dude is not a black belt.

1327
01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:56.980
And I'm like, really? I go like, like, what do you think? He is like,

1328
01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.280
he's terrible. He's like,

1329
01:15:58.281 --> 01:16:02.930
he has nothing that he said he was a CIO before Eddie was deep, deep, deep,

1330
01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:06.410
deep, deep into conspiracies. Back then it was like he was barely,

1331
01:16:06.411 --> 01:16:08.990
he was like in the UFOs and shit. It was barely any conspiracy.

1332
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.790
<v 0>He's way off the deep end on me and the UFO is,</v>

1333
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.500
well, maybe it is true.

1334
01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.271
<v 3>I am a,</v>

1335
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:19.990
I'm scheduled to have a phone call today this afternoon with George Knapp.

1336
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.120
He wants to brief me on all this shit.

1337
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:26.890
George Knapp is the guy that broke the Bob Bizarre story in the 1990s and you

1338
01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:30.760
know, he shares my opinion. He's like, most of this is bullshit.

1339
01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.900
Most of these people are liars. Most of these people are crazy. Right?

1340
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.040
But there's some real shit out there too.

1341
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:39.640
Like a lot of these air force pilots that they have eyes on this fucking thing

1342
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:43.150
that's going 600 miles away in a second,

1343
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:47.740
like dropping down from 60,000 feet to 10 feet, like in a second.

1344
01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.890
And they're like, I don't know. We don't know what the fuck this is.

1345
01:16:50.891 --> 01:16:54.370
We have no idea how these things are doing this. And that's not some hope,

1346
01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.040
Billy. Like just no talking about Sask. Exactly. Now. Yeah.

1347
01:16:58.090 --> 01:16:59.170
It's air force pilots.

1348
01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:04.171
People who they're trained to fly jets and have gun fights in the fucking sky.

1349
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.040
These are exceptional human beings. When they see things like that, you got to,

1350
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.100
they know what the fuck

1351
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.740
<v 1>they're seeing. That's so crazy. Yeah. Who knows?</v>

1352
01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.190
The thing is like every day you could go out there and look in the sky and you

1353
01:17:16.191 --> 01:17:19.100
don't see shit. You go, there's nothing up there because you're not seeing it.

1354
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:23.420
But if you go to a fucking lake, you're never going to see a shark.

1355
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:26.030
You know what I'm saying? Like it's doesn't mean sharks aren't real.

1356
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.980
It's like you're looking in the wrong spot or you want,

1357
01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.080
you aren't there when they show up, but they're real.

1358
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:33.770
So we have enough accumulated data to know that all there are sharks.

1359
01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.350
You know they are real, but they're not in lakes. They're in the ocean.

1360
01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:39.380
Here's where they are. This is how you find them. Go to South Africa. Oh look,

1361
01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:42.350
there's a shark. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1362
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.650
Or I'm fucking Catalina off of Catalina. I'd shoot you.

1363
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.080
I worked at a boy scout camp in Catalina.

1364
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:52.790
I'm just teaching snorkeling and that was like the whole time I was shitting

1365
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:56.150
myself. Oh my goodness. It's just the nicest water in the world though.

1366
01:17:56.151 --> 01:17:59.660
It's so warm and salty. You just float. You know.

1367
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.340
We did fear factor out there a couple of times. Yeah,

1368
01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.700
we did a couple of the stunts. My a couple of Waterstones here.

1369
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:07.370
That's a cool spot. We stayed on the other side, like the,

1370
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:09.200
there's the hotels on the one side and everything.

1371
01:18:09.201 --> 01:18:12.440
We were on the other side of the campsites. It was awesome. Awesome.

1372
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:16.250
I was like 13 and I got so roasted,

1373
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:20.210
my entire body became one blister. Oh no stupid. I was stupid.

1374
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.810
No sunscreen done. None out there. All Day long. Yeah.

1375
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:27.590
So I don't know if you know UFO is real, but it's,

1376
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:30.620
it's certainly believable enough.

1377
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.180
It's not like the sky's empty. It was filled with stars.

1378
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:39.620
So do you think now after speaking with him that do you think we've had contact

1379
01:18:39.621 --> 01:18:40.040
like that?

1380
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.280
It's hard to tell cause they could've been flying on opinion enough for the

1381
01:18:43.281 --> 01:18:44.540
listeners. Not for anybody else.

1382
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:49.070
Just you when you're at home and you're chilling, do you think? I don't know.

1383
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.530
I really honestly don't know. I couldn't say yes or no.

1384
01:18:51.531 --> 01:18:55.760
I'm more inclined now to think there's something going on than I was before I

1385
01:18:55.761 --> 01:18:58.610
met Lozar and watched that documentary because I was on the,

1386
01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:02.560
not that I was saying that aliens are not real. I think there,

1387
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:06.610
I think there's 100% life out there for sure. Just say that it's too big. Right?

1388
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:08.460
It just doesn't make any sense that there isn't.

1389
01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.870
It's the question of whether or not it ever has gotten here before is the weird

1390
01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:12.350
question.

1391
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:17.350
And it's also the problem is that you feel foolish talking about it because so

1392
01:19:19.161 --> 01:19:23.360
many people who believe in it are foolish and so many people who tell stories,

1393
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:24.680
there's their stories are foolish.

1394
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.900
So you feel foolish kind of going along with it.

1395
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.780
But I'm very careful about stuff like that because I'm like,

1396
01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:33.160
just get something makes you feel foolish. Doesn't mean it's true. You know?

1397
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:35.180
It doesn't mean it isn't true. Yeah.

1398
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:40.280
So I definitely think there's a very high likelihood that there's life out

1399
01:19:40.281 --> 01:19:44.060
there. And it's entirely possible that something's gotten here before,

1400
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.110
but as to whether or not something really has made contact with people.

1401
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:52.610
I don't know. I'm in class. If I would say like where's my scale?

1402
01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:56.810
It's like probably 65% believe 35% going.

1403
01:19:57.170 --> 01:20:01.040
Especially after talking to that guy. Yeah, he but what he could,

1404
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.550
he could've experienced something that was an experimental aircraft that they

1405
01:20:04.551 --> 01:20:06.960
didn't want to tell them. Right. You never know man. I mean,

1406
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.040
I don't still know what the

1407
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.910
<v 3>tech, look, I'm a moron. Like I don't understand physics at all.</v>

1408
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:16.680
I have no knowledge of propulsion systems or mathematics and I don't know what

1409
01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:22.320
the top of the field in propulsion experts are capable of today. I don't know.

1410
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.260
They might be some shit that they're working on that they've never really

1411
01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:26.094
perfected,

1412
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:29.580
so they've never actually implemented in the battlefield or something like that.

1413
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:33.330
But they have some sort of a drone that looks like it would be filled with three

1414
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:36.570
foot tall people like these aliens that they described. I don't know.

1415
01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.480
And they're not going to fill you in on that if you think it's alien thing.

1416
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:43.260
Fine. It's fucking alien. Exactly. I mean, who knows what that was. I mean,

1417
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:43.381
they,

1418
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:47.730
they're taking this guy who was a physicist from Los Alamos labs who went to cal

1419
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.620
tech and they, they sent them to these, uh,

1420
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.430
classes and MIT to learn fucking nuclear shit.

1421
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:57.300
And then they try to see if he can figure out how to back engineer something

1422
01:20:57.301 --> 01:21:00.160
they tried to say. That doesn't mean it comes from another world. Right.

1423
01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.620
It could have been the Russian thing.

1424
01:21:01.621 --> 01:21:05.160
It could have been something that the Germans figured out. I mean, I don't know,

1425
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:09.290
but I'm more inclined to believe him than not believe him. Yeah.

1426
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:12.630
He didn't seem like he was full of it, you know. Exactly. Just looking at him,

1427
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:16.110
he also didn't seem like he even wanted to be here. He was just like,

1428
01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:17.430
I'm done with this.

1429
01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:20.260
And I was getting migraines talking about it before we even got out here.

1430
01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.520
He was like, I just gotta tell you I'm getting a migraine. And like, you know,

1431
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.680
Jeremy was trying to talk them into doing it.

1432
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:29.340
Like we're going to be fine George. I mean Bob is important,

1433
01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:32.580
it's really good to do this and we're gonna be able to really get the story out.

1434
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:36.060
But I think more more people told me that they got more out of the conversation

1435
01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:40.320
because it's just him talking not no spooky music,

1436
01:21:40.321 --> 01:21:44.940
no edits and you get to see like he's honest about what he knows and doesn't

1437
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:47.610
know. And when he would say like, what do you think about this? He's like maybe,

1438
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:51.960
I don't know. Like it wasn't a bullshit, didn't seem rehearsed full of shit.

1439
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:56.640
Nothing. What he was saying, if he didn't believe in that at least to himself,

1440
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.800
what he was saying, I I'd be fucking amazed.

1441
01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:03.270
And His story has not deviated in 30 plus years, which you can't.

1442
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:09.230
I've tried to have me tell a story of something that actually really did happen

1443
01:22:09.721 --> 01:22:13.110
from 30 years ago and I probably told that a bunch of different times what we

1444
01:22:13.111 --> 01:22:16.830
started the podcast. It's hard to remember, especially when you,

1445
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:19.470
my memory varies day to day.

1446
01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.200
Like some days it's awesome and some days it's dog shit.

1447
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:26.130
It's crazy how that works, Huh? Yeah. Have you, you've had a few concussions,

1448
01:22:26.131 --> 01:22:30.420
right? Oh yeah, sure. Same here. Yeah. I, I have horrible memory,

1449
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:33.840
but from football it's like probably the worst thing ever for concussions

1450
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:37.920
because you're getting them even from body hits when dudes as big as you are

1451
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:40.800
clashing into each other, your fucking brains getting rattled around in there.

1452
01:22:40.801 --> 01:22:43.710
Even if your head doesn't get hit. Right. And I, I played rough,

1453
01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.770
like I didn't avoid anything, I'm sure. Yeah.

1454
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.460
Well that's a strength of yours. A guy as big as you, I mean,

1455
01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:54.120
I would imagine you would impose that exactly. Paid for college.

1456
01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.700
College for, what was the history. History. Oh, that's cool.

1457
01:22:59.701 --> 01:23:01.980
You're on the history channel now. No, it was awesome, man.

1458
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:06.040
It's actually the only thing I ever liked about, I never liked in school. My

1459
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:10.000
<v 2>science and math didn't really click by history. It was all special to me.</v>

1460
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:12.860
<v 1>Do you listen to Dan Carlin? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.</v>

1461
01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.310
The best hardcore history he needs. I wish he would just do more.

1462
01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.980
Let's say only go hard. I know the research.

1463
01:23:18.981 --> 01:23:20.660
That's where you have to appreciate it. You know,

1464
01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:24.650
I'm embarrassed to call what I do a podcast in comparison to what he does. Yeah,

1465
01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:28.430
he does. Is like a lecture. What? Yours is the podcast though.

1466
01:23:28.431 --> 01:23:32.150
He needs to call his something else. That's what it is. It's way more in depth.

1467
01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:37.180
He's his hardcore history on world war two and World War One and the one on the

1468
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:41.270
Mongols, the greatest fucking Shit I've ever heard.

1469
01:23:41.271 --> 01:23:44.850
The Mongo one I've listened to like four or five times the wrath of the con.

1470
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:48.770
Fuck. It's good. He's so good. He's so entertaining too.

1471
01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.720
It's like if history was that entertaining,

1472
01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:54.350
we'd have a fucking world full of history scholars and we wouldn't be censoring

1473
01:23:54.351 --> 01:23:56.900
Instagram right now. But you people know how that works.

1474
01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.220
Then it be jumped to 10 put a sock on your cock.

1475
01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:07.280
Yeah. Dan Carlin is a, he's, he's a fucking man. He really is.

1476
01:24:07.281 --> 01:24:10.520
His podcast is incredible and the fact that he only charges a dollar for them,

1477
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:13.460
you know, and no, no, he did that while he's there free.

1478
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:17.180
And then when you go deep into the archives, he charges a dollar a podcast,

1479
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.570
which is fucking nothing. I mean an hour and a half long.

1480
01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:24.350
It takes a months and months to do and he's really just trying to make up for

1481
01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:26.210
production costs. He's not trying to get rich.

1482
01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.360
He would recharge him much more than they're worth more. Man.

1483
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:32.330
I've learned more from that than I did from college. You know,

1484
01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.800
he retain it because he's entertaining. He's the man and he's a great guy too.

1485
01:24:37.010 --> 01:24:40.280
I really love that guy. And his story is interesting too.

1486
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:42.310
He's the old time radio guy, you know,

1487
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:46.820
and did radio and then was always a history buff and even says he's not a

1488
01:24:46.821 --> 01:24:49.550
historian. He's like very self deprecating. But that damn,

1489
01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:53.170
you're probably the most important historian of our time. Exactly. As I,

1490
01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:54.310
for guys like me,

1491
01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:58.730
I've learned more about history from that guy than probably from anybody. Yeah.

1492
01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:02.960
So I mean probably this moment now, he technically is a historian you,

1493
01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.710
I think we should at least give him that. I mean he's got him. Yeah. I mean,

1494
01:25:06.711 --> 01:25:08.230
I don't know what you have to be to be,

1495
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:12.770
I guess a practicing scholar is like his, you say whole new show.

1496
01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.000
It's official. He's a, he's absolutely historian. Boom. Dan Carlin.

1497
01:25:17.001 --> 01:25:20.420
You are a historian. Give that man a plaque, give him a plaque,

1498
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:23.480
give them a piece of paper, some bullshit group of dudes.

1499
01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:28.420
<v 2>One of my favorite things about the TV show is being able to like dive into the</v>

1500
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:31.440
history of this stuff. Like we did a a an episode in England.

1501
01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.930
We were in London for most of it. And um,

1502
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
this Guy Thomas toppum and he was a fucking psychopath person,

1503
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:42.600
like just a crazy person. Like he, uh, he,

1504
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.990
he owned a pub and his way of getting people in was doing these crazy feats of

1505
01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:48.010
strength and he would,

1506
01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:52.270
he would go out there and one of the biggest feat of strength, which we,

1507
01:25:52.271 --> 01:25:56.200
we challenged ourselves to do and we actually attempted a world record,

1508
01:25:56.201 --> 01:25:57.520
I can't say if we broke it or not,

1509
01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:02.260
but we took these giant barrels of whiskey out in front of this pub downtown

1510
01:26:02.261 --> 01:26:04.850
London and we picking them up on like a yoke.

1511
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.240
You know what a yoke is like a yoke walk. Yes. Yes. So like that.

1512
01:26:08.241 --> 01:26:10.910
So the crossbar goes across your Mac and you pick up,

1513
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.770
basically we went though the world record we were attempting was, uh,

1514
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:21.130
I think it was like 1,790 pounds, something like that. So it was,

1515
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:25.790
it was big. It was big. And in front of a crowd, that's silver.

1516
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:29.930
That's a car that said in 1968, nine, 11. Yeah,

1517
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:33.650
exactly. Engine and everything. Yeah, it was awesome, man.

1518
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:38.200
When we get to tell his story and talk about like that. My favorite, I'm,

1519
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.680
my favorite thing we did for the whole season was probably his episode.

1520
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:47.450
There's an old tale that he got drunk one night and back in the day, um,

1521
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:51.560
London police officers had these little huts they would stand in so they could

1522
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:54.980
be out of the weather and they were like on the side of the road, almost like,

1523
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.180
like on a, on our house,

1524
01:26:56.181 --> 01:27:01.100
but a little bit smaller and they'd stand in there and they basically keep watch

1525
01:27:01.101 --> 01:27:03.320
on the street and being, so the rain didn't get on them.

1526
01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.130
There was the story that he got drunk with his buddies and just to fuck around

1527
01:27:07.131 --> 01:27:07.964
with his cop,

1528
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.870
he picked one of those up with them inside carrying it down the street and throw

1529
01:27:11.871 --> 01:27:16.490
them into an open grave with the graveyard. So we did that. It was awesome, man.

1530
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:19.790
We're running down these back cobblestone streets with this,

1531
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.130
like we didn't use the real police officer obviously,

1532
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.260
but we'll like with the whole setup on our,

1533
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:27.320
some of us tried to do it on our backs and one was tried to do other ways,

1534
01:27:27.321 --> 01:27:27.980
you know,

1535
01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.010
but like we're running down and all these people were cheering us on is we're

1536
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:32.210
like celebrating this guy,

1537
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:35.690
but basically like dragged the cop down the street and through,

1538
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.320
through window graveyard. It was hilarious. Now when you do something like that,

1539
01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:43.160
say a stunt like that, how much of a consideration is like when you look at it,

1540
01:27:43.161 --> 01:27:46.610
you go, okay, I think I can do this, but fuck, I might get hurt doing this.

1541
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:50.000
Almost everything. Everything's like that. Like, um,

1542
01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.250
we were with the daredevils last night and evil evil life,

1543
01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:59.990
we did a premiere where, um, like it was, uh, an homage to evil Knievel.

1544
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:02.960
The guys, the guy was going to jump a world record jump,

1545
01:28:02.961 --> 01:28:06.470
but he actually broke his ankles doing the testing for it. So this,

1546
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:10.460
this woman came out and she, she broke a world record driving through.

1547
01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:15.660
They have these platforms set up with like boards on fire and she did 13 boards

1548
01:28:15.831 --> 01:28:18.320
that were all on fire, Chiro face first to him.

1549
01:28:18.890 --> 01:28:22.250
She was a fucking savage and she was the baddest, I, I'm so sorry.

1550
01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:24.680
I can't remember her name right now. But um,

1551
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:26.750
she came over and spoke to me and like,

1552
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.000
I'm from Santa Cruz like you hear the way I'm talking right now.

1553
01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:33.140
This is how I talk. Like I'm not like super official or anything like that.

1554
01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.720
And she came over and I was like, so what are you, what are you thinking?

1555
01:28:35.721 --> 01:28:38.880
She's like, oh no, Bro. Probably dry likes 30. Put my face to the motherfucker.

1556
01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:42.740
I don't know. I don't know like that. I was like, this girl is fucking savage.

1557
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:47.660
I love this. And uh, it was so awesome. Fighter. Jamie, what's her name?

1558
01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:51.950
Golden. Vicky Golden. She looks like a regular girl. She's not even a giant.

1559
01:28:51.951 --> 01:28:54.940
She's very pretty. She's, she's normal. Like just Nan.

1560
01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.700
She's putting her face through boards. Yeah. Jesus for crushed.

1561
01:28:58.701 --> 01:29:02.340
It was so god that, fuck

1562
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.510
<v 1>man two, that's, that's the boards though. That's the guy who had the,</v>

1563
01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.450
oh Jesus. Oh my God.

1564
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.550
So she just accelerating through these flaming boards. Yup.

1565
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:17.810
Fucking 13 of them. And that's the kid that broke his ankle axle. Hodges. He,

1566
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:22.410
he uh, he got hurt like just like four days before the live show.

1567
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:25.980
Well, evil Knievel man, they put him back together again.

1568
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:28.590
Back when they didn't even know how to put pack people back together again.

1569
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:33.090
He was glue and shit and screws and rubber bands crazy.

1570
01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:34.430
And he just kept calling buck.

1571
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.190
You ever see like the x rays of evil Knievel's body? I saw him from the show.

1572
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:43.191
I saw a little bit of it or the videos of him like flopping as he was rolling

1573
01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:46.290
and you see his ankle go one way in his arm, go the other way,

1574
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:51.020
and I'm just creeps me out, man. Ty was an animal. He just didn't,

1575
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:51.893
I wonder if he was,

1576
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.040
I wonder if he would take something before he would go coconut job.

1577
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:58.980
Everybody was on coke back then. I think so. Yeah. It makes sense. Yeah.

1578
01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:02.820
What year was that? I'm talking shit. Probably the seventies in the eighties.

1579
01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:06.570
Right? It was before 95 everybody was on coke. I bet.

1580
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:13.590
I mean that would be the thing. Do a fucking giant Bob if he wasn't

1581
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:20.110
God. Right, like some some meth type substance. Yeah.

1582
01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.150
That's what I was talking to them about is basically the same way they look at a

1583
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:28.140
stunt is the way we look at a lift. It's like this.

1584
01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:32.430
This could possibly cripple me. This could finish my career, all that stuff.

1585
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.670
<v 5>What do you got Jamie?</v>

1586
01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:39.670
When he jumped the Caesars fountains in 1967 he crushed pelvis and femur

1587
01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.340
fractures to his hip, wrist, and both ankles concussion.

1588
01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:49.310
That kept him in the hospital and rumors that he was in a coma for 29

1589
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:54.170
<v 1>[inaudible] from jot out and kept jumping. Came back. I think it was six months,</v>

1590
01:30:54.171 --> 01:30:57.200
right? They talked about this. I can't remember how long it was,

1591
01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.770
but he was right back out on it. Seeding and find a picture of his x-ray.

1592
01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:03.540
<v 5>I did. It's not that they're super old, so it's not clear yet.</v>

1593
01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.370
<v 1>Oh, what it was. I looked for that first and I was just kidding.</v>

1594
01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.700
He probably wasn't doing any drugs. Just making a joke. I'll say it.

1595
01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:14.530
He's doing coke. Probably drinking, doing coke. Having a great time. Why not?

1596
01:31:14.531 --> 01:31:19.120
Fuck it. Everybody else did. Yeah, it was, it was, um,

1597
01:31:19.210 --> 01:31:22.150
for that, for that specific lift that we did. I didn't really,

1598
01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:26.260
that's him at Caesar's, Huh? Hmm. Jesus Christ.

1599
01:31:26.261 --> 01:31:30.400
Look how fucking Fox. Let's look too clear to be, oh, I met his son.

1600
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:35.020
I met his son on the set of fear fat. Yeah. Son made it. Yeah. Ooh,

1601
01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.310
what the front end. That high? Yeah, that's Robbie. Wow.

1602
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:44.120
Fucking crazy at oh dome. Show me. Oh Geez. I was crazy.

1603
01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.520
He goes little man, this stuff creeps me out. Yeah.

1604
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.260
Well it's just weird that that was a thing like when we were kids,

1605
01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:57.310
evil Knievel was like the daredevil guy. Like, you know,

1606
01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:00.040
like what do you think your evil Knievel, the toys and everything,

1607
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.430
<v 2>man. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

1608
01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.030
They had that wind up back in that would just shoot them forward.

1609
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:10.210
So you have to look at a lift. Similar to the way they would look at a stunt.

1610
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:13.140
Like it's, there's a high possibility. Right. And,

1611
01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.540
and everything from where you stepped those cobblestone streets,

1612
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:19.780
that was the scouts part of the, yeah, because the thing itself was,

1613
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:23.230
I think it was like, like 400 something, something like that.

1614
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:27.190
It wasn't like crazy heavy. It was around 400 pounds. So for us,

1615
01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:32.191
that's not that big of a deal unless you put your foot wrong with 400 pounds,

1616
01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.380
then all of a sudden there goes your ankle, there goes your knee,

1617
01:32:35.381 --> 01:32:39.730
there goes your Achilles and, and there, the thing is one, once,

1618
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.400
once the whistle blows and it's on and we're racing or you're,

1619
01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:47.440
you're playing in a sport and then like the fight starts or like the game starts

1620
01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:50.920
when the whistle blows, all that Shit's gone. Like the fear is gone,

1621
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:53.800
the hesitation is gone. I'm gonna fucking win. You know,

1622
01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.510
that's what I'm here for. So that,

1623
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:57.820
that's when you really have to like worry about that.

1624
01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:02.650
So like beforehand I'll always walk the course and just like look like, okay,

1625
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:04.450
I wanna I want to hug this corner.

1626
01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.610
Even if it's going to take me a little bit longer, I'll,

1627
01:33:06.611 --> 01:33:10.570
I'll be loose on this corner. Because it's a little bit of a dip, you know,

1628
01:33:10.571 --> 01:33:14.020
stuff like that. But you know, I mean, it doesn't always turn out right.

1629
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.400
First world strongest man.

1630
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:19.420
Franklin Colombo just destroyed his knee carrying a fridge. They really, yeah.

1631
01:33:19.421 --> 01:33:22.570
Which actually changed a lot of the structure of a contracts that we signed.

1632
01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:26.800
Now Franco Colombo was in the worlds the first world's strongest man. Yeah.

1633
01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:29.980
I believe it was Frankel Columbo. Yeah. Yeah, it was, there was Lou Ferrigno,

1634
01:33:30.490 --> 01:33:33.280
um, Franco Columbo and I could Franco,

1635
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:35.500
was this the shorter guy who's turning Ronald, right? Yeah.

1636
01:33:35.501 --> 01:33:39.220
He has the guy who used to blow up hot water bottles with his lungs and make him

1637
01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.140
explode. Yeah. Which is crazy fucking insane amount of lung power.

1638
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:46.740
Yeah. That's like longevity power too.

1639
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.250
And that's the kind of stuff I really like.

1640
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.850
I can't wait until like I'm done with the sport and I can actually do stuff

1641
01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:54.540
that'll make me feel good. Like, you know,

1642
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.540
instead of like waking up broken every day, I'll be like, oh,

1643
01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:01.110
I can do a little bit of yoga. I like to hike. That kind of stuff. Yeah.

1644
01:34:01.210 --> 01:34:03.620
You're looking forward to a normal life. Yes, exactly. What,

1645
01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.620
what injuries have you had? Um, I, the first, uh,

1646
01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:11.020
the amateur show was doing, I actually,

1647
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:14.020
I competed Brian Shaw who was on the TV show with us.

1648
01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:16.900
He's four time world's strongest man when they're out of Colorado.

1649
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:20.570
He was hosting an amateur show in Colorado and I,

1650
01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:25.610
I was in Santa Cruz training ocean sea level and went up to outside of Denver to

1651
01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:30.820
compete at the show and fucking had a heart attack. It was so, so hard,

1652
01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:34.810
but uh, it was the deadlift. It was, it was like maybe

1653
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:40.060
two, two months after I started done lifting, maybe three months.

1654
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:42.910
So I'd never really dead lifted and we were dead lifting a car,

1655
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.680
the back end of a car and they made it heavy. So it was probably for amateurs,

1656
01:34:47.681 --> 01:34:52.560
heavy is about like a hundred 840 pounds, something like that. So I'm,

1657
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:56.230
I'm winning the show and, and I'm doing it in front of four time.

1658
01:34:56.231 --> 01:35:00.470
World's youngest man who already, I had my sights on him like I was coming from,

1659
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.440
you know, like I, that's like when I first started I was like, okay,

1660
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:07.070
this guy's the best, this guy's the best. I'm coming for that guy. So I wanted,

1661
01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.790
I wanted to show out, you know, so I go out and I pull the car up.

1662
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:12.230
I do the first rap and I was like,

1663
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.770
just basically it took 90% of everything I had for that first rep,

1664
01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.490
but like a meathead. I was like, oh, I'll pull the second one, you know,

1665
01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:23.680
it's four reps, so I go pull the second one about halfway up my,

1666
01:35:23.681 --> 01:35:26.390
my lower back pops and I just let go.

1667
01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:29.600
My both of my legs went stiff and then they went numb completely.

1668
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:34.280
I fall forward into Brian's arms actually as he's judging me and my legs were

1669
01:35:34.281 --> 01:35:35.114
numb

1670
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:41.150
like maybe two months straight and then off and on for like two years.

1671
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.410
They were just so bad for the, for that first two months,

1672
01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:47.770
I actually ended up in second finish.

1673
01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:51.560
That show ended up in second place qualified for nationals,

1674
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.310
which was my goal so I could get my pro card. I went home,

1675
01:35:55.311 --> 01:35:58.730
started training for nationals with numb legs and had to sleep in my pickup

1676
01:35:58.731 --> 01:36:01.310
truck cause I wouldn't, I couldn't lay down. And we had,

1677
01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:03.800
we had a studio at the time, no chairs. We just had a bed.

1678
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:07.190
And so I would sleep in my pickup truck, get up, drive to the gym,

1679
01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.900
go train and looking back like yeah, that was stupid.

1680
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:13.130
It was really stupid.

1681
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:17.960
But that's once I'd failed at football in my eyes,

1682
01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:21.560
I'd failed once. Once I kind of painted myself in this corner, I was like,

1683
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:24.860
I'm just, I'm just not gonna lose. And you never got an MRI? No,

1684
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.840
I didn't have insurance. Now you don't want to get a look.

1685
01:36:29.841 --> 01:36:32.930
See I kind of do. I mean it feels good now.

1686
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.370
I mean I should take a peek. I needed,

1687
01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:39.800
I'm going to go get my achilles checked out. Cause at this current,

1688
01:36:39.801 --> 01:36:40.880
this last world, strongest man,

1689
01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:45.530
I had a decent pop in my Achilles and so I'm going to get that checked out.

1690
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:49.670
But I've been, been really careful about how I, uh, Rehab stuff like that.

1691
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:52.960
But you're right. Yes. I should check out my bag.

1692
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.630
It's crazy though that your legs were numb for two years. Yeah. Off and on.

1693
01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:59.430
There were straightened them for about two months straight and I'm like,

1694
01:36:59.890 --> 01:37:03.680
someone could stab you in the leg, like, like asleep like that. Yeah.

1695
01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:04.820
And it was psychotic. It was,

1696
01:37:04.821 --> 01:37:08.720
I pinched my side cause I wasn't sure what I was told. And so, you know,

1697
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:11.780
I'd figure that out that then, um, after that I'd,

1698
01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:16.960
I was in Africa and I ripped my a bicep off the tendon and um,

1699
01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:22.010
I'd been getting beaten up a lot at that point in like my first year of world's

1700
01:37:22.011 --> 01:37:24.530
strongest man. It was so easy for me to get to the finals.

1701
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:28.660
I kinda just was like, you know, fucking, you know, whatever.

1702
01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:30.200
I know I don't have to work for this.

1703
01:37:30.201 --> 01:37:32.240
I am the strongest man without having to work for you.

1704
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:37.810
And then got an Africa after being beaten up a lot and kind of getting my head

1705
01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:42.650
pushed down in the sand for two years in a row and rip that off.

1706
01:37:42.651 --> 01:37:45.740
And I was just like, I'm done. Like I in my head, like I just,

1707
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.880
I had thought I was done.

1708
01:37:46.881 --> 01:37:50.450
I remember walking out by the river and sitting there and just feeling like

1709
01:37:50.451 --> 01:37:50.990
broken,

1710
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:54.380
just like I didn't know what I was going to do with myself or anything like

1711
01:37:54.381 --> 01:37:59.040
that. And I walked back to the tent and the, the referees were telling me like,

1712
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:00.150
you know, get your stuff. They don't,

1713
01:38:00.151 --> 01:38:01.420
they don't want you that once you get hurt,

1714
01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.040
they have to fly you home right away. They,

1715
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:05.610
they don't let you stay and watch the finish or any of that shit. They,

1716
01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.480
they make you leave. Yeah. Hi. I think it's a liability thing. I don't know.

1717
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:13.170
Basically they just gotta get rid of you. But, uh, the, the,

1718
01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:16.250
the judge for the show was like, hey, we're doing the,

1719
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:19.590
what's called the Hercules' hold and, and you're up, are you going to do it?

1720
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:21.540
And the Hercules' hold means you reach,

1721
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:25.940
you reach out with both arms here like this and um, you have like a,

1722
01:38:25.941 --> 01:38:29.490
a handle, like basically like a, like in the gym,

1723
01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:33.780
you know the row handles like that attached to a tower that's falling and you

1724
01:38:33.781 --> 01:38:38.040
hold it as long as you possibly can. And uh, and my mind, I was like,

1725
01:38:38.041 --> 01:38:39.870
this is the last time I've ever going to be here,

1726
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:42.420
so I might as well leave some fucking blood on the bar.

1727
01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:46.830
So I've walked out and did it. And a torn bicep off the bone. Yeah,

1728
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:52.290
10 the tendon. So I went over there and I was just like, fuck it. Like let's,

1729
01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:55.230
let's at least leave a mark, you know, I'm like, I had to do something.

1730
01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.780
He just tape it up or anything that, what are you going to tape up?

1731
01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:00.540
I mean like it's like fully extended your arm.

1732
01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:05.280
It's basically just taking weight, pulling you. And so it's not direct,

1733
01:39:05.281 --> 01:39:06.390
like curling hurting,

1734
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.980
but it's yanking a tendon further up into your bicep.

1735
01:39:10.981 --> 01:39:15.000
And I felt that creeping up into my shoulder as I was doing it. And I,

1736
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:19.890
I did great. I actually, uh, it was the best event I'd had that year. You know,

1737
01:39:19.891 --> 01:39:24.030
I had crazy rusty and I remember just closing my eyes and being gone and just,

1738
01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:27.000
if when I let go, it was almost like being baptized man.

1739
01:39:27.001 --> 01:39:29.610
Like I felt like all the pain and all the stress,

1740
01:39:29.611 --> 01:39:34.050
everything I'd felt like build up once I'd gotten hurt, I just dumped it all.

1741
01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:39.570
And then it took me, it took me a, I think it was two more years.

1742
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:42.450
I finally fought back. I had thought I was done.

1743
01:39:42.690 --> 01:39:47.090
And then last year I made it back into the finals. I was,

1744
01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:49.800
I'm now again top 10 strongest man in the world.

1745
01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:53.250
And so it was because of surgery and Rehab Surgery,

1746
01:39:53.251 --> 01:39:57.690
and then everything else was so beat up. Once I, once I finally stepped back,

1747
01:39:57.691 --> 01:39:58.530
I was like, oh,

1748
01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:03.540
like there's no reason I should have to take an hour to be able to walk in the

1749
01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:05.320
morning. And I'm like,

1750
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:09.420
there's no reason why my back should hurt from walking from the front door to

1751
01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.800
the car. You know,

1752
01:40:10.801 --> 01:40:14.160
like I was so racked and so I just started working on different things.

1753
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.340
I'm trying to take care of myself and I got back to worlds. Um,

1754
01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.470
that next year actually I got back and I just didn't do well cause I hadn't been

1755
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:26.910
able to do anything. And then, uh, came back the following year,

1756
01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:30.450
which was just this last year. And uh, you know,

1757
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.350
basically I'd been written off. It was, it was,

1758
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:37.380
I was told it was my last time I was getting invited because at this point like

1759
01:40:37.410 --> 01:40:38.400
you're done, you know,

1760
01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:42.680
like it's time for you to find something else and came out and I,

1761
01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:46.410
I've had the show in my life, I've been working so hard,

1762
01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.900
but you never know how strong you are until you line up.

1763
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:53.410
You never know like what kind of athlete Char until you get tested. So I got,

1764
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:57.490
I lined up and I'm, I got done. I just crushed when I'm,

1765
01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.260
when I finished, I loaded out the stone and I knew I was in the finals.

1766
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.010
Like, dude, I get emotional just thinking about it right now.

1767
01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:09.550
Like it just felt like somebody had just washed all that away. Wow. No,

1768
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.750
I remember ripping my shirt off. I am a fucking show man. I'll tell you that.

1769
01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:14.740
I had my strong,

1770
01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:18.340
I'm pretty sure underneath and I ripped my world's strongest man shirt and

1771
01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:22.060
showed my strong and pretty shirt and I was just roaring and we were in in

1772
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:25.210
Malaysia and like everybody just kinda like stepped back a little bit.

1773
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.293
It was awesome.

1774
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:31.510
What kind of stuff does he do to try to Rehab your body to start to get your

1775
01:41:31.511 --> 01:41:34.030
body back into condition? Tons of Cowork,

1776
01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:39.060
tons of stretching and like basically just digging out scar tissue is huge.

1777
01:41:39.370 --> 01:41:42.640
It's huge. Like a lot of people use like a third gun and stuff like that.

1778
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.680
I went the cheap route. I took a black and decker skilsaw and I,

1779
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:50.980
I've got this stuff. Attachments, put it all together cost me like 65 bucks,

1780
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:54.370
you know, but like stuff like that.

1781
01:41:54.371 --> 01:41:57.240
I kind of figured it all out as I was going. You know,

1782
01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.850
there's people out there that were telling us stuff,

1783
01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:04.810
but it wasn't as easily accessible when I was, when I was first going.

1784
01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.010
And now like literally now we have a website called starting strong man.

1785
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.030
So like people who want to train and figure out like what's a safe way to start

1786
01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:15.940
out or like if I want to train like this but I don't want to,

1787
01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:18.990
don't want to buy all the equipment to, or if I just,

1788
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:22.600
or if I do want to be the strongest man in the world or if I just want to know

1789
01:42:22.601 --> 01:42:24.970
what kind of type of lifts to use to,

1790
01:42:25.110 --> 01:42:30.110
to like keep your back healthy to help you use your upper back instead of your

1791
01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:33.730
lower back when you're pulling that kind of stuff. I mean it's all there now.

1792
01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.890
Like literally that that did not exist and you just have to like listen to like

1793
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:42.490
the sock on the cock guy in the gym telling you what to do. You know?

1794
01:42:43.330 --> 01:42:44.770
That's what it was for me.

1795
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.640
Like it was a bunch of older lifters and I remember just warming up as for

1796
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:52.780
pussies and all that kind of shit. Oh yeah. Old School lifting man. Oh,

1797
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.120
it's gonna listen pussies. Yeah.

1798
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:56.680
You ever see a lion warm up before it chases a gazelle?

1799
01:42:56.681 --> 01:43:01.180
I've heard that nonsense before. Hamilton was talking that crazy. It's crazy.

1800
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:06.260
It's crazy. I'm not allying and I'm not going after like zone. Yeah.

1801
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.430
If you have to, it's there. But if you want to take care of your body,

1802
01:43:09.431 --> 01:43:13.200
it's definitely better to warm up. Yes, exactly. Yeah. If you watch like a guy,

1803
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:13.330
I like

1804
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:15.260
<v 3>Manny Pacquiao train like d. And. T.</v>

1805
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:20.290
I watched him a workout once with a Freddie Roach and he wa he warms up for a

1806
01:43:20.801 --> 01:43:23.080
long time. Yeah.

1807
01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:26.890
It's like 1520 minutes of warming up.

1808
01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:30.750
They said that about Ali that Ali would warm up for one hour. Yeah.

1809
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:34.930
So an hour of his workout was him just warming up his body,

1810
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:36.220
just moving,

1811
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:41.080
moving along and getting stretching and rolling his arms and his legs and

1812
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:45.090
rolling his hips. And then once that blood flow and then he starts shuffling,

1813
01:43:45.250 --> 01:43:47.410
now he starts hitting the bag and then he starts hitting the pads.

1814
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:52.130
That's more the older I get, the more I realize how important that is and

1815
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:57.130
<v 2>like how important it is to teach the next generation how to warm up.</v>

1816
01:43:57.850 --> 01:43:58.970
Even just rowing your hips.

1817
01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.110
I only started doing that in the last year and a half. That's crazy. It's crazy.

1818
01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:06.930
It's crazy. Like I put all that strain on my hips and low back. My,

1819
01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.090
I'm telling you forever and didn't even move my hips in the circle.

1820
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.840
Like for your low back. Do you ever use a reverse hyper? I do.

1821
01:44:15.050 --> 01:44:18.530
I use the reverse hyper. Um, I like to do a lot of stiff leg stuff.

1822
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.940
I avoid dead as much as possible, but I, I mean I still compete. I can't.

1823
01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:27.290
And what I did now was, what a lot of guys do is they use a suit.

1824
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:30.710
I didn't know like everyone was using deadlifts suits and it was actually

1825
01:44:30.711 --> 01:44:34.340
protecting the low back. And that's a lot of what is dead lifts.

1826
01:44:34.341 --> 01:44:37.580
Who does is transfer it to your upper back, which is like,

1827
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:41.330
I went to worlds this year and it was the first time I didn't zero the dead lift

1828
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:43.760
at world's strongest man. I pulled it up and it was,

1829
01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:48.560
it was fucking easy and it was, I was in my groups and I was cruising zero.

1830
01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:51.620
The deadlift like didn't get a z like a no rep. Like I,

1831
01:44:51.621 --> 01:44:54.830
the first time I actually pulled the deadlift rep at world's longest man,

1832
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:58.370
every year I've been fighting to get in the finals and doing my best with one

1833
01:44:58.371 --> 01:45:01.880
arm tied behind my back because when this event comes, I get zero points.

1834
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.570
But like I finally figured that out. That's what I was,

1835
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:09.080
I was still thinking that I was close to retiring even though I was feeling

1836
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:09.914
better.

1837
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.600
But then I realized that I'm so much stronger now and I don't have all the pain.

1838
01:45:14.601 --> 01:45:19.450
So like I'm, I'm almost at like peak age for strength too. So I,

1839
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:22.850
I, I've got to give it a couple more years. I get some peak age for strength,

1840
01:45:22.851 --> 01:45:25.010
they say, but for, at least from what I've been told,

1841
01:45:25.011 --> 01:45:28.700
they say it's like between 34 and 36 is for strong men.

1842
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:30.020
This is what I've always been told,

1843
01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:33.830
but honestly I think the longer we study this stuff,

1844
01:45:33.831 --> 01:45:36.890
the more realizing is like if you treat your body right,

1845
01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:41.240
you can keep getting stronger as long as you don't break things, mess things up.

1846
01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:42.570
<v 3>That's the big issue, right?</v>

1847
01:45:42.571 --> 01:45:45.330
People break things and they have to work around those things and they break

1848
01:45:45.331 --> 01:45:48.450
something else and they're compensating because one knee's fucked up and then

1849
01:45:48.451 --> 01:45:53.070
the other knee blows out because it's compensating for the bad name. Yeah. Yeah.

1850
01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.390
I was always tell people like,

1851
01:45:54.391 --> 01:45:57.720
I know a lot of people that have had ACL surgeries and they try or ACL injuries

1852
01:45:57.721 --> 01:46:01.620
and they try to not have surgery. They try to just rehab it and I'm like,

1853
01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:05.100
God damn, it just didn't get the fucking surgery. Right. Yeah.

1854
01:46:05.101 --> 01:46:08.850
You're going to be out for six months, but at least you'll have a fixed knee.

1855
01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:14.520
Yeah. Yeah. You'll be great in a year's can happen whether you like it or not.

1856
01:46:14.830 --> 01:46:18.210
Right. And this way that year happens and while it's happening, you know,

1857
01:46:18.211 --> 01:46:21.850
you'll realize like, hey, I gotta, I gotta keep my fucking legs strong. Right.

1858
01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:25.350
I gotta keep all those stabilizer muscles strong and then everything else

1859
01:46:25.351 --> 01:46:28.050
doesn't fall. Yeah, the hamstring, hamstring strength. It's big,

1860
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:32.570
<v 2>huge. And but strength, a lot of guys don't like to do like butt exercises.</v>

1861
01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.810
That's huge man. It saves you a low back. It makes you feel better.

1862
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:37.590
And also stretching out the,

1863
01:46:37.610 --> 01:46:40.860
the front end of your hips and your abdominals stretching that stuff.

1864
01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:44.630
That company you've spoke about him. Yeah. So they actually just,

1865
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.300
they hit me up the other day and they were like, we got,

1866
01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.980
we really want to send you one of these. And I was like, fuck you. I have them.

1867
01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:50.060
Do you want one? No,

1868
01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:53.260
<v 0>no, they're sending me one. So we got, I want to give you right now. Nice. Yeah.</v>

1869
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:56.820
Give us a box of them. Give given to people. Fucking believe in them.

1870
01:46:56.821 --> 01:47:00.000
They're not expensive. It's real simple. Super easy to use.

1871
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:04.330
I put them down on the ground and lie on it and it just like kits in there and

1872
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.030
dig in. It's not just for the Saas Muscle, it's for your whole back. Right.

1873
01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.950
I use it on everything. I use it on my shoulders. I use on my legs.

1874
01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.950
I saw a video where this guy was doing the outside of his leg and everything

1875
01:47:14.090 --> 01:47:17.940
with a fucking brutal, but you know what's my favorite is that Tim Tam thing?

1876
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:21.680
That thing right there. You see that? That Jack Hammer motherfucker there. Yeah.

1877
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:26.430
That's like a upgraded thera gun. That's like even more powerful ones.

1878
01:47:26.431 --> 01:47:27.960
Yeah, that thing's amazing.

1879
01:47:28.090 --> 01:47:30.720
And they don't die as quick to a lot of the guys that world's used. Those,

1880
01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:32.190
those are good. They're so good.

1881
01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.520
Although all that kind of recovery stuff is so important guys.

1882
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:39.660
I think they just work out and not take that time and recover.

1883
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:44.490
I was that guy though, learn. I mean I, when,

1884
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:48.120
when I needed, when this ripped, um, we, this, uh,

1885
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:52.590
was the full toe finally, like my, my tendon exploded. It didn't rip actually,

1886
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:55.680
and it exploded. So there was still that when you were doing the Hercules thing?

1887
01:47:55.710 --> 01:47:58.320
No, no, that, that was after, cause that was after.

1888
01:47:58.321 --> 01:48:02.850
So when that happened it wasn't, it didn't fully separate. So, but when,

1889
01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:05.220
when I went home and I was training down the road,

1890
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.670
this was like a little while later. So you didn't even get surgery immediately.

1891
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:11.640
He couldn't, you can't. Why? Because first off,

1892
01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:14.370
if it's a muscle or if it's not completely separated, you can't get surgery.

1893
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:17.940
But this basically what I'm saying is exactly what you're saying.

1894
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:22.360
Just a different time period. I, uh, I, this exploded off the,

1895
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:27.060
the tendon when I was doing a world record attempt for an axle in training and,

1896
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:30.840
um, that I, I was like, I knew it was tour right away,

1897
01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:34.560
but we had the pilot for the TV show. We were supposed to film the Nova Scotia,

1898
01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:39.180
Canada the next day. And I knew what an opportunity it was. So I said,

1899
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:39.640
fuck it.

1900
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.860
I went and took a shower and got on a plane and I flew to Canada and in Canada

1901
01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.630
with, with it completely torn,

1902
01:48:45.930 --> 01:48:50.040
knowing that I needed surgery and it hurting like, like the worst pain ever.

1903
01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.420
We had to flip a boat.

1904
01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:54.690
So like one of those little rowboats we had to flip it like a tire.

1905
01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.590
Then we carried 300 pound water jugs up a hill.

1906
01:48:58.890 --> 01:49:03.150
We did like all this stuff with that separated and the entire time it just felt

1907
01:49:03.151 --> 01:49:06.570
like someone was stabbing me with a cattle prod. Uh,

1908
01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:08.330
but that one that was me that, but

1909
01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:14.160
where that you were doing more permanent damage though? Not on the BICEP. No.

1910
01:49:14.161 --> 01:49:15.450
Once, once the bicep goes,

1911
01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:18.120
the only thing worse you can really do is shove it up higher.

1912
01:49:18.121 --> 01:49:22.910
So they have to flay you deeper when they pull it down and lays a hard word.

1913
01:49:25.890 --> 01:49:29.380
I'm thinking of some fucking inquisition type torture device. Right.

1914
01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.600
But I had a, I had a great surgeon. I was, I was taking care of man and um,

1915
01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:38.660
it was, it wasn't too bad. How long is the Rehab? Two Mill?

1916
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:39.503
Oh, no, no, no.

1917
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:44.370
Three weeks in a cast and then like he gave me this like a,

1918
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:45.810
an arm brace that would like,

1919
01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.030
I'd adjust it every week or so to where I go more and more straight.

1920
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.100
And then that was maybe three months before I could use it.

1921
01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:58.510
And at that point it's not like I could go do what I was doing at that point.

1922
01:49:58.511 --> 01:50:03.070
You start over and it was, my arm was like tiny,

1923
01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:08.420
but I was pretty pissed off. Well even your arm tinies probably go,

1924
01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.120
yeah, fuck it. But how weird is that?

1925
01:50:10.121 --> 01:50:13.240
I'm walking around like with one on like this and the other one was like,

1926
01:50:13.241 --> 01:50:17.250
it works like some ID company. Well you know boss Rutan do you know? Yeah,

1927
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:21.060
I've met them a few times. Has, what do you call his baby arm is one arms.

1928
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.750
It's small because of atrophy. Because of pinched nerves. Right. This is really,

1929
01:50:25.751 --> 01:50:28.860
it's really kind of fucked up. Yeah. Like to this day he,

1930
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:31.900
I don't think you can hold up a jug of milk. Oh Shit.

1931
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.830
He couldn't like hold the jug of milk in his arm and extend his arm. Yeah.

1932
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:39.490
That's a guy that for some reason didn't get a lot of the love that he so

1933
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:43.320
deserved. Pioneer savage. Yeah. And one of the most, uh,

1934
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.600
like one of the original technical strikers taking on dudes way bigger than him

1935
01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:53.110
and still handled them like hoist Gracie is amazing and savage.

1936
01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:57.910
But he was doing the exact same thing. Oh yeah. Yeah he was just years later.

1937
01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:00.430
But if boys had to fight boss route and it would have been ugly.

1938
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:02.860
But the thing is like in the early days,

1939
01:51:02.861 --> 01:51:04.540
boss didn't understand submissions either.

1940
01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:07.360
So hoist would have probably got him if it was like UFC one, who knows,

1941
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:08.680
you know, it's um,

1942
01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:13.680
it's a crazy sport and the people that have been able to like pave the way,

1943
01:51:14.231 --> 01:51:17.590
like a guy like boss route and they were such actively

1944
01:51:19.330 --> 01:51:21.640
savage, he would just shoot cortisone and everything.

1945
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:25.210
All of his joints are all fucked up cause he would just take cortisone shots to

1946
01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:28.870
shoot it into everything. Wow. Lidacain shoot lidacain into his shins.

1947
01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:31.380
Oh my second fucking blast. People not feeling,

1948
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:38.440
he said he was such an animal. He had amazing stories though.

1949
01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:40.800
We went to his gym, we did a,

1950
01:51:40.801 --> 01:51:44.560
I did Moss Russ moss wrestling is like an old Russian style of wrestling while

1951
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:48.430
you have like a a stick and you each hold the ends of the stick and try and take

1952
01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:53.210
it from each other. And um, we actually, I, I did it twice and um,

1953
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:58.030
two tournaments and I was the undefeated American champion for a year and a half

1954
01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.560
after doing it twice.

1955
01:51:59.890 --> 01:52:04.310
But we went to his gym to do the qualifiers to go to the world championship in

1956
01:52:04.330 --> 01:52:08.560
Dubai and he came out there and he was judging and stuff and I remember like,

1957
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:11.620
I basically, I was way bigger than most people and I'm,

1958
01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:13.660
I'm like upper body heavy,

1959
01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:17.650
so I just lean back and take it and at the end of it he walked over and he goes,

1960
01:52:18.090 --> 01:52:22.600
uh, he's like, the force is strong with your son. Like I fucking love this guy.

1961
01:52:23.290 --> 01:52:26.890
Yeah. He's got a great personality. He's a, he's a great commentator too,

1962
01:52:27.210 --> 01:52:31.250
was great at that. It's fun. He makes shit fun. Yeah. He seems like a cool dude.

1963
01:52:31.590 --> 01:52:36.040
What's the average lifespan in terms of like how much time you can compete at

1964
01:52:36.041 --> 01:52:38.960
the highest level for strong man. Cause it seems like you're,

1965
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:44.170
everything is just so fucking heavy. It's, everything's gonna almost blow out.

1966
01:52:44.590 --> 01:52:46.220
Right? Like how many years can a guy

1967
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:49.220
<v 2>expect to compete at the highest level? Depends on the guy. Depends.</v>

1968
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:52.040
We're getting better at holding onto that kind of stuff.

1969
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.090
And if you make it to the top echelon so that you're saying at the top level,

1970
01:52:57.110 --> 01:53:00.980
um, I'd say the average, the average is low. It's probably like a year,

1971
01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:01.963
two years.

1972
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:06.950
But if you just took the last five years and kind of cut that out and did your

1973
01:53:06.951 --> 01:53:09.440
own like, like study that with that five years,

1974
01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.650
I'd say guys now are going to average more like,

1975
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:17.480
like three to five years. Five maybe six. If you're doing good,

1976
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:19.700
but then you have these guys like,

1977
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:23.450
like Brian Shaw's been doing it since before I even knew what it was. You know,

1978
01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:26.690
Brian Shaws four time, world's strongest man and out of Colorado.

1979
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.450
He takes his rehab seriously. He's, he like,

1980
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:33.170
he doesn't care about how much it costs or what it takes.

1981
01:53:33.170 --> 01:53:36.290
Like it's to him, he's an athlete first.

1982
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:39.950
So like he's got these really amazing like cold pools and hot pools,

1983
01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.270
rent actually each other at his house.

1984
01:53:41.271 --> 01:53:44.390
And then all the different types of equipment that he would need to rehab.

1985
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:47.110
And he's, he's always making sure he gets body work done two,

1986
01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.420
three times a week. And when we're on the road, like,

1987
01:53:49.810 --> 01:53:54.500
like when we were on the road for me that that's, that was, it was an education,

1988
01:53:54.501 --> 01:53:58.550
cause I was with nick best, who's, who's 55 and he's,

1989
01:53:58.790 --> 01:54:00.680
he's still doing this really, eh,

1990
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.980
55 how he's a just a savage man.

1991
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:08.750
He's an old power lifter and he's at the point where he needs help to get down

1992
01:54:08.751 --> 01:54:12.310
to the ground, to pick something up where he's trying to figure that stuff out.

1993
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:16.550
And, and he's definitely gonna pay for, for the years of savagery for sure.

1994
01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:19.640
But we got, we have him and then we have Eddie Hall,

1995
01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:21.760
Eddie Hall's one world's strongest man,

1996
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:26.360
2017 and he's the the strongest person to ever dead lift in the world.

1997
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:30.620
He pulled 500 kilos from the ground, which is 1,104 pounds, I believe.

1998
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:35.000
500 kilos deadlift, just straight split up with it. Like it was nothing.

1999
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.160
Looked around the crowd, made sure they understood,

2000
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:39.260
he had it like it was easy and then put it back down.

2001
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:43.790
You know that and a lot of people's opinion that makes him the strongest man

2002
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:46.640
ever to live dead lift to a lot of people as king.

2003
01:54:47.130 --> 01:54:50.390
And then we have Brian Shaw four times world's strongest man and he's,

2004
01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.370
he's like a mad scientist with the stuff.

2005
01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:56.310
Like if you go to talk to Brian Shaw about like the trajectory of,

2006
01:54:56.311 --> 01:54:58.170
of a sandbag or, or how,

2007
01:54:58.171 --> 01:55:01.070
how you want to put your hand placement or where you want to do this or that.

2008
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:05.930
Like anything that has to do with the science of lifting, he can dissect it.

2009
01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.120
Like basically Bill Nye the science guy. That's what,

2010
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:11.840
that's what I always call him. Is that a Debo, cause he gets crazy,

2011
01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.770
reminds me of Debo from Friday and he makes me look small.

2012
01:55:15.771 --> 01:55:19.490
Brian Brian's got me by like two inches and like 40 pounds. Wow.

2013
01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:22.850
And when he gets tired or hungry, he starts to get that flex, you know?

2014
01:55:22.851 --> 01:55:26.780
And he's like, like cause like that Debo calm down.

2015
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:30.470
But like I'm traveling the world with these guys and I'm,

2016
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.950
I'm basically picking my little pieces out of what they've learned and what

2017
01:55:33.951 --> 01:55:36.650
they've done. Cause I'm, I'm very young in this game.

2018
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.040
I've haven't been doing it for a long time. I've, I'm still,

2019
01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.590
I mean I'm getting to the point now where I feel comfortable calling myself like

2020
01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.010
not a

2021
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.590
<v 0>rookie. I wouldn't say I'm a vet, I'm right about that. But I've,</v>

2022
01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:50.370
I've got to learn like what Brian does for his Rehab,

2023
01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:54.270
how many times he gets massage therapy and what the differences between massage

2024
01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:55.550
therapy and a massage or,

2025
01:55:55.551 --> 01:56:00.551
or someone who's a PT and someone who actually is fluent in like deep tissue or

2026
01:56:00.751 --> 01:56:04.260
sports, sports therapy, that kind of stuff. You learn all that stuff.

2027
01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:09.350
And I never took the time or spent the money. Honestly I just, I never had,

2028
01:56:09.450 --> 01:56:12.840
I was never in a situation where I could spend that money and take care of

2029
01:56:12.841 --> 01:56:13.411
myself that way.

2030
01:56:13.411 --> 01:56:18.411
It always kind of seemed like a luxury and it's not like for them it's

2031
01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:21.150
maintenance. It's like getting the oil changed on your car.

2032
01:56:21.210 --> 01:56:25.380
Do you roll out with a Lacrosse Ball? Like you use like one of those wad balls.

2033
01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:27.060
He was a softball, a softball,

2034
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:30.210
softball because it's big and it's not hard like a baseball.

2035
01:56:30.570 --> 01:56:32.700
So I mean for a lot of people that's too much.

2036
01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:35.760
But for me it's perfect and I actually do a lot of,

2037
01:56:35.761 --> 01:56:38.520
I try and get a lot of people to do them on the front of their hips too.

2038
01:56:38.730 --> 01:56:42.210
Cause it's, it's nice like pressure point stuff really good. Or like a,

2039
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:45.540
an atlas stone. The, the, the balls that we lift, the concrete stones,

2040
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:49.950
you just roll your stomach over that and just relax and just let it sit there

2041
01:56:49.951 --> 01:56:52.770
and it Kinda just pushes everything back and moves it around.

2042
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:54.900
So I like doing a lot of that stuff.

2043
01:56:54.901 --> 01:56:57.330
I've seen a lot of guys do that with kettlebells as well. Yeah.

2044
01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:02.190
Down on them and roll it over your back cause it's an unforgiving and it pulls

2045
01:57:02.191 --> 01:57:06.360
all the tissue apart. Yep. Exactly. Yeah. Now what about food?

2046
01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:09.500
Like what kind of Diet are you guys on? Uh,

2047
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.210
we all basically the exact same thing. You know,

2048
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:16.830
just a ton of meat and rice and we do a lot of peppers and stuff like that.

2049
01:57:16.831 --> 01:57:19.450
No one's Vegan. No, no, no, no. They,

2050
01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.100
there was times that one guy that Patrick with the fuck's his name.

2051
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:26.460
There's a Vegan strong man I've heard of. I don't remember his name,

2052
01:57:26.850 --> 01:57:30.540
but he's not like, he's never been the world's strongest man. Well there's,

2053
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:33.420
there's a documented they doing with James Cameron where they're trying to

2054
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:36.720
promote him as being, James Cameron is on this Vegan kick.

2055
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:40.530
His wife has a school and they feed the kids all Vegan food.

2056
01:57:40.531 --> 01:57:43.700
And Arnold's a part of this too. And they're, yeah, that guy. Yeah. Yeah.

2057
01:57:43.701 --> 01:57:47.370
I know who that is. He's, he's not one of the strongest men in the world.

2058
01:57:47.490 --> 01:57:51.480
He's a strong man and he's strong. And I've seen no disrespect. I'm not,

2059
01:57:51.481 --> 01:57:53.340
I'm not, I'm not saying anything bad about him,

2060
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:56.490
he's just put that back up again. Jamie, he's just a, he's, I don't,

2061
01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.300
and from what I recall, he's never even been invited towards strongest man.

2062
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:02.210
So it's bullshit. Yeah.

2063
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:07.260
I mean you can say a lot of things like this guy say say he broke a record and

2064
01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.670
in like a some power lifting competition that was in a guy's backyard. Right.

2065
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:15.390
And they call that a world record and then all of a sudden now he's a world

2066
01:58:15.391 --> 01:58:19.560
record strength athlete because his buddy in his backyard said, so the,

2067
01:58:19.561 --> 01:58:22.740
a lot of that happens. I don't know specifically about him. I've no,

2068
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.230
no clue where he's getting his, his uh,

2069
01:58:25.590 --> 01:58:29.130
his credentials from one Neil at day two. This is ridiculous.

2070
01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:30.930
One meal a day and Vegan,

2071
01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:34.410
Vegan professional powerlifter two 13,

2072
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:39.070
2013 set the deadlift world record for his weight class. Oh, okay.

2073
01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:43.300
672 pounds for four. How much does he weigh though? There's six.

2074
01:58:43.301 --> 01:58:47.890
72 isn't even big for guys that are like 150. Well, he's only five. Seven.

2075
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:51.730
Okay. So he's smaller than me. So they're there talking about power lifting too.

2076
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:53.290
So once you get into power lifting,

2077
01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.530
there's so many little federations and stuff like that.

2078
01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:59.650
Everybody in their mother has world records and just this and that.

2079
01:58:59.651 --> 01:59:03.580
And so does he's documentary is touting, cause that's what I was confused.

2080
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:07.950
Like all the strong men that I've seen are giants, right? Like how,

2081
01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.180
how can a five, seven guy,

2082
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:13.860
cause I've never seen them anywhere on the circuit or anyway.

2083
01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:18.080
And there is a circuit with firms circuit with guys like you.

2084
01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:21.430
We have John Sha, Eddie Hall and Nick Best.

2085
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:25.990
We have giant humans. We have the, we have giants live drawing slides,

2086
01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:30.030
the qualifying tour for world's strongest men. So to get to giants live,

2087
01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:33.220
you either there's like a bunch of little federations that you could possibly do

2088
01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:36.430
well in, in that limb bite you or um, you know,

2089
01:59:36.431 --> 01:59:39.220
like getting invited is kind of like a,

2090
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.820
the only tricky thing getting in. But once you get there,

2091
01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:45.280
if you prove yourself and you get top three,

2092
01:59:45.281 --> 01:59:49.210
or if if like say you go to my first giant slide, if I went to,

2093
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.380
it was like stacked,

2094
01:59:50.381 --> 01:59:54.010
like it was 10 of the strongest men on the planet and normally giant's live has

2095
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:58.660
like three of the top 10 and then a few of other guys trying to get in.

2096
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.430
And so when I went,

2097
02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.870
it was top the all the top 10 guys and I got a six place I believe,

2098
02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:08.980
but I still got a mud at the world's strongest man because it was the top 10

2099
02:00:08.981 --> 02:00:10.990
strongest men in the world there when I did that.

2100
02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:15.610
So normally you have to go to a giants live, prove yourself there,

2101
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:19.150
and then you get invited to world's strongest man. And sometimes, uh,

2102
02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:23.140
like we've had years where we'll chunks, man got pushed and was filmed early,

2103
02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:28.000
so they had to invite other guys. But you can, you can always tell who's strong.

2104
02:00:28.540 --> 02:00:32.170
Like you, you can see when a guy shows up and he's ready to go.

2105
02:00:32.171 --> 02:00:36.940
Or if he's just got show muscles or if he's just a big chubby dude, you know,

2106
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:39.100
and it's, it's, I mean,

2107
02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:42.070
you strap a guy to a truck and tell him to pull it 30 meters.

2108
02:00:42.071 --> 02:00:45.900
You're going to figure that shit out real quick. Yeah,

2109
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:48.700
I can only imagine it's a shit show for some people.

2110
02:00:49.110 --> 02:00:51.610
Well they see the James Camera thing.

2111
02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:55.750
They're pulling this guy out as if he's some world record power lifter,

2112
02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:59.200
strong man guy. He probably has a world record.

2113
02:00:59.230 --> 02:01:01.450
He probably has some type of world record. I,

2114
02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:04.620
I've seen him because I've posted videos talking about my,

2115
02:01:04.670 --> 02:01:08.020
my meals and stuff before. And a lot of people give me that, like,

2116
02:01:08.021 --> 02:01:10.920
this guy does this and he's Vegan. But I've, I,

2117
02:01:11.210 --> 02:01:15.700
I mean if the biggest pulleys ever pulled a six 27 that,

2118
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:18.010
that wouldn't even do like,

2119
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:21.700
that would get last place at an amateur heavyweight show in America.

2120
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.520
Because also the other thing is America, we have,

2121
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:27.700
we have the strongest man in the world to like everyone. It's weird.

2122
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:31.870
In America we have these, uh, people like, um, have these,

2123
02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:34.210
this love for other countries. Everyone wants to be like,

2124
02:01:34.211 --> 02:01:38.230
well I hear in Iceland they're really strong or oh in Poland they're this and

2125
02:01:38.231 --> 02:01:41.750
it's like motherfucker, we're strong here. Like we're fucking strong.

2126
02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:45.620
If you're an American, getting into worlds is the hardest way to get in.

2127
02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:48.440
If you go to another country, it's much easier,

2128
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:51.200
much easier because here we've got,

2129
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:54.770
out of the top 10 we've probably got four or five guys,

2130
02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:58.700
four or five guys that are top 10 in the world at any given time.

2131
02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.860
And only like three or four,

2132
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:04.730
maybe five guys get invited every year from America. So if you're,

2133
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:05.810
if you're getting in the worlds,

2134
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.980
you gotta be a bad motherfucker or go move to Poland or actually pull into got a

2135
02:02:09.981 --> 02:02:14.240
bad dude right now. Go, go, move to Lithuania or go go somewhere else.

2136
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:16.580
And they would be easier cause you would represent a country with a smaller

2137
02:02:16.581 --> 02:02:20.870
town. Much easier went bang out here. I believe that sir.

2138
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:23.780
What about the mountain? The guy from the game of the mountain. From Iceland?

2139
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:27.920
Yes. Legit. He's a salvage Jay. Yeah, he won last year. He's no joke, man. He,

2140
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:31.370
he, he's strong. How'd he say his name? A hassle. Julius. We wants him

2141
02:02:33.050 --> 02:02:37.730
just call him Thor. Say it again. Half Thor. Julius Bjornsen. Half Thor.

2142
02:02:37.731 --> 02:02:42.620
Julius Brunson. Bjornsen. Yeah, he's a savage.

2143
02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:46.910
He's, he's strong and he, he's definitely legit. No joke. You know, he's,

2144
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:51.440
he's good. He got third place this year. He's a, you know,

2145
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:54.530
isn't he fighting off bell's palsy or something? He had,

2146
02:02:54.531 --> 02:02:58.820
he had bell's palsy a couple of years ago and um, he's,

2147
02:02:59.090 --> 02:03:03.320
I think he's almost all the way better. Like it's not to be rude,

2148
02:03:03.321 --> 02:03:06.010
but his face all was, had like a little bit of a, like my,

2149
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:09.230
I've got these huge fat chubby cheeks, so I'm allowed to talk shit I guess.

2150
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.920
But he had, he had kind of like that look on his face a little bit already.

2151
02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:17.000
So I'm pretty sure he's, he's probably like, oh,

2152
02:03:17.330 --> 02:03:20.690
I'd say at least 99% done. And the other thing is that Shit,

2153
02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:25.040
a lot of times it's stress. It can be an infection. I, I'm, I'm,

2154
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:28.610
I'm not a doctor, I'm just putting out a doctor at the moment.

2155
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:31.550
I'm working on getting my license chimney.

2156
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:35.150
What the fuck is this guy here for? This fucking guy.

2157
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:40.520
So all of you basically you're saying eat the same thing.

2158
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:43.790
It's just meat and rice. Basically meat and rice. Potatoes.

2159
02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:48.090
It's kind of meat and a lot of times it's bison and um,

2160
02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:53.180
we do sound strong. Yeah, I fucking love it. I love Bison. Shit.

2161
02:03:53.210 --> 02:03:57.620
How long you town for? Uh, two more days. You got somewhere you can cook?

2162
02:03:58.070 --> 02:04:00.590
Yeah, I got a lot of elk. Boy. Oh my God. I love you.

2163
02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.270
My favorite commercial freezers in the back. Nice. I shot two last year,

2164
02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:07.490
so I really, yeah, I tried to give it out to as many people. Nice.

2165
02:04:07.890 --> 02:04:12.410
Where'd you go? One of them in Utah and one of them in central California.

2166
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:17.410
Nice, Nice, Nice. I've always in Oregon they got a ton of El Con, the war.

2167
02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:22.840
It was the Roosevelt elk and in Oregon they're bigger body to right animal and

2168
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:26.570
um, the best meat it is, in my opinion,

2169
02:04:26.571 --> 02:04:30.350
the best meat there is his elk by far. It's my favorite.

2170
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:34.280
So good for you too. Yeah, it's tastes so damn good too.

2171
02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:37.440
I've never had elk that I didn't like. Even if the guy cooking it sucked,

2172
02:04:37.441 --> 02:04:39.870
it still came out good. Yeah. That's a crazy taste. Right.

2173
02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:44.190
It's like people that think that a, that venison is Gamey, like first of all,

2174
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.070
just because someone hasn't prepared correctly and they didn't take care of it

2175
02:04:47.071 --> 02:04:50.850
after they killed it. But too, it's like not elk. No, no.

2176
02:04:50.851 --> 02:04:52.820
That shit is always good. You gotta have a old bowl,

2177
02:04:52.821 --> 02:04:56.940
like a fucking 10 year old bull has been rotten and stab another Elkwood his

2178
02:04:56.941 --> 02:05:01.170
head and it still tastes delicious. When you cook it, it's fucking amazing.

2179
02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.010
The reason why wolves are chasing those motherfuckers. Exactly. It's delicious.

2180
02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:09.350
You don't know what's going on. So how many times do you eat a day? She,

2181
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:11.940
right now it's usually, it's usually about five,

2182
02:05:11.970 --> 02:05:16.950
but right now my five meals are smaller. Like when we're going into worlds,

2183
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:19.320
like the last two months,

2184
02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:24.210
I mean those five meals and then anything else, everything else just gone crazy.

2185
02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:27.900
Everything I possibly can. And um, you know, I try and keep it clean,

2186
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:30.270
but you just, you just want it all in one and everything.

2187
02:05:30.271 --> 02:05:35.190
When you're in a competition, how many days is a like a world's strongest man?

2188
02:05:35.191 --> 02:05:38.520
Competition? Well, strongest man's normally, uh, two or three weeks.

2189
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:41.730
Two or three weeks. Fucking savage. Brutal.

2190
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:43.650
So are you working out at all while that's going on?

2191
02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:44.730
Are you just doing the events?

2192
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:48.450
You're doing the event and then you immediately try and find someplace cold?

2193
02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:53.410
Because normally worlds is in some exotic location that we're selling tourism to

2194
02:05:53.410 --> 02:05:57.810
. So it's like Malaysia, Africa, we were in Florida this year.

2195
02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:59.850
It's all a, some hot, humid place.

2196
02:05:59.851 --> 02:06:01.380
So they're trying to get people to come to see it.

2197
02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:06.420
A lot of it's a tourism ad and um, it's always beautiful background, right?

2198
02:06:06.850 --> 02:06:10.680
The background fucking hell on us, you know, it's brutal. Yeah. So,

2199
02:06:10.681 --> 02:06:14.370
but I mean it's, it's part of what pays for everything and none of us really,

2200
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:18.100
we all know to expect it's gonna be hot and humid. We just,

2201
02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:22.170
you now myself, this is the first time I've had people come with me.

2202
02:06:22.171 --> 02:06:24.480
Like every time I've been to worlds before,

2203
02:06:24.481 --> 02:06:28.080
it was just me and my gym bag and I'm just ready to Bang, you know?

2204
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:32.850
But now for some reason I kept thinking of the sock on the cock thing when

2205
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:37.150
we're ready to bang here.

2206
02:06:39.570 --> 02:06:43.980
So, but now this, this year and every year forward from now on, I had my crew,

2207
02:06:43.981 --> 02:06:46.620
like my girl was with me and uh,

2208
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:50.130
two of the guys I train with and they basically,

2209
02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:53.670
so we'll be in our tent and like 400 yards away,

2210
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:58.380
his them lifting and if I want to know who's doing what or what position they're

2211
02:06:58.381 --> 02:07:00.720
in or like I'm competing in a group of five,

2212
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:03.660
I need to know how many points this guy just scored, what this guy has.

2213
02:07:03.661 --> 02:07:07.320
Like I need to know all that before I would have to walk out there hot and

2214
02:07:07.321 --> 02:07:10.800
humid, find out that come back and be moving back and forth,

2215
02:07:10.801 --> 02:07:13.440
doing all that stuff if I wanted to get food, anything.

2216
02:07:13.441 --> 02:07:15.960
It's just a ton of extra stress this year.

2217
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:19.860
Like they literally wouldn't even let me bend over to tie my own shoes. Like,

2218
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:24.540
like they put them on me, had me set and I was, I was fucking strong as shit.

2219
02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:27.840
Joe, I'm telling you because of that everything like the work too,

2220
02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:31.710
that I really thank Brian, nick and Ed for, for how strong I was this year.

2221
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.620
Like just training with them and then, you know, when you,

2222
02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:37.940
when you're with somebody like you compete, let's just, let's just,

2223
02:07:38.210 --> 02:07:41.200
if you and I were walking into the door, I'd try and get there faster, you know,

2224
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.390
just the way it is. Right, right, right. So doing that for the entire year,

2225
02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:47.350
going in the worlds,

2226
02:07:47.351 --> 02:07:52.060
I showed up and I've been going chest to chest with the strong, in my opinion,

2227
02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:53.740
Brian Shawls, the strongest man who ever lived.

2228
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.650
And so I've been going chest to chest with this dude all year.

2229
02:07:56.950 --> 02:08:01.300
You 30 other dudes and shit. Like, I'm, I'm here to take your money. Right,

2230
02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:05.320
right. So it, I felt great and having them help me and stuff, it just,

2231
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.560
it all added up to me feeling the best I've ever felt.

2232
02:08:08.730 --> 02:08:13.240
Do you do a lot of ice baths? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't before cause I,

2233
02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:17.290
I was basically just posting out and just didn't want to. But they, they,

2234
02:08:17.500 --> 02:08:20.230
you have to, if you're training with these guys you have to,

2235
02:08:20.530 --> 02:08:23.560
they're not going to let you slide. It's like that, that coach that's just like,

2236
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:27.340
Yo you don't want to go. Okay. Well twice as long for you.

2237
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:31.510
When do you do the the ice bath? Because I was reading something. Um,

2238
02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:36.580
I think it was Andy Galpin had a study that he'd put up about a hypertrophy and

2239
02:08:36.581 --> 02:08:38.800
how it um, how it affect his,

2240
02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.300
it's affected by ice baths and that there's a certain amount of time after

2241
02:08:43.301 --> 02:08:45.610
lifting you should wait before you get in an ice bath.

2242
02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:47.110
We've all known that for a while.

2243
02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:51.160
I didn't know that that was new information cause a lot of people are just now

2244
02:08:51.161 --> 02:08:55.690
finding out the way your body reacts after a workout. Like the pain,

2245
02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:58.960
the inflammation, all that stuff. You're supposed to allow that for how long?

2246
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:04.060
For us it's like we'll train normally it depends on filming. Like,

2247
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:07.540
cause we'd worked 13 hour days on top of that, you know, and you know,

2248
02:09:07.541 --> 02:09:10.570
filming us fucking exhausting. It's like, yeah, you did that. Perfect.

2249
02:09:10.571 --> 02:09:14.350
Do it three more times. You know, that shit's so crazy. But um,

2250
02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.550
so normally if we train in the morning, we would,

2251
02:09:18.610 --> 02:09:21.460
we would wait to ice best to the end of the day. But if,

2252
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:25.930
if we trained immediately after, um, after set, like we got off set,

2253
02:09:25.931 --> 02:09:30.130
we went and train. So it'd be like six or seven at night, we'd come back,

2254
02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:32.430
we'd eat and we'd like conversation,

2255
02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:37.420
take our time and then we would go just before bed. So it's like,

2256
02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:42.130
I think minimum we would do like, like, uh, two hours or so.

2257
02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:46.720
And I know maybe that's too long, maybe, maybe. But um, you know,

2258
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:49.860
for us that's usually just, that's our routine.

2259
02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.080
We don't want to avoid that stuff cause that's Kinda your body learning how to

2260
02:09:53.081 --> 02:09:54.100
deal with that. Yeah.

2261
02:09:54.101 --> 02:09:57.310
I think that what they were studying was the difference between someone who did

2262
02:09:57.311 --> 02:10:01.240
it immediately after a workout or someone who waited an hour and a waiting an

2263
02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.200
hour was beneficial to muscle growth. Right. Yeah. And it's the same thing with,

2264
02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:08.860
you see people like popping Ibuprofen after workouts and stuff and it's like,

2265
02:10:09.370 --> 02:10:12.820
Bro, you're supposed to feel that you're supposed to feel that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

2266
02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:14.350
That's part of the part of the whole thing.

2267
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:16.990
Now when you're eating these five meals a day,

2268
02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:20.950
do you have like a meal prep person that sets it up so the have the right amount

2269
02:10:20.951 --> 02:10:24.030
of calories and nutrients and you're doing it like that?

2270
02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:27.340
I don't have to worry about that too much. Um, when we're on set,

2271
02:10:27.341 --> 02:10:30.250
we have caterers and stuff, so it's, it's super easy to do.

2272
02:10:30.251 --> 02:10:33.200
The cater is like give you bison and rice and shit. Like, oh,

2273
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:36.930
it's everything you need, everything we need. It's nice. So when,

2274
02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:41.210
when it's that it's not easy, but when I get home, so you get used for that too.

2275
02:10:41.211 --> 02:10:44.900
So you go home and you try and eat some shitty meat after after like three

2276
02:10:44.901 --> 02:10:47.930
straight weeks of clean food, your body is like, what are you doing bro?

2277
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:52.730
You know, enjoy these parts. Exactly. Exactly. Run my girl out of the house.

2278
02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:58.070
They'll get bad drink. What do you drink? Do you drink? Just water, stray water.

2279
02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:03.110
Um, uh, I switched to those like uh, we, when we're doing like humid shit,

2280
02:11:03.111 --> 02:11:07.130
like we're in human areas of liquid ivy. We did those, we did those.

2281
02:11:07.131 --> 02:11:11.620
But W W and I got off of Gatorade and switched to those body armors cause like I

2282
02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:15.410
was body almost like less sugar and it's just, it's way better,

2283
02:11:15.411 --> 02:11:18.290
more electrolytes. So it's only,

2284
02:11:18.291 --> 02:11:21.350
I only do those when when we're actually training and it's human.

2285
02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:27.040
I try the best I can to keep myself from like a allowing that type of stuff

2286
02:11:27.321 --> 02:11:29.750
unless it's competition. So like when it's competition,

2287
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.500
take the fucking Ibuprofen, drink the body armor, all that shit.

2288
02:11:33.501 --> 02:11:35.900
Like this is what you, this is the moment you worked for.

2289
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:38.450
Like you want it to be as smooth as possible now.

2290
02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:42.650
But when you leading up into that, it's, it's, it's water. Like when I'm,

2291
02:11:42.651 --> 02:11:44.000
when I'm really tight on my diet,

2292
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:45.860
like every once in a while it'll be a coke zero,

2293
02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:49.430
which I'm telling you getting crazy. It saves me,

2294
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:54.050
I don't get in and out, but I'll have this coke there that'll be okay.

2295
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:58.390
Can in and out fucking with, you know, and then now it's amazing. It's,

2296
02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:02.420
that's God's gift to us that this is,

2297
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:07.390
this is for everyone in Texas. I'm so sorry, but in and out is $1 million now.

2298
02:12:07.690 --> 02:12:10.590
No, they're in Dallas. They're Austin then new Braunfels. Yeah.

2299
02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:12.950
Those Water Burger people are, they're drinking the Koolaid.

2300
02:12:12.980 --> 02:12:15.750
It's wrong fucking mind. If you're comparing water burger,

2301
02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:18.380
you've got to compare it to like McDonald's, to Burger King.

2302
02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:21.740
And that's a different show like this. This is the different tickets.

2303
02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:25.400
Only people that fuck with in and out. It's five guys. Okay, five guys.

2304
02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:28.880
But if you go to Austin, and where we're on it is, if you go out there,

2305
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:32.480
there's this place called p toes. There's only three or four of them,

2306
02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:36.080
and they're only in that area. I'm telling you, they crush.

2307
02:12:36.110 --> 02:12:40.280
Everybody appreciated. Terry P, Terry's daughter,

2308
02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:44.450
Terry Terry crews like t e R, y, apostrophe s,

2309
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:46.970
and I'm telling you this is not a sponsored ad.

2310
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.410
They are the fucking shit and their fries in and knots. Pfizer. Okay.

2311
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:54.820
They're not the best. I think guys had better fries. Way Better way.

2312
02:12:55.150 --> 02:12:59.540
Legend fries. And they have better burger choices too. Weird Jalapenos.

2313
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:03.100
Exactly. Of Shakes. They don't have shakes. Oh,

2314
02:13:03.101 --> 02:13:05.830
they do have shakes and then that's got pretty good chicks too. Yeah.

2315
02:13:05.850 --> 02:13:08.750
The five guy didn't have shakes for awhile. Now they have shakes at some places,

2316
02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:13.730
but they win with the Jalapenos. Oh yeah, I'll pianos in Bacon. More options.

2317
02:13:13.731 --> 02:13:17.240
Yeah. They can't fuck with that. Better buns too. Yeah. Way Better buns.

2318
02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:20.870
But when you go to Austin, you got to try be Derrick's hungry now.

2319
02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:26.930
We left the, we left evil live too last night in the limo and I was like,

2320
02:13:26.931 --> 02:13:30.470
we've been here for nine hours. We're stopping to in and out to the, I was like,

2321
02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.910
you've had it in and out. I was like, no, I've had it.

2322
02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:37.550
We're just stopping that damn p Terry's bang for your Burger.

2323
02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:43.320
That does God damn good. That looks so good.

2324
02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.520
And they're only in that area to really, they need to branch the fuck out.

2325
02:13:47.521 --> 02:13:52.030
That looks fantastic. Yeah. Woo Man. Next time we're there. For sure. Yeah.

2326
02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.700
Mean so I'm, what about supplements? Like vitamins, minerals,

2327
02:13:56.701 --> 02:13:59.400
actually a protein is,

2328
02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.620
is something I definitely stick to and I do pre-workouts, uh,

2329
02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.880
depending on like what mood I'm in, what kind of protein powder use.

2330
02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:10.520
I am spoiled. I do the RTDs like the way to do drinks. Like guys,

2331
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:14.760
I'll get those cases at Costco. Man, Costco's always got great deals, but um,

2332
02:14:15.150 --> 02:14:19.290
I like to basically use whatever's easy on my stomach, you know, like, like way.

2333
02:14:19.291 --> 02:14:22.260
Do you like pea protein, hemp? What do you like? I've had,

2334
02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:26.820
I've had P P was okay. It tasted kind of funny. Um, real weird. Hemp Hens. Nice.

2335
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:29.250
And Saul is nice and if you can for me,

2336
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.660
like it's just nice to go back to that. Like just the honest stuff.

2337
02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:36.190
No on it. Like, Shit, I wish I had some here.

2338
02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:40.410
I'll give you some no on him. Fuck.

2339
02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:43.890
Maybe we'll see. It's always nice, man. Whatever you need.

2340
02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.690
It's always nice to go back to the hemp,

2341
02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:49.530
like for anything for like if you're doing clothes or anything like that.

2342
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:54.330
It's just so easy to digest to hemp protein. Just like go, goes, no problem.

2343
02:14:54.331 --> 02:14:58.140
Nice. Yeah, it's my favorite. Yeah. And then so I'll do,

2344
02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:01.040
I'll do press and stuff like that. I actually work with a,

2345
02:15:01.041 --> 02:15:04.770
a company called Nana suitable solutions that does do vitamins.

2346
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:09.000
And it's basically, I'm gonna fuck this all up concussions. Don't,

2347
02:15:09.001 --> 02:15:12.210
don't fucking don't email me telling me I fucked this up.

2348
02:15:12.211 --> 02:15:16.680
I'm telling you right now. I fucked this up. God Damn Email Joe. Okay.

2349
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:20.760
Email Joe. That's why. So Nana Nana suitable solutions.

2350
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:22.530
They take uh,

2351
02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:26.160
like basically your normal vitamins and they break them down into a smaller bit.

2352
02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:29.460
Like normally the smallest way you can. You can, um,

2353
02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:34.350
it's called bio, like the way your body injustice, it's called bioavailability.

2354
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:38.700
There you go. Thank you. That was going to bug me. So the,

2355
02:15:38.701 --> 02:15:43.500
so for your body to actually accept that like the lowest we've gotten this to I

2356
02:15:43.501 --> 02:15:48.501
think micro grams or something like that and the sky out of San Antonio,

2357
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:52.920
he broke it down into nanograms and he will, he's been working with me.

2358
02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:57.560
I think I'm the only athlete he works with. He's a small company and um,

2359
02:15:57.810 --> 02:16:01.350
we've been talking, we were working together and I could just tell right away.

2360
02:16:01.351 --> 02:16:03.270
I used to do B 12 shots.

2361
02:16:03.330 --> 02:16:06.750
You ever had to be 12 shots and you know how right afterwards you kind of taste

2362
02:16:06.751 --> 02:16:10.710
that weird taste in your mouth and you get that energy with him.

2363
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:13.800
He has the sublingual vitamins.

2364
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:18.230
So like between the B12 and the glutosiome dude,

2365
02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:21.840
I'm telling you like the B12, it was just like getting the B12 shot.

2366
02:16:21.850 --> 02:16:22.710
What's the name of his company?

2367
02:16:23.070 --> 02:16:26.880
Nana ceuticals solutions Nano ceuticals solution go. Got It.

2368
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:30.910
Proprietary manufacturing process allows for the molecular dispersion without

2369
02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:33.790
excessive heat or breaking of the chemical bonds.

2370
02:16:33.791 --> 02:16:38.791
This allows the vitamins and supplements to remain unchanged and undamaged when

2371
02:16:39.050 --> 02:16:43.110
they are absorbed in your body. Fucking them in exactly what I said. Right,

2372
02:16:43.710 --> 02:16:47.650
exactly. Methyl B12, Melatonin,

2373
02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:52.030
gludethyon gluten islands, a shish. Nobody knows about her Americans or Kumon.

2374
02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:55.510
I just found out that tumeric has an RNA. I learned it this year.

2375
02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:59.620
I learned that from you was like,

2376
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:02.800
I thought it was tumeric. We're so stupid.

2377
02:17:03.430 --> 02:17:07.110
We are reptiles for sure. You and I for sure. So I do that.

2378
02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.350
They've got smart people out there making vitamins that nanograms. Exactly.

2379
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:16.270
So I just try and eat clean and that kind of stuff. You know and it's,

2380
02:17:17.170 --> 02:17:17.920
you can,

2381
02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.060
we can always tell when our bodies like act a little weird and funny and you can

2382
02:17:22.061 --> 02:17:24.340
just backtrack a little bit and you're like, oh,

2383
02:17:24.341 --> 02:17:26.140
like I've been doing this a little different.

2384
02:17:26.650 --> 02:17:30.790
I've had beer fucking six nights in a row. Like just chill out.

2385
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:34.600
That kind of shit. Yeah. So most of the time it's self regulation.

2386
02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:38.760
Now you said that they drug test, you guys, what are they testing for a,

2387
02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:41.860
they test for everything. When we get drug tested at world's strongest man,

2388
02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:45.630
that's for everything. It's steroids for steroids. It's full.

2389
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:49.000
Everybody has to be on steroids. No I don't. I mean,

2390
02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:52.990
I don't know what to tell you when there's one test a year. Right?

2391
02:17:52.991 --> 02:17:54.550
So you have one test that test,

2392
02:17:54.551 --> 02:17:59.551
you have to pass that test and they can test you randomly to randomly thing on

2393
02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:01.600
the, from my experience,

2394
02:18:01.601 --> 02:18:05.650
the random thing only happens if you're acting like you're on amphetamines.

2395
02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:09.070
If you're acting like you're on amphetamines, they're going to test you.

2396
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:13.180
And there's been guys who pop for amphetamines after they randomly tested them

2397
02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:15.700
to try to put us off. Exactly.

2398
02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:19.510
If you're screaming at somebody about cocking sock and all that,

2399
02:18:20.410 --> 02:18:22.140
you're going to get drug tested. Oh,

2400
02:18:22.141 --> 02:18:25.240
so that's what I would imagine that they would worry about that when it comes to

2401
02:18:25.241 --> 02:18:28.780
lifting. Right. Definitely. You don't want somebody to gut die on their right.

2402
02:18:28.810 --> 02:18:32.050
You know you can have that and more like pulling that truck. I'm telling you,

2403
02:18:32.051 --> 02:18:35.560
they stopped using the heart meters because people were losing their fucking

2404
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:38.920
mind. Seeing that in our hearts were so high. It was like two 40 a minute,

2405
02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:43.780
like maybe two 30 yeah, it's insane. You could get that high.

2406
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:46.360
That's what everybody else said. So they pulled the fucking meters.

2407
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:54.160
Oh my God, dude, that's like a Jack Rabbit. Crazy. Huh. Wow.

2408
02:18:54.310 --> 02:18:56.720
Two 40 a minute. Fucking A.

2409
02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:00.670
Does anybody pissed hot for steroids? Uh,

2410
02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:04.780
I believe one person got busted. I would imagine,

2411
02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:07.810
I don't want to say his name cause I don't know if it was for steroids or for,

2412
02:19:08.210 --> 02:19:11.710
uh, a Meth, meth amphetamine.

2413
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:15.490
That makes sense. But I mean, I got to feel like for steroids, I kinda,

2414
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:19.330
I mean I don't wanna like push it, but it seems like you'd have to be,

2415
02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:22.990
I mean it's, it's a sport where it's a, it's built for bigger men,

2416
02:19:22.991 --> 02:19:27.530
but there's a lot of guys who have gone through and been very adamant that

2417
02:19:27.531 --> 02:19:28.010
they're not.

2418
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.550
<v 1>And you know, we get tested. We will literally,</v>

2419
02:19:31.551 --> 02:19:34.310
like every year I have to explain to the guy like, yes,

2420
02:19:34.311 --> 02:19:36.230
there's going to be marijuana in my system.

2421
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:38.480
And that's in the rules that says it's okay.

2422
02:19:38.481 --> 02:19:42.140
Like I have that conversation every year and it used to be illegal.

2423
02:19:42.170 --> 02:19:44.330
You should be illegal. And we got to, we got to switched,

2424
02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:48.950
I believe 14 [inaudible] switch. I brought it up a lot.

2425
02:19:48.951 --> 02:19:51.770
I don't know if that really changed anything, but I was like,

2426
02:19:51.771 --> 02:19:53.290
look at these fucking gorillas.

2427
02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:58.300
You want everyone here on Vicodin and like I w I literally like all I'm saying

2428
02:19:58.671 --> 02:20:00.080
is we should be able to smoke weed.

2429
02:20:00.081 --> 02:20:03.650
I'm not saying you guys should be able to do math or any of that other shit.

2430
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:04.810
None of that.

2431
02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:08.900
Like I think we're finally recognizing finally as a culture that weed is not

2432
02:20:08.930 --> 02:20:13.220
what everybody thought it was. They were in the 50s and the 30s and thank God,

2433
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:16.400
thank God. Cause I mean people were doing so much worse shit.

2434
02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:19.670
Well that's why that little Jeff sessions cut was driving me fucking crazy when

2435
02:20:19.671 --> 02:20:21.740
he was the attorney general and he was saying we've gotta you know,

2436
02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.910
marijuana is good. People don't smoke marijuana like you.

2437
02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:27.710
You're not hanging around with good people first of all because good people

2438
02:20:27.711 --> 02:20:29.270
don't want to hang out with you. Exactly.

2439
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:30.350
You don't know what you're talking and wasn't,

2440
02:20:30.351 --> 02:20:32.110
it wasn't a Hilary that was saying he was,

2441
02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:35.300
she was going to do her best to keep it illegal. Yeah.

2442
02:20:35.301 --> 02:20:39.050
She had some nonsense that she was saying too. That was, I don't know.

2443
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:43.100
She be fucking, who knows? That's crazy. If I was you, I,

2444
02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:47.540
and just being honest on the show would scare the living fuck out of me because

2445
02:20:47.541 --> 02:20:51.230
so many people listen. I just be worried that sooner or later,

2446
02:20:51.231 --> 02:20:55.190
like you know somebody before you just show up, Hillary just shows up.

2447
02:20:55.390 --> 02:20:57.500
This show I'm going to carry on one of them.

2448
02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:02.420
That kings that carry with the Poles on the shoulders, she just comes in,

2449
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:05.660
moves the veil and peaks. Yes.

2450
02:21:05.661 --> 02:21:09.680
That is the one that you see that a video I put on my Instagram with that dude

2451
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:10.890
who Trump. Yeah.

2452
02:21:10.891 --> 02:21:14.720
I was out with a Hillary head inside the body that was so bad ass.

2453
02:21:14.721 --> 02:21:15.710
Who is that guy?

2454
02:21:15.711 --> 02:21:19.430
Let's give that guy some props cause that fucking animation's amazing. Put It,

2455
02:21:19.431 --> 02:21:21.620
put it up on, on the big screen.

2456
02:21:22.350 --> 02:21:25.790
It's like one of those things where like how does this guy even think of this

2457
02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:28.040
and where is he buying his wheat?

2458
02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:34.580
This is not something that a regular person thinks of people. Crap, B,

2459
02:21:35.330 --> 02:21:39.670
p. L, e. Underscore, c. R. A. P. And. A.

2460
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:44.710
He's got this video of this Trump robot with glowing eyes and one artificial leg

2461
02:21:46.850 --> 02:21:51.850
moving and the entire body of the Trump robot is Hillary's giant head floating

2462
02:21:52.641 --> 02:21:56.900
around in a vat of liquid, like a war torn United States.

2463
02:21:56.901 --> 02:21:59.210
I'm guessing soldiers marching with them. Yeah.

2464
02:21:59.211 --> 02:22:02.540
At some apocalyptic post-apocalyptic scenario.

2465
02:22:02.541 --> 02:22:06.470
But there's all these lights and it's fucking amazing. It's so dope.

2466
02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:11.710
And Trump's body is weird and his feet are like baby feet in his hand.

2467
02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:15.140
Yeah, I always get that. They do their best to just fuck with that.

2468
02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:18.500
Cause it bothers him. He should've never acted like it bothered him.

2469
02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:21.590
Did he act like it bothered him? I think he said something about my hand,

2470
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:24.650
these big hands after they'd said it. I don't know. That's hilarious.

2471
02:22:24.651 --> 02:22:27.180
That's the thing is, is every, every dude knows.

2472
02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.720
Like if a guy flinches when you say some shit or say some more of that shit,

2473
02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.110
that's what you do. Exactly. You're not supposed to flinch.

2474
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:36.600
But they're the ones who say you don't body shame.

2475
02:22:36.810 --> 02:22:38.900
I mean while their body shaming this poor guy a little,

2476
02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:43.530
he doesn't even have little hands, but normal hands rules don't exist anymore.

2477
02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:50.850
Oh, that's hilarious. It's like a gorilla. Yeah. If I was Trump,

2478
02:22:50.851 --> 02:22:53.340
I would hire a trainer and just get on the best juice too.

2479
02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:55.650
If I had apps like that, I'd never wear a shirt.

2480
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:59.040
I'd go to funerals without a shirt on. Yeah. Sorry Bro, you dead.

2481
02:22:59.110 --> 02:23:04.050
But I'm [inaudible] put a sock on your cock. I don't,

2482
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.430
yeah, I don't, I don't think Trump has little hands. They're regular hands,

2483
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:11.100
but it is a constant theme to hers.

2484
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:15.170
But that thing that Beepo crap guy does that you say his name beatable

2485
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:18.720
underscore crap. He's amazing. Got some great shit on his page too.

2486
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:23.310
That's really cool. God Damn. Look at that giant Kim Giang robot.

2487
02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:27.900
Cause I wasn't Trump just in Korea right now. We partying with that dude.

2488
02:23:27.901 --> 02:23:29.100
They'd probably killed somebody together.

2489
02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:31.050
I wonder if it was like the interview way.

2490
02:23:31.051 --> 02:23:35.190
Let them drive the tank and they were listening to my Miley Cyrus was in Miley

2491
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:37.980
Cyrus. What was it? Um, I don't remember.

2492
02:23:37.981 --> 02:23:40.770
It wasn't my only listen to in the movie, the interview,

2493
02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.110
they were driving around.

2494
02:23:46.350 --> 02:23:50.690
I don't remember. Yeah, that was the Seth Rogen movie. Hilarious movement,

2495
02:23:50.691 --> 02:23:54.450
by the way. I never saw that movie. Oh, you've got to see that shit.

2496
02:23:54.780 --> 02:23:57.930
It's fucking clips. You got to see that one. That's good.

2497
02:23:57.990 --> 02:24:02.190
That movie like vanished. Like I forgot about it until you just brought it up.

2498
02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:07.110
I was like, Oh yeah, Netflix. I'm sure it is. Yeah. All of those. All of those,

2499
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:11.900
like from Superbad got me like I wasn't allowed to for back's hilarious scene

2500
02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:14.160
when they were good at sex. When you go to college,

2501
02:24:14.161 --> 02:24:18.090
you want to be sucking Dick at fucking pussy. So good.

2502
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:21.440
Who wrote that shit? Tell me who wrote. That's all I can say. Thank you.

2503
02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:25.070
I don't know man, but the scene, what? He's just drawn. Dick's

2504
02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:30.960
ridiculous. Crazy. I love movies like that.

2505
02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:36.180
Just preposterous shit. Just like relaxed humor. Yeah.

2506
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.320
He didn't care if it bothered somebody and he wasn't trying to be a dick,

2507
02:24:40.470 --> 02:24:43.110
but he was funny. Well, what's interesting is that was quite a few years ago.

2508
02:24:43.111 --> 02:24:46.770
I wonder if they would even do that movie that way today. That's it.

2509
02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:51.630
You know it was like 2013 or something movie coming out about three younger kids

2510
02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:55.020
than the super bad movie and it's rated r and it seems like it's right along

2511
02:24:55.021 --> 02:25:00.021
that same vein of like humorous comedy and thank God we need more of that.

2512
02:25:01.370 --> 02:25:05.220
It's like the backlash is stronger now than ever before.

2513
02:25:05.221 --> 02:25:08.430
But also the appreciation of it is stronger now than ever before too because

2514
02:25:08.431 --> 02:25:12.930
people are so tired of people being so politically correct and so upset about

2515
02:25:12.931 --> 02:25:16.140
everything. You know like no one's telling you to be an asshole,

2516
02:25:16.350 --> 02:25:21.300
but people are jumping on things that aren't even bad. Right.

2517
02:25:21.450 --> 02:25:24.130
It's like I was, I'm actually like a little nervous

2518
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:26.920
<v 2>about telling athletes that they should smoke weed now.</v>

2519
02:25:27.430 --> 02:25:30.730
Like [inaudible] that's nerve wracking cause like you're hold dependent,

2520
02:25:30.731 --> 02:25:33.730
you're depending on, on your boss in the places you work in, the things you do.

2521
02:25:33.731 --> 02:25:36.130
Right. So just saying something like that,

2522
02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:38.980
if two people find that offensive and they raised enough house,

2523
02:25:38.981 --> 02:25:42.700
sure that's a big fucking deal. But w what we're just saying is like,

2524
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:45.660
it's better than Viking and it's better than hills. It's,

2525
02:25:45.690 --> 02:25:50.410
it's a very much healthier alternative alternative. Um, alternative.

2526
02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:55.480
<v 3>Well, you know what it is, man, it's a tool. It's like you can abuse tools,</v>

2527
02:25:55.690 --> 02:25:58.660
but you could also use them correctly. I mean,

2528
02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:02.220
you don't want to fucking hammer nails with a saw, right? But,

2529
02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:07.270
but if you use marijuana correctly and you have discipline and you know what

2530
02:26:07.271 --> 02:26:10.570
you're doing, if the problem is that it's been illegal for so long,

2531
02:26:10.571 --> 02:26:14.080
people don't understand what the best way to use it for is.

2532
02:26:14.081 --> 02:26:17.980
And what are the side effects? What is the w you know, what's the paranoia?

2533
02:26:17.981 --> 02:26:21.820
What's this heightened sense of awareness that kind of freaks people out?

2534
02:26:21.821 --> 02:26:23.860
Like how do ya, how do you mitigate that? How do you,

2535
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:25.930
how do you get over what's the right dosage?

2536
02:26:25.931 --> 02:26:28.630
All that stuff is dependent upon information.

2537
02:26:28.631 --> 02:26:32.890
And when people aligned to you about it being terrible and you know,

2538
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:37.840
making you fucking blind and losing your marbles and you're going to kill

2539
02:26:37.841 --> 02:26:39.370
people. Just stuff.

2540
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.060
People are so confused about it that it also makes you more paranoid because as

2541
02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:45.100
you're smoking you think, and I'm like, God, I shouldn't be doing this.

2542
02:26:45.490 --> 02:26:47.620
What am I doing? I'm ruining my life. I can't believe I'm doing that.

2543
02:26:47.621 --> 02:26:49.150
And then you get even more paranoid and then you're like,

2544
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:53.440
I'm never doing this again. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Now what about sponsors?

2545
02:26:53.441 --> 02:26:54.940
Is it ever an issue with sponsors?

2546
02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:57.640
<v 2>The weed thing would be, would be, oh my,</v>

2547
02:26:57.650 --> 02:27:01.110
right now the only people I work with other than myself is that Nana suitable

2548
02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:05.300
solutions. So he's actually working on doing a CBD thing and stuff.

2549
02:27:05.810 --> 02:27:08.230
I don't know if I'll be a part of that cause I'm trying to, there's,

2550
02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:11.210
it's so available now. I just,

2551
02:27:11.211 --> 02:27:15.110
I'd rather just find whoever does it the very best to not not marketing because

2552
02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:19.630
it's so saturated. I just take it from myself. Actually a lot of people. I,

2553
02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:24.650
I worked in group homes when I was in college for kids with autism on um,

2554
02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:28.990
for, for a long time. And there was actually this little girl who, uh,

2555
02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:32.810
she had this, this uh, it's not a disease. She had this, uh,

2556
02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:34.280
I'll just call it a thing.

2557
02:27:34.281 --> 02:27:37.700
She had this thing where she always felt that she was falling. So,

2558
02:27:37.701 --> 02:27:40.040
so like she looked completely normal.

2559
02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:42.140
She was autistic and nonverbal didn't speak,

2560
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:44.900
but imagine all day feeling like you're falling.

2561
02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:49.310
So she learned as a child really little if she would hit herself,

2562
02:27:49.311 --> 02:27:52.940
that people would hold her. So if you weren't holding her,

2563
02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.570
she would literally ask, watched her break her own nose and like she was,

2564
02:27:56.571 --> 02:27:59.810
she was 11 years old, this, this sweet little girl,

2565
02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:03.710
like just super nice and Smiley, but like if you didn't hold her,

2566
02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:08.720
she just wacked ran her own face and we found out that through,

2567
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:12.980
I don't remember exactly how it came about, but they, they gave her THC pills,

2568
02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:16.250
they gave her THC pills and then stopped.

2569
02:28:16.460 --> 02:28:20.320
She would walk around the house normally like she was still nonverbal.

2570
02:28:20.450 --> 02:28:22.520
It's not like a fixed her autism or any of that stuff,

2571
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:25.550
but with the whole symptoms of feeling like she was falling,

2572
02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:29.240
which I'm sure I don't even think had anything to do with autism. Again,

2573
02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:32.430
I'm not a doctor, but um, but again,

2574
02:28:32.610 --> 02:28:36.560
yeah you got to worry about that shit. So uh,

2575
02:28:36.850 --> 02:28:41.450
they gave her THC pills and she was like just walking around the house smiling.

2576
02:28:41.451 --> 02:28:42.440
She would help us cook.

2577
02:28:42.650 --> 02:28:45.500
She would move around like she would help the other kids cause it was four kids

2578
02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:48.710
in the house. She would help the other kids tie their shoes, stuff like that.

2579
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:51.560
Oh that's true. Then her parents came back,

2580
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:57.110
must've been four months later and their friends had guilted them about giving

2581
02:28:57.111 --> 02:29:00.710
her dog their daughter weed and they stopped giving it to her and she went right

2582
02:29:00.711 --> 02:29:05.180
back to it. Went straight back to it. So stupid. It's just ignorance.

2583
02:29:05.181 --> 02:29:07.670
People just don't understand what it is. That's all it is. Yeah.

2584
02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:10.520
Oh that's so sad. I felt so bad.

2585
02:29:10.570 --> 02:29:14.060
It was one of the things that like just rip me apart from working in that field

2586
02:29:14.210 --> 02:29:17.300
is just, there's so much,

2587
02:29:17.301 --> 02:29:20.150
like there's these little rules that you don't understand.

2588
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:22.880
We had a kid that would sit right and he would just,

2589
02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:26.960
he would feel stressed out and he would sit and the rule was when he did that,

2590
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:30.830
we weren't allowed to help him up or move him or anything like that because that

2591
02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.670
was rewarding bad behavior. That's how they classified that.

2592
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:38.270
So he would just sit in the middle of the road and we weren't allowed to get him

2593
02:29:38.271 --> 02:29:40.350
out of the middle of the road. He would, he would.

2594
02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:44.000
And then he learned that if he didn't want to do something,

2595
02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.120
if he basically would stay in his room all day,

2596
02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:52.490
he would stay in his room all day because he didn't like the only worker he

2597
02:29:52.491 --> 02:29:56.300
liked was me. And I think it was just cause that was big and jolly and all that.

2598
02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:59.540
But if you didn't like the person who was working with,

2599
02:29:59.670 --> 02:30:02.360
he just sit in his room on the floor and then they couldn't touch him.

2600
02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:03.800
They couldn't do anything and he'd just sit there.

2601
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:07.850
He'd go days without eating or going anywhere out of the room or anything like

2602
02:30:07.851 --> 02:30:08.630
that.

2603
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:13.630
And it was all because we'd put these rules in and put these chains on ourselves

2604
02:30:14.061 --> 02:30:17.360
based off of other people's opinions or worrying what it would look like if we

2605
02:30:17.361 --> 02:30:20.840
did this. You know, if this girl is taking this pill, what does that look like?

2606
02:30:20.841 --> 02:30:23.600
Or if we're picking this boy up off the ground, what does that look like?

2607
02:30:23.601 --> 02:30:25.420
And it was, it was, it was,

2608
02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:28.790
it was like trying to help these children with your hands tied behind your back.

2609
02:30:29.300 --> 02:30:32.390
And I don't know if it's like that anymore. It was, this was a long time ago,

2610
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:34.100
but it was just, it was heartbreaking.

2611
02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.980
I remember everyone was terrified to work with this little boy.

2612
02:30:37.250 --> 02:30:41.270
He was 10 or 11 he was just a sweet little dude. He just didn't,

2613
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:46.130
he got nervous, you know? And so I remember coming in and one day I was like,

2614
02:30:46.131 --> 02:30:48.470
you know what, I'm taking him to go to a football game.

2615
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:52.910
So I took him to a college division one football game. Never had an issue.

2616
02:30:52.911 --> 02:30:55.070
Never had any problems, never sat down, nothing.

2617
02:30:55.340 --> 02:31:00.020
Sat second row in the end zone and like would get all excited every time anybody

2618
02:31:00.021 --> 02:31:02.750
came or like the cannon went off for a touchdown.

2619
02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:07.760
It was like the greatest moment of my whole like college career was hanging out

2620
02:31:07.761 --> 02:31:11.090
with this 11 year old at a college football game that people were too terrified

2621
02:31:11.091 --> 02:31:14.420
to even get out of this room. That's terrible.

2622
02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:16.780
But that's so cool that he got them there though. Yeah.

2623
02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:20.220
I'd like to think that a lot of people work more

2624
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:23.740
<v 0>in that direction after I left. You know, I'm hoping that he was,</v>

2625
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.690
you could see in his eyes he was a sweet little boy. You know, you,

2626
02:31:27.210 --> 02:31:30.960
you can see there's, I've never met a kid that was evil ever.

2627
02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:33.690
You just need to know how to, how to work with them, how to talk with them.

2628
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:36.210
Well, that's cool that you have that kind of patience. Yeah.

2629
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:40.290
Do you have kids of your own? I do. I have a three year old boy. Oh, nice. Yeah.

2630
02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:43.560
My little atlas by first one, three year old. Wow. That's a,

2631
02:31:43.561 --> 02:31:44.820
that's a fun age man.

2632
02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:48.510
They start talking to Ya and they're running around telling all the stories and

2633
02:31:48.511 --> 02:31:50.600
everything and now he doesn't even like,

2634
02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:54.150
like we have to read books before we go to bed cause when we go to bed he wants

2635
02:31:54.151 --> 02:31:56.670
to tell me stories. So he'll lay there and he'll be like,

2636
02:31:56.671 --> 02:32:01.150
well this one time and he'll talk for like 10 minutes about some shit. You know?

2637
02:32:01.390 --> 02:32:05.610
It's, it's so sweet and so cute. Yeah, it's a wild thing.

2638
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.650
Having a little person that made people that don't experience it,

2639
02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:15.510
it's very, very hard to describe. Yeah. It's like the sweetest,

2640
02:32:15.511 --> 02:32:19.950
most lovey, most intense sweetness you've ever felt in your life.

2641
02:32:20.190 --> 02:32:24.600
Yet the scariest fucking, most horrifying thing at the exact same time. Right.

2642
02:32:24.601 --> 02:32:27.660
You just feel so vulnerable. Yeah. Vulnerable is a great word for it.

2643
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:31.110
I also have so much more compassion for other people now because I think of

2644
02:32:31.111 --> 02:32:34.080
other people now as babies that grew up where I used to think,

2645
02:32:34.081 --> 02:32:35.640
oh look at this asshole. And I was think,

2646
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:38.310
oh that asshole used to be a little baby. Like someone's a little boy.

2647
02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:43.290
Someone's carrying him and holding him and he just got bad information and now

2648
02:32:43.291 --> 02:32:46.260
he's all fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. I saw some homeless guy today.

2649
02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:48.750
I was at a stop light. He was wearing a bathrobe,

2650
02:32:49.150 --> 02:32:51.990
got a bathrobe and socks on as it just dirty,

2651
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:56.600
fucked up and I was looking at him like this. That was someone's baby boy. Yeah.

2652
02:32:56.990 --> 02:33:00.180
Now here he is, a guy in his thirties or forties whatever.

2653
02:33:00.181 --> 02:33:01.680
He was just wandering around,

2654
02:33:01.681 --> 02:33:05.250
all fucked up and dirty with mental health problems wearing in a bathrobe and

2655
02:33:05.251 --> 02:33:08.150
I'm like, they used to be someone's boy. Yup. That's,

2656
02:33:09.210 --> 02:33:13.200
it's good for you to feel that way, but it's rough to live like that. Well,

2657
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:14.530
it's, it's,

2658
02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:19.050
it's so hard when you look at all the problems in the world and all the people

2659
02:33:19.051 --> 02:33:24.051
that are suffering from poverty and disease and strife and natural disasters and

2660
02:33:24.211 --> 02:33:27.300
all these things, there's just so many people to care about and think about.

2661
02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:30.750
It's almost like you can become paralyzed with compassion. Just stuff.

2662
02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:33.330
I'm really just looking at all the problems with the world. Yeah.

2663
02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:34.650
And then the other side of it,

2664
02:33:34.651 --> 02:33:39.651
the one that gets me a lot is like when you see parents or you hear about

2665
02:33:39.661 --> 02:33:41.040
parents, I haven't seen it a lot,

2666
02:33:41.070 --> 02:33:45.560
but you hear about parents who just don't give a fuck who it's like this.

2667
02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:49.100
This is a burden on me and they avoid it and digit I.

2668
02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:51.300
When you look at your daughter's eyes,

2669
02:33:51.301 --> 02:33:55.310
have you ever once in your life imagine being able to walk away from that? No.

2670
02:33:55.410 --> 02:33:57.150
Fuck that. That would kill me.

2671
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:59.700
I heard a story about a lady who abandoned her kids the other day.

2672
02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:04.080
I just couldn't imagine that she abandoned her kids and wanting to start fresh

2673
02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:07.500
left the husband with the kids just left. Wow.

2674
02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:10.080
And I was just sitting there going, what in the fuck?

2675
02:34:10.081 --> 02:34:14.440
And then the fires came and their fucking house burnt down. Wow.

2676
02:34:14.490 --> 02:34:18.460
And so then, so here they are, the dad and the kids, daughters

2677
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.410
<v 3>and the mom fucking jet and the guys. They're no house.</v>

2678
02:34:23.470 --> 02:34:28.360
Fuck. I'm like God, Jesus Christ man. Yeah man, it's,

2679
02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:32.020
it's rough cause you gotta wonder like what is wrong with that person?

2680
02:34:32.021 --> 02:34:35.050
Like what kind of schizophrenia they dealing with kind mental health issues.

2681
02:34:35.051 --> 02:34:37.000
Like what is, how could you do that?

2682
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:40.150
Like how do you not like you think about what you experienced with your son and

2683
02:34:40.151 --> 02:34:43.150
I think about what I experienced with my daughters and like how could you,

2684
02:34:43.690 --> 02:34:45.940
how could you not want to be there for them?

2685
02:34:45.941 --> 02:34:47.740
How could you not want to take care of them?

2686
02:34:47.770 --> 02:34:52.090
How could you not want to love them? It's there's some kind of disconnect man.

2687
02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.090
Yeah. What happened? Well,

2688
02:34:53.091 --> 02:34:56.440
I mean you think about that poor girl who kept punching herself in the face

2689
02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.110
because she thought she was falling. Like there's obviously an issue there.

2690
02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:02.740
Like what other issues are there psychologically with empathy issues,

2691
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:06.640
detachments, you know sociopathy like what,

2692
02:35:06.641 --> 02:35:09.070
what's wrong with them? That they're allowed,

2693
02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:13.300
that they can allow that in their life. So you know, there's too,

2694
02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:17.230
almost too many people, man, it's almost too much to pay attention to.

2695
02:35:17.530 --> 02:35:21.780
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I mean legitimately it's hard to say whether it is too much. Yeah.</v>

2696
02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.550
It's hard to say that and accepted, but it is. I mean,

2697
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:27.960
that's how a lot of people end up going crazy. Paralyzed from fear.

2698
02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:31.640
<v 3>Worry. Yeah. That's where we comes in. Yes.</v>

2699
02:35:32.330 --> 02:35:34.720
<v 0>You just worry about other shit. Think about aliens.</v>

2700
02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:37.960
Aliums if you had to guess,

2701
02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:40.770
<v 3>I'll turn it around on you. What do you think about aliens?</v>

2702
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:42.540
Do you think Bob was ours? Telling the truth.

2703
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.580
<v 0>I don't even look them in the eye because you weren't in the room with them.</v>

2704
02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:48.230
Yeah, but I told you I want, I'm the one of the,

2705
02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:50.380
the creepers that watched the youtube video.

2706
02:35:50.390 --> 02:35:55.150
I'm that guy right there that I sit at home. I don't really watch much TV.

2707
02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:59.290
Like I'll sit at home and like stretch and watch, uh, watch these videos.

2708
02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:00.550
So it's,

2709
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:04.210
I think it's a whole new thing to it like adds an element that I really like,

2710
02:36:04.270 --> 02:36:08.530
like being able to see miss pat did. Oh yeah. Fucking hilarious.

2711
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:13.510
Like my entire time I was like glued everybody.

2712
02:36:13.511 --> 02:36:13.900
I mean,

2713
02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:17.430
I've never funny when she talks about broke dudes are great at slings day,

2714
02:36:19.450 --> 02:36:23.590
you know, I love his art. Ari's subtleness like, Oh man,

2715
02:36:23.650 --> 02:36:24.520
he's fucking hilarious.

2716
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:28.600
I would imagine that for like a guy who's doing such ruthless fucking explosive

2717
02:36:28.601 --> 02:36:29.680
shit like you're doing all the time,

2718
02:36:29.681 --> 02:36:33.580
like comedy must be kind of important for sure. It's a huge release. Put some,

2719
02:36:33.581 --> 02:36:33.791
you know,

2720
02:36:33.791 --> 02:36:37.660
like I like it and a lot of my friends were that like I was friends with a lot

2721
02:36:37.661 --> 02:36:40.060
of guys at the comedy store, so I was around it. Like I,

2722
02:36:40.390 --> 02:36:42.640
I even thought about doing it for awhile. I just,

2723
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.110
I know I'd have to dedicate so much to even be decent that I just couldn't do

2724
02:36:47.111 --> 02:36:50.620
that. But like it's one of those things I like to take.

2725
02:36:50.850 --> 02:36:53.260
Tried it for a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I was with him.

2726
02:36:53.290 --> 02:36:55.780
I was hanging out with them a lot when he was working on material and stuff.

2727
02:36:56.350 --> 02:36:59.740
I remember he came over and he gave me a, this bad-ass Poncho.

2728
02:36:59.741 --> 02:37:03.700
One time he just randomly came over to give me a Poncho and then was like date

2729
02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.100
and then we wanted to hang out and when we were sitting out on my deck and we

2730
02:37:07.170 --> 02:37:10.840
had this boy, he was working, we were just chilling. He was, he's like,

2731
02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:13.780
it's so cool. One of the, what's that quote?

2732
02:37:13.781 --> 02:37:17.690
It's better to be a warrior and a garden and a gardener in a war. Yes.

2733
02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.660
That's state by state. Yeah, and that's similar to you.

2734
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.070
It's a lot of guys like that. You see a lot of these guys who are just,

2735
02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:30.460
they're built, ready to go. You know? Like if if some shit went down, like I,

2736
02:37:30.461 --> 02:37:33.650
I would happily stand next to you. You know, like I'd be, I'd be,

2737
02:37:33.651 --> 02:37:34.820
I'd feel like secure,

2738
02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:37.970
but you don't have to worry about like if you're coming here,

2739
02:37:37.971 --> 02:37:42.680
you're not going to have no fake lats syndrome and flex up on some asshole.

2740
02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:46.160
That's one of the things you do see with fighters too,

2741
02:37:46.430 --> 02:37:49.800
is that most of them in general, they're really nice people. Yeah.

2742
02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:53.450
As soon as they don't, they're not always puffing their chest out for no reason.

2743
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:56.230
Act like an asshole for no reason. They're nice folks. Yeah.

2744
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:58.880
They get all that shit out. They get it out in the gym.

2745
02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:02.440
If you're a bad motherfucker, you don't have to act like a bad motherfucker.

2746
02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:04.130
You just be, you exactly know.

2747
02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.150
That's why I wear pink Chuck's and strong and pretty shirts and shit. You know,

2748
02:38:08.151 --> 02:38:10.970
like I don't have to act like I'm bad that it's doing well.

2749
02:38:11.390 --> 02:38:16.100
No one's disputing it. Exactly. Exactly. There's a long line. They sometimes do.

2750
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:20.630
Oh, of course. Who are they? Are they even real? That's the people I'm saying.

2751
02:38:20.631 --> 02:38:25.250
I'm not a doctor for oh, for them, but for the aliens.

2752
02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.970
Um, what do you think he had a bad, if I, if he had 100 bucks,

2753
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:31.250
your last hundred bucks. It's hard. I,

2754
02:38:31.430 --> 02:38:33.950
if I had 100 bucks and we were going to find that,

2755
02:38:33.951 --> 02:38:37.640
I'd say I'm leaning more toward just them now. I'm looking more towards yes to,

2756
02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:40.670
I wasn't leaning before that interview. I wasn't though.

2757
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:44.540
I wasn't before the documentary that Jeremy Corbell documentary,

2758
02:38:45.770 --> 02:38:48.440
Bob Lasar area 51 and flying saucers before that.

2759
02:38:48.441 --> 02:38:51.470
I was like mostly bullshit because that one is that one available.

2760
02:38:51.471 --> 02:38:54.430
Like Netflix is great. Yeah, I'll check those.

2761
02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:58.130
A lot of old bibles are shit too from the George Knapp interviews where he goes

2762
02:38:58.131 --> 02:38:58.510
over the,

2763
02:38:58.510 --> 02:39:03.510
the details of the craft and he describes it and explains it and the fucker knew

2764
02:39:04.041 --> 02:39:07.340
about element one 15 in the 1990s that's, that's,

2765
02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:10.460
that's one of the big ones that gets me. That's one of the big ones.

2766
02:39:10.461 --> 02:39:13.730
That's like, that's a big red flag that this dude's real. This isn't a lot.

2767
02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:16.040
Who knows? But there's a lot that makes me go,

2768
02:39:18.100 --> 02:39:21.260
I know you talk about this all the time,

2769
02:39:21.290 --> 02:39:25.880
but I so fucking wish Sasquatch was real too. Man.

2770
02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.270
Every time I'm in Oregon or Washington, I'm walking around,

2771
02:39:29.271 --> 02:39:33.230
I buy all the little like roadside trinkets and shit. I love that shit.

2772
02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:36.230
I wish it was fucking real man. It would be nice.

2773
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:39.020
But I think we was on a deadline. It's, I mean that's,

2774
02:39:39.021 --> 02:39:42.200
that's one of the ones I'm like 90% sure. You got to give,

2775
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:45.710
you always gotta give room. You always got to give room for the possibility.

2776
02:39:46.390 --> 02:39:49.460
The thing is some people really believe and then go looking for it.

2777
02:39:49.461 --> 02:39:53.630
They invest so much time and if they start going crazy like survivor man,

2778
02:39:54.410 --> 02:39:58.100
Les Stroud. Yes. It's gone. Gone, gone. Gone. He's out there in the woods. Yeah.

2779
02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.870
He's got a pup tent for bigfoot, not fucking zippers. It's weird man.

2780
02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:07.160
He's 100% believer now and he does that for survivor man. Big Foot show.

2781
02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:09.530
He's like what? I heard a branch snap, not the commercial.

2782
02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:13.040
That's definitely a squatch. Yeah. Those shows are weird man,

2783
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:14.063
because those shows

2784
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.430
<v 1>have been on TV like surviving bigfoot or finding bigfoot rather.</v>

2785
02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:20.670
So finding bigfoot was on TV for what? Eight fucking years.

2786
02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:24.140
They never found shit. No like how the fuck do you keep renewing that shit?

2787
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:28.980
I'm going to breathe underwater. The show. It's called breathing underwater.

2788
02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:32.700
Can you breathe under water? Not yet. Tune in next week. Next season though,

2789
02:40:32.730 --> 02:40:35.630
we're going to try to breathe underwater. The shit out of y'all.

2790
02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:38.100
Just give us an off season. We'll get this talking to these scientists.

2791
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:41.100
They're saying no one can breathe under water. Not yet. They don't know shit.

2792
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:45.380
Trust South Louisiana. We got a guy he breathes on the water. If,

2793
02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:48.420
if there was a big foot, no one be happier than me. Dude,

2794
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:51.960
I'd be right there though. I was so fucking stoked, man.

2795
02:40:51.961 --> 02:40:56.670
I just seen it in a cage. Just fucking trying to get out.

2796
02:40:57.090 --> 02:41:00.160
Looking around and no, not cage though. I want to see it like in a,

2797
02:41:00.161 --> 02:41:04.380
in a destiny like the mushrooms trip where he's like walking and singing with

2798
02:41:04.381 --> 02:41:08.640
him. Oh, Jack blocks. Pick a X. Pick a destiny. Pick of destiny.

2799
02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:13.020
I would want to be there. I want to want to see it with my own eyes. For sure.

2800
02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:14.400
Video. I'd be like, man,

2801
02:41:14.610 --> 02:41:18.570
I saw 80 foot tall Donald Trump with a Hillary Clinton head.

2802
02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:23.760
Power walk you through a post apocalyptic Philadelphia. You can't,

2803
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:27.880
you can't prove to me that video's real. I mean, you see it. I would,

2804
02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:30.900
I would shit my pants. I don't know what I would say though,

2805
02:41:31.050 --> 02:41:34.140
if I was in the woods and I was camping and I saw a fucking nine foot tall

2806
02:41:34.141 --> 02:41:37.090
gorilla. I Dunno what I would say. You wouldn't,

2807
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:41.030
I mean if you came back you probably have to. Yeah, cause you'd be so,

2808
02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.310
you feel so stupid. Oh, plus I mean there's a lot.

2809
02:41:44.311 --> 02:41:46.410
I mean say there is one out there.

2810
02:41:46.770 --> 02:41:49.920
There's a lot of bullshit artists out there telling you they saw some shit.

2811
02:41:49.950 --> 02:41:52.050
You know a lot of people trying to get some camera time.

2812
02:41:52.170 --> 02:41:55.320
They can't be one though. If it's going to be a real thing, a living thing,

2813
02:41:55.321 --> 02:41:57.600
that has to be a living population of them. Yeah,

2814
02:41:57.601 --> 02:41:59.040
because primates don't live that long.

2815
02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:02.880
I don't think there's a primary that lives any older than humans. We're just,

2816
02:42:02.881 --> 02:42:05.340
we're just way into the weeds. But no, that doesn't exist.

2817
02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:07.480
This most likely success. Yeah.

2818
02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:12.330
As they get better and better at like using drones and scanning the forest and

2819
02:42:12.331 --> 02:42:14.910
stuff, it's getting less and less likely. Yeah.

2820
02:42:15.270 --> 02:42:16.590
I used to do that as a kid though.

2821
02:42:16.591 --> 02:42:19.950
Like walk out in the woods and like look and hope it was around, you know, hope.

2822
02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:21.930
Yeah. When I was living in Oregon, I was like,

2823
02:42:21.931 --> 02:42:25.470
hell's canyon is probably one of the least explored parts of Oregon.

2824
02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:27.990
If he was anyway, he'd be up there, you know?

2825
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:31.470
Well there's some dense ass thick forest in the Pacific northwest,

2826
02:42:31.471 --> 02:42:35.460
which is one of the reasons why I think it's so attractive because you think

2827
02:42:35.461 --> 02:42:38.020
like, man, hey thing could be in here. No one knows. Right?

2828
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:41.310
Like you go outside of Philadelphia or excuse me, Seattle.

2829
02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:45.390
When you go into a like, you know, what is it? What's the mountain out there?

2830
02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:48.840
What's the sat Helen say now this is the one that blue,

2831
02:42:48.841 --> 02:42:52.740
but there's another one that, anyway, those big ass mountains filled with soup.

2832
02:42:53.350 --> 02:42:56.120
There's, the trees are so dense, it's like a box of Q tips,

2833
02:42:56.470 --> 02:42:59.070
just one after the other bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang,

2834
02:42:59.071 --> 02:43:03.570
and the forest floor is all pine needles so that nothing would leave a footprint

2835
02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.800
and then you look, you're like, what if you saw something 30 yards away?

2836
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:10.260
It could disappear instantly left, right.

2837
02:43:10.261 --> 02:43:13.360
You wouldn't know where the fuck it is. You'd never find it. And it could,

2838
02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:16.740
it could be out there. So I think that also leads to this,

2839
02:43:17.390 --> 02:43:20.550
this delusional idea that it might be alive. Right.

2840
02:43:21.070 --> 02:43:24.490
But I think it definitely was a real thing back in the day. Yeah.

2841
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:28.390
They have that gigantic [inaudible] yeah. That they proven was a,

2842
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:33.040
a real, uh, bipedal hominid that existed at,

2843
02:43:33.100 --> 02:43:37.720
as recently as 100,000 years ago. And it will America, no, it was in Asia.

2844
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:40.180
They found an apothecary shop.

2845
02:43:40.181 --> 02:43:42.370
There was a anthropologist who was in an apothecary,

2846
02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:47.200
found a teeth and he was like, what the fuck is this? And they said, uh,

2847
02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:49.480
we found these. And he's like, where'd you find these?

2848
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:52.080
Cause you recognize it as primate teeth. And then they,

2849
02:43:52.081 --> 02:43:55.840
they start digging and they found job bones that were indicative of a bipedal

2850
02:43:55.841 --> 02:43:58.180
hominid because of the, the shape of the job on,

2851
02:43:58.181 --> 02:44:00.940
they could tell the difference between like the way a gorillas burnt bones are

2852
02:44:00.941 --> 02:44:02.110
shaped and the way ours are.

2853
02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:05.850
And they think it was in the orangutan family that it was enormous.

2854
02:44:06.090 --> 02:44:10.660
Some it enormous fucking eight to 10 foot tall by peatal ape. Yeah.

2855
02:44:11.320 --> 02:44:15.350
So stories that build and build them to set them. That's probably where the,

2856
02:44:15.351 --> 02:44:17.020
the lore and the legend comes from.

2857
02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:19.210
You never seen like a picture of what it looks like.

2858
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:23.760
I remember you talking about it on here. I don't remember. Um,

2859
02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:26.500
if I saw a picture, you could find it on Google.

2860
02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:30.220
There's pictures of it standing next to like a standard, you know,

2861
02:44:30.221 --> 02:44:31.570
like six foot tall man.

2862
02:44:31.571 --> 02:44:35.800
Like what a regular size man would be like standing next to this giant ass

2863
02:44:35.801 --> 02:44:38.200
fucking gorilla really did live.

2864
02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:42.430
It really did live and it lived alongside people while people were real people.

2865
02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:46.250
They know at least a hundred thousand years ago it was alive. That's,

2866
02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:51.230
that's what it looked like. Oh Shit. Yeah. That's a depiction of them.

2867
02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:52.990
There's a, there's a few different versions of that.

2868
02:44:52.991 --> 02:44:56.260
We'll get that other shit with the harm up in the Air Jamie and the lower right

2869
02:44:56.261 --> 02:44:59.710
hand corner. No, no, no, no. Go, go up, up,

2870
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:05.890
go see those pictures. I see that when you have those little pictures and the,

2871
02:45:05.891 --> 02:45:08.910
the little windows below it. She the one with his arm up in the air. Yeah.

2872
02:45:09.130 --> 02:45:12.100
Click that one. That's the one. That's what it looked like.

2873
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:16.860
I shit with fuck you up to yeah, probably super fast.

2874
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:18.490
It's Kinda like a rank tan looking.

2875
02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:21.070
That's what they think their thinking was kind of a member of the orangutan

2876
02:45:21.071 --> 02:45:25.960
family. But it was a real thing.

2877
02:45:25.961 --> 02:45:29.350
But it's just funny how like we want those things to be real.

2878
02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:31.450
We want mysteries to be real.

2879
02:45:31.930 --> 02:45:35.410
It's part of the reasons why you have to really worry or wonder whether or not

2880
02:45:35.411 --> 02:45:39.550
someone's telling the truth because of the desire for something to be real.

2881
02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:42.540
So strong. Right? Like UFO, the same thing.

2882
02:45:42.610 --> 02:45:45.940
People want to believe God so hard to be objective.

2883
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.310
What about with all that stuff hotep was saying on here?

2884
02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:53.350
Cause like a lot of it he sounds like way more intelligent than I was expecting

2885
02:45:53.351 --> 02:45:55.750
when I first turned it on. I didn't really know much about him,

2886
02:45:56.140 --> 02:45:58.870
but I mean about Africans traveling the world in boats.

2887
02:45:59.290 --> 02:46:02.370
Well about them being in America first or about them,

2888
02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:07.240
like giving that technology to Rome. He said a lot of stuff that like,

2889
02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:09.980
I mean obviously I'm a meat head

2890
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.290
<v 3>and I'm not like the smartest man on the planet,</v>

2891
02:46:12.291 --> 02:46:15.380
but he's made a lot of sense from what he was saying. Well,

2892
02:46:15.381 --> 02:46:19.400
for sure when people think about Africa, they forget about Egypt.

2893
02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:24.760
And Egypt is one of the most fascinating and absolutely spectacularly advanced

2894
02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.700
civilizations of all time. We have no idea how they built those structures.

2895
02:46:28.701 --> 02:46:30.320
There's all this speculation about the,

2896
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:33.330
especially like the Great Pyramid of just this,

2897
02:46:33.350 --> 02:46:38.350
a stunning technological and physical accomplishment that to this day baffles

2898
02:46:38.811 --> 02:46:41.780
people. That's Africa. So those people at boats,

2899
02:46:41.810 --> 02:46:46.200
and we don't even know how long, I mean Graham Hancock believes and so does uh,

2900
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:50.150
Robert Schoch and um, John Anthony West, when he was alive,

2901
02:46:50.810 --> 02:46:55.490
believed that those people were building those things tens of thousands of years

2902
02:46:55.490 --> 02:46:56.240
ago. That,

2903
02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:01.240
that that is like a spectacularly creative and innovative society that was most

2904
02:47:02.001 --> 02:47:06.440
likely wiped out by some sort of global capitalism around 12,000 years ago.

2905
02:47:06.590 --> 02:47:10.330
And then everything after that was a rebuilding of past knowledge. Right.

2906
02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:14.030
So it would make sense if they had traveled to south, uh,

2907
02:47:14.031 --> 02:47:17.750
south parts of America and then just basically everything got wiped out.

2908
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.823
And so they're,

2909
02:47:19.090 --> 02:47:22.670
they're working from a fresh start in America and then over on this side,

2910
02:47:22.671 --> 02:47:26.060
they don't have the information about that because they all got wiped out. Well,

2911
02:47:26.061 --> 02:47:28.940
it certainly makes sense that you look at the Omex, those deals,

2912
02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:31.910
giant stone heads, it looked like African faces, right? I mean,

2913
02:47:31.911 --> 02:47:35.810
they look exactly like Africans and these [inaudible] heads that came from

2914
02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:38.480
thousands and thousands of years ago in a civilization.

2915
02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:41.900
The omex that they know very little about. Yeah.

2916
02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:44.090
So I felt like,

2917
02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:47.600
I felt like I was crazy for thinking he wasn't crazy for some of the shit he was

2918
02:47:47.601 --> 02:47:52.550
saying. It's like the history of humans is something that becomes more,

2919
02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:55.250
it unveils itself over time.

2920
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:58.040
And the more they're starting to find new things,

2921
02:47:58.310 --> 02:47:59.960
like there was something of the law,

2922
02:48:00.050 --> 02:48:04.010
there was some ancient castle that they just discovered that used to be

2923
02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:07.640
underwater. That's like 3000, 500 years old.

2924
02:48:07.730 --> 02:48:11.210
And I'm talking about the receding floodwater. Yeah, yeah. They found like,

2925
02:48:11.211 --> 02:48:13.310
what the fuck is this? They don't like, they don't even know what it is.

2926
02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:15.410
So 3,500 years ago,

2927
02:48:15.411 --> 02:48:19.070
long before Europeans ever came to America,

2928
02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:22.110
these people built this fucking castle that is now underwater.

2929
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:25.340
You're like the sea levels rise and fall. That's it. Yeah.

2930
02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:27.770
Where is the things in Iraq? Oh yeah, it is in Iraq. Yeah,

2931
02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:32.480
so they found these ancient, now Iraq is also where Sumir was.

2932
02:48:32.481 --> 02:48:33.680
That's the,

2933
02:48:33.850 --> 02:48:37.730
the earliest known civilization in terms of the earliest known writing,

2934
02:48:38.090 --> 02:48:41.630
the earliest known agriculture in mathematics. That's Sumar,

2935
02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:45.410
that's epic of Gilgamesh. All that shit came from that part of the world.

2936
02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:49.280
So there's all sorts of stuff that was probably lost in that, you know,

2937
02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:52.760
thousands and thousands of years of history. It's amazing.

2938
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:55.580
It's so fascinating to be there. Just like,

2939
02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:57.860
I like this place that I was in in Italy,

2940
02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:03.790
there's a church in Ravello that's a thousand years old and below the church is

2941
02:49:04.461 --> 02:49:08.040
a glass floor. The church. There's pictures of it on my, and it's

2942
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:13.040
<v 1>a glass floor of the church and below the glass for is that is another church</v>

2943
02:49:13.980 --> 02:49:18.530
that's so old. They don't even know when it was built. Oh. So it's more that.

2944
02:49:18.531 --> 02:49:22.770
That's it. That's from my, my Instagram. So fucking cool. So that,

2945
02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:27.900
that they have it like blocked off and they put a glass floor over it so you

2946
02:49:27.901 --> 02:49:32.130
could look down and see it because they don't want people to tread on it and

2947
02:49:32.131 --> 02:49:35.220
fuck with it. But the church itself,

2948
02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.290
just that the church that you could walk around in is a thousand years old.

2949
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:44.490
You know what? And we're working off information.

2950
02:49:44.491 --> 02:49:47.430
That's basically just been since we started writing things down.

2951
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:51.840
We've got this little short time period where we started writing things down.

2952
02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:55.380
I mean acting almost as though that was the beginning of time.

2953
02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:59.310
And you have to take people's word for it. Exactly. Exactly. No pictures,

2954
02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:02.310
no video. Same thing with the aliens and the Sasquatch.

2955
02:50:02.311 --> 02:50:06.090
There's some things that you want to believe. So throw that in there.

2956
02:50:06.330 --> 02:50:11.250
And history was written by the winners. Exactly. So bunch of lion assholes.

2957
02:50:11.390 --> 02:50:12.223
It killed everybody.

2958
02:50:12.690 --> 02:50:17.150
Like the chair is my friend.

2959
02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:21.060
My son loves that song between that one, and we will rock you. We've got,

2960
02:50:21.090 --> 02:50:24.150
we were in a limo yesterday and he was like, put on, we will rock you.

2961
02:50:24.151 --> 02:50:28.110
So I'm cranking. We will rock you. My three year olds in the back deal. Boom,

2962
02:50:28.111 --> 02:50:30.980
boom. She's so excited. That's awesome.

2963
02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:36.240
When you think about fucking classic songs, Man Queen had a gay,

2964
02:50:36.241 --> 02:50:40.080
a classic songs that just worldwide to this day that are used it.

2965
02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:44.610
Basketball Games and football games all over the world. Yeah. Huge.

2966
02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:49.290
Such a icon. Yeah. John Jones came out to, we are the champions. Yeah.

2967
02:50:49.350 --> 02:50:53.210
This was this last one. Yeah. Nice. I didn't get to see the fights that,

2968
02:50:53.220 --> 02:50:56.910
how did I know John went to a, it was a split decision, right?

2969
02:50:57.440 --> 02:51:01.620
How did the fight fight? Man, fucking Tiago Santos is danger us.

2970
02:51:01.621 --> 02:51:03.180
He hit John with some big shots,

2971
02:51:03.390 --> 02:51:07.620
fucked his legs up with kicks to the point where John had to be carried out when

2972
02:51:07.621 --> 02:51:11.220
he, when he walked out of the octagon, they were carrying him. He couldn't walk.

2973
02:51:11.221 --> 02:51:12.660
His legs were fucked up.

2974
02:51:12.661 --> 02:51:16.950
That guy kicked the shit out of his legs and Tiago blew his knee out somewhere

2975
02:51:16.951 --> 02:51:20.700
in the first, we believe he threw a kick and blew his ACL out,

2976
02:51:20.701 --> 02:51:22.370
but never even winced. He,

2977
02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:26.490
you around that knee and just kept throwing kicks with it and everything. Yeah,

2978
02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:31.050
I'm crazy. It was an awesome fight. Your think, uh, he fought was, again,

2979
02:51:31.051 --> 02:51:33.420
this is, I'm not projecting anything. I didn't get to see the fight.

2980
02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:37.770
Did he fight well enough to suffer it extensive damage to left knee out for the

2981
02:51:37.771 --> 02:51:40.850
rest of 2008 well, there goes the question. I was just saying.

2982
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:45.300
You think you earned another shot? Well, he, he definitely did. He proved,

2983
02:51:45.870 --> 02:51:50.310
yeah, he had a split decision. What, what's up complete?

2984
02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:55.610
Ligament's torn in his left knee. Oh yeah. There you go. Yeah, I kind of,

2985
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:58.140
we kind of saw it looking at it. Yeah.

2986
02:51:58.830 --> 02:52:03.150
Shows left knee meniscus and all his ligaments are completely torn. Wow.

2987
02:52:03.810 --> 02:52:07.360
The meniscus and all the ligaments, that's Jesus Christ.

2988
02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:10.450
And he still stood in there for four fucking rounds.

2989
02:52:10.600 --> 02:52:13.240
He needed surgery on his right knee earlier this year.

2990
02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:17.410
Also suffered damage during the fight as he compensated for his left knee.

2991
02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:18.273
Oh Man.

2992
02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:22.420
So he doesn't even know if he might need tests on his right knee as well.

2993
02:52:23.050 --> 02:52:27.070
But you know what the good news is that UFC doctors are the top of the food

2994
02:52:27.071 --> 02:52:27.280
chain.

2995
02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:31.540
They'll fill that motherfucker up with stem cells and do everything they can of

2996
02:52:31.541 --> 02:52:33.960
rebuild some of that inner tissue. He deserves it.

2997
02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:37.480
If you're going to stand in them and put it all in the line like that, you know,

2998
02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:40.000
give the man his fucking stem cells. If they fight again,

2999
02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:43.990
Jon Jones fucking power doubles him. Takes him to the ground. So yeah,

3000
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:47.770
I mean I think, I don't, I'm a, I was shocked that he didn't do it. I saw,

3001
02:52:47.771 --> 02:52:48.870
I read, um,

3002
02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.450
I don't know if it was on his page or on the ones like MMA junkie or something,

3003
02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:54.220
but um, he said that he,

3004
02:52:54.221 --> 02:52:58.780
it was pride he didn't want to do that cause that's crazy. That's John Though.

3005
02:52:58.810 --> 02:53:01.690
But the pride almost cost him the title. Yeah. Like,

3006
02:53:01.691 --> 02:53:05.230
what if Tiago clipped him and dropped him in the third round and then he won

3007
02:53:05.231 --> 02:53:08.370
that round on all the judges scorecards and then he wanted decision. Yeah,

3008
02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:11.550
he almost lost the title. We can look crazy. I mean I don't,

3009
02:53:11.620 --> 02:53:15.370
I don't agree necessarily with the guy who give it to gave it to Tiago.

3010
02:53:15.371 --> 02:53:19.120
I'd have to watch it and see how they thought it and yeah, cause when you're,

3011
02:53:19.330 --> 02:53:22.870
when you're calling a fight, I'm trying to be entertaining.

3012
02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:27.100
I'm looking for patterns, but I'm not really scoring it to score it.

3013
02:53:27.101 --> 02:53:29.000
I think you have to do it in silence. Yeah.

3014
02:53:29.310 --> 02:53:31.600
So I'd have to see whether or not I agreed with them,

3015
02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:32.980
but it was definitely close.

3016
02:53:33.010 --> 02:53:34.780
It was definitely interesting and a lot more interesting.

3017
02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:35.561
A lot of people thought,

3018
02:53:35.561 --> 02:53:37.350
a lot of people thought John was going to blow them out of the water.

3019
02:53:37.410 --> 02:53:40.930
And that's what I was expecting. I've messed around just like, you know,

3020
02:53:40.931 --> 02:53:43.330
like Bro, like, like uh,

3021
02:53:43.690 --> 02:53:47.260
pushing him around and stuff like that and he's way stronger than I would

3022
02:53:47.261 --> 02:53:51.310
expect. Oh, he's strong. It's fucked. Last Shit. He took Daniel Cormier down,

3023
02:53:51.570 --> 02:53:54.040
you know, I mean he's a mother fucker dude.

3024
02:53:54.430 --> 02:53:56.950
And I think when he goes up to heavyweight he's going to be even stronger.

3025
02:53:56.951 --> 02:54:00.000
And I think that's probably what's going to happen next with Sean before they

3026
02:54:00.010 --> 02:54:05.010
fucking should winter steepen the dental fighting that's out here in August.

3027
02:54:05.650 --> 02:54:10.450
August. That is um, yeah, that's an August. And that's at Anaheim. Yeah. Um,

3028
02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:14.800
man, DC and Steve Bay too. That should be very interesting too.

3029
02:54:14.860 --> 02:54:18.490
I don't even know who to root for it cause I fucking love stupid. I love him.

3030
02:54:18.730 --> 02:54:19.990
But like I, I've got,

3031
02:54:20.880 --> 02:54:24.790
I feel like I have to love Daniel cause everyone else for no fucking reason

3032
02:54:24.791 --> 02:54:26.680
doesn't like they do now.

3033
02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:30.430
You think they're more and more he's getting Manuel's turned good turn cause he

3034
02:54:30.431 --> 02:54:33.220
fucking deserves it. You know, I mean he's,

3035
02:54:33.310 --> 02:54:36.530
he's a bad motherfucker initially knocked out Steve pay one punch that,

3036
02:54:36.531 --> 02:54:40.810
that turned the tide good. Good for him when he beat Anthony Johnson,

3037
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:43.690
that turned the tie. People get it now for awhile though.

3038
02:54:43.691 --> 02:54:48.390
They were like looking at him like he's a legitimate, absurd. Well,

3039
02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:53.460
welcome to the world of MMA pedes versus DSS on that car to l yellow Romero
