the efficient markets hypothesis but

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
the efficient markets hypothesis but
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.519
the efficient markets hypothesis but

how do prices incorporate new
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800
how do prices incorporate new
information so I devised a lot of tests

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
information so I devised a lot of tests
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.009

to how you about how you go about doing
doing that that's one branch of asset

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
doing that that's one branch of asset
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910
doing that that's one branch of asset
pricing for which the award was given

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
pricing for which the award was given
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880
pricing for which the award was given
the other one is what we call asset

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
the other one is what we call asset
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250
the other one is what we call asset
pricing models which are really stories

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
pricing models which are really stories
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.700
pricing models which are really stories
about how you measure risk and then what

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
about how you measure risk and then what
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.690
about how you measure risk and then what
is the relation between risk and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700
is the relation between risk and
 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.850
is the relation between risk and
expected return so they are basically

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
expected return so they are basically
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610
expected return so they are basically
risk return story so those are the kind

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
risk return story so those are the kind
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189
risk return story so those are the kind
of the two main branches of of asset

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
of the two main branches of of asset
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.720
of the two main branches of of asset
pricing which I've been working on for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
pricing which I've been working on for
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.199
