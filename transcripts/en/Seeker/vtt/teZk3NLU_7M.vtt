00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.880
Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising,
droughts are more frequent, extreme weather

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.259
events more common-- This is climate change
in action, and you’ve heard it all before.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.889
But a major report just came out that looks
at how close we are to this irreversible damage,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.160
and it’s looking bad.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Real bad.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.170
Back in 2015, the world’s leaders came together
to solidify a plan to combat climate change.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.570
The resulting Paris Agreement set a goal to
hold “the increase of global average temperature

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.230
to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial
levels” and added the intent of “limiting

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.540
the temperature increase to 1.5°C. But now,
in October of 2018, the UN Intergovernmental

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.870
Panel on Climate Change, or the IPCC, compiled
the results of over 6,000 scientific studies

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.420
and released a new report.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.420
The main takeaway?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.390
At our current rate, global average temperature
is likely to rise 1.5°C between as early

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.770
as 2030.This means, we only have 12 years
to make drastic changes, or we’ll miss our

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.770
target.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.800
The difference between 1.5 and 2 may seem
small, and and it’s hard to imagine how

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.439
half a degree could make much of an impact.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.600
But using climate models, scientists can predict
what that half a degree actually means for

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
our planet.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.479
And, well, it means a lot.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.789
First there’s the arctic.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.149
At 1.5 degrees warming, arctic sea ice will
still last through most summers, but at 2

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.179
degrees, ice-free summers become 10 times
more likely.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.320
This would not only be devastating for arctic
wildlife, but would reduce the albedo, or

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.740
the amount of light being reflected away from
earth, causing even more warming.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.120
Ice melt coupled with rising temperatures
means sea level rise.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.350
At 1.5 degrees warming, average sea level
rise could be somewhere between 26 and 77

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
centimeters.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.509
At 2 degrees, that range could go up a whole
10 centimeters.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.509
That change could expose about 10 million
more people to harmful flooding than if warming

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.780
stays at 1.5.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.880
A warmer world also means that fresh water
will become even more scarce.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.319
At 1.5 degrees, severe drought will likely
affect 350 million people, but at 2 degrees,

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.369
that number grows to about 411 million people.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.899
Heatwaves get worse, too.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.830
At 1.5 degrees, about 14% of the world’s
population will be exposed to severe heat

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.140
waves, and at 2 degrees that number more than
doubles, raising to a whopping 37%.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.690
Then, there’s the coral reefs.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.010
At 1.5 degrees warming, 70-90% of coral reefs
die.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.230
At 2 degrees, that number grows to greater
than 99%, meaning virtually all coral reefs

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.790
will disappear.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.510
This would be devastating to marine biodiversity
and affect nearly 500 million people who rely

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.180
on them for storm protection, food, jobs and
recreation.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.330
If none of this phases you, a separate study
published in Nature looked into how many people

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390
could die from that half degree rise.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.310
They found that due to air pollution alone,
an additional 150 million people could die

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.840
if we hit 2 degrees.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.610
And that’s not even including the likely
deaths by heat wave, drought, and famine.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.070
So what can we do?

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.840
Well, the report makes it clear that the pledges
made in the Paris Agreement will not be enough.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.480
It not only states that these goals won’t
keep us under the 1.5 degree mark, but that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.400
they could result in a warming of THREE DEGREES
by 2100.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.380
A whole degree higher than what the world
decided should be an upper threshold.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.050
To prevent this, the report states that we
have to drastically reduce CO2 emissions well

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.860
before 2030, and at faster rate than we ever
have before.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.170
And while highly unlikely, scientists are
stressing that keeping warming to 1.5 degrees

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.880
is still possible.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.730
Projections suggest it would require CO2 emissions
to take a nosedive and then operate in the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.990
negatives towards the end of the century.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.770
While there’s no definitive plan yet, it
would likely involve steep, across the board

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.220
investment in renewables, the electrification
of huge energy sectors that currently run

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.450
on fossil fuels, and rapid advances in negative
emission technologies that can suck carbon

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.450
out of the air.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.990
Among other things-- like a carbon tax, a
world-wide reduction in meat consumption,

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.320
a decline in population growth, and maximized
global energy efficiency.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.610
So yeah, it will take quite literally everything
we’ve got, but it’s possible.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.780
So what do you think, can we do it?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.050
Negative emission technologies could be a
big player in our fight against climate change,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.360
but how feasible are they?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.300
We’ve got a video coming about about that
soon.
