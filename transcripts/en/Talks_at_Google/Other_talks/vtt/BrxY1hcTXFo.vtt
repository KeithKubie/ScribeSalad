[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:13.770
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.750
I really appreciate it.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.570
We have an amazing
guest for you today,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.800
Dan Harris of "10%
Happier" and "Meditation

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.035
for Fidgety Skeptics."

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:27.200
Dan was basically primed for
just a conventionally very

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.100
successful career in journalism
and perhaps nothing else.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.020
And in 2000, he joined ABC
News and was kind of primed

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.800
to make it to the top there.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.670
In 2014, he actually had
a panic attack on air.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.442
And this was kind of an
inflection point for him.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:50.400
And he essentially did
what all of us would do,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.410
which is kind of investigate
the sources of his panic attack

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.310
and what were the causes of it.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.300
And he used his journalism
platform as leverage

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.040
to meet a lot of the best
in the self-help industry.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.710
And he documented
that in "10% Happier."

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.680
And what's really
amazing about that book,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.100
as opposed to a lot of
other self-help books,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.630
it's not immediately
embracing of everything

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.400
that's New Agey and self-helpy.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.590
He comes in, as
he calls himself,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.390
a hard-charging skeptic.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.580
And he kind of sifts the
substance from the snake oil.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.160
And it's written not in a
proselytizing or pedantic way.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.040
It's written in a way that
you can really identify with.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.710
So I definitely recommend
checking that out.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.380
And then he follows up with
"Meditation for Fidgety

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.140
Skeptics," which is--

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.090
if "10% Happier" gets you bought
into meditating to begin with,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.130
this book is kind of the how-to.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.450
If you have a lot of objections
and maybe aren't fully

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.156
bought in, then it is helpful.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.530
Or then you are bought in,
and you do think it's helpful,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.680
but you're having a hard
time just doing it every day,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.259
this book is going
to help you there.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.360
So I recommend both.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.405
He has a podcast as well,
"10% Happier" podcast.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:15.740
He has an app.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.890
And he's still doing all of
the amazing journalistic things

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.350
as well on "GMA"
and other platforms.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.020
So yeah, thank you so
much, Dan, for coming here.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.120
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.070
SPEAKER: We really
appreciate it.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.440
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.510
I love from an anthropological
standpoint that--

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.870
Oh, hi.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.400
Nobody sits right-- except
for this brave individual.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.810
It's like there's some
sort of force field.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.810
SPEAKER: Maybe they're
just afraid of meditation.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.884
DAN HARRIS: Or just me.

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:44.780
SPEAKER: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.350
So I want to kind of set
some context here and just

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.150
talk about your life
pre-meditation and your outlook

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.250
on life.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.160
I think your dad actually had
an interesting phrase that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.130
[INAUDIBLE] that kind of
represented your take on life

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.140
and just being a very
ambitious person trying

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.090
to make it to the top.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.506
It was something
about insecurity.

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.880
And then post-meditation,
just so we kind of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.030
get people bought into
your transformation.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.340
Yeah.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.980
DAN HARRIS: So I was--

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.210
my dad is an academic
physician, a recently retired

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.480
academic physician
in Boston and very--

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.240
both my parents are
academic physicians,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.430
so really sort of hard charging,
secular folks in Boston.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.750
And my dad had an expression,
which is, the price of security

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.910
is insecurity, which is a
great thing to tell your child.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.260
It always shocks
people when I tell them

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.280
that my father's Jewish.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.050
And so it was this kind of idea
that the only way to succeed

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.550
is to work incredibly hard.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.920
And it takes a lot
of gnashing of teeth

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.450
and rending of garments.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.640
And so that became my way
of surviving when I arrived

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.220
at ABC News in the year 2000.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.570
And I was 28 and really
young and insecure

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.870
about my lack of experience.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.029
And I mean, I had operated on
this thesis for a long time.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.100
But it really went
into overdrive

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.300
when I came here to
New York 18 years ago.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:29.420
And even now that I'm, oddly
enough, sort of a traveling

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.550
evangelist for meditation, which
was never in my plan at all--

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.680
even now that I am, I
still actually believe

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.210
the price of security
is insecurity.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.000
I still think if you're
going to do anything great,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.576
it takes a lot of
work, and stress,

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:43.700
and plotting, and planning.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.890
And I do a lot of that.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.370
Even though I really believe
in the benefits of meditation,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.470
I'm still as ambitious
as I ever was.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.720
I not only have my
situation at ABC,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.930
where I host "Nightline" and
the weekend edition of "Good

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.330
Morning America," but I
have a startup company

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.300
and I think five books
kind of planned in my head

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.380
that I want to do.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.130
And I have a podcast.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.850
And I go around giving
speeches and stuff like that.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.160
So I'm still really ambitious
in some of the same ways

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.320
that I was as a younger guy.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.560
But I think I'm just less
of an asshole about it.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.930
I mean, that is really--

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.430
people ask me all
the time, how do I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.110
know if meditation is working?

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.390
And really the simple
metric is, are you

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.270
less of an asshole to
yourself and others?

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.620
And that's the key.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.630
Because often the number one
victim of our worst impulses

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.140
is ourselves.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.690
And so I think that
where meditation helps

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.050
is that I have
learned how to draw

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.790
the line between
useless rumination

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.890
and what I call
constructive anguish.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.650
There's a certain amount
of plotting and planning

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.991
that makes sense, and
hard work, and stress,

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:07.740
and banging your head
up against the wall.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.620
And then it stops making sense.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.730
And really having increased
self-awareness, which is really

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.240
one of the big
fruits of meditation,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.260
can help you see, all
right, at this point,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.530
is this angst useful?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.210
And learning how to manage
that has made me much more

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.130
effective in my job and
also easier to live with,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.030
just living with
myself, but also I've

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.629
heard my wife talk about this
many times, just generally

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:38.670
being less of a shithead.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:43.070
SPEAKER: Fair.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.820
I want to go through the plot
line of "10% Happier" just

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.870
a little bit.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.710
DAN HARRIS: Sure.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.760
SPEAKER: I think it basically
shows through your life

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.800
how meditation is very
effective and that you

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.350
tried a bunch of
different things

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.240
and kind of looked
at everything.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.080
So you had this
panic attack on air.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.670
You kind of sought help.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.120
And you realized it was kind
of a mild form of depression

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.190
and anxiety.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.370
And describe from there.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.990
You used your
platform as leverage

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.340
to meet Deepak Chopra,
and Eckhart Tolle,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.360
and people like that.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.030
Describe those experiences
and then what brought you

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.020
to realizing just plain
and simple mindfulness

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.300
meditation is the most
scientifically studied thing.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.050
This works.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.760
DAN HARRIS: So I wouldn't
recommend you do it my way

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.650
because it involved doing
a lot of stupid things.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.890
There are plenty of
seats over here, guys.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.642
SPEAKER: Front row.

00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:37.520
DAN HARRIS: I'm trying to
see if I can challenge people

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.065
to sit directly in front of
me so I can give you a death

00:07:40.065 --> 00:07:40.940
stare the whole time.

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:45.359
Hi.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:46.080
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.580
How are you?

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.690
DAN HARRIS: Good.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.990
I like this guy.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.270
So I really don't recommend
you do it the way I did.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:59.310
So I had a panic attack on
national television in 2004--

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.740
unpleasant and
really embarrassing.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.710
And I was filling in as the
newsreader on "Good Morning

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.210
America."

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.980
They don't have that
position anymore.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.570
But there used to
be that somebody

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.090
would come on at the top of each
hour and read the headlines.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.005
And I had filled in
on this job before.

00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:20.630
And I didn't have
any reason to foresee

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.005
what was about to happen,
which was that I just basically

00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:23.570
freaked out.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.730
And because I have a
pretty good poker face,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.020
and I'd spent my entire
adult life on television,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.052
it didn't look--

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.510
I mean, it didn't
look like I was--

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.669
I didn't rip the mic
off and run away.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.110
I just had trouble breathing.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.720
And I was stammering a
lot, although actually, you

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.039
can see it on a company I
believe you own called YouTube.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.300
If you Google or search on
YouTube for panic attack

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.260
on live television, it's
the number one result.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.010
And after I had the panic
attack, I went to a doctor

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.340
here in New York City.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.560
And he asked me a
bunch of questions.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.050
And one of the questions
was, do you do drugs?

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.300
And I said, yeah, I do.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.500
And he said nothing,
except for he gave me

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.830
a look that communicated
the following sentiment--

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.744
OK, asshole, mystery solved.

00:09:20.744 --> 00:09:22.076
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.076 --> 00:09:24.620
And so the back story is that
I had spent a lot of time

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.840
as a really ambitious
young reporter.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.620
So I got to ABC
in the year 2000.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.660
Then 9/11 happened
the next year.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.310
And I was in Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Israel,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.050
the West Bank, Gaza,
Iraq, a lot in Iraq.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:47.090
And I came home after
a big spell in Iraq,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.710
and I got depressed.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.580
And I didn't know
I was depressed.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.790
And I did something
very dumb, which

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.980
is I started self-medicating
with a lot of cocaine.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.760
And it turns out that's a good
way to have a panic attack.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.660
And so when that doctor
said what he said,

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.360
or gave me the look
that said what it said,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.530
I quit doing drugs and
agreed to go see him

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.850
once or twice a week.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.410
And that kind of-- it's not like
I found meditation that day.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.250
I didn't, actually.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.390
And so it's not like
then everything was all

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.520
unicorns barfing rainbows
immediately or ever.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.660
Then it took me a couple years
to stumble onto meditation.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.780
And at first, I was
really skeptical.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.790
I mean, I just thought
it was complete bullshit.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:44.390
And I associated it with
hacky sack, and dreamcatchers,

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.560
and yoga, and stuff like that.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.040
I had had a bad
experience in yoga

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.240
as a little-- my
parents were hippies.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.950
And they made me
go to yoga class.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.210
And the teacher made me
do it in my underwear.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.860
So I was pretty anti-yoga.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.520
So I had all those
associations in my head.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.880
But then I saw the science
that suggests that meditation

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.990
is really good for you.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.780
I don't want to--

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.030
the science sometimes is, I
think, inappropriately hyped.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.720
But I think what we can
say is that it strongly

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.750
suggests that meditation, short
daily doses of meditation,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.220
can confer a lot
of health benefits,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.950
including basically
rewiring your brain.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.880
It changes key areas
of the brain that

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.100
have to do with attention
regulation, stress,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.080
self-awareness, compassion.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.810
And that sounds cooler
than it is on some levels

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.030
because everything you
do rewires your brain.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.440
The brain is the
organ of experience.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.530
So every experience you have is
creating new neural pathways.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.210
But this is just
an organized way

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.550
to train the brain and the mind.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.890
And to me, that's the
revolutionary insight, which

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.710
is that the mind is trainable.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.380
We think that we are
the way that we are.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.824
These are factory settings
that can't be rejiggered,

00:11:58.824 --> 00:12:00.740
that we are as compassionate
as we'll ever be,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.010
we're as calm, generous,
focused, whatever.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.840
But all of these
mental attributes,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.420
which are what we want
the most-- we may think we

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.780
want whatever-- my
case, success, all

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.720
the hedonistic pleasures
that are on offer.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.080
But all that stuff is
refracted through one filter,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.790
which is your mind.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.700
And that filter is trainable.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.660
And that is really what got
me interested in meditation.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.290
And in the process of getting
to that kind of secular,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:36.200
scientific view of meditation,
as Jesse indicated,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.010
I did use my job at ABC News to
meet a lot of these self-help

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.100
gurus, which turned out to be--

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.570
I don't want to say useless
digression because it

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.611
was useful in that it
provided me a lot of people

00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:52.040
to make fun of in my book.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.459
But I didn't learn that many--

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:58.250
I learned some things
that are very useful.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.765
But I also met a lot
of people who tell you

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:02.390
that you can solve
all of your problems

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.265
through the power of
positive thinking, which

00:13:04.265 --> 00:13:06.975
is utter nonsense and I think
actually a really destructive

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:07.850
thing to tell people.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.985
Eckhart Tolle I think actually
is interesting in some ways.

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:15.860
I don't know if-- do
you guys know who he is?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.360
Yeah.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.370
So Eckhart Tolle is a
really big self-help guru.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.589
And he changed my
life, I have to say.

00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:25.130
I don't know if he
did it on purpose.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.740
But I was reading
one of his books.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.180
And it was the
first time anybody

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.520
had ever pointed out to me that
we have a voice in our heads,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.589
that we have this inner narrator
that chases you out of bed,

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:37.130
and is yammering at
you all day long,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.255
and has you constantly
wanting stuff or not wanting

00:13:39.255 --> 00:13:42.410
stuff, judging people,
comparing yourself to people.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.700
My friend Sam Harris--

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.705
we're not related, but
we're good friends.

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:49.080
He says that what he thinks
about the voice in his head--

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.120
he feels like he's been hijacked
by the most boring person alive

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.060
who just says the same
shit over and over--

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.910
most of it negative, all
of it self-referential.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.550
And Tolle was really
the first person

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.820
I had ever heard who was
pointing out that when

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.880
you're unaware of this
nonstop conversation

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.360
that you're having with
yourself, it owns you.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.340
And all the dumbest
shit we do is

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.080
because we're
being yanked around

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.660
by this malevolent
puppeteer, our ego.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.570
And that's why you eat
when you're not hungry,

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:24.650
or you check your email in
the middle of a conversation.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.564
And for me, reading
Eckhart Tolle really--

00:14:28.564 --> 00:14:30.230
well, first off, it
became obvious to me

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.470
that my panic attack was
the result of the ego,

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.530
that I had gone off to
war zones without thinking

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.590
about the consequences,
came home, got depressed,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.620
was insufficiently self-aware
to know that I was depressed,

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.369
then did this very dumb
thing of self-medicating.

00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:49.410
And so reading Eckhart
Tolle was really powerful.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.009
But my beef with him-- and I
did go meet him afterwards.

00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:54.050
And my beef with him is
that, as a friend of mine

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.050
has described him, he is
correct, but not useful.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.600
So he diagnoses the problem
beautifully, brilliantly,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.732
although, by the way,
for thousands of years,

00:15:04.732 --> 00:15:06.440
people have been
diagnosing this problem.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.750
He just happened to be the
first dude I ever heard say it.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.040
But there was a guy
named the Buddha

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.415
you might have heard of who
also talked about this stuff.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.910
But Tolle, he does diagnose
this and write about it really

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.570
in, I think, an incisive way.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.000
But I don't feel
like he gives you

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.700
an actionable, practical
advice to deal with it.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.344
And so I give him
a lot of credit

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.510
for really changing my life.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.589
But I also then had to go
find something specific to do

00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:34.880
about it, which was meditation.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.920
That was a really long answer
to your simple question.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.310
Sorry.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.430
SPEAKER: No.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.346
It was a great answer.

00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:39.657
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:15:39.657 --> 00:15:40.240
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.640
It's funny.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.098
With Eckhart Tolle, I think
the beginning of "Power of Now"

00:15:43.098 --> 00:15:45.089
actually, it's like
he's in a dark room.

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:46.005
Everything's negative.

00:15:46.005 --> 00:15:49.055
And then he wakes up the next
morning, and everything's fine.

00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:50.930
DAN HARRIS: And then he
lives on a park bench

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.652
for two years in a state of
bliss in the city of London,

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:54.610
where they have winter.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.370
SPEAKER: That's right.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.869
Right.

00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:58.820
So can you replicate that?

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.870
I don't really-- maybe.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.380
DAN HARRIS: Good luck.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.880
SPEAKER: I really
like something you

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.674
say in your new
book, "Meditation

00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:09.590
for Fidgety Skeptics."

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.048
Again, this is kind
of the followup

00:16:11.048 --> 00:16:14.080
to help you actually
meditate once you're more

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.520
bought in at least.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.560
You say that human
beings are not--

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.685
the original word, it's
not just Homo sapiens.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:22.370
It's not just thinking beings.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.170
It's Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.750
It's this self-referential
awareness that we can think.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.100
And that cuts to the core
of maybe your definition

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.870
of mindfulness.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.621
So can we just
establish that context?

00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:36.245
What is your definition
of mindfulness?

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:37.940
DAN HARRIS: Mindfulness is this.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.450
It's an interesting thing
because simultaneously a really

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.030
boring sounding word, a
very anodyne sounding word,

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.650
but also the recipient of an
incalculable amount of hype.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.680
So everything's mindful--
yarn bombing, mindful this,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.370
mindful that.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.642
And I often think
that people, when

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:58.100
they talk about
mindfulness, really

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.970
have no idea what
they're talking about.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.540
So I think the simple
definition is--

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.714
but we should say mindfulness
is actually an ancient term.

00:17:06.714 --> 00:17:08.089
The Buddha talked
about it a lot.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:12.800
It was really one of
his big talking points.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.155
And it has a lot of meanings.

00:17:15.155 --> 00:17:18.050
But I think a really easy
way to think about it

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.940
as a beginner is
it's just the ability

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.400
to know what's happening in
your mind at any given moment

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.869
without getting
carried away by it.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.780
It's the skill of being
able to see what's

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.440
happening between your ears
without necessarily taking

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.930
the bait and acting on it.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.479
And this is really, in my view,
the big benefit of meditation.

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:38.770
There are lots of benefits,
and we can talk about them.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.620
But in my experience,
the big benefit

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.630
is to be able to have
some-- a term that's

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.180
been used to describe this
is emotional intelligence.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.900
So we are just bombarded
with external stimuli,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.330
internal stimuli, internal
stimuli in response

00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:01.660
to external stimuli, these very
powerful emotions like anger,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.700
boredom, sadness.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.040
And often, we're just
owned by these things.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.640
We're just basically
bobbing around in a sea

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.640
of our own emotions
without any real awareness

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.020
of what's happening.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.900
And meditation just builds
you an inner microscope,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.960
an inner telescope, to see--

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.221
is that super contradictory,
telescope and microscope?

00:18:22.221 --> 00:18:22.720
Whatever.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.680
It's a way to see
what's happening.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.300
Thank you.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.184
It's a way to see what's
happening inside so that it

00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:28.850
doesn't own you.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.500
And it's not complicated.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.270
Basically, you sit,
watch your breath.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.166
Usually, we start
with the breath.

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:36.950
You sit.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.405
You feel your breath
coming in, going out.

00:18:39.405 --> 00:18:40.780
And then you're
just going to get

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.210
hit by all these distractions.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.220
And you notice, oh,
I've become distracted.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.190
And in that moment, when most
of us think we're failures,

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.540
that is the win.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.500
Because when you see how
fucking crazy you are,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.770
the craziness doesn't
own you as much.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.690
And that is the game.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:04.990
The game is to sit and watch
the zoo and to see it is a zoo.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.470
And that seeing
clearly of the zoo

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.780
makes you less of an animal.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.865
And that is what we're
doing in meditation.

00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:15.430
And that is mindfulness.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.182
SPEAKER: So you touched
on this a little.

00:19:17.182 --> 00:19:19.390
DAN HARRIS: You're going to
have to edit the hell out

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.932
of this video.

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:24.140
The YouTube censors are not
going to be cool with it.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.760
Sorry.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.530
When I'm not on television,
I break FCC violations.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.006
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:32.960
SPEAKER: You're so
used to upholding them.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.100
So there are a bunch
of misconceptions

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.840
about meditation--

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.860
this idea that you have to
be this Buddha-like character

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.660
under a waterfall, that you
have to do it in a fixed time,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.210
that you have to do
it right, and there's

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.670
some kind of perfect state
that you have to attain,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.880
or that you have to crowd
out your thoughts versus what

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.010
you just said, which is
disidentify with your thoughts.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.961
So can you touch on a
lot of the big ones?

00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:01.460
Yeah.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.560
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.560
So I think the
two biggest ones--

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.319
we've already touched on a
little bit the first one.

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:13.360
But I think it's actually
worth discussing again,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.190
which is that people say to
me all the time, OK, Dan, I

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.970
get it.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.642
I see the science.

00:20:20.642 --> 00:20:22.100
Meditation, I should
be meditating.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.141
But you don't understand.

00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:26.260
I can't do it because
my mind is too busy.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.832
And I call this the
fallacy of uniqueness.

00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:33.040
The good news and the bad
news is you're not special.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.840
Everybody's mind is like this.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.024
We evolved, as I
think Bill Duane,

00:20:37.024 --> 00:20:38.440
one of your former
colleagues-- he

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.220
was, until recently, the
superintendent of well-being

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.260
here at Google and a great guy.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.160
He has said that we descended
from nervous monkeys.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.850
We evolved on the savanna
for threat detection

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.052
and for finding sources
of pleasure, food

00:20:58.052 --> 00:20:58.885
and sexual partners.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.810
Evolution bequeathed
us a racing mind,

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.260
which made a lot of sense.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.380
It still, in some cases,
makes a lot of sense.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.260
But this is the way
all of our minds work.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.030
And that doesn't mean
you can't meditate.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.750
Because it is a massive and
pernicious misconception

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.820
that meditation involves
clearing your mind.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.200
I often joke that if you
sit, and you clear your mind,

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.040
you're either enlightened,
or you're dead, more likely,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.900
the latter.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.400
The point is not
to clear your mind.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.060
The point is to focus your
mind for a few nanoseconds

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.930
at a time.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.350
And then when you
get distracted,

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.850
which you will, just start again
and again and again and again.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.395
And it is that seeing
of the distraction,

00:21:43.395 --> 00:21:44.770
knowing you've
become distracted,

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.170
and starting again
that is the win.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.810
I often refer to it as the
bicep curl for your brain.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.810
This is what you see on the
brain scans of meditators.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.880
This is the mechanism
for changing

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.240
the brain, for rewiring
key regions of the brain.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.041
So what are you focusing on?

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.040
As I said before, you're
focusing on the breath.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.910
There are basically three
steps for beginning meditation.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:11.010
The first is you sit in
a reasonably quiet place.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.607
If it's not as pristine as you
would like, put in headphones.

00:22:14.607 --> 00:22:16.440
I sometimes, if I'm in
a really noisy place,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.815
will put in headphones and
then play a little white noise

00:22:18.815 --> 00:22:19.410
through it.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.244
So you sit in a reasonably
quiet place, close your eyes.

00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:24.660
If you don't want to close
your eyes, you can kind of just

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.194
gaze at the floor
in a neutral way.

00:22:28.194 --> 00:22:30.360
The second step is just to
bring your full attention

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.850
to the feeling of your breath
coming in and going out.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.000
By the way, there
are other objects

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.414
of meditation, other things
you can meditate on aside

00:22:38.414 --> 00:22:39.080
from the breath.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.759
But the breath is a
great place to start

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.925
because it's super portable.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.885
So you're just feeling the raw
data of the physical sensations

00:22:48.885 --> 00:22:50.510
of your breath coming
in and going out,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.780
like your belly rising and
falling or the cool air passing

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.130
your nostrils.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.340
And then the third
step is you will just

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.830
be ambushed by all of
these random thoughts.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.060
Where do gerbils run wild?

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.450
Blah, blah, blah.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.830
And then the whole game
is just to notice, oh,

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.480
I'm distracted right now.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.930
Back to the breath
over and over and over.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.590
And that is really the game.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.630
And I think when it's
explained that way,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.770
I can see the light going on for
people that this thing they've

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.540
told themselves is
impossible is actually

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.790
super possible for
anybody, no matter

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.710
how distractable you are.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.180
I'm not some paragon of focus.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.850
I went to work in TV
specifically because I didn't

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.670
have what it took to
be a coder or a lawyer

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.170
or something like that.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.800
And so if it can
work for me, I think

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.430
it could work for anybody.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.550
The other big misconception--

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.160
and this is, I think, probably
a bigger problem for people

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.600
who are already bought in.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.980
They know they want to meditate.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.160
The big issue that people have
is finding the time to do it.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.590
So I like to say on this
one, I have good news,

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.880
and I have even better news.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.770
The good news is I think five
to 10 minutes is a great habit.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.229
If you were doing that
every day, I think--

00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:14.270
everybody wants to know,
what's the least you can

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.240
do and still get the benefits?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.230
And so I've asked a lot of
these neuroscientists, what

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.640
is the least you can do?

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.690
Because I hear this from
people all the time.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.900
And so I said, is five to
10 minutes a day enough?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.110
And we don't know for sure.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.690
But the consensus that
I'm hearing from folks

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.340
is five to 10 minutes
is probably enough.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.840
And just see for yourself.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.270
I've had this standing challenge
for the last four years

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.070
since my first book
came out, which

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.720
is I say publicly
all the time try

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.000
meditating five to 10 minutes
a day every day for a month.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And if you think it's
complete bullshit, send me

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.510
a note on Twitter and
tell me I'm a moron.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.560
And people hit me on
Twitter all the time

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.380
to tell me I'm a moron,
but never for that,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.850
never, not once.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.306
So I really do think this is--

00:25:05.306 --> 00:25:06.680
the only way you're
going to know

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.138
whether you're
getting the benefits

00:25:08.138 --> 00:25:09.650
is how it shows up
in your own life.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:15.110
The science is really useful
for me as an evangelizing tool.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.092
But you may start
meditating because you

00:25:17.092 --> 00:25:18.050
hear about the science.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.880
But you don't keep
meditating because you

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.490
think your prefrontal
cortices are changing.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.660
You keep meditating
because, as I said before,

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.900
you're less of an asshole
to yourself or others.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.660
And that's really just the way
to see whether it's working.

00:25:32.436 --> 00:25:35.060
So the good news is I think five
to 10 minutes a day is enough.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.250
I think the better
news is that I really

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.170
do believe that if
that's too much for you,

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.720
one minute most days is enough.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.800
We have-- at the
10% Happier company,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.250
we talk about this
one minute daily-ish.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.830
And I think that is a
great way for people

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.230
who just don't feel--

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.890
I get it.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:55.640
I'm busy too.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.619
So I get the feeling of one
more thing on my to-do list

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:01.160
is just going to make me more
stressed out than I already am.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.280
And that defeats the whole
purpose of this thing.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.880
So one minute most days is, I
think, a really good way to get

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.260
started.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.930
SPEAKER: In "Meditation
for Fidgety Skeptics,"

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.800
you start actually
at home with "GMA,"

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.310
getting the whole
cast to meditate

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.900
and listening to
their objections.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.320
And then you kind of go
west across the country.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.050
You just mentioned some
conventional objections.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.170
Were there any weird or
very surprising objections

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.880
you got to people
wanting to meditate

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.870
or for you telling them
they should meditate?

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.790
DAN HARRIS: The objection
that we got that I just

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.190
couldn't relate to
because I'm so selfish

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.060
is the idea that meditation
is self-indulgent.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.150
So my wife has this objection.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.290
She's a physician.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.020
She's a mom.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.730
And she is really naturally
very compassionate

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.900
and sort of other-oriented.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.340
But it turns out to
be a very common thing

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.500
that I heard a lot when
we went out on the road.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.542
We took this big, orange
bus across the country

00:27:10.542 --> 00:27:12.000
to meet people who
want to meditate

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.708
but aren't doing it
to try to figure out,

00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:15.240
what are the main obstacles?

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.980
And how can we tackle them?

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.436
That was kind of the narrative
conceit of the second book.

00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:21.810
And one of the
obstacles we found

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.090
was this idea that
meditation is self-indulgent.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.090
And there's a really
easy knock down on this,

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.940
which is, if you want
to help other people,

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.390
it's really hard to do
that if you're a mess.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:38.070
And it's the cliche from the
airline safety instructions.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.210
Put your own oxygen
mask on first.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.690
If you truly want
to be of service,

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.730
the way to do it
from a maximally

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.150
resilient, calm,
useful standpoint

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.354
is to have your shit together.

00:27:54.354 --> 00:27:55.770
SPEAKER: Given
what you just said,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.900
and given that there's
an emphasis of training

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.120
from the neck down just in
terms of the formal physical

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.350
education growing up, why is
this not instituted on a much

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.330
younger level for kids?

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.510
I know maybe-- did David
Lynch do some stuff?

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.310
DAN HARRIS: He has
done some stuff, yes.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.260
SPEAKER: But it doesn't seem
still accepted on that level.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.780
It should be this foundational
thing that everybody learns.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.820
But yeah.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.720
DAN HARRIS: I think
we're heading there.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.440
I do.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.540
That's my optimistic view.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.970
But we're starting to see it.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:31.530
Now, it's in some
schools and pretends

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.104
to be in more progressive
schools or some school district

00:28:34.104 --> 00:28:36.270
where they're lucky because
there's just an activist

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.190
locally who's an
activist parent who's

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.070
pushing it into the schools.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.332
But I actually think
we're going to--

00:28:44.332 --> 00:28:45.790
again, this is me
being optimistic.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.990
But I think we're headed toward
a world where mental skills are

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.520
taught in schools
across the country

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.130
and in basic training
for the military.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.390
And that's already
starting to happen.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.059
Because the military is
embracing this stuff.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:04.350
And in locker rooms, again,
that is starting to happen.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.510
The Chicago Cubs
called me not long ago

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.850
to come maybe talk
to their folks.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.000
They're into it.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.870
The fact that Google has several
courses on offer that teach it.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.340
I think we're at the beginning
of a public health revolution.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.650
And these things
often take time.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.550
And what started it,
what catalyzed it,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.800
is really the science.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.960
Because it's the lingua
franca in our culture.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.970
And people like me see the
science, the blobs on the brain

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.010
scans, and think, all
right, yeah, I'm in.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.070
And I think that happens in
C-suites at companies like this

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.020
and superintendents' offices
for schools around the country.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.680
And so I think we're
heading toward it.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.805
It may take a little while.

00:29:44.805 --> 00:29:47.160
And especially in schools,
you do occasionally

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.350
have parents who don't
like it because they

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.330
think it's religious,
especially evangelical parents.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.040
And I get that.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.710
Because they are correct.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:30:00.144
These practices are derived from
Eastern spiritual practices.

00:30:00.144 --> 00:30:02.310
But the kind of stuff that's
being taught in schools

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.020
is secularized.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.810
Algebra was developed
by the Muslims,

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:08.550
and we're not
worried about that.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:14.700
And so I think these are
innate mental skills that

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.980
are our birthright.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.500
And it happens to be that
the Buddhists and the Hindus

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.450
before them described
these skills really well.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.200
But that doesn't mean
they're Buddhist.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.550
SPEAKER: Right.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.750
And what is the science?

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.320
Because you mentioned at the
top that some of it is a little

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:31.920
overhyped.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.930
Anything you do is going
to affect your brain.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.260
The one thing that I always hear
is it affects, or decreases,

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.485
the gray matter in your
brain associated with stress

00:30:39.485 --> 00:30:40.890
and anxiety.

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:43.740
What else is out there?

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.240
DAN HARRIS: It's
been shown to lower

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.230
the release of stress hormones.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.290
It's shown to lower
blood pressure,

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:52.570
boost your immune system.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.720
It's been shown to help--

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.230
I think where the
research is really

00:30:55.230 --> 00:31:00.340
the strongest is anxiety and
depression, both of which

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.590
I've dealt with my whole life.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.760
And then the brain,
the neuroscience really

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.789
shows that it can
grow the gray matter

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:12.080
in the area of the brain
associated with self-awareness

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.250
and with compassion.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.620
And it decreases the gray
matter in the area associated

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.440
with stress.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.849
It's also been shown to
kind of fluff up the area

00:31:20.849 --> 00:31:22.640
associated with attention
regulation, which

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.389
is a huge problem.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.690
I love joking that the people
who are developing the products

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:31.720
and services--

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.820
I don't want to name any names,
but Google comes to mind--

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.690
that are destroying
our abilities to focus

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.820
are now embracing these
ancient technologies

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.599
that are proving that there's
a reason why folks at Google

00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:44.640
are embracing this stuff.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.095
Because it's been shown to
help with attention regulation.

00:31:47.095 --> 00:31:51.640
And we are in an age where
our attention's under siege.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.920
That is not to
unfairly malign Google.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.490
There are many
people in this space.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:02.640
So I think there
are a lot of things

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.190
from the scientific standpoint
that make this practice really

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.920
attractive.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.700
But again, I would
advise that it's not

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.900
super useful to get really
hung up on everything

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.630
the science says.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.345
Because once you
try it for yourself,

00:32:14.345 --> 00:32:16.470
you're not really going to
have that many questions

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.980
about the science.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.360
Because it's just
about you start

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.693
to see the benefits on your own.

00:32:19.693 --> 00:32:22.560
And what we know about
habit formation is the best

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.939
way to create a habit, which
is a very hard thing to do,

00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:27.480
creating a habit--
the best way to do

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.150
it is to be pulled
forward by the benefits,

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.600
to make it either a pleasurable
experience-- or like for me,

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.090
exercise is not pleasurable.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.480
But I like not being overweight.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.520
And I like that it
makes me less depressed.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.440
And so that really
helps me stay on it.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.290
And I think with meditation,
you start to see the benefits.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:53.010
You're less yanked
around by your emotions.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.180
You're more focused.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.430
And that really provides
a powerful incentive

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.010
to keep doing it.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.840
SPEAKER: I know an
objection you had early on

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.500
was the fear of
losing your edge.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.774
A lot of people think
maybe to be creative,

00:33:06.774 --> 00:33:08.190
you need a certain
amount of pain.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:13.620
There's the tortured
artist archetype.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.700
What do you say to that?

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.650
DAN HARRIS: Who says if van
Gogh wasn't so messed up

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.860
that he didn't chop off his
ear that maybe his art wouldn't

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.360
have been better?

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.120
I mean, I don't know that
this has been proven.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.660
And by the way, meditation--

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.655
I wish that it did,
but meditation doesn't

00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:37.780
solve all of your problems.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.930
It's not going to take
all of the Sturm und Drang

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:44.290
in your life and
just evaporate it

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.810
all into an impenetrable
bubble of bliss.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.430
It doesn't work that way.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.890
As one great meditation
teacher has said,

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.980
it makes you more of a
connoisseur of your neuroses.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.470
But it doesn't
vanquish the neuroses.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.030
So you're more self-aware.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:02.710
You see, oh, yeah, these are the
various neurotic programs that

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.110
are kind of running my life.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.810
When I'm in one mode,
I'm really greedy.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.960
Or when I'm in another
mode, I'm really fearful.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.230
Or in another mode, I'm
really self-critical.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.270
And it just allows
you to see, oh,

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.540
this is the trance I'm
operating in right now,

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.960
and to pop out of it--
maybe for a few seconds,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.370
or maybe really to pop out of
it just you don't immediately

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.210
fall back into it.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.170
So I really don't think
it's the type of thing that

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:40.580
is going to defang your
ability to be creative.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.330
Nor do I think it's going to--

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.790
as I said before, I'm
still really ambitious.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.580
And I do a lot of meditation.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.949
And so I've not found that it's
reduced my ambition at all.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.909
I do think maybe on the
edges it can clarify

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.620
what is truly important to you.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.240
And we're all kind
of rats in a maze.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.200
We're going wherever
the food pellets are.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.070
In these mazes that
they set up for rats,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.780
they're just chasing
the little pellets.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:14.200
And we're looking for various
varieties of dopamine hit.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.650
And so I've seen
over time the things

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.190
that I thought made me happy
don't make me as happy,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.010
but there are other
things that really do.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.270
And so I think it might change
the nature of your ambition.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:31.990
But if it truly makes you
happy to vanquish your enemies

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:37.060
and be endlessly,
mindlessly acquisitive,

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.400
I think that you will
retain those capacities.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.000
But I also think you might
find that you are not

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.740
as blindly driven
as you used to be.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.280
But your ambition gets channeled
in more wholesome directions.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.290
But that doesn't mean
you're moving into a yurt

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:57.660
or anything like that.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.170
SPEAKER: Right.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.780
And so you do "GMA."

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.590
You do "Nightline."

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.750
You have the podcast.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.470
You have the app, which
you guys should check out.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.200
It's basically a bunch of
awesome meditation experts,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.110
like Joseph Goldstein
you mentioned earlier,

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:19.150
giving you their own tips and
tricks and take on meditation.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.470
What's your goal with all this?

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:25.180
Just moving forward,
you have a lot going on.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.040
Yeah.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.160
DAN HARRIS: My grand--

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.990
I've been told by our
venture capitalists

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:30.220
that I shouldn't say
what I'm about to say.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.900
But I'm just going
to say it anyway

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.900
because I can't think of
a better way to say it.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.320
But my grand ambition--

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.080
and I say this in the spirit
of that old expression.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.360
They say a man's reach--
or let's just say

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.830
a person's reach--

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.290
should exceed his or her grasp.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.030
So I say this as aspirational.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.869
But I would love if 10% Happier
became kind of like the Nike

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:50.410
for the mind.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.390
Now that we know that the
mind is trainable, which

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:00.130
is a really radical and
empowering thing to know,

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:05.410
I would love if we become the
company that helps you do it

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.860
in all areas of your life.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:15.190
So right now, we have an
app that's doing quite well.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.770
And I want that to grow.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.340
But I could see us moving
into in-person trainings,

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.100
corporate trainings,
secular meditation

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:32.650
retreats, lifestyle-brand-type
stuff like shirts.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.850
I want to make--

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.220
don't steal this.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.270
I want to make little,
really nice sweatshirts.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.790
And at that point
where the sleeve meets

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.030
the watch, it should say in
just very subtle embroidery,

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.645
don't be an asshole so
every time you look,

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:50.040
it's just a great reminder.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.690
That's my little mantra.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.220
And so things like that,
kind of funny, 10% Happier

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:57.970
branded stuff.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.450
And then books, I want
to do lots more books.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.860
And actually my
podcast is a place

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.750
where people who
otherwise wouldn't

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.710
be able to get attention, these
great meditation teachers who

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.350
really reach their folks
in the Buddhist world

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.740
but don't reach a wider
audience, that I can help them

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.760
reach a wider audience.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.490
So yeah, that's where I
think I want it to go.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.250
But I also love
working in TV news.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.860
So I sometimes
describe my schedule

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.760
as drowning in chocolate.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.814
I love everything I do,
but I'm still drowning.

00:38:29.814 --> 00:38:31.480
SPEAKER: That's a
great problem to have.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.150
DAN HARRIS: Yeah,
high-class problem.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.610
SPEAKER: And then it seemed
like the meditation retreat

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:41.620
in "10% Happier" profoundly was
a big inflection point for you.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.495
At what point do
you consider that?

00:38:43.495 --> 00:38:44.870
If you don't have
any experience,

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.347
can you just do
a 10-day retreat?

00:38:46.347 --> 00:38:47.180
DAN HARRIS: Totally.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:47.770
SPEAKER: You can?

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:47.940
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.700
You can.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.320
I don't recommend
it, but you can.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:57.730
And the good retreats
are created in a way

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.390
that they're for all
levels of experience.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.330
When I tell people that I
went on-- for my first book,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.740
I went on a 10-day silent
meditation retreat.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.390
I feel that sometimes that is--

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:11.930
I know how the
skeptical mind works.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.297
And I suspect for some
of you, it's like, oh,

00:39:16.297 --> 00:39:17.380
that's what this involves?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.000
Well, I'm never doing it.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.920
I'm never going to
meditate because then you

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.030
have to go on a retreat.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:23.530
You don't have to
go on a retreat.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:29.620
I stand by my one minute
or five, 10 minute rule.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.270
I was writing a book
about meditation,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:32.853
and I needed some
shit to write about.

00:39:32.853 --> 00:39:35.650
So I went on a 10-day
silent meditation retreat.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.050
As it turns out, I
don't want to say

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.920
I liked it so much because
that would be the wrong way

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.650
to describe it.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.860
But I found it
meaningful, useful,

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.100
powerful enough that I now
have done many of them.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.780
And I plan to
continue to do them.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.730
It's just like you're really
taking yourself out of--

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.690
[BACKGROUND VOICE]

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:01.580
Is that me?

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.710
It sounds like my voice.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.340
Sorry.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.670
I'm distracted now.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.530
10-day-- a meditation
retreat, by the way,

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.750
they have shorter ones--
one day, two day, three day.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:18.490
I actually do kind of recommend
going for seven days or longer.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:22.030
Because it sucks so
badly at the beginning,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:26.750
and it takes several days
for that to kind of wear off,

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:30.037
that the inner rebellion,
in my experience--

00:40:30.037 --> 00:40:31.120
Because I hate it so much.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.000
Even now when I go, I
mean, I hate it so much.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.440
I hate everybody there.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.460
I hate the teachers.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.780
I can't believe I'm here.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.540
It takes a while for that
kind of inner chatter

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.450
to start to calm down.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.200
And that's when the
good stuff's on offer.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.140
So yeah, I really do recommend
it, but it's not a must.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.862
SPEAKER: OK.

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:55.570
It's interesting.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.160
What you just said
about a retreat is

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.650
almost like meditating
is a microcosm of that.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.339
Almost the harder the beginning
is, the more refreshing

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:07.380
it ends up kind of being.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.220
DAN HARRIS: That's right.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.567
But here's the double bind.

00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:12.400
Here's the catch-22.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.691
SPEAKER: You can't go for that.

00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:15.860
DAN HARRIS: You can't go
for anything in meditation.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.290
The most valuable thing--

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.424
there's this friend
of mine who's

00:41:19.424 --> 00:41:21.340
written many beautiful
books about meditation.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.780
His name is Dr. Mark Epstein.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.550
He's a shrink here in New York.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.470
And he was looking
back at his diaries

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.090
from various retreats
he's been on.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.630
And every time, the bottom
line, the lesson he takes

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.540
away, he's found it-- for
every retreat he's gone on,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.910
he realizes he learns
the same thing, which

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:41.290
is you can't try to feel--
the point of meditation

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.110
is not to feel a certain way.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.160
It is to feel whatever you're
feeling clearly, mindfully

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.990
so that your feelings
don't own you.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.100
And so if you sit
and try to feel calm,

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.490
it's pretty much a guarantee
that you won't feel calm.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.800
This is the paradox
of meditation,

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.600
of mindfulness meditation.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.630
The goal is not to vector
toward a certain state.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.719
The point-- as the
great meditation teacher

00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:12.760
Sharon Salzberg has said,
the point of meditation

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.218
is not to become
a great meditator.

00:42:14.218 --> 00:42:16.780
The point of meditation is
to become a better human,

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:18.200
to be better at your life.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.040
And so the same is true
on retreat that you--

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.100
I've done this a lot,
where I'm berating myself

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.760
for not being calm or not
being as focused or whatever.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.401
And it's when that ends that
interesting things can happen

00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:31.900
or not.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.010
But we do so much--

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.460
the mind is so
interfering that it

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:44.350
creates a buffer between
you, whatever that is,

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.194
and your direct experience.

00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:48.610
Just think about
it with something

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.470
small like eating, how
as we eat, as we chew,

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.710
we're hunting around
for the next bite.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.300
We're never really experiencing
what's happening right now.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:05.380
And on a retreat,
that leaning forward

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.440
can diminish to a
significant extent.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.090
And it can be accompanied
by a big blast of serotonin.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.890
SPEAKER: I want to let the
audience ask some questions.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:21.340
Final question from me,
you mentioned Mark Epstein,

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.840
Sharon Salzberg.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.480
What other sort of
intellectual influences

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.980
do you have that
you might recommend

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.390
other people kind of check out?

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:30.670
A lot of them I'm sure
you've come into contact

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.753
with through your podcast.

00:43:31.753 --> 00:43:32.780
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.380
So I would say the folks
who I wrote about a lot

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:39.580
in "10% Happier," often they
come out of this school called

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.780
the JuBus.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:46.290
They're Jewish Buddhists.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.340
So they have these kind of
chewy Jewish last names,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.110
like Salzberg, Sharon Salzberg,
Mark Epstein, Joseph Goldstein,

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.120
Jack Kornfield.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:03.540
And these folks are
all really New Yorkers

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.480
who went over to India
in the '60s and '70s

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.910
and learned how to meditate
and then brought it back

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.500
and started teaching it here.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.980
And without that
work, we wouldn't--

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:19.560
they really are the sine
qua non, the conditions--

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.400
they created the conditions
that allowed this current health

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.790
revolution, public health
revolution, to arise.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.875
They've all written
really interesting books.

00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:32.705
But I also recommend Sam Harris,
who was trained by these folks.

00:44:32.705 --> 00:44:34.330
And some of you may
know him because he

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.660
has a very popular podcast
called "Waking Up."

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.430
"Waking Up" is actually
the name of a book

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.721
he wrote called "Waking Up,"
which is about meditation,

00:44:40.721 --> 00:44:42.260
which I highly recommend.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.970
And Sam is just also a
really interesting dude--

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.310
controversial.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.760
And I get some
hate sometimes when

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.051
I talk about how we're friends.

00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:50.550
But we are friends.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.130
And who else?

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:54.630
Yeah.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.360
I'll leave it there.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.568
I don't want to overload you.

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:57.210
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.543
Does anybody have any questions?

00:44:58.543 --> 00:45:00.598
There's a mic right there.

00:45:00.598 --> 00:45:01.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.890
DAN HARRIS: My pleasure.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.330
AUDIENCE: My
question is, how has

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.710
the success of your podcast,
your apps, your books

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.220
impacted your personal
meditation practice?

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.380
Do you feel a lot of pressure to
be really good because of that?

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.190
DAN HARRIS: I know enough now to
know that that pressure is just

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.590
a thought.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.180
However, in the writing
of this most recent book,

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.550
I really did--

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.560
so we went--

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.820
I found this great meditation
teacher named Jeff Warren.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.560
I found him.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.300
That's a little
presumptive on my part.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.140
We met.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.780
And I really developed
a big man crush on him.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.916
And he's this awesome,
rad guy from Toronto.

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:53.790
And so I thought he
would be the right person

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:58.260
to put on a bus with me to
go across country in 11 days.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.410
Because he seemed like he kind
of had the stamina to do that.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.100
And being that
close every minute

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.990
of every day with a
meditation teacher,

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.634
he pointed out that
I'm a huge hypocrite.

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:11.550
He pointed out that I
go around telling people

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:16.260
that the goal of meditation is
not to be really good at it,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.340
as I've been saying.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.970
You've heard me say
it a million times.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.344
It's just to get distracted,
start again, get distracted,

00:46:21.344 --> 00:46:22.020
start again.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.260
But in my own practice, it
started to become clear to Jeff

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.070
that I was berating myself
for my lack of focus.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.570
And he really helped me come
up with some ways to not do it.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.280
And I'll tell you
what the mechanism

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.290
is that's been really
helpful to me, which

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:42.210
is when you see that
you've become distracted

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.680
to have this little mantra
of, welcome to the party.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.200
And like after-- there's
a lot of fake it until you

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.120
make it involved here.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.400
But I've found that
now I've been doing it

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.960
for a year and a half,
that often I'll see--

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.380
he had me kind of name
my various inner neurotic

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.490
programs.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.320
Anger is a big one for me.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.650
My grandfather
Robert Johnson, who

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.740
looks like the guy from
"American Gothic," he was just

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:16.950
really, really tightass,
mean, old goat who--

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.220
he once took me and my
brother into his living room,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.600
pointed out his new Betamax--

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.891
this was back in the day--
and said, if you touch this,

00:47:23.891 --> 00:47:26.760
I'll break your arm--
when we were eight.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.700
So that kind of guy, but he's
running through my veins.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.140
I have this tendency
toward anger.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.930
I can be really crotchety
and really mean to myself.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.990
And so he was like, when you see
Robert Johnson, be like, what's

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.900
up, Robert?

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.880
Welcome to the party.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.130
And over time, I
found that as goofy

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:44.220
as that is, it's really changed
my attitude toward myself

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.500
and when I see anger just come
up with my wife or my child

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.430
or whatever.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.386
So yeah.

00:47:51.386 --> 00:47:52.136
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:47:52.136 --> 00:47:53.136
DAN HARRIS: Thanks, man.

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.414
Appreciate it.

00:47:54.414 --> 00:47:55.330
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.400
Thank you for being here.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:56.640
DAN HARRIS: Hi.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.110
AUDIENCE: "10%
Happier" was amazing.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.900
DAN HARRIS: Thanks.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.310
AUDIENCE: I think you should
be less hard on yourself

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.540
about the panic attack because
it's not as bad as you describe

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.300
it being.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.840
You mentioned having a kid.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.820
I think anxiety's
something that people deal

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.410
with for all of their lives.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.200
And then they come to
meditation later in life.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.570
What advice do you
have for small children

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.000
and getting them in a
habit that helps them

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.130
deal with anxiety early on?

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:20.980
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:22.860
Yeah, my kid's three--

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:28.690
not super mindful, really
good at pooping his pants.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.190
What did he say to
me the other day?

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.235
We were talking.

00:48:31.235 --> 00:48:33.025
We were playing
basketball or something

00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:35.400
like that in the hallway with
the little Nerf basketball.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.320
And he dropped it.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:36.960
And he was like, pick it up.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.293
And I said, what do I look like?

00:48:38.293 --> 00:48:41.050
And he said, a poopy.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.140
That's the kind of
discussions we have.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.167
I have not--

00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:50.500
I actually want to write a
book about mindful parenting.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.900
But I haven't started teaching
him yet or doing much because I

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.642
don't really know
that much about how

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:57.600
to teach a preschooler.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.770
And there are-- it can be done.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.840
Preschoolers can be
taught meditation.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.532
There's different techniques
for kids at different ages.

00:49:08.532 --> 00:49:10.740
I'd be perfectly comfortable
teaching a high schooler

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.019
because it's the same
technique you teach a grownup.

00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:15.560
But I don't really
know all the stuff

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.630
that you teach a kid, which
makes me a horrible parent.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:19.990
But let me say this.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:25.130
I actually think-- here's
the story I'm telling myself,

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:28.550
which is when I think
back about my parents,

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:32.906
I do 0% of the things
they told me to do.

00:49:32.906 --> 00:49:34.280
They told me I
couldn't watch TV.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.580
Now I work in the box.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.860
But I do everything they did.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.320
I do everything
I saw them model.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.980
So I found meaningful work.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.300
I have a great
relationship with my wife.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.990
I spend a lot of
time with my child.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.140
I do all the things
that I saw them do.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.690
I exercise a lot because my
dad was running marathons,

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.420
and my mom was really into
exercise and all the things

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.970
that just they didn't
lecture me about.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.900
And so I feel like lecturing
your kid is a bad move.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.280
But modeling behavior for
a kid is a better one.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.000
And the bad news for
parents is if you

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.540
want to have a mindful kid, you
have to be a mindful parent.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.150
That is the sine qua
non of the whole thing.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.770
But there's a great
book out there,

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.780
after I've now steadfastly
refused to give you

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.760
any practical advice.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.000
There's a great book called
"Mindful Games" by Susan Kaiser

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.950
Greenland and Annaka
Harris, who happens

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.612
to be Sam Harris's
wife, that actually does

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:32.820
explain how to do this stuff.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.720
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.340
Thank you.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.149
DAN HARRIS: My pleasure.

00:50:36.149 --> 00:50:36.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.330
Echoing everyone else,
thank you for being here.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:41.260
So you said one of the--

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.050
sort of where the
science is strongest

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:45.510
is the impact that
meditation can

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.610
have on depression and anxiety.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:50.070
So where do you think
that sort of falls

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:52.675
in with things like
therapy or medication?

00:50:52.675 --> 00:50:54.550
How do all these things
relate to each other?

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.967
Have you tried
those other routes,

00:50:55.967 --> 00:50:57.550
if that's not too
personal a question?

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.680
And how do you think they
all relate to each other?

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.440
DAN HARRIS: You can't get
into my current line of work

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.280
without--

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.860
with anything
being too personal.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.880
So yes, tried all
those routes, still

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.370
believe in all of those routes.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.170
But when it comes to mental
well-being, I'm a maximalist.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.800
I think you should
do everything.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.230
You should try everything that
there's some science behind.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:25.800
Talk therapy, a lot of
reason to believe it

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.360
can be really useful.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.741
Medication, a lot of
reason to believe it

00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:30.615
can be really useful.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.390
What's the logic for
not doing either?

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.770
We are, as a society,
perhaps overmedicated.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:43.230
So I'm not saying you should
willy-nilly be popping pills.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:45.750
But if you have a careful,
thoughtful doctor,

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.900
I think it's
something to look at.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:54.060
I don't see meditation
as some silver bullet,

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:58.144
and I don't prejudice it
over other modalities.

00:51:58.144 --> 00:52:00.060
I think it can work
really well in conjunction

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.450
with medication, talk therapy.

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.300
For depression, most doctors
will tell you exercise

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.220
is incredibly important.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.346
Getting enough sleep, eating
right, having meaningful work,

00:52:11.346 --> 00:52:12.720
having positive
relationships, we

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.300
know the pantheon
of no-brainers.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.600
And my only argument
is that meditation

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.767
should be in the pantheon.

00:52:21.767 --> 00:52:22.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.399
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

00:52:24.399 --> 00:52:25.440
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.940
DAN HARRIS: Hi.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.640
AUDIENCE: So through personal
experience and some anecdotes

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.000
from friends, I found it
hard to kind of get over

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.660
that hump in terms of
locking down meditation

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.340
as a long-term habit.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:42.300
I know you mentioned
earlier in the talk

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.590
once you start
realizing successes

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.050
from a habit, that's
when it really

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:47.650
gets easy to be repeated.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.160
But even having seen
some success 20 days,

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.630
30 days, I always
sort of fall off.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.300
Do you have any specific
tips for turning it

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.020
into a long-term habit?

00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.790
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.150
I wrote a whole
chapter about this

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.920
because this is one of the big--

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.110
there are many people
in your situation.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.160
So there are a lot of
people who've never tried.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.930
They just can't get it started.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.000
And then there are some
people who try and just

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.380
fall off really quickly.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.914
And then there are people
like you who, they try.

00:53:18.914 --> 00:53:19.830
They see the benefits.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.480
And they still fall off.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.470
The thing to know--

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.350
well, there are a bunch
of things to know.

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:24.650
One is that we are not--

00:53:24.650 --> 00:53:26.640
I talked before about
evolution and how

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.265
it bequeathed us a racing mind.

00:53:28.265 --> 00:53:29.640
It also bequeathed
us a mind that

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.840
is shit at creating
healthy habits.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.710
We evolved, as I
discussed before,

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:41.160
to spot saber-toothed tigers
and find where the food was.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.310
Evolution didn't care about
your long-term health.

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:48.720
It just cared about getting your
DNA into the next generation.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.680
So we're not wired for brushing
our teeth and things like that.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.780
We are wired, as a
consequence of evolution,

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.450
for really kind of
short-term thinking.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:03.690
And so just knowing that lowers
the temperature a little bit.

00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.290
You know you're wired to fail.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:06.420
This is hard to do.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.620
You are going to fail
time and time again.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:13.560
And so the answer is to
approach the entire enterprise

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:19.130
with a spirit of exploration
and experimentation.

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.770
And so try different
times of day.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:22.940
Try different apps.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.980
Try different kinds
of meditation.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.540
Try different dosages.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.570
Like maybe really it'd be
better for you to do one minute.

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.350
Maybe five minutes is good.

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.790
Try drafting off
of existing habits.

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:39.270
Maybe you have an
abiding exercise habit.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.840
Well, right after
you stretch, if you

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.350
could put meditation
right on there,

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:49.810
it might be a good
way to get it going.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.560
So two parts here, one,
don't beat yourself up.

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.780
It's totally normal.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:56.240
Two, try a bunch of
stuff, like those things

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.345
that I just listed,
and see what happens.

00:54:58.345 --> 00:55:02.270
And I think over time, given
that you see the benefits,

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.990
and you have a history
of making it work,

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:07.280
it will click at some point.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:07.820
It will.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.076
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:55:09.076 --> 00:55:10.700
DAN HARRIS: And the
other thing to know

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.570
is that starting,
falling off the wagon,

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:18.110
and starting again, in that
process, nothing has been lost.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:22.250
It's not like you are
rebuilding from zero.

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.820
I don't think that's the case.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.974
It's just like when you
get lost in meditation.

00:55:27.974 --> 00:55:30.140
The whole game is just to
notice and to start again.

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.870
And I think that that analogy
holds true for the habit

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:33.640
formation process.

00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:36.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.610
Thanks for coming.

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:39.710
I'm a big fan.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:44.600
I really loved all the
potty talk, the potty mouth

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.070
because I am so
used to hearing you

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:49.777
talk like on a podcast, where
it's clean and everything.

00:55:49.777 --> 00:55:50.860
And thanks for coming too.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.130
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.850
Well, my podcast
is owned by Disney.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:56:01.500
AUDIENCE: So you're
at a company that you

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.250
said our attention
is under siege

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:08.200
by some companies like ours.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:12.180
And maybe you can help
us figure out how to--

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.040
because the next step, it seems
like artificial intelligence

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.380
is-- like, we're trying to
program robots to think.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.130
But really, what we
needed to be doing

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.200
is teaching robots
to be mindful.

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.810
So maybe you could
help us with that?

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.270
I don't want to be
part of the problem.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:27.630
DAN HARRIS: By the way, I
made that joke at Apple too.

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:29.397
So I'm not just
picking on you guys.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.260
God, AI is such a tricky thing.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.810
And I know next to
nothing about it.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:45.460
But I see-- there's
plenty of reasons

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:49.630
to be a technoskeptic
when it comes to AI

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.550
or when it comes
to just basically

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.700
the inundation of
data for all of us.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.840
But I just see this
countertrend of mindfulness

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.860
as being really
powerful and being real.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.400
And so I don't know
what I would advise

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:12.230
folks who are programming
AI in terms of how to--

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.687
I would love to come and sit
in on discussions about how

00:57:14.687 --> 00:57:15.770
to make that more mindful.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.570
I have nothing that's
surfacing right now.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:22.010
But I would say that everybody
doing the work and everybody

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:24.380
just full stop would
benefit from this practice.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.510
Because it is such
a nice corrective

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:33.380
to the tide of society
that's just yanking us along.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.510
AUDIENCE: I actually wanted
to ask you another question.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:40.000
So you talked a lot about--

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.534
I assume you've never
meditated on cocaine.

00:57:43.534 --> 00:57:45.200
But I don't know if
that's too personal.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.574
DAN HARRIS: No,
not too personal.

00:57:46.574 --> 00:57:47.510
Never done it.

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:50.190
I mean if my doctor would've
allowed me to, I would love it.

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.690
But--

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:52.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:52.046 --> 00:57:52.729
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:52.729 --> 00:57:55.020
I don't think-- I think that
would be a big zoo, right?

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.750
I mean not that I ever partake.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:58.600
But I'm wondering--

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.580
AUDIENCE: No judgment here, man.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:03.830
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering what your--

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.630
I mean, there's
pleasure-seeking.

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:08.720
There's alcohol, nicotine.

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:13.050
How has your relationship
changed with other medications,

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.430
whether it be self-medication--

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:18.440
I've heard you talk about
mushrooms on your podcast.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:23.870
And Sam Harris has certainly
talked about this stuff a lot.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.270
I mean to be mindful,
do you need to just wipe

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:27.590
your hands clean of this stuff?

00:58:27.590 --> 00:58:28.381
DAN HARRIS: No, no.

00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:31.979
AUDIENCE: Or what's your
take on altering your mind?

00:58:31.979 --> 00:58:33.770
DAN HARRIS: A lot of
things to say on that.

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:42.910
First of all, on the mushroom,
acid, ayahuasca, DMT [? tip, ?]

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.427
I'm really interested
in Michael--

00:58:44.427 --> 00:58:45.760
Jesse and I were talking before.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.040
Michael Pollan has a
new book out about this

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.773
called "How to
Change Your Mind."

00:58:49.773 --> 00:58:53.350
And I recently struck up a
little bit of a friendship

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.200
with Tim Ferriss, who's
really into this stuff.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.950
And Sam-- not anymore, but
Sam's done a lot of this

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.180
and written about it.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:05.050
But my shrink and my
wife make the case

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:07.180
in a very compelling
fashion that

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:10.870
for somebody who has panic
disorder, messing with my brain

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.260
chemistry while I still
have to go on television,

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.090
probably not the best move.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:18.640
So while I'm very
interested in this stuff,

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.560
I'm not going to do it,
at least not right now.

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:27.260
But as to just the
everyday quote unquote,

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.610
"vices," drinking alcohol,
smoking a little bit of weed,

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:32.770
or whatever it is,
I am not really

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:35.440
that judgmental about it.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:40.510
The Buddhist perspective is
not that you should never

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.320
have any pleasure in your life.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:47.260
It's are you so
swamped and addicted

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.270
to the pleasure that
it's actually really

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.610
not pleasurable anymore?

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:53.980
And that's the
line to play with.

00:59:53.980 --> 01:00:02.399
So I know plenty of really,
really well-trained meditation

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.690
teachers who will have a
glass of wine once in a while,

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.060
or like chocolate, or whatever.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.375
The point is not that you
should become an ascetic.

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.980
The point is that
you should just

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:15.664
be able to manage these
pleasures skillfully.

01:00:15.664 --> 01:00:17.080
And actually, you
can start to see

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:23.000
over time that desire,
pleasure, these

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.010
are all impermanent things.

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.617
And you can start to surf
that and get interested in it

01:00:28.617 --> 01:00:30.950
in a way that the meditation
practice can help you with.

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:34.460
And on the flip side,
displeasure and pain

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.800
are also impermanent.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.820
So the practice can be
woven into all sorts

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.440
of aspects of life.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.499
And I would argue that we're--

01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:46.790
I have a friend who's a
neuroscientist and a meditation

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:47.070
teacher.

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.650
And he was writing a
book that he ended up

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.608
calling something else.

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:52.130
But he was going to call
it "We're All Addicted."

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:53.300
Because we're all addicted.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.040
Addiction is part of our lives.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.410
We're just hurling
ourselves from one hit

01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.530
of pleasant experience, one
dopamine hit, to the next

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.180
all the time--

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.240
one latte, one slice of
cake, one party, whatever.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.890
We're always on the hunt.

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:10.070
And seeing that
is the first step

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.460
towards starting to kind of play
with it in a more skillful way.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.860
It doesn't mean that
you are never going

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.870
to have any pleasurable stuff.

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:20.882
I went to a movie with
my wife this morning--

01:01:20.882 --> 01:01:23.090
"Solo," which by the way--
and I'm a Disney employee,

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:24.339
so I was supposed to say this.

01:01:24.339 --> 01:01:27.980
But it actually is really
good, the new Han Solo movie.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:35.190
So I still love all sorts
of things that I love.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:40.540
But it's about hopefully
managing addiction.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:42.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.120
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for coming in.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.150
I'm new to the
meditation practice.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.910
And everything I've read,
including what you said here

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:56.060
today, the practical
application of meditating,

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.680
it's always recommended to do it
sitting instead of lying down.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.810
I think I also fall
victim to trying

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.200
to get the most out of something
with the least amount of work.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:12.560
And I want to incorporate
meditation in my day-to-day.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.060
And the easiest
thing I can think of

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.500
is doing it right when
I wake up, lying down.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.640
Do you not recommend that?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:20.760
DAN HARRIS: I think
it's totally fine.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.426
AUDIENCE: Is there
science behind having

01:02:22.426 --> 01:02:24.800
to do meditation while sitting?

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.120
DAN HARRIS: Totally fine.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.910
So the Buddha talked
about four ways

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.310
to meditate, four
postures for meditation--

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:35.060
sitting, standing,
walking, or lying down.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.620
So you're on the right side of
the angels, as per the Buddha--

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.910
not a bad place to be.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.480
So I think it's totally fine
to lie down and meditate.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.880
Your mind's your mind,
whatever posture you're in.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.690
So if you're training
it, you're training it.

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:53.330
Now, there are some
schools of meditation,

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.100
especially the Zen
school, that are really

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.720
strict about posture.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.760
And I think there's
something to that.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.090
But as a guy who doesn't
like to sit straight,

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:03.830
can't sit cross-legged,
I'm really

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:07.369
on the side of the argument
that's what I said before,

01:03:07.369 --> 01:03:09.410
that you're training your
mind, whatever position

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:10.130
your body's in.

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:14.684
And that's really where I
would put your attention.

01:03:14.684 --> 01:03:15.350
AUDIENCE: Great.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:15.849
Thank you.

01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:18.064
DAN HARRIS: My pleasure.

01:03:18.064 --> 01:03:18.946
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

01:03:18.946 --> 01:03:22.540
A few years ago, you and
Sam Harris were at the Rubin

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.360
and talked about
mindfulness meditation.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.860
And I think this
was around the time

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.532
you had written "10% Happier."

01:03:28.532 --> 01:03:29.240
DAN HARRIS: Yeah.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.160
AUDIENCE: And so Sam,
I think jokingly, said,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.910
I don't want to denigrate
your experience.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:37.450
But he talked about
there being a little more

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.220
to mindfulness and
the practice, things

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.190
like the ability to
discover fundamental things

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:43.990
about the mind,
self-transcendental

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.530
experiences.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.560
And you brought up how this
is common across religious and

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.400
nonreligious people.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.760
And you even see it in athletes
who get into a flow state.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.720
And then he brought up this
idea of the self and the ego

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.090
and how, through meditation,
you can kind of get rid

01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.020
of that illusion.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.440
So I was wondering
if you could--

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.481
what's your take on that?

01:04:01.481 --> 01:04:02.680
Have you moved away--

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.190
or I guess researched more,
discovered more than just

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:07.894
the utilitarian
aspects of meditation?

01:04:07.894 --> 01:04:09.310
DAN HARRIS: It's
a great question.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:11.643
Sam and I just did an event
together in LA the other day

01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:16.210
that's going to post on our
respective podcasts soon.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:17.830
It's really a
question of emphasis.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:30.970
So Sam is very erudite and is--

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.300
he's a public intellectual.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.800
That's the way he
thinks of himself.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:39.410
And so I am not nearly
as educated as Sam.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.750
And I'm a TV news anchor.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:44.601
So I'm really keeping
things more basic.

01:04:44.601 --> 01:04:46.100
And I'm really
trying to emphasize--

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.895
I speak to folks--

01:04:47.895 --> 01:04:48.770
today, I'm at Google.

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:51.770
But I'll be in Indiana or
New Orleans or wherever.

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:55.670
I'm really speaking to all kinds
of people about this-- cops,

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:58.370
social workers,
celebrities, whatever.

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:01.040
I want to be able to talk
to everybody in language

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.700
they can understand.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.484
And so I do.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:07.400
And Sam and I have talked
about this publicly.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.890
I choose to emphasize
certain aspects

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.230
of the practice, primarily two.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.940
One is focus.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.490
And the other is mindfulness,
not being yanked around

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:17.630
by your emotions.

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:20.060
Of course, Sam is
correct when he

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.980
talks about what is
sometimes referred to

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.370
as the deeper end of the
pool, which is that you start

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:28.310
to examine the nature of the
self, the nature of who you

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:30.980
are, the nature
of consciousness.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.570
All of that stuff
is absolutely real

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.030
and a huge part of my practice.

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.810
And I'm always happy
to talk about it

01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:37.226
because I think,
actually, there's

01:05:37.226 --> 01:05:38.850
nothing more interesting.

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:41.030
And we talk about it a lot
on my podcast these days.

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:43.339
But it's not what I lead with.

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.380
Because my audience is
very different from Sam's.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:52.670
Sam's is a bunch of really
smart, uptight young men--

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:55.790
maybe not uptight, but a
lot of really smart guys

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:57.440
who have opinions about things.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.380
And I just did this
event with him in LA.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:04.010
And they all come.

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.860
And they're great.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.840
They're super intense
and really smart.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:15.380
But so Sam can lead with the
biggest, most esoteric idea

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.780
because that's what
his audience expects.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:21.770
But I'm not that smart.

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:26.960
And I choose really to emphasize
the low-hanging fruit, which

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:29.900
is why Sam often says, you
should read "10% Happier"

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.710
before you read "Waking Up."

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:35.330
They work as a
sequence in that way.

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:38.120
Because I really am
happy splashing around

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.414
in the shallow
end because I am--

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.580
I'm not talking about my
own personal practice here.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.130
I'm talking about my
public positioning.

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:47.630
Because I really want--

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.540
I'm sort of at the
wide end of the funnel.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.440
I want to talk about
the basic human capacity

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.279
to train the mind and
get people in the pool.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.820
And then in my own
personal practice,

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.020
yeah, I do two hours
a day of meditation.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.224
I do 10-day silent meditation
retreats one-on-one

01:07:03.224 --> 01:07:04.140
with Joseph Goldstein.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.240
And all this stuff is the
stuff that I'm obsessed with.

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.400
But it just doesn't
seem to me the way

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.670
to-- the thing to lead with when
I'm trying to get people just

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:15.997
to do a minute or five
minutes a day of meditation.

01:07:15.997 --> 01:07:17.330
AUDIENCE: Appreciate your work.

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:17.830
Thanks.

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:18.180
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.070
Appreciate it.

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.020
SPEAKER: Everybody

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:22.040

Check out "10% Happier,"

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:26.230
Is there anything else?

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:27.650
DAN HARRIS: No, you've
done a great job plugging.

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:28.150
Thank you.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.717
SPEAKER: Of course.

01:07:29.717 --> 01:07:30.800
Thank you for coming, man.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.100
Really appreciate it.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.700
DAN HARRIS: Thank you.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.000
Appreciate it.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:32.300
Thank you.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:32.800
Thank you.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.442
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:33.442 --> 01:07:34.400
It was fun, really fun.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.850
SPEAKER: That was awesome.
