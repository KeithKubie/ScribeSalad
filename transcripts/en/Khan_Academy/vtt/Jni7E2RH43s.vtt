00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.900
This here is a screenshot of
the Khan Academy unit circle

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.594
module.

00:00:04.594 --> 00:00:06.010
And the whole point
here is to get

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.690
you familiar with the unit
circle definition of trig

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.140
functions, which is
just an extension

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.380
of the traditional
SOHCAHTOA definition.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.090
But the reason why the
math world did this

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.390
is so that we can define the
sine and cosines of angles that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.880
are 90 degrees or more, or
that have actual negative angle

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.780
measures.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.120
So let's figure out what
the sine of 275 degrees is.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.780
So we have this dot that's
sitting on a unit circle that

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.570
has a circle of radius 1.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.360
And let's hit this
dot to 275 degrees.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.260
Let's make an angle
of 275 degrees

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.360
with the positive x-axis.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.540
So let's see, that's 50
degrees, 75 degrees, 90 degrees.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.700
You see the angle
measure right over there.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.960
So 90 degrees, 180
gets us halfway around.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.970
270 gets us at 3/4
of the way around.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.470
So 275 is a little
bit more than that.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.710
And we need to figure out
the sine of 275 degrees.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.020
The unit circle
definition of sine

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.190
is that it's the y value of
that angle measure on the unit

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.960
circle.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.293
So we've made the angle measure.

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:10.230
We've gone 275 degrees
counterclockwise

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.180
from the positive x-axis to get
to this point right over here.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.330
And the y value is
this negative 0.996.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.380
That is the sine of 275 degrees.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.166
Negative 0.996.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.790
If they'd asked for
the cosine, then we

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.230
would give the x value of
this point of this dot right

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.030
over here.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.460
So the y value is
negative 0.996.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.770
Let's check our answer.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.280
Very good.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.550
Let's do another one.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.310
And we get-- let's see--
sine of negative 55 degrees.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.980
So now we're going to
go below the x-axis.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.110
It's a negative angle.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.290
Negative 55 degrees.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.900
And it's sine once
again, so we want

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.570
to look at the
y-coordinate of this point.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.110
So the y-coordinate
is negative 0.819.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.650
Negative 0.819.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.435
Check our answer.

00:01:59.435 --> 00:01:59.957
Very good.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:00.790
Let's keep doing it.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.730
Maybe we'll see a
cosine soon enough.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.660
Sine of 285 degrees.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.340
So 285 degrees, we're
looking right over there.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.620
The sine is the y value.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.380
Negative 0.966.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.510
Let's check our answer.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.820
Let's do another one.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.840
Sine again.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.880
2/3 pi.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.890
So now it's in radians.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680
We don't see that
little degree sign.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.550
So 2/3 pi.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.070
Let's see-- 2/3 pi
is right over here.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.190
That's the angle in radians
relative to the positive x-axis

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.180
going in the
counterclockwise direction.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.090
We care about the
sine which is the y

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.480
value of our point sitting
on the unit circle.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.540
0.866.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.430
And one thing that bears
mention is the exact

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.422
is square root of 3/2.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.880
And square root of 3/2 if you
were to write it as a decimal

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.490
would just continue on forever
without actually repeating.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.970
This is just an approximation.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.970
For the sake of this
module, we really

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030
just want to make you
comfortable with the unit

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.894
circle, and maybe
using this tool.

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.310
So you really should just type
in this approximate number.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.880
You don't have to
do the exact number

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.460
of what square root of 3/2 is.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.630
This is it rounded to
the nearest thousand.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.750
So 0.866.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.140
Let's check our answer.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.720
Let's do another one.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.480
Sine again.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.520
Sine of 15 degrees.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.580
So 15 degrees.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.500
0.259.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm going to keep doing
this until I get a cosine.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.180
So let's do it again-- cosine!

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.680
Very good.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.780
2 pi.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.750
2 pi radians.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.800
Well 2 pi is completely going
around the unit circle once.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.080
So let's go all the
way around, and we

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.760
see that we get back to
where we were before.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.440
We've gone around
to 2 pi radians.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.970
We're back to where
we were before.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.640
The cosine is the x
value of that point.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.825
So the x value of
that point is 1.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.170
The x value of the point is 1.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.910
If we wanted the
sine of 2 pi, then we

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.950
would get 0 because we have
no y value right over here.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.720
We're at the x-axis.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.029
Let's check our answer.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:51.570
Let's do one.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.950
Maybe we'll see another cosine.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.290
There we go.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.940
Another cosine.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.140
Cosine of 112 pi.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.931
So that's just going
to be a little-- let's

00:03:56.931 --> 00:03:58.680
see, 1/35, 1/18, 1/12.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.180
Cosine.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.260
We want the x value,
not the y value.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.690
The x value is 0.966.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.530
So 0.966.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.910
Check our answer.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.994
And we are done.
