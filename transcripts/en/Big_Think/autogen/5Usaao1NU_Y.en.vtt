are you doing and then I realize in
order to create the extremes of these

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920
order to create the extremes of these
 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.759
order to create the extremes of these
technologies you have to innovate you

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769
technologies you have to innovate you
 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.650
technologies you have to innovate you
can't just step there it's not it's

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660
can't just step there it's not it's
 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.719
can't just step there it's not it's
hardly ever just make it a little longer

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
hardly ever just make it a little longer
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.940
hardly ever just make it a little longer
this well it's longer so it's more

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950
this well it's longer so it's more
 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.520
this well it's longer so it's more
stress on the structure there's so we

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530
stress on the structure there's so we
 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.719
stress on the structure there's so we
have to invent something new to

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729
have to invent something new to
 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.040
have to invent something new to
accommodate this need or this desire and

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
accommodate this need or this desire and
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.510
accommodate this need or this desire and
therein are the seeds of innovation

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520
 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.240
