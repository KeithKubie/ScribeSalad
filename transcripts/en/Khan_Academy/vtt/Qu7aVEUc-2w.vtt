00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] We talked
about the dissemination

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.030
of information being
a force of convergence

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.470
on the global scale.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.003
But what about on the individual scale?

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:12.950
When we're talking about
knowledge dissemination

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.090
on an individual scale,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.210
we're really talking about
education on some level.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.740
So once again, this is a
topic very close to my heart.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.750
So let's just go through a
few thought experiments here.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.863
So in general, you have income.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.940
Income, and that income,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.540
in order to produce it, you need capital.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.260
You need capital.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.660
And you need,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.750
you need labor.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.370
For example, if you're running a farm,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.580
you need land and you need animals

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.710
and you need some equipment,
but you also need people to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580
run the equipment and manage the farm.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.080
If you're running a software company,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.220
you need a building, you need computers,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.380
you need servers.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.290
I guess that's computers as well.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.960
But you need people to
program the computers

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.140
and to sell the software

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.180
and to develop it and whatever else.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.100
So these are the two things that you need

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.180
in order to produce output,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.100
which you would recognize
in terms of income.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.290
But then the question is how
does that income get split?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.350
How much of it goes to the capital,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.690
and how much goes to labor?

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.870
And the idea here is, is that
if you have dissemination

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.180
of knowledge and if knowledge work

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.930
becomes more and more and more valuable,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690
so if knowledge work,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.480
so let me put a little,
little aura around this.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.290
So this is the aura of knowledge.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.670
If this is knowledge work

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.090
and it's less and less of a commodity,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.470
then maybe labor has more leverage here.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.303
On the other hand,

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.730
if you have these hugely
capital-intensive industries

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.150
where labor is kind of this
monotonous, unskilled work,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.870
then maybe capital has
more of the leverage.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.140
Now let's just think about,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.710
and Piketty tends to
be a little dismissive

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.100
of this happening on a large scale.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.140
He says it might be happening in pockets.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.730
It might be happening
in pockets in terms of,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.560
you know, managers in finance

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.580
or maybe in certain industries
like the software industry.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.510
But in his mind, this isn't,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.230
this knowledge dissemination
isn't going to make

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.730
labor important enough in
order to offset this whole,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.860
in more and more income going to capital,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.100
especially after
generation and generation,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.190
potentially leading to dynastic wealth.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.090
But the one thought
experiment, once again,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.170
my goal here isn't to
give my point of view,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.990
it's really to just give
you things to think about

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.200
and for you to come to
your own point of view,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370
is to think about the comparison
between the present day

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.870
and the Gilded Age, which the book makes.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.130
If we look at the Gilded Age,
so let me write this here.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.240
So the Gilded Age,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.350
so this is the end of the
19th century, the late 1800s.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.513
The Gilded Age,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.680
what were the forces of
growth in the Gilded Age?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.970
Where was a lot of the
income being generated from?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.920
Well, this was really the peak
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.430
You have things like railroads,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.120
railroads.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.880
You have oil, I guess you could
say, you know, energy, oil.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.493
You have manufacturing,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.920
manufacturing.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.780
All of these industries are
incredibly capital-intensive.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.820
Capital is very important.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.630
You can't even do these
things without capital.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.790
And in all of these, labor
is a bit of a commodity,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.470
that, hey, you just need
people to kind of, you know,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.410
nail the railroad ties
in and things like that.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.440
You need people to just,
you know, work on the rig.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.610
You need people to work
on the assembly line.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.340
And the Industrial Revolution
was really a process

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.570
of taking these crafts and
turning them into more and more,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.200
you know, one-off, almost you
could call it commodity labor.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.860
Now let's think about the present day,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.170
and we could probably,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.620
I think it's fair to call
it the Information Age,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.820
Information Age.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.460
And what are the growth industries

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.370
in the Information Age?

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.740
Well, one that's close to my heart,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm making this video in the
middle of Silicon Valley,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.555
is software.

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:12.750
Actually, that's probably the one

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.410
that really stands out to
me as a major growth area,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.300
but there's, you know, kind of biotech,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.530
biotech, we could go on and on and on.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.000
And what's common about all of these?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.610
Well, they're not necessarily

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.700
as capital-intensive as what we see here.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.610
In particular, if we're
talking about software,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.640
it's not very capital-intensive at all.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.640
You just need some computers
and a place to program,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.870
and you can, in theory, do
it inside someone's house.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.080
And this is really more about highly,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.500
highly, highly skilled labor.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.050
Same thing with biotech,
it does need capital,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.450
but that capital isn't for railroads

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.990
or isn't for, you know, hugely,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.840
I mean, there is some equipment,
but it's mainly for people.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.420
It's mainly for researchers

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.310
and people to run the clinical
trials and for whatever else.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.120
And so we are, it seems
like we are in an age

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.980
where labor is going to become
more and more invaluable,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.480
more valuable, but not
just commodity labor,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.000
not just to someone to kind of, you know,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.770
work one shift at the factory,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.490
but highly, highly, highly skilled labor.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.300
Now, just because this is happening, this,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.160
or because this is happening,
this could be a driver

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.630
of more and more income going to labor.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.830
But that by itself wouldn't necessarily

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.140
drive off inequality.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.390
For example, you might have a situation,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.610
and there's some date signs
that maybe this is happening,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.990
where if you look at, if
this is the pool of folks,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.380
that the people who are
able to participate in this,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.750
these high-growth sectors

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.700
where labor adds a
significant amount of value,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.720
that that's actually a small
percentage of this population.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.080
So a small percentage of the population

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.260
is going to take advantage,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.640
could potentially take
advantage of these, and if,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.130
of these dynamics.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.520
But if the rest of the population

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.880
doesn't have the skills necessary,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.600
then they're going to
essentially be left out

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.470
of this growth, and so that
could still drive inequality.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.830
It won't be driving inequality

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.710
because of income going
more and more to capital,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.540
because of R being greater than G,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.510
because returns of capital
are greater than growth.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.890
It wouldn't be because of that.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.100
It would be because of this
differentiation in labor

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.210
where highly, highly skilled labor

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.640
is getting a disproportionate
share of the income

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.540
relative to other labor.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.840
So the question is,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.640
is can we get more people
to participate this?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.000
And once again, this is
an issue of education.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.720
Can we get this pool, as a
percentage of the population,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.470
to become a much larger
pool of the population

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.080
so more and more,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.360
so more and more of the world,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.550
more and more of the world
can participate in that?

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.330
So once again, this is just
something to think about.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.000
I don't know the answer to this,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.280
but there are some dynamics in play.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.700
And we're definitely in
a different type of world

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.930
than we were in the Gilded Age.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.500
Another way that you could think about it,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.530
and this isn't from the book,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.860
but this is just a way that
I sometimes think about it.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.250
If you think, in the
Industrial Revolution,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.860
you have the world was kind of a,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.870
the world was kind of a pyramid,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.443
that down here you have your labor,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.210
then, and you needed a lot of folks there,

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.120
but it was relatively unskilled.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.440
And then in the middle,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.010
you kind of have your white-collar jobs.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.420
You could, white-collar jobs,
you know, this is the folks

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.450
who are kind of manipulating
information, filing papers,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.400
et cetera, et cetera, the office jobs.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.953
And then at the top of the pyramid

00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:31.370
during the Industrial Revolution

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.300
and really going into the
20th century, you had,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.700
you could, I guess you could
say your capital owners,

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.290
your owners of capital.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.860
And then you had also a very small,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.680
you had a very small, I
would say, creative class.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.740
So this is creative,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.843
creative,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.000
creative class.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.180
And so this would be folks like engineers

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.840
and artists and people doing research.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.610
And so, this is essentially
the dynamic you had.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.750
But now when we go into
the Information Age,

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.620
automation is making labor,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.370
is making labor less important

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.950
in even white-collar jobs,
information processing.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.840
And so there's two different realities

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.490
that we could potentially go to.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.030
There's one where essentially

00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:21.630
you still have a relatively small

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.550
class of people who own capital

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.220
or own most of the capital
or, and a creative class.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.890
And then you have a small,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.410
you have a, actually, let me just,

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.380
so if I just take that triangle,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.263
that same triangle right over there,

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:42.580
so you still have a small group of people

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.380
who fall into the top of the triangle.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.580
And because automation is
taking care of these middle two,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.980
you only need a small sliver of people

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.690
who are participating in here.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.560
And so everyone else here

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.070
is essentially going to be left out.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.770
So these folks are going to be left out,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.350
which isn't a good recipe for anyone.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.050
But there's another reality where,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.710
well, what if we could
expand this top triangle

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.930
where we can have a larger
and larger creative class?

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.430
And if these people can
participate in the high-value labor

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.260
jobs, I guess you can say,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.760
then they are going to be in a position

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.550
to capture more and more of the income,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.080
and then they will also be in a position

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.540
to have more and more capital.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.890
You see that happening in Silicon Valley.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.790
People who get a neat software job

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.230
at Google or Facebook or Apple,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.850
not only, you know, they're getting that

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.260
through their labor,

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.840
but because that income is
larger than their expenses,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.930
they're able to start
to accumulate capital

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.040
and also become capital owners.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.310
So there's a reality that,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.780
if we play our cards right in education,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.860
and once again, this is close to my heart,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.250
maybe instead of going to this world

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.200
where we leave all of these people out,

00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:56.590
we can go to a world
that looks more like this

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.300
where we don't need a lot of labor

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.900
because of automation, more kind of,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.640
I guess you could say commodity labor.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.270
We don't need a lot of
kind of the traditional

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.920
white-collar jobs in
information processing.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.100
And then most people,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.450
if we can get education to be good enough,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.510
can now participate in
these really high-value jobs

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.030
where labor has a lot more leverage,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.380
where the returns to labor are larger

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.470
than the returns to capital.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.630
And because the returns
to labor are larger,

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.500
you're going to have those people also,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.020
they're gonna get more share of income,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.960
and they're also going to be able to start

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.820
to accumulate capital.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.370
So getting to this reality

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.110
where you're having a
larger and larger percentage

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.700
of people who are
essentially capital owners,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.460
capital owners and software
engineers and artists

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.530
and people doing R and D,

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.340
in my mind, this is predicated

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.600
on improving education.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.590
So to get from here to here

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.460
and to avoid going to this top one,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.270
it really is about having

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.330
a more talented labor pool,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.400
a more educated labor pool.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.280
And if we pull this off, then we get into

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.650
what could be considered
kind of a Star Trek reality.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.920
A Star Trek reality, people
don't really view Star Trek

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.210
from economic point of
view, but in Star Trek,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.130
you might realize that
there aren't a lot of people

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.970
kind of tilling the fields here.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.090
There aren't a lot of people

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.870
just kind of doing desk jobs at Star Trek.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.730
Everyone at Star Trek
is either doing R and D,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.473
they are Explorers,

00:11:25.225 --> 00:11:27.600
or they are artists.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.900
So once again, just
something to think about,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.650
that education, that
knowledge dissemination

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.820
could be a very, very
powerful force of convergence

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.163
and keep us from going
into another Gilded Age.
