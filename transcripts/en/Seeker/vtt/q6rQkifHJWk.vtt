00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.440
If our dreams are a reflection of reality,
how does someone who experiences a different

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.100
reality dream?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.550
Hey folks, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.090
Here's something I had never really thought
about: how do the blind experience their dreams?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
It's a perspective completely removed from
my own, having been able to see my whole life

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.699
-- well, minus when I take my glasses off
and knock into things, but that's a slightly

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.699
different story.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.751
A new study published in the journal Sleep
Medicine took a little looksee at how the

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:30.789
blind dream.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.079
For sighted people, dreaming is primarily
a visual activity.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.260
You remember images.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.111
But if you don't have the sense of sight,
other sensory information--the information

00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:40.430
you rely on the most-- takes the lead.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.860
The researchers looked at groups of people
who were blind from birth (or congenitally

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.610
blind), those who became blind later in life,
and those who can see.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.520
Immediately after a dream, they were asked
about their sensory experiences -- (what did

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520
you see?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.809
Did you taste anything?) -- as well as how
they felt emotionally in the dream and if

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.059
there were any themes.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.980
Like falling, or being able to fly, for instance.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.809
Amongst the blind participants, most of the
content in their dreams was made up of things

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.809
they *heard*.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.040
86% of them experienced sounds and voices,
as opposed to 64% of the seeing group.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.520
The scientists basically said that the longer
the person was able to see during their life,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.029
the more visual content there was in the dreams.

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:20.499
The blind also experienced more sensations
of *touch* in their dreams - 70%, versus 45%

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:21.749
of the seeing group.

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.439
The blind were also much more likely to taste
and smell than the seeing group.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.289
In terms of emotional and thematic content,
all the groups reported similar results -- but

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.810
the congenitally blind group did stand out
in the way of....nightmares.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.359
They were 4x more likely to report nightmares
than the late onset blindness and seeing groups.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.630
Why might those who are congenitally blind
have more nightmares than everyone else?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.609
The scientists aren't sure, but they have
a theory!

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.279
Nightmares are one way that our brains process
and cope with threats to our safety.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.929
So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the
blind tended to have nightmares about things

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.100
like getting hit by a car, getting lost, losing
a guide dog.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.600
It's unclear if this means that the blind
experience more fear overall in their lives,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
generally speaking.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.700
So folks, what parts of your dreams do you
remember most?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.759
Or do you dream at all?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.829
