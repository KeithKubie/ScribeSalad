TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.480
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.010
Let's start with the TLDR.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.510
Zooshi!

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.750
Is a new open source
cross-platform game written

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.050
in C++ that demonstrates how
to build games using a suite

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.140
of newly released and updated
open source game technologies

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.150
from Google.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.050
Click the link below
in the description

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.660
to check out the six
recently updated open source

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.240
tools you can use in your game.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.910
Jason Sanmiya is the TL for
Zooshi! and is on the show

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.102
today to tell us more.

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:26.810
JASON SANMIYA: Great
to be here, Timothy.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.268
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Happy birthday, Go.

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:30.565
[PARTY HORN]

00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:36.640
[LAUGHTER] You've
just turned six,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.535
and you have over 780
contributors with 30,000

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.505
commits in 22 repositories.

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:43.880
Thank you to everyone in the
open source community who've

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.190
made Go what it is today.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.310
Create virtual machines
with exactly the amount

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.920
of power and memory you need,
using custom machine types

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.470
on the Google Cloud platform.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.080
No more rounding up
to a power of two

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.912
and wasting money
on unused resources.

00:00:56.912 --> 00:00:59.370
A bunch of network performance
and flexibility improvements

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.510
have recently come to the
Google Cloud platform,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.120
including the general
availability of HTTPS load

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.590
balancing, segmenting
your IP space

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.630
with sub-networks,
dynamic routing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.090
on Cloud Router for seamless
connectivity with no traffic

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.430
disruption, and the
ability to use Akamai

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.160
as a CDN interconnect provider.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.480
30% of all smartphone
sales worldwide

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.350
happen in the last three
months of the year,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.640
and ad impressions
spike by nearly 30%

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.300
between October and January.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.060
This makes January an excellent
time to promote your app.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.130
Check out the infographic
linked below in the description

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.110
for more.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.640
So this next part isn't
exactly developer related.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.820
But if you love "Star Wars,"
check out google.com/starwars

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.700
to add a little light side or a
little dark side to your Google

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.310
experience.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.410
Find out how Fablic
improved sign-ups by 30%

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.130
and increased retention
by 20% using Material

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.660
Design in Android Studio.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.520
The video is linked in
the description below.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.580
App builds and deployment are
both faster with Android Studio

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.450
2.0.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.000
The new version
features instant run,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.375
a feature that will dramatically
improve your development

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:04.120
workflow.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.650
More on this later
in the show as I

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.280
get the inside scoop from
product manager Stephanie

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.690
Cuthbertson.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.777
Speaking of Android, the
Android Dev Summit has wrapped.

00:02:12.777 --> 00:02:14.860
We had a great time meeting
developers and talking

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.690
about all things Android, and
we've got a few more clips

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.340
to play from the event as well
as Joanna Smith on the show

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.200
today to share more
about what went down

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.180
at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View, California.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.100
JOANNA SMITH: Hi.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
that and more today

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.490
on "The Developer Show."

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.770
OK, so the Android Dev
Summit has wrapped.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.499
Let's actually start
with a clip to see

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:42.790
what it was like on the ground.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.984
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:55.162 --> 00:02:56.870
Hey, everybody, I'm
here with Chet Haase,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.029
who leads the Android
UI Toolkit team.

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.570
CHET HAASE: We talked about some
of the overview information,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.930
and then a deep dive on memory.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.138
So what we wanted to do this
time was talk about some

00:03:05.138 --> 00:03:07.844
of the higher level concepts
that you need to keep in mind

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:09.760
so that you understand
the context that you're

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.410
developing in.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.310
MALE SPEAKER: I
think what developers

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.934
don't think about is
that notifications

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:20.220
are the first place often the
users come into their phone.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.740
And that's your
opportunity to build trust,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.573
to deliver information that
they need and they can act upon.

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:26.985
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So that's what it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.990
felt like to be on the ground
at Android Dev Summit this year

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.730
at the Computer
History Museum here

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.450
in Mountain View, California.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.819
One of the things that I
realized about conferences,

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.360
and I think we share
this philosophy,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.210
is that these
sessions are great.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.520
And, by the way, you can see all
the sessions-- play list linked

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.010
below with all the links.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.180
However, another thing
happens at conferences,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.400
which is the conversation in
the hallways between sessions.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.150
I was hoping that-- I
mean, you were there

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.670
for the entire conference.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.750
JOANNA SMITH: I was.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --you'd give us
a little bit inside about maybe

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.570
what were the three top
conversations happening

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.420
between developers at the event?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.910
JOANNA SMITH: So
obviously, the one

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.050
I noticed the most were all the
questions about Doze and App

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.950
Standby because that's what
people like to ask me about,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.370
which is great.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.260
Ask me questions on Twitter.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.759
It's fine.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.250
JASON SANMIYA: I love Doze mode.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.580
JOANNA SMITH: It's the hero of
Marshmallows, you know that?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It really
is the hero of Marshmallow.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.385
JASON SANMIYA: I never plug
my phone in anymore at night.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:16.209
I just let it doze.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.360
JOANNA SMITH: You
doze with Doze?

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.170
JASON SANMIYA: With me, yeah.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.975
JOANNA SMITH: I like that.

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.140
So Doze mode's clearly a really
big topic, and a lot of people

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.280
have a lot of feelings about it.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.370
And I'm happy to
hear your feelings,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.828
but you're probably
wrong to worry.

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.410
So that's a great conversation.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.090
And then, of course,
Android Studio 2.0

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.800
was a huge moment
because everyone's

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.300
excited about being
able to actually develop

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.430
without having to wait every
five seconds to see, like,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.000
what did that change
to my layout look like.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.780
What did that change look like?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.190
What did that change look like?

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.470
If we can enable developers
to develop faster,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.303
then I think they'll
be able to build better

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:42.660
apps at a much better pace.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.850
So I'm excited about that.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.725
But the other thing that
made me really happy

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:48.141
was people haven't stopped
talking about Material Design.

00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:50.140
Like it's still a core
part of their development

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.610
thought now now.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.800
And we've managed
to take something

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.130
that people used to hate
doing, unless you had a higher

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.745
designer, and make it a core
part of their considerations.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:59.162
Like people want beautiful
apps that flow really well,

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:00.120
and I love seeing that.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.109
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.400
And the conversations that
happen in the hallway, those

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.540
can continue online.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.050
We have a developer community.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.193
JOANNA SMITH: We do.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:07.360
We have an Android
developer community.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.850
We have a lot of specialized
communities for things

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.091
like performance or design.

00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:11.590
And, you know, we're
all on Twitter.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.996
So our engineers and our
Android framework team,

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.370
they look at the
questions on G+.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.430
They look at the community.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.080
Give us a shout out.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.580
Let us know what
your questions are.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.450
And then holler at
us at Twitter, too.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great, and
we'll put all those links down

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.540
in the show notes.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.310
JOANNA SMITH: Tons of
links in the description.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Tons of links.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.010
All right, let's
go to an interview

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.430
I was able to do Stephanie
Cuthbertson just after she

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.550
gave the keynote about
Android Studio 2.0.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.800
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.300
Hi there.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.799
I'm here with
Stephanie Cuthbertson.

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.250
She's a Group Product Manager
for Android and, of course,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.960
one of the captains
of Android Studio.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.800
Android Studio, up until now,
has been about a really strong

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.860
foundation.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.340
But with 2.0, there's a whole
bunch of speed improvements

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.160
across the board.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.980
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
When you look at 2.0,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.370
you'll find the emulators
changed dramatically.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.830
The ADB speeds have
improved massively.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.654
It's now five times
faster to push.

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:57.070
If you look closely,
it's actually

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.080
34 times faster than it
was in the last build

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.120
of Android Studio.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.161
And we worked really
closely with the search team

00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:03.970
on deep linking.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.510
And this is one of my
favorite speed improvements.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.600
Because if you think
about it, as a developer,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.517
you really want to make
your app discoverable.

00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:10.391
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:12.989
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: But it
sometimes takes a long time

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:14.530
to read through all
the documentation

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.990
and figure out how to do that.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.470
And so one of the things
that's magical about IntelliJ

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.680
is it prompts you in line
for how to do things.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.250
And with deep linking,
Android Studio 2.0

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.370
will do exactly that.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.860
I think you probably
know what I'm

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.610
going to say what my
favorite feature is.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think I do.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.500
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Which is Instant Run.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.240
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
It's just amazing.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It is so cool.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.800
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Yeah, really

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.740
what's cool about
it is it really

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.198
changes mobile development so
it's much more like web style

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:37.716
development.

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:39.090
So now you can
just make a change

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.509
and see it refresh,
more or less,

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.050
instantly, which is very much
like doing development in HTML.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
like refreshing the page.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.010
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.040
When we look at
profiling Android apps,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.170
we found around
80% of Android apps

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.090
will build in a minute or less.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.160
And so an app that used
to take a minute to build

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.270
is now going to take
about one to two seconds

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.020
to push incremental changes,
so that's quite a big change.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes,
that's incredible.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.650
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yeah.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And we
were talking a bit earlier,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.580
and I thought it was
really fascinating.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.913
I was hoping we could share
it with everybody out there,

00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:07.680
about how you've landed
upon sort of this direction,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.187
like this feature, and the
early days of building for it.

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:12.770
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
We got together

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.709
with a crack group
of engineers, some

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.750
of the most talented
engineers in Android Studio,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.000
which is a very talented team.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.994
And our engineering director,
Arno Weber, said, look,

00:07:21.994 --> 00:07:23.910
we're going to make the
build 10 times faster.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.350
And the team went
off over the weekend

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.510
and came back in and showed us
a running demo of Instant Run,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.090
complete with hot
swapping for code changes

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.850
and instant run for resources.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.772
And I remember it was
my modeling at the time.

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:40.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
now we can do this.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.063
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON:
Yes, I remember

00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:44.900
thinking to myself, that's not
exactly what I had in mind.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.270
That's about 10 times better.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.970
So, in fact, if
you look closely,

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.700
the build is not
10 times faster.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.720
It's roughly 55 times faster.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.752
We cannot say enough
how grateful we are

00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:56.460
to our community.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.340
And Android, it's open source.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.220
It's free.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.365
And I'd say a lot of, if not
all of the most significant

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:03.740
improvements that
we've made have

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.730
come from us using
the product ourselves,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.450
and especially listening to
the community's feedback.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.300
So we're very dependent
on the community.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.841
We're very grateful
to the community.

00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:12.490
And so I I think
with 2.0 coming out

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.531
probably one of the biggest
things we want to say

00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:17.090
is just thank you so much to
that whole group of developers.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:17.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.250
STEPHANIE CUTHBERTSON: Yep.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And keep
the feedback coming.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.160
And check out the keynote.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.810
It's awesome.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.518
Thank you, Steph.

00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:23.470
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:23.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's all you need

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.158
to know about Android Studio.

00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:27.370
OK, let's talk about the Zooshi!

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.730
Jason, welcome to the show.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.310
JASON SANMIYA: Thanks.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.685
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
So first, tell us

00:08:30.685 --> 00:08:33.840
what is Zooshi! in, I don't
know, 20 words or less.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.590
JASON SANMIYA: Well, Zooshi!
is a mobile and VR game

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.150
where you float down
a mystic river feeding

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.460
sushi to animal patrons.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's 18-ish.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.900
That was great.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.640
So why do we make the game, and
people may have heard of FPL.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.800
What is FPL?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.900
JASON SANMIYA: Fun Promotion
Labs, that's my team,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.680
is a team here at Google
that makes open source

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.949
cross-platform C++ libraries
for game developers.

00:08:59.949 --> 00:09:02.240
So we found that there's a
lot of developers out there,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.880
the majority, in fact, who would
prefer to roll their own C++

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.230
libraries or use open
source libraries,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.542
rather than lock into a
third party game engine.

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:16.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you make
games so people can make games.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.166
JASON SANMIYA: That's right.

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:18.610
It's a pretty tough job.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's
a pretty great job.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.106
For Zooshi! in
particular, can you

00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:24.980
tell us maybe some of
your favorite features,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.400
like for example, VR.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.882
You can play the
Cardboard version

00:09:27.882 --> 00:09:29.340
or you can play
the Mobile version.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.132
It's the same game.

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:31.548
JASON SANMIYA:
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:34.583
We talked to developers, and the
big question that they have is,

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:37.480
is VR a big enough market?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.380
And so our solution
was well, hey,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.250
maybe you can
develop for both VR

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.590
and mobile at the same
time, the same way

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.320
that you would develop, say,
a PC game and a console game--

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.120
same game, different
input schemes.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.962
But you can basically develop
them both at the same time,

00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:54.920
and they're a little bit
different experiences.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.570
But game-wise they're the same.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.040
JOANNA SMITH: So what I
like about this whole thing

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.920
is that you've made the
entire game open source.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.480
So developers can actually see
how you did that development

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.330
side by side and what you're
able to reuse and everything.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.610
But even cooler is
you built this game,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.970
and then you took the APIs
out of the game, right?

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.500
Like you didn't build
an engine and then build

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.458
a game for your engine.

00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:15.000
You did it the way a
developer would do it, right?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.090
JASON SANMIYA: Yeah, we
think the best game tech is

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.910
tech that comes out of a game.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.790
So everything that we package
up as an individual library

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.790
on GitHub was originally
part of one of our games

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.060
that we generalized and made
independent of everything

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.814
else and then posted on
GitHub for people to use.

00:10:34.814 --> 00:10:37.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And the whole
game is open source as well.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.880
So you can see the whole game,
how everything works together.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.665
And you can use any of
the individual libraries.

00:10:41.665 --> 00:10:42.480
JASON SANMIYA: That's right.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.760
You don't have to
grab the whole game.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.750
You don't have to use it
as one monolithic thing.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.130
You can grab each individual
piece and put it in your game.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.080
JOANNA SMITH: It's like
they love their developers.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.038
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
move on to the next clip,

00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:53.790
and this is Joanna's
favorite topic,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.070
JOANNA SMITH: Doze Mode.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
[INAUDIBLE] joins us

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.690
for this week's "Who's
Doing What Now?"

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.729
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.770
MALE SPEAKER: I've actually
never seen that show.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.710
MALE SPEAKER: You--

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.270
MALE SPEAKER: But I did read
up on dynamic permissions

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.080
last night.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.288
That's basically the only
thing I need to think about

00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:12.600
for Android 6, right?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.110
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's all.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.840
Well, except for Doze mode.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.289
MALE SPEAKER: Wait,
who's doing what now?

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:20.080
MALE SPEAKER: Don't
let this happen to you.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.834
I'm right [INAUDIBLE] and
this "Who's Doing What Now?"

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.250
Now, we all hate
being interrupted

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.430
in the middle of a good nap.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.330
(WHISPERING) When you're
asleep, it's more important

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.470
that your device have
battery when you wake up then

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.380
for every app to be
continuously updated.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.330
So if the device is unplugged,
stationary, and with the screen

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.850
off for a significant period
of time, it enters Doze mode.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.190
Doze mode conserves battery
by restricting network access

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.850
and deferring jobs,
syncs, and standard alarms

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.020
to fall within periodic
maintenance windows,

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.780
or until the user wakes the
device by plugging it in,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.980
turning on the screen,
or picking it up.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.260
Until that time, network access
will be disabled for all apps.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.630
Wake locks are ignored, standard
alarm managers are deferred,

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.050
as are Wi-Fi scans, sync
adapters, and the job

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.330
scheduler.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.540
The goal is to optimize
battery life by limiting

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.970
power intensive operations.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.050
So, in many cases, you won't
have to change anything.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.990
But, if your app needs to update
regularly or more frequently,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.210
there are ways to handle that.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.090
You can fire alarms while in
Doze mode using the new Set

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.420
and Allow While
Idle or Set Exact

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.560
and Allow While Idle methods.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.240
An alarm set with
Set Alarm Clock

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.370
continues to fire normally,
causing the system

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.097
to exit Doze mode shortly
before those alarms fire.

00:12:34.097 --> 00:12:35.930
Now, if your app needs
persistent connection

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.770
to the network to
receive messages,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.570
you should consider using
Google Cloud Messaging, or GCM.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.560
It lets you support
real time downstream

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.610
messaging between
back-end services and apps

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:48.120
on Android devices,
using a single shared

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.920
persistent connection
to the cloud,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.200
significantly improving
battery performance.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.060
GCM is optimized
to work with Doze

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.450
through the use of high
priority GCM messages

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.830
that let you wake your
app to access the network.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.070
The Android team
optimizing battery life

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.786
using Doze mode, that's
"Who's Doing What Now?"

[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And that's
our show for the day.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.190
Let's end with our
final question.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.810
Panel, if you could add
Doze mode to something else

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.104
in your life, what would it be?

00:13:17.104 --> 00:13:19.270
JOANNA SMITH: Could I just
doze through the work day

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.966
and still get my paycheck?

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:21.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Nope.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.680
Jason?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.160
JASON SANMIYA:
How about my boss?

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.252
Because that guy's
always plugged in.

00:13:26.252 --> 00:13:27.500
He's really high energy.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.045
JOANNA SMITH: They
don't need to doze

00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:29.440
if they're plugged in, right?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.000
Like, you're only worried
when they're unplugged.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.583
JASON SANMIYA: I'm going to have
to check the links afterwards

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:35.700
and read more about Doze.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.580
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, and
that's our show for the day.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.900
Thank you for joining us
here on "The Developer Show."

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.000
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.450
