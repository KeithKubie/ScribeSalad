00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:05.238
MAN: That woke me up out
of a beautiful dream.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.841
Me and pizza with my
girlfriend at this place

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.510
near our apartment.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.348
[animal howl]

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.217
I think it's a moose.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.053
[animal howl]

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.621
A moose's mating call.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.795
Dude, just go to her.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.996
Sounds like a match
made in heaven.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:40.640
[animal howl]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.510
Holy crap, bro.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.183
[animal howl]
Oh.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:55.955
Stupid moose.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:01:03.863
[animal howl]

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:12.605
[howls] Ain't nature beautiful?

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:45.205
The moose was at it from like
midnight all the way to an hour

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.875
ago, an hour or two ago.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.710
I didn't get a lick
of sleep since then.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.981
He's an ass [bleep].

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.715
He's an [bleep] neighbor.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.888
It's like living
next to a fraternity.

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.189
Except I couldn't call the cops.

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:10.930
I'm getting really hungry.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.502
Stone crop and grasshoppers
are not cutting it anymore.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.470
And I'm going to
focus more on trapping

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.306
and trout line and hunting.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.310
I really need to start catching
fish or kill an animal.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.379
If I don't, they'll be
pulling me out of here.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.017
Wish we could kill moose.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.186
I would've [bleep] murdered
that moose last night.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.691
Oh hell yeah!

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.961
Oh [bleep] yeah!

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:44.464
Holy [bleep]!

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.799
Oh no, I'm getting
[inaudible] go away.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.101
[bleep] Yeah!

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:52.605
[bleep] fish!

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:26.272
[bleep] Damn it!
