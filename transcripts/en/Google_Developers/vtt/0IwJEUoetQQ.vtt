TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.383
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.383 --> 00:00:06.580
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.030
The advanced Android app
development online course

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.760
has been updated,
improved, and extended.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.650
With it, you can build
a portfolio of apps

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.990
as you improve your
Android dev skills.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
The course is linked from the
post in the description below.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.650
We recently launched
AIY projects,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.630
do-it-yourself artificial
intelligence for makers.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.840
With it, makers can use
artificial intelligence

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.300
to make human-to-machine
interaction more

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.759
like human-to-human
interactions.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.950
We'll be releasing a
series of reference kits,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.440
starting with voice recognition.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.360
More details and
links are on the post.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.560
Chrome 59 beta is now available
with headless chromium,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.250
native notifications on Mac
OS, service worker navigation

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.230
pre-load, and more.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.790
All the details are on the post.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.840
Google Cloud Launcher has more
Google-maintained containers,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.080
including Cassandra,
ElasticSearch, Jenkins,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.240
MySQL, and more.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.090
Google Container solutions are
managed by Google engineers,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.099
and since we're
maintaining the images,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.860
the containers available
on Google Cloud Launcher

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.440
will be current with the
latest application and security

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.880
updates.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760
There are two announcements from
Google Cloud Next London that I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.240
wanted to tell you about.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.750
First, Google Cloud
Natural language API

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.900
is adding support for new
languages and entity sentiment

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.160
analysis.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.030
And second, Cloud Spanner
is now generally available.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.970
Check out the details of both
announcements on the post.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.440
Google I/O is just around the
corner, and if you're like me,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.180
you like to go in
prepared, which

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.450
is why we have an Android
iOS and web app to help you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.540
customize your I/O schedule
and get around the developer

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.710
festival.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.020
