00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.800
and  we've spent a lot of this series on how various gods created the earth,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.500
but now it's time to look at one way they destroy it.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.200
Today's topic..

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.500
is floods.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.100
Oh!

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.200
Thoth put his swimtrunks on!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Thoth put his swimtrunks on! 
 All right, we're all ready, let's get started!

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.800
(water noise)

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
(Mike's wearing defective water wings)

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.000
*Egyption myth-trivia*

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.200
*Greek myth-trivia*

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.500
*Indian myth-trivia*

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.060
*Norse myth-trivia*

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.000
You're probably familiar with the story of the flood
from the Bible,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.900
featuring Noah and the Ark, but

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.000
it turns out that alot of cultures have flood myths.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.500
One explanation for this is the belief that
myths are rooted in history.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.200
--remember Euhemerism?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.200
Plus many of the earliest, complex societies grew around rivers--

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.800
--which would flood.
Most of the time, that flooding was neither predictable,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.000
nor helpful; except for the
Nile river, whose floods were regular,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
provided water for irrigation, and-

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.580
-were thought to be of divine significance.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.700
Just ask Sobek, crocodile-headed god of
the Nile's floods.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.100
Despite his frightening teeth, he also has a reputation for healing or protection in some stories.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.100
-Anyway, flood myths may also reflect a
common theme in some of the myths we've examined:

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.400
The idea that creation's source..

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.100
..is PRIMORDIAL WATERS.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
if water can bring life, it stands to reason,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.000
it can also bring...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it can also bring...
DEATH.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.100
You can see the symbolism in various purification
rituals like baptisms,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.600
or

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000
prenuptial cleansings.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.800
They serve as tiny reenactments of floods

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
-where an old life is destroyed and a new life begins.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.640
A tiny made-to-order single-serving flood:

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.720
adorable..

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.220
and destructive

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's begin in ancient Mesopotamia
with one of our favorite mythical sources:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.800
The Epic of Gilgamesh

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.200
Thought bubble?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
What you got?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
At the beginning of this particular story

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.500
the hero, Utnapishtim, is talking to Gilgamesh

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.770
about living in the city of Shurupakk
on the banks of the Euphrates.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.000
He explains that a group of Gods,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.500
Anu,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.100
Anu, Enlil,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.600
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.100
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.800
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi, and Ea

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800
Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi, and Ea
put their divine heads together..

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
..and decided to flood the place.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.500
luckily for Utnapishtim, Ea has second thoughts,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.229
and sneaks over to spill the beans.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.600
Ea secretly tells Utnapishtim what's going down,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.100
and orders him to leave his home,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.300
all his possessions,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800
and to build a boat,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.500
which will carry the seed of all living things.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.800
Utnapishtim's boat is...

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.810
Utnapishtim's boat is... 
MASSIVE

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.500
--an acre in circumference, with six enormous decks.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.100
Utnapishtim and his family loaded up with everything there was:

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100
all the silver, gold, and seeds of every living thing;

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.680
his kith, and his kin and the
wild beasts, and all kinds of craftsmen--

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.500
--and also shuffleboard!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.800
--and also shuffleboard and a killer buffet!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.300
--and also shuffleboard and a killer buffet!
(I assume)

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.500
When the hour of destruction arrives,
the gods send down a terrifying storm.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.200
So terrifying that even the gods were afraid of the flood-weapon.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
and when they see what they've done to their creation,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.000
the Gods,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
the Gods, humbled,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.400
the Gods, humbled,
sat there...

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800
the Gods, humbled,
sat there... weeping.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.600
(Whoops!)

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000
The storm rages for seven days before
eventually blowing itself out.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.950
Utnapishtim looks out of a porthole and sees
that all of mankind has been destroyed

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.500
--and he weeps.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.200
He's just become the world's first cruise ship captain..

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.800
under VERY unfortunate circumstances.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.900
His boat comes aground on mount Nimush,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.900
and Utnapishtim sends out birds to search for dry land.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.400
First,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.100
First, 
a dove comes back,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.800
First, 
a dove comes back, 
because there was no place to perch,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.300
then,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.200
then,
the swallow returns,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.100
finally,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.600
finally, 
he sends out a raven,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.800
and when it doesn't return,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800
and when it doesn't return,
he knows dry land is out there...

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.100
somewhere.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.100
He makes a sacrifice to the gods,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.800
and am-scrays off that oat-bay, lickety-split.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.800
Thank you, thought bubble!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.300
So,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.800
So, the flood destroys mankind,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.500
So, the flood destroys mankind,
but..

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.200
..it doesn't end there.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.900
..it doesn't end there.
Enlil, the brains behind the decision to destroy humanity,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
sees that Utnapishtim and his family,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.900
sees that Utnapishtim and his family, 
and also probably the craftsmen,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
-have survived!
And he can't believe his eyes!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.200
What sort of life survived?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.500
What sort of life survived? 
No man should have lived through the destruction.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Ea, who had told Utnapishtim to build
the giant boat, chimes in:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"You are the sage of the gods, warrior,"

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
"so how,"

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"so how, oh how"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.200
"so how, oh how
could you fail to consult and impose the flood?"

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
"Punish the sinner for his sin,"

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.700
"Punish the sinner for his sin,
punish the criminal for his crime, but-"

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.200
"-ease off, let work not cease, be patient..."

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.500
Ea tries to instill some moderation in Enlil,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.500
and suggests that maybe, in the
future, he could just send like

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.200
a lion,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.000
a lion, 
or a wolf

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.100
a lion, 
or a wolf
or a plague..

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.100
you know, something mild...

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.000
you know, something mild... 
like a plague.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Apparently this satisfies Enlil, because he shrugs,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.669
pops on down to Utnapishtim's boat and

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.000
touches him on the forehead to make him

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
touches him on the forehead to make him
immortal.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I guess it all works out in the end for Utnapishtim.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.500
You know they say:
All's Well that Ends Well

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200
-or doesn't end at all, ever,
because it's immortal.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.910
So, this all probably sounds familiar to those of you
who know the flood story from the Bible.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.200
I don't remember Noah having room for every piece of gold and silver alongside all those animals, but

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.200
both stories have angry divinities who order

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.200
a chosen person person to build a big boat, and fill it with wildlife.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.800
Then, birds are sent to find land after the boat gets stuck on a mountain.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.200
There are a number of important differences though, too.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.000
First of all, the reason the Babylonian gods decided to destroy humanity is..

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.200
well, its unclear.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.900
well, its unclear.
in one version it's because

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
humans are making too much noise which,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.500
humans are making too much noise which,
okay,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.000
humans are making too much noise which,
okay, fair,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
humans are making too much noise which,
okay, fair, 
Keep it down you kids!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Don't make me send a..

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.800
Don't make me send a.. 
deluge..

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800
Don't make me send a.. 
deluge.. down there

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.100
Don't make me send a..
deluge.. down there and literally destroy you.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.800
In the Old Testament the flood is punishment for mankind's sinfulness.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.000
As the book tells it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.100
"God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth,"

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
"and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.800
"and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually."

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.100
"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.100
"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the Earth,
and it grieved him at his heart."

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.200
"And the Lord said,"

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.200
"I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth;"

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.700
both man,

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.000
both man, and beast,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.100
both man, and beast,
and creeping things,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.500
and the fowls of the air,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.000
for it repenteth me that I have made them.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Which,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.800
Which, I mean, man!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.200
Which, I mean, man!
I don't LOVE the creeping things, but...

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.000
I don't want them DESTROYED,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I don't want them DESTROYED, 
What about Anansi?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.600
Yahweh commands Noah to build a boat,
like Ea did with Utnapishtim, but

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
Yahwah gives Noah even more detailed instructions.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.000
He's also less efficient when it comes to the rainstorm.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.800
It takes Yahweh 40 days to do what the Babylonian gods did in seven!

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.400
Then again, those Babylonians were working as a team.

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:02.800
Like the Sumerian myth, Noah celebrates his survival with a sacrifice.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.800
This seems to make Yahweh feel both relieved and...

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.500
sorry..

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.200
sorry.. for

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.000
sorry.. for destroying the world.

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:13.100
He says, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake;

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.800
for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.000
neither will I again smite anymore every living thing

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.100
neither will I again smite anymore every living thing
as I have done."

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.249
Whoops, again!

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.500
Yahweh doesn't make Noah immortal,
like Utnapishtim, but--

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.000
--he does promise Noah that he and his sons will
replenish the Earth,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.800
and he gives them all the living things of the Earth for food,

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.500
along with some rules for how they should be eaten;

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.200
which,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.200
which, I mean, that's got
to be pretty disappointing for those animals,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.800
which, I mean, that's got
to be pretty disappointing for those animals, right?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Like, "YAY! We survived the floo-

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.949
Like, "YAY! We survived the floo-
you're gonne do WHAT?!?"

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.000
Most important, at least for this episode,
is that Yahweh establishes a covenant with Noah

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.689
and promises that he will never
have another flood destroy the Earth again.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.000
Somewhere in-between the
inscrutable Babylonian flood,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.900
Somewhere in-between the
inscrutable Babylonian flood,
and the sin-cleansing biblical flood,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.000
is the Zoroastrian flood.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.200
This is a myth that comes to us from ancient Iran.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200
It also features a lone survivor, named Yima,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.000
who gathers two of each species to repopulate the Earth.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but, rather than building a boat,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.100
Yima gathers the animals in his mountain-castle,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.000
which is high enough to survive the rising floodwaters.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.700
The creator God, Ahura Mazda, decides that the Earth needs a new beginning--not because of sin,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.000
but because its
overwhelmed by the constant multiplication of its immortal beings.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.100
This suggests that, prior to the flood,
Earth's inhabitants were immortal.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.100
And it's only after this cleansing that we
have a world in which..

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.940
stuff dies.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.800
In yet another flood myth, this one from Ovid's "Metamorphoses,"

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.000
Jupiter decides to destroy mortals for their sinfulness.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.800
Jupiter seems to be worried that humans might contaminate other Earthly beings.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.300
which,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.900
which, I mean,

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.400
which, I mean, yeah,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.000
Same!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.200
The gods don't all agree with Jupiter,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200
but they assent to his decision because..

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.580
but they assent to his decision because.. 
he's the boss.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.820
They're sad because they'll miss all the
delicious sacrifices that humans gave them,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.200
but they agree that a flood is better than a fire,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.000
because fires can get out of control,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.900
and then reach up to Olympus.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.100
Gods, only YOU can prevent heaven fires!

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.100
so Jupiter gets together with Neptune,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.100
who pumps up the rivers, and whips up some high winds, and..

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.090
flood!

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.630
There's no chosen survivors for Jupiter,
he's trying to just wipe the slate clean.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.800
But, luckily for Humanity, two people:

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
Deucalion

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Deucalion and Pyrrha

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.100
Deucalion and Pyrrha
are fortunate enough to survive and so.. life carries on.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.160
Jupiter obviously notices that these two

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.900
dodged his wrath but he's so impressed with Deucalion and Pyrrha's piety..

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.900
..that he spares them.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.500
Like Utnapishtim and Noah, they give thanks in prayer,

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.900
--and, like Noah, they're tasked with
repopulating the world.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
They do that by throwing stones over their shoulders,
which become more humans.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And that, kids,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And that, kids,
is how babies are made!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.900
And that, kids,
is how babies are made.
--no follow-up questions!

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.200
Today we learned that gods in the ancient Mediterranean world seemed...

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.500
...highly ambivalent about their creations,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.200
--especially humans,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.000
but ESPECIALLY creeping things.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.300
But, also, there's enough similarity in these myths to suggest that..

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.300
..they may have influenced one another,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.900
and that seems likely given the
amount of cultural transmission in the region.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.130
And we also learned that a good
way to survive a flood is to be

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.900
reasonably righteous.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.000
That helps Deucalion and Pyrrha, Noah and Yima but..

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.300
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.100
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity
is to..

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.310
maybe the best way to survive the destruction of humanity
is to.. listen to the gods.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.850
Especially when they give you detailed
instructions on how to build a boat.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.100
Sometimes life, like a flood,
is unpredictable and frightening.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.700
So..

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.000
It makes sense for us to look for meaning in tragedy wherever we can find it.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.100
And one way we can find meaning is to tell a story..

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.500
..and then to change into some dry clothes.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.000
