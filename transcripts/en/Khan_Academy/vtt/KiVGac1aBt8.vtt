00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.620
Shares of stock represent
how much of a company

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.110
a person owns?

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.120
Puff Incorporated is owned
by Peter, Paul, and Mary.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.570
Peter owns 4,050 shares,
Paul owns 2,510 shares,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.930
And Mary owns 42
hundred or 4,200 shares.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.250
Suppose the company made a
profit this year of $1,500,000.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.370
If each shareholder gets a
proportion of the total profit

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.920
that is equal to the proportion
of the share they own,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.220
how much money
does Mary receive?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.060
So first, let's think about
what fraction or what percentage

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.260
or what proportion of the total
profit should Mary receive?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.220
So Mary owns 4,200 shares.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.390
And how many total shares
are there in the company?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.120
Well, the only owners
of this company

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.236
are Peter, Paul, and Mary.

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:02.610
So the total number
of shares are

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.900
the sum of Peter, Paul,
and Mary's shares.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:14.530
So we know that Peter
owns 4,050 shares.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.100
We know that Paul owns 2,510.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.339
And of course, we know
that Mary owns 4,200.

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:28.130
So let's figure it.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.990
This is the fraction
of the profit

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.390
that Mary should be getting.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.780
So let's figure out
this with a calculator.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.860
So this is going
to be 4,200 divided

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:56.080
by 4,050 plus 2,510 plus 4,200.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.794
And so Mary should get
0.39 of the profit.

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:02.710
Or if we talk about it
in terms of percentage,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.890
it would be 39% of the profit.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.602
So this right over
here is 0.390.

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:11.310
Actually, let me just
leave it like that.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:20.070
So this is approximately
equal to 0.39.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.920
And so if we want to figure
out how much profit she gets,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.650
she gets this much
times the total profit.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.954
So Mary gets 0.39, and
this is the exact quantity

00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:36.620
right over here.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.360
0.39 is the approximation,
so approximately 0.39.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.280
This little squiggly equal sign
is how I say approximately.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.850
She's going to get 0.39
times the total profit, which

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.655
is $1,500,000.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:57.220
And so let's go back
to our calculator.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.940
And so we said
approximately 0.39.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.570
This is the exact value.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.270
I can get that
exact value again,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.210
at least on this calculator,
by saying Second Answer.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.620
This literally means
the previous answer.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.170
So this is literally this number
right over here-- 0.390334

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.720
whatever.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.465
So this is the exact
quantity times $1,500,000.

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:20.280
One, two, three, there we go.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.530
There's $1,500,000.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.160
I've got to make sure I have
the right number zeroes there.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.980
And that gets us
$585,50- and we need

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.990
to round to the nearest
penny-- and $0.86.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.980
So let me put that someplace
where I can see it.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:55.730
So this is going to be equal
to $585,501 and, if we round,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.040
$0.86.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.460
So not bad for
one year for Mary.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.260
She should be able to live
quite well just on her dividends

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.139
from Puff Incorporated.
