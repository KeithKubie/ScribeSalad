00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.496
&gt;&gt;Sometimes, y'all when we're
researching we find out things

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:14.566
that we think we knew already
might not be exactly true.

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:15.596
Is that okay?

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:15.976
Yes.

00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:19.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The teaching team at
Forrest Lake is a tight knit group.

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:22.636
Many of them have worked together
for several years collaborating

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:25.806
to improve their teaching
skills and supporting each other

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.546
as they embrace rapidly
evolving technology.

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:30.936
&gt;&gt;All right, we need
to look at home life.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:33.396
&gt;&gt;How they travel in transportation.

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:34.856
Transportation.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every other
week grade-level teams meet

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:41.736
in what they call "Collaborative
Corner" to discuss challenges

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:45.026
and plan interdisciplinary
lessons together.

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:48.186
With the support of
Instructional Technology Specialist,

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:49.146
Paulette Williams.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.086
&gt;&gt;Because we have plenty
of resources on everything.

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:53.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Media specialist,
Lizzie Padget.

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:56.086
&gt;&gt;Do you like having the
taste of the countries

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:58.006
with everybody in a different room?

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And Curriculum
Coordinator, Marian Scullion.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.746
&gt;&gt;The student will
demonstrate an understanding

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.446
of other settings across the world.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.976
So if we journey through
other places of the world.

00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:07.776
&gt;&gt;We've used a number of
different models over the years

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.346
for staff development and training.

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:14.676
At this point in our process we use
a collaborative meeting every other

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:19.306
week and that is a very
honored treasured time.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:20.916
You don't miss your collaborative.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.966
Professionally speaking,
everyone expects you to be there

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.946
and it's a meeting that you don't
want to miss because it's a meeting

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:32.296
where you kind of massage your
unit plan to be better and better.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.516
&gt;&gt;We can take an inventory of things
that they want to specifically learn

00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:37.316
about that country and
not necessarily narrow it.

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:39.016
&gt;&gt;We're doing graphing in math.

00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:40.976
So that will be a great
way to tie in.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.486
&gt;&gt;Lizzie: The collaborative
process allows us

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:45.606
to spread the wealth and team teach.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.476
Teachers come down to
Collaborative Corner.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:49.616
We feed them.

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:51.116
You know, that's a very
important part of it.

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:54.136
We get, we soften them up a
little bit with some chocolate and

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:59.046
but we just give them a time to talk
first and then we take the standards

00:01:59.046 --> 00:02:02.936
that they are teaching and
we put together what kind

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.976
of project is going
to be a part of that?

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.536
What's going to be your
pre-assessment piece?

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:11.246
What strategies are you using
to get the objectives across?

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:15.966
&gt;&gt;At first place in a light, was this
experiencing a day in the life of?

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.256
&gt;&gt;We're not asking them to
do all this by themselves.

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:20.986
We're saying what part can I play?

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.866
What can I do to make this
work smoothly for you?

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:28.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Principal Kappy Cannon
drops in on classes frequently

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.936
to make observations she later
shares with the teachers.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.736
&gt;&gt;Kappy: We have created
our own walk-through form

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:38.686
which is an observation, it's not
an evaluation, and we call that our

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:40.716
"failure is not an option" form.

00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:45.116
What we did was we tried to think of
all the things that we have worked

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:46.506
on in the past few years.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:49.536
Maybe we've gone to a workshop,
it might be professional reading

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.686
that we have done,
conversations, staff development,

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.916
collectively put it all together
to make sure that bottom line

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.746
that we're doing what
we say that we're doing

00:02:59.286 --> 00:03:01.386
and to stay focused
and to stay on track.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:03.956
&gt;&gt;And you like spending
that time with him?

00:03:04.196 --> 00:03:07.956
&gt;&gt;We also have times during the years
where all of the teachers will go

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:08.966
in each other's classroom.

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:13.866
And again it's a nonthreatening
type of process and you can get just

00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:16.396
that one snapshot of going
in someone else's room

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.456
and seeing how they have taken
some of the same information

00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:22.296
that you have been given and
they're using it in a different way.

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:23.806
&gt;&gt;Let me give you a
round of applause.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:28.286
&gt;&gt;I've started giving a lot of online
and computerized testing and I wanted

00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:30.946
to know how would I
show those grades.

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:32.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers who
are new to the profession

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:34.486
or the school are well supported.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:37.996
Once a month they gather in the
media center with teacher leaders

00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:41.196
to discuss their successes
and their concerns.

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:45.186
&gt;&gt;Coke and Conversation gives
us a springboard for discussion

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:48.476
about maybe things related
to reading, things related

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:51.146
to technology, things related
to behavior management.

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:55.086
&gt;&gt;Maybe we want to discuss some tips
for how to motivate those children

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:58.526
that are not quite where they,
we'd like them to be for that.

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.786
&gt;&gt;And it's not a scary time for them

00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:05.396
because all these other people are
new as well so it's just a safe haven

00:04:05.476 --> 00:04:10.456
for new people, newbies, to have
this time to brainstorm together.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.246
&gt;&gt;Katie and I were
looking at Google Lit Trips

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:16.976
and it's a really neat tool
for you to pick a book.

00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:19.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At a monthly staff
meeting teachers share their latest

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.586
tech discoveries with
their colleagues.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.926
&gt;&gt;And each one is really convenient
because it gives you an overview

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.966
of the book itself right here.

00:04:28.046 --> 00:04:31.446
&gt;&gt;I think that's one thing that
makes this school special is the

00:04:31.446 --> 00:04:32.456
collaborative spirit.

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:34.376
It's a part of everything that we do.

00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:39.886
And we like each other, you know?

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:41.656
&gt;&gt;Have a great afternoon.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:41.976
Thank you.
