You know, Chelsea, I bet our students are very

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.810
curious about what this device is that you're wearing.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.620
&gt;&gt; An external fixator, that's what it's called?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.520
&gt;&gt; That's correct. Yeah. It's kind of hard to miss. When I was a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.610
kid, I injured the growth plate in my arm. And as a result, my

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.300
humerus stopped growing. So I was missing two and a half inches of bone.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.070
And recently I had what's called limb

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.405
lengthening surgery. Which involved an orthopedic surgeon

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:32.159
re-breaking my humorous. I know, it sounds awful. Attaching this device, and

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.980
then ever so slightly over the course of several months, I would make

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.510
adjustments to the device. Which would spread apart the bone and as

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.140
it healed it, just filled in that missing two and a half inches.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.530
&gt;&gt; So, you have to make adjustments to this.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.280
&gt;&gt; And you know, one of the things we talk

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.530
about is that whenever a design has to have external labels.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.360
Somebody has to put on special labels. That's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.600
a sign of poor design. And I see there

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.720
are several labels you have, and what makes them

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.000
even worse is that. You can't even see them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.290
&gt;&gt; I can't. So making adjustments is a very intimidating process. If I do

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.450
it wrong there can be serious consequences, so I asked my doctor to help me

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.320
out by adding these labels, but when I left his office I realized, oh,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.870
I can't see the labels. So, yeah, I sit in front of a mirror and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.280
look at the them, just to remind me

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.740
which direction and which bolts I need to adjust.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.160
&gt;&gt; So you have to take a hex wrench and put it in here.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.620
&gt;&gt; I do, in this tiny little hole. And you can't see it as you do that.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.930
&gt;&gt; I can't. Yep. And some of the holes are so

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.120
close together that I can put the wrench in the wrong one.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.770
&gt;&gt; So, you know, this is a good example of some of the design

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.020
challenges we face in the real world. On the one hand you'd say, well, why isn't

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.160
that design so much easier for the patient than

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.950
the physician? On the other hand, you know, if

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.590
you're making a million devices, it's fairly easy to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.290
spend a lot of time and effort to make

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.780
it easy for the people who use it. But I don't know how many of these are made.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.830
Not very many. And probably each one has to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.370
be specially tailerod for the patient. For your particular problem.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.620
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.020
&gt;&gt; And so, there probably, there's no easy way to fix it.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.610
I, in fact, I though about it and I don't come up

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.270
with an easy solution to make it easy for all the people involved.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.120
External fixator is strange name. This would be an interesting challenge

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.450
for you, think about it. If you want to learn more about this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.080
particular device, go to the instructor's note, it will tell you how

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.080
to get to the website to the company that makes these parts.
