00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.920
The graph of a function
f is shown below.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.290
If both the limit of f of x
as x approaches k and f of k

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.280
exist, and f is not
continuous at k, then

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.040
what is the value of k?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.950
So we have to find a k where
f is not continuous at k,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.990
but f of k is defined.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.330
And the limit as x approaches
k of f of x is also defined.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.000
So the easiest ones to
spot out just with our eyes

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.420
might just to be to see
where f is not continuous,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.250
where f is not continuous.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.820
So you see here when x
is equal to negative 2,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.400
the function is not continuous.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.740
It jumps from up here.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.230
It looks like it's
approaching 3.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.790
And then it jumps
down to negative 3.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.670
So this is one of
our candidates.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.930
This is one of our
candidates for k.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.321
The other discontinuity
happens when x is equal to 3.

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.570
Once again, we jump down
from-- looks like 4 and a 1/2

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.120
all the way to negative 4.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.850
So that's another candidate.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.650
That's a point where
f is not continuous.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.620
And then we have when x is
equal to 8, we have this.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.870
As we approach this, it looks
like we're getting to 1.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.120
But then we jump
right at x equals 8.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.640
And then we continue
from 1 again.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.305
So this is our other candidate.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.680
So these are the
three candidates

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.990
where the function
is not continuous.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.840
Now let's think about
which of these points,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.060
which of these x values,
does f of k exist.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.100
So if one of these is
k, does f of k exist?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.360
Well f of negative 2 exists.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.780
f of 3 exists, right over here.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.740
That's f of 3.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.290
This is f of negative 2.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.130
And f of 8, all exist.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.430
So all of these potential k's
meet this constraint-- f of k

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.420
exists, and f is
not continuous at k.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.640
So that's true for x
equals 8, 3, or negative 2.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.930
Now let's look at
this first constraint.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.010
The limit of f of x as x
approaches k needs to exist.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.350
Well, if we tried to look at
x equals 2, the limit of f

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.920
of x as x approaches
negative 2-- not 2,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160
as x approaches
negative 2 here--

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.230
the limit from the left,
the limit from values

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.380
lower than negative 2, it
looks like our function

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.545
is approaching something
a little higher.

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:17.587
It looks like it's a
little higher than 3.

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:19.170
And the limit from
the right, it looks

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.030
like our function is
approaching negative 3.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.910
So this one, the
limit does not exist.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.750
You get a different limit from
the left and from the right.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.580
Same thing for x
equals positive 3.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.510
The limit from the
left seems like it's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.110
approaching 4 and 1/2, while
the limit from the right

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.050
looks like it's
approaching negative 4.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.070
So this is also not a candidate.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.390
So we only have one left.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.970
So for this one, the
limit should exist.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.820
And we see the limit as
f of x as x approaches 8

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.210
from the negative
direction, it looks

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.020
like f of x is approaching 1.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.800
And it looks like,
as we approach 8

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.560
from the positive
direction, the limit of f

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.060
of x as x approaches 8 from
the positive direction.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.410
It's also equal to 1.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.350
So your left- and your
right-sided limits

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.810
approach the same value.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.390
So the limit of f of x as x
approaches 8 is equal to 1.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.930
This limit exists.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.870
Now, the reason why the
function isn't continuous there

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.680
is that the limit of
f of x as x approaches

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.170
8, which is equal to 1, it does
not equal the value of f of 8.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.130
f of 8, we're seeing,
is equal to 7.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.380
So that's why it meets
the last constraint.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.520
The function is not
continuous there.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.420
The function exists.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.100
It's defined, f of
8 is equal to 7.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.620
And the limit exists.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.370
But the limit of f of
x as x approaches k

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.460
is not the same thing,
or is not the same

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.990
as the value of the function
evaluated at that point.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.960
And so x equals 8 meets
all of our constraints.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.060
So we could say k is equal to 8.
