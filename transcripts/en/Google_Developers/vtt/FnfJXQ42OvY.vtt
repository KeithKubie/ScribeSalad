00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:06.630
SPEAKER 1: Hello.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm here with Shams, who is the
technical writer for Flutter

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.630
and the chief plushy officer.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.749
Tell me, what are
the responsibilities

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:14.915
of the Chief Plushy Officer?

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:16.070
And how'd you get that title?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.380
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: It was given
to me by another colleague.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.430
I had some designs
for the mascot.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.520
And I found a
company to make them.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.880
And then we were making them
for Dart Conf 2018 in January.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.390
I named her Dash because that
was the first code, the project

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.031
name for Dart.

00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:38.030
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.863
And I think you have
some Dashes to show us.

00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:40.850
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: I do.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.920
Here is the first Dash.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.200
And you can see she's got
some sort of turquoise,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.140
light turquoise here and here.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.520
After she was made, there were
tweaks to the Flutter logo,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.220
where it was brought more in
line with material design.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.740
And so the turquoise went away.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.870
And so our second run has blue,
like a darker blue substituted

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.850
for the light color.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.070
But is otherwise
essentially the same.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.200
And then, I was requested
to make some puppets.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.520
So I did.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.490
I made a puppet.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.260
Everything's a widget, you know?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.010
So--

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.810
SPEAKER 1: Why is Dash a bird?

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.470
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: Oh, an early
O'Reilly book about Dart

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.260
on the cover had a hummingbird.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.110
And it was a very angular,
spiky hummingbird.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.390
But when the design company
that designed the Dart Conf

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710
website for us, they made
this fat, round bird.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.800
So also, I've had
Dash socks made.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.300
And--

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.160
SPEAKER 1: Those are adorable.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.010
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: And I've
had Dash fabrics made.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.820
So here I have a chiffon I
plan to make into a scarf.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.780
And then here I have
some knitted fabric

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.750
that I was going to make into
a top to wear at Flutter Live.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.710
But people have suggested
that it should be

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.050
like a onesie, an adult onesie.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.050
So I don't know.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.910
I'll have to think about that.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.410
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you so much, Shams.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.280
It's been great
talking with you.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.196
SHAMS ZAKHOUR: Thanks.

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:20.470
It's been fun
talking with you too.
