ANTHONY RIBOT: Good
afternoon, Berlin.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.270
Let's get stuck into things.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.420
A bat and ball cost $1.10.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.510
The bat costs $1
more than the ball.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.980
How much does the ball cost?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.880
Have a little think.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.380
Ready?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.350
Who got this answer?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.480
Hands up, please.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.010
Great.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.030
You got one of two
possible answers.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.860
What you, though, got was
the cognitive miser answer,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760
the one that used a
shortcut in the brain.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.530
This actually isn't
the real answer.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.190
The real answer is $0.05.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.890
And if you look at the
graphic on that side,

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.760
it really does add up to $0.05.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.710
So that's one example of us
thinking that we're rational

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.780
but actually acting
irrationally.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.640
The reason behind
the cognitive miser

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.730
is that your brain is actually
trying to save mental energy.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.450
The brain is an amazing
thing, and we actually

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.730
make, on average, 35,000
decisions in a day.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.140
But that mental energy
is a finite resource,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.630
and we suffer, over
the day, something

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.110
called decision fatigue.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.990
So by the end of
it, it's almost as

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.012
if we're drunk when
we're making decisions.

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:24.970
But that's just the tip
of the iceberg, really.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.590
Why are we all here today,
and why am I speaking up here?

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.850
Well, biases are really,
really important to us

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.900
because we're all here to
create apps and experiences that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.180
really offer long-term
relationships

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.200
with the customers.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.230
We're all aiming for high
engagement and a high perceived

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.470
value from customers
for our products.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.580
But we can use biases in a
positive way, and a guiding

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.750
light, and a
simplification process

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.130
to guide them through the
journey of our app in a really

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.320
nice and simple way.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.710
Two scenarios.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.720
Which would you prefer?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.170
The number involved above is
number of monthly active users

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.550
in your app.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.340
I think we'd all agree
that we'd rather 3 million

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.442
rather than 800,000.

00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:26.660
But let's add one
data point to that--

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.000
engagement.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720
Scenario 1 now has
low engagement,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.900
but scenario 2 has got high.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.700
And by engagement,
I'm defining that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.480
as the percentage of people
completing your core action.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040
A core action,
for example, would

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.835
be posting a tweet on
Twitter, pinning an item

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:44.950
on a board on Pinterest.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.330
So actually, which of
the two would you rather?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.820
I'd highly and strongly
suggest that we actually

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.310
focus on the 800,000
and the high engagement.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.160
The 3 million is really
just a vanity metric.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.380
Let's go six months
into the future.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.720
And now we've seen how
focusing on high engagement--

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.790
that's leading to
higher retention.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.400
You've been able to build
up the monthly active users

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.330
to 5 million.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.690
And so that's with using
these little nudges,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.090
these little biases,
these guiding lights

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.810
to help your customers along
the journeys within the apps

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.100
that you've built.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.560
Having been in this
business for a long time,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.900
there's a few questions we
ask ourselves when we're

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.570
designing and building apps--

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.040
simple questions, really.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.690
Is it clear what the app does?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.630
In that first five or
10-second experience

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.550
for the customer,
really, how are you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.020
getting the value across?

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.090
Are you providing that hook?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.710
In terms of value as well,
generally, to create value,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.780
you either save people
time, save people money,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.190
or enhance an
experience, or it's

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.470
a combination of the three.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.580
So think about how
you're actually creating

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.380
value for the customer.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.180
And also, going back
to that core action,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.970
try and design that whole
experience of your app

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.300
around that specific,
simple core action

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.970
and use those biases to
help them along the way

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.950
to complete that core action.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.720
Also, along that
journey, how can you

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.170
provide a sense of progress
to make them feel like they're

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.693
progressing to the end goal?

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.510
We live in a very noisy world.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.410
We've got push notifications,
social messages, adverts,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.100
emails, phone calls all from
all sorts of different devices.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.290
We live in an age
of distraction.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.210
With that in mind,
it's never been

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.630
more important to
consider a few things--

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.134
specifically, context
and past behavior

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:51.550
when you're thinking
about sending

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.970
triggers out to your customers.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.990
Even better, there
are now SDKs available

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.190
that allow you to look at
the past behavior, the habits

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.700
and the lifestyle of your
users, and predict when is best

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.910
to send out those push
notifications as used

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.880
by [INAUDIBLE]
using the newer SDK.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.680
It's amazing the kinds of
tools that we've got access to.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.110
Also worth considering
are other tools,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.240
like the Google
Awareness API, which

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
can provide a sense of
context to your app in terms

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.690
of what state the user is in.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.620
Are they driving?

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.640
Are they walking?

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.380
Do they have their
headphones plugged in?

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.440
These little nuances to how
and when you're pushing out

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.640
triggers really have a
long-term positive effect

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.600
on your retention
and engagement.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.740
The power of defaults--

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.430
this is often overlooked,
but hugely, hugely useful

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.190
to simplifying the
customer's experience.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.180
Here we've got a top-up wheel
for a mobile coffee loyalty

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.170
app.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.060
There are seven segments.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.320
Now, the numbers in
green, which one of those

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.530
do you think we should
place in the default

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.010
highlighted segment
in the wheel?

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.490
And you-- again,
give me a shout.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.950
10?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.510
30?

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.010
OK.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.030
We've got some
smart people here.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.180
So 30 is correct.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.480
We chose 30 as the
default here because it

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.640
was in the middle of the range.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.740
And the end result of that was
that the average top-up value

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.706
was roughly around
20 pounds here,

00:06:37.706 --> 00:06:39.580
where originally, the
business thought it was

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.070
going to be around 10 pounds.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.050
Now, with all these biases
and guiding lights and nudges,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.470
it's great to
integrate into an app.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.320
But it really does have a
positive long-term effect.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.550
And this was the case with this
specific app that 50% of orders

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.290
were coming from the app
for a certain source.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.760
And that compares to the market
leader in the coffee space

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.790
having an average of 21% of
orders coming from the app.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.040
So these little
nudges really help.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.730
I think a huge number of us have
heard of the classic jam jar

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.910
experiment whereby 24 jams
compared to six jams--

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.100
the 3% of the people
who are shown 24 jams

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:35.540
buy a jam compared to 40% of
people who buy one of the six.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.850
So that's called the
paradox of choice.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.450
And this applied to
many who design here.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.570
I start off with
showing 50 options.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.250
So you've got every
option under the sun

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.750
on the starting screen--

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.550
obviously, far too many.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.460
You're introducing cognitive
load into the experience.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.860
You're making the
user work too hard.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.100
So let's just apply some
common sense to that list,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.170
and we end up with
the second screen--

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.876
10 options.

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.250
This is still a
[INAUDIBLE] list,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.720
but we can do so much
more for the customer.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.260
The ideal could
be just one user--

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.580
one option-- the smart,
the perfect option,

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.840
the perfect option that takes
into account the context.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.530
That's true, but it's also worth
considering the last screen

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.680
on the far-hand side of
providing three options.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.750
Why would you want to
write three options?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.840
To give a sense of
choice to your customer,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.130
to allow them to control their
journey through your app.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.539
All these behavioral
biases are really

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.809
stemming from the last
60 years of research

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.850
in behavioral science.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.610
But new concepts and
theories are coming out

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.630
on a weekly basis.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.500
There's a problem, though,
in that they're really

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.670
largely very dry, very academic,
maths-ridden sometimes,

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.530
actually hard to get hold
of, and fundamentally, also,

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.070
not very practical in
their original form.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.250
So we discovered this particular
problem two or three years ago

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.940
and decided to create a little
micro-site called cogload.com

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.510
which basically is
a collection of all

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.570
these lovely behavioral
biases pulled together

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.230
into one location,
but redesigned

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.280
and rewritten so that it's in
a format that's digestible,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.730
understandable, and
also practical to us

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.040
who are the designers
and developers of today's

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.760
products and the future.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.580
So cogload.com, and I might have
something to give out later on.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.840
Will all this
speak about biases,

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.590
how best do you integrate
this thinking into the way

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.890
that you're designing
and building your apps?

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.100
One of the methods
that we've got is--

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.140
we call it the cog
load focus method.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.110
We have biases, and on
a whole stack of cards,

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.940
we put it all out in the table.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.730
And collectively,
within the team,

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.670
we look at what's
most applicable

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.040
to that particular
scenario, to that brand.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.310
And we make sure that everyone
understands the biases.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.580
Then you go off in your
individual little corners

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.110
of the room and brainstorm ideas
around how to best integrate

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.330
that bias into the
experience for the benefit

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.300
of the customer.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.410
Also, it's worth keeping
in mind the values

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.337
of the client or the product,
the strategy that you've got,

00:10:31.337 --> 00:10:33.170
and also think about
the emotion that you're

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:38.820
looking to evoke by someone
using your tool or app.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.020
Then come back together, present
your best idea to the team,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.810
but think about
the actual problem

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.070
that you're looking to tackle.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.930
Present the idea, how it
aligns with the brand.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.050
Present also the
assumptions and risks

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.250
you think are involved
in that and how

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.005
are you going make
that minimal test,

00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.630
and who's going to
be involved in that.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.620
The Memrise app, one of my most
favorite apps in the world.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.960
And I just wanted
to take a moment

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.620
to focus you in
on to the very top

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.660
of the screen, the green area.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.690
This is the first time this
screen has been shown to me,

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.430
the user, the first-time user.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.860
But there's two ticks here.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.730
This is what's called the
endowed progress effect.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.490
And it's a feeling that you've
already made a great start,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.320
so you're more likely to
progress to that end goal,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.570
completing that line,
developing a positive behavior.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.050
And it all stems from research
originally done in the US

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.570
for a car wash who trialed
two different loyalty cards.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.230
The first loyalty
card had eight stamps.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.330
The second loyalty
card had 10 stamps,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.280
but two were pre-filled.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.960
Which was the loyalty card
that performed the best?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.190
It was the one that had
the two pre-filled stamps.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.070
That was the card that was
completed the most often,

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.080
that was complete
the quickest, and had

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.640
the most loyal customers.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.810
Another lovely graphic here--

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.320
the Harvard Business
Review Pyramid.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.450
Now, two things to
take from this slide.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.940
Try and involve as many of
these points in this pyramid as

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.090
possible in your app.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.940
And what you will then
create is customer loyalty

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.750
and high engagement.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.680
One other thing from this
pyramid is emotion again.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.740
It's really important to
just ask this simple question

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.720
when you're designing
and building your app.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.300
What emotion am I
looking to evoke?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.060
It might simply be a smile.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.090
It might be some
stage past emotion,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.410
like salivation, which
is an amusing one.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.210
But it's a very simple
question, and it

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.390
acts as a really lovely,
simple guiding light

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.480
to making sure that the
value you're creating

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.720
is high enough and
beneficial to the customer.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.310
Now, this is an app that I
hope you've all got installed

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.980
already on your devices--

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.690
Playbook for Developers,
which is a goldmine of nuggets

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:17.200
for anyone building businesses
on top of Google Platforms.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.010
And I just wanted to showcase
two particular biases that

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.500
are integrated into the app.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.660
You've got the sunk
cost effect, which

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.250
is as you spend more time
investing within a tool

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.690
or product, you're far
less likely to leave.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.460
And so over the days or months
that you're using the Playbook

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.990
app, you're personalizing
it, so then you're

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.290
getting a more
personalized feed,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.400
and again, less likely to leave.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.080
Then there's the humor effect.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.330
It's not really
connected to a feature,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.670
but it's used to really create
a more lasting memory, which

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.150
helps with retention.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.960
So we always want to get
darting androids into our apps.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.070
As I also mentioned before,
it's not always about features.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.060
Think about also the low
moments in an app's experience--

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.600
when the network
fails, when there's

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.370
an internal error within
the app, when you're

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.740
in that first default state
where you don't have any

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.880
saved items.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.500
How can you use these design
nudges in a positive way

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.720
to turn what actually might
feel initially quite negative,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.630
soften that, and maybe
you can even turn that

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.910
into a positive experience,
and maybe make someone

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.610
smile by showing a cute robot?

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.950
The last case study I
wanted to highlight today

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.940
is the M. Gemi app, which
is an app that sells shoes.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.870
And the really interesting bias
that they've integrated here

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.870
is that of limited availability.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.850
So they have this
notion of editions

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.590
that they release
every single week.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.287
But within those
editions, there's

00:15:00.287 --> 00:15:02.870
a certain number of shoes-- so
limited availability, actually,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.770
on the shoes.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.390
And then there's
a limited window

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.060
of 12 weeks for each shoe.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.310
So the result of all
that-- they ended up

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:18.210
having the highest converting
sales channel on mobile.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.940
That was their
highest-converting sales

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.910
channel, and it was four to five
times the industry standards

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.930
of conversions of push.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.002
So these things really do
work and are very, very useful

00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.210
for both customer and client.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.350
All this said-- like I've said
before, with biases come power.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.690
They can be used
for negative effect,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.430
but it's not the
time to use that.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.610
Really, for creating long-term
engagement, retention,

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.880
the customer has to be right
at the heart of it all.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.500
And you can use the pulse
devices in so many ways

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.365
to create that positive
emotion for the customer.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.600
So always end on a
peak end rule bias,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.060
which creates a
longer-lasting memory.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.590
Find me at the break.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:19.850
I've got a limited number of
special things to give out.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.760
So limited availability
bias there.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.130
Also, human bias creates
a longer-lasting memory.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.380
Merci, danke, thank you.
