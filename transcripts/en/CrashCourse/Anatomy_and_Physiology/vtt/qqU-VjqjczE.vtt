00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Consider your heart for a moment.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.110
For the average person -- at rest, like you
probably are, sitting there watching me -- the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.160
heart beats at around 60 beats per minute.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.160
Once a second. Nice and easy.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.840
But if you were to somehow disconnect your
heart from your autonomic nervous system,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.820
things, as you might imagine, would change.

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.489
But, your heart would not stop. Actually,
it would be the opposite.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.480
It would speed up.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.990
It would start beating at around 100 beats
per minute -- and that’s just at rest.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.970
With your heart beating two-thirds faster
than normal, before you even broke a sweat,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.810
your cardiac muscle would experience a lot
of extra wear and tear. The surrounding blood

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.720
vessels would be under enormous pressure.
And your body would suddenly require -- and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.200
waste -- a lot of energy.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.500
Basically, you’d be out of balance.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.270
Part of what keeps your heart under control
is your parasympathetic nervous system.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.550
It’s often described as the calming side
of your autonomic system -- a kind of antidote

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.770
to the effects of stress created by the sympathetic
system.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.160
But it’s really much more than that.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.670
Unlike your sympathetic division, which lets
you deal with the crisis of the now, the parasympathetic

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.020
system allows your body to handle … everything
else.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.760
It not only calms you down after being stressed
out, it’s what allows you to digest food,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.820
to reproduce, to excrete waste, to fight off
infections.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.720
Basically, it lets you do the business of
living.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.670
But our bodies can only do that when they
are in balance, somewhere between excitement

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.940
and inhibition, both aroused enough and calm
enough to keep things working.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.740
So the parasympathetic system is why our hearts
don’t pump so hard that they explode, sure.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.780
But it also explains a lot of other stuff
about our bodies.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210
Oh, but just one thing?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.780
Learning about the parasympathetic system
is going to involve a lot of memorizing.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.260
Hope that doesn’t stress you out.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.280
You will recall that our sympathetic &amp; parasympathetic
systems not only have different functions

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.040
-- more or less engaging the same organs to opposite
effects -- they also have different structures.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.920
Their ganglia, for example, are located in
different places: The sympathetic ganglia

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.680
are located near the spinal cord, while on the
parasympathetic side, they’re close to the effectors.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.280
And likewise, the use of neurotransmitters in the
two systems is similar, but not quite the same.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.560
In both systems, neurons release acetylcholine,
or ACh, in their preganglionic synapses.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.030
But in your parasympathetic system, the postganglionic
neurons release ACh at their synapses with

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.420
the effector organs, too...

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.599
...as opposed to in the sympathetic system,
where effectors get a dose of norepinephrine instead.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.420
But the biggest anatomical difference between
these two systems has to do with the physical

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.680
networks that they form as they reach throughout
your body.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.940
While the sympathetic nerves all spring from
the thoracolumbar area of your spinal cord,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.580
right around your midsection, the nerves of
the parasympathetic division are craniosacral.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.640
And with the exception of a couple of sacral
nerves near the tailbone that run to the bladder

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.069
and genitals and rectum, most of these nerves
never go through the spinal cord.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.940
Instead, they run right from the brain almost
all the way to their effectors.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.780
There are 12 of these cranial nerves, and they vary
in terms of what kinds of neurons they contain.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.980
I mean, we’re talking about the autonomic system
here, but they are not all autonomic motor fibers.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.290
Some of your cranial nerves also carry motor
fibers that control voluntary functions, like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.739
moving your eyeballs around.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.959
And others carry only sensory fibers, which
relay data to and from your sensory organs.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.019
And, you know, just to keep things interesting,
some of your cranial nerves carry both motor

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.459
and sensory neurons.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.439
So, which ones are where? And what exactly
does each one of these 12 nerves do?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.440
As anatomists, we have to keep track of the
human wiring-diagram that are cranial nerves,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.260
because you don’t want to end up like some
sidekick in a ‘90s action movie who has

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.890
to defuse a bomb all by himself.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.780
SHOULD I CUT THE RED WIRE OR THE BLACK WIRE?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.379
Honestly, though, if you find yourself inside
of somebody’s brain stem you probably shouldn’t

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.700
be cutting anything.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.920
Since all 12 of these cranial nerves are important,
you’re gonna have to come up with some kind

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.380
of mnemonics to help you keep track of both
their names and their functions.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.180
You’ll need to know what each one is called, whether
it’s a sensory nerve, a motor nerve, or both.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.540
And the map that we follow of the cranial
nerves is based on a ventral view of the brain

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.500
-- looking at its underside, with the anterior
portion at the top, and posterior on the bottom.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.330
First, let’s tackle the names.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.269
Starting at the top, the first cranial nerve
you encounter is the olfactory nerve, which

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.669
takes scent information gathered by the nose
and sends it to the brain.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.320
Followed by the optic nerve, which does the
same, but with visual data.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.439
Then there’s oculomotor, which controls four of the six
muscles that control the movements of your eyes.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:23.520
The next nerve, near the center of the brain’s
ventral side, is the trochlear nerve, which

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.900
controls a single muscle in the eye,
and it lets you do this.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.990
Just below that is the trigeminal nerve, the
largest of the cranial nerves, which branches

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.779
into three main strands -- hence the ‘tri’
-- and innervates the face and jaw muscles.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:41.020
After that there’s the abducens, which stimulates
the muscles that let your eyes do this -- from

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.289
side to side, followed by the facial nerve,
which operates the muscles that make most

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.040
facial expressions possible.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.180
Then there’s the auditory nerve. You can
probably guess what that’s for.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.270
You might notice that, up until the auditory
nerve, the cranial nerves mostly control organs

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.589
in the front of the cranium -- mainly the
eyes and facial muscles.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.210
But as you work your way down, the nerves
tend to innervate the lower and more posterior

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.430
portions of the head.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.149
Like the glossopharyngeal nerve, which leads
to your tongue and your pharynx.

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.789
That’s followed by your vagus nerve -- you
should definitely remember that one -- and

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.999
then the spinal accessory nerve -- which has
to do with moving your head and shoulders,

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.960
and not whether your belt matches your shoes.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.339
Lastly there’s the hypoglossal, the nerve
that allows you to swallow and talk, among

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:22.610
other things that you do with your mouth and
tongue.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.920
That was a lot of information and probably new
words, so how are you gonna remember it all?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.120
Well, by finding a way to remember the first
letter of each name, in order. Which is:

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.720
O-O-O .. T-T … A-F-A … G-V-S-H.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.960
That doesn’t spell anything useful at all.
There is a mnemonic that you’ll probably

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.749
hear in school that goes like this:

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:46.240
On old Olympus’ towering top, a Fin and
German viewed some hops.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.449
That’s pretty weird sounding -- not terribly
easy to remember. I mean, Olympus? Fin? Hops?

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.339
There’s gotta be something more relevant
to us 21st century science lovers. Like, the

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.779
Lord of the Rings fans out there might prefer
something along the lines of:

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.320
Onward old orcs! Toward the Argonath for a
Great Villain! Slay Hobbits!

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.460
I’m just trying to help.

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.839
Whatever device you use to remember the names
of the cranial nerves, you also have to keep

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:14.199
track of their functions -- that is, whether
they’re sensory, motor, or both. So, again

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.959
from top to bottom, a lot of teachers use
this sequence of S’s, M’s and B’s to remember:

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.960
Some say marry money, but my brother says
big brains matter more.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.580
That one’s not so bad. But I don’t know, maybe
you’ll have better luck with something like this:

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.640
Sorry, Sherlock -- Mean Moriarty Beat Me,
But Some Bobbies Busted Moriarty Masterfully!

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.339
You are, of course, invited to think up your
own. And feel free to share them in the comments,

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.199
hopefully there will be some good ones down there
-- anything would be better than Fins and Hops

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.660
But if you’re going to commit one cranial nerve
type to memory, it should be 10, the vagus nerve.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.900
This long and extensive nerve stretches from
near the brainstem down to most of your visceral

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.490
organs, including your heart, lungs, and stomach.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.009
The vagus nerves work as a two-way street,
ferrying incoming sensory information from

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.429
the peripheral system to the brain, and transmitting
outgoing motor instructions from the brain

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:03.599
to the rest of the body.

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.509
So it’s a “B” nerve, because it has
“both” sensory and motor functions. And

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:12.009
usually you don’t notice this nerve at work,
because its functions are mostly automatic.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.569
Say you’ve had a really stressful day, so
your sympathetic system is charged up. You

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.279
come home, crash on the couch, mow down a
half a pizza.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:22.619
Your stomach sends signals to your brain through
the sensory nerve axons in your vagus nerve,

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:25.669
telling you that your belly is full of starch
and protein and fat.

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:31.219
Your brain sees that your stomach is churning
away, which is a usual parasympathetic activity,

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:35.469
so it sends signals back down through the
vagus nerve, triggering other parasympathetic

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:39.839
responses -- like slowing down your heart rate,
putting some glucose back into storage, and

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.709
reducing all that norepinephrine that your
sympathetic system was pumping out all day.

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:47.729
Soon, you start feeling more relaxed. Which
is just one reason why, for some people, eating

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.239
is a way of reducing stress and anxiety. In
fact, it can feel so good that even though

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.619
your stomach is full, you might continue eating.

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:58.349
So, like I mentioned before, it can be easy
to think of the two divisions of your autonomic

00:07:58.349 --> 00:08:02.239
system as opposites or even rivals, but that’s
a little off the mark.

00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:06.409
Looking at your body as a whole, you should
picture them as two sides of a scale -- sometimes

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:10.600
it’s balanced in the middle, and sometimes it leans
to the left or right, depending on what's happening.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:16.660
That balance is the essence of homeostasis, and
as you’ll recall, homeostasis is the key to life.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.400
Here’s something else that’s important
for life: sex.

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:23.709
It mostly falls within the parasympathetic
domain of “necessary but not an emergency.”

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:27.220
But in order to effectively do it, you need
help from both systems.

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:31.289
First, the parasympathetic system has to make
sure you’re calm enough to even think about

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:35.169
sex, and then funnel extra blood away from
your muscles and down to your genitals -- which

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.360
is why too much stress and anxiety can lead
to sexual dysfunction.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.409
But you also need a burst of that sympathetic
system to excite you, and keep you excited.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.540
So like two sides of the scale, the balance
depends on having the right amount of both.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.880
The rate of action potentials travelling through
each division is known as your “sympathetic

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.820
tone” and your “parasympathetic tone.”

00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:58.009
And, most of the time, our parasympathetic
tone is actually dominant, keeping down the

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:00.410
caged animal that is your sympathetic response.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.370
That’s why you need your parasympathetic
system to keep your heart from racing like

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.410
a rabbit’s. And why, most of the time, our
bodies can do the eating, and sex-having,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.319
and all of the other fun tasks that make up
the business of living.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.410
Today on Crash Course: Anatomy &amp; Physiology
we looked at the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.910
its structural differences from the sympathetic
system, and the 12 cranial nerves. We also

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.399
looked at the vagus nerve as a way of understanding
how parasympathetic responses work, and how

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.979
they make our lives possible.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.780
