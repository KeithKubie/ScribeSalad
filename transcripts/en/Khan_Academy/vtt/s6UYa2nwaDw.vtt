00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.290
I'll now explain to you why,
from 2000 to 2005, we had very

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.390
low defaults on mortgages.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.490
Let's say that I buy a
house for $1 million.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.610
I buy a $1 million house.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.280
So let's say the bank
gives me $1 million.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.370
And then I'm willing to pay
a percentage on it.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.700
So this is from the bank.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.130
This is me.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.190
And I use that to buy a house.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.360
I don't know if these
diagrams help you.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.320
But you get the general idea.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.600
And the bank does that.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.330
And let's say, I don't know,
a year later I lose my job.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.340
I just can't pay this
mortgage anymore.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.420
So I have a couple of options.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.920
I can either sell the house
and pay off the debt, or I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.780
guess I could just tell the
bank, well I can't do

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.570
anything, and I'm going
to foreclose.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.760
And that would ruin my credit.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.440
It would hurt my credit.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650
And I would lose all
my down payment.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.470
So what are the circumstances
that I can sell the house?

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.650
Well, if I borrowed $1 million,
as long as-- and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.940
let's say I didn't put any
money down, just for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.190
simplicity.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.600
If I can sell the house for
$1.1 million, well I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.640
would do it, right?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910
Let me sell for $1.1 million.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.460
If I sell for $1.1 million,
I pay the bank--

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.760
let me switch colors.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.900
I pay the bank $1 million,
and I net $100,000.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.800
And everyone's happy.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.540
The bank got their money back,
so they didn't lose any money

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.690
on the transaction.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.360
I made $100,000.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.840
And so the whole reason why this
worked out, even though

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.970
maybe I was a credit risk,
is because the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.970
housing prices went up.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.050
So when you have rising housing
prices, the banks will

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.100
not lose money lending you.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.270
Because if you can't pay, you
just give back the house, the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.860
bank can sell it.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.170
Or, you won't even give
back the house.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.190
You'll sell the house and you'll
pay it off, even though

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.800
you can't pay the mortgage
anymore.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.200
The only situation where I
would foreclose is if the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.070
market price of the house
goes less than my loan.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.320
And that's actually
the situation that

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.400
we're facing now.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.340
So if, let's say that
I can only sell

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.400
this house for $900,000.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.430
Well, then I'm just
going to give the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.000
keys back to the bank.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.840
That's actually called jingle
mail, because you just mail

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.030
the keys back.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.139
And then the bank sells the
house for $900,000.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.610
And then they would
take a loss.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.510
So when housing prices go
down, that's the only

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.810
situation where really you
should have foreclosure.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.550
When housing prices soon. go up,
the person who borrowed it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.700
is just going to sell the house
and pay off the loan.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.070
And they are actually probably
going to make some money.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.970
So there was every incentive
to buy a house.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.390
So let's think about this whole
dynamic over the last

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.870
several videos that we've
been building.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.300
So we said, from 2000 to 2004
housing prices went up.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.530
Let me do it like this.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.030
Let me change it a little bit.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.160
We can even say, from
2000 to 2006.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.300
So we know that housing
prices went up.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.770
And why did why did housing
prices go up?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.120
Well, we saw the data.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.240
It wasn't because people
were earning more.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.010
It wasn't because the
unemployment rate went down.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.940
It wasn't because the population
increased.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.840
It wasn't because the supply
of houses were limited.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.830
We disproved all that.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.830
We realize it was just because
financing got easier.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.770
The standards for getting a
loan went lower and lower.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.850
Financing got easier
and easier.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.850
And because housing prices went
up, what did that cause?

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.150
We just said when housing
prices go up,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.400
default rates go down.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.330
You could give a
loan to someone

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.890
who's a complete deadbeat.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.970
But as long as housing prices go
up, if they lose their job,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.690
they can still sell that house
and pay you back the loan.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.060
So housing prices going up
makes sure there's no

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.140
foreclosure, so defaults
go down.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.950
So then the perceived risk
goes down, of lending.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:17.360
Perceived lending
risk goes down.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.040
So that makes more people
willing to lend.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.450
And the corollary of more people
willing to lend, is you

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.410
that the actual standards
go down.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.860
That's financing easier.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.600
We could actually write that.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.850
Standards go down.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.320
So you had this whole-- I guess
you could argue whether

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.230
this is a negative or
a positive cycle.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.720
But you had this whole cycle
occurring from the late '90s,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.770
but especially, it really got
a lot of momentum at around

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.090
2001, 2002, 2003.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.070
That financing got easier,
despite the fact that people

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.740
were earning less, population
wasn't increasing that fast,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.920
that there were all of
these new houses.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.170
And that caused housing
prices to go up.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.850
Housing prices went up, then
we had a lot fewer people

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.300
defaulting on their loans.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.050
No one would default on their
loans if they could sell it

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.630
for more than the loan.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.420
Then a lot more people said,
well these are super safe.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.910
And so the ratings agencies,
Standard and Poor's and

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.030
Moody's, were willing to give
AAA ratings to more and more,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.030
what I would argue,
are risky loans.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.070
So the perceived lending
risk went down.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.920
Then more and more people
liked this asset class.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.960
They said, wow, this is great.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.650
I can get a better return than
I can get in a bank, or in

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.080
Treasuries, or in a whole set
of securities, even though

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.750
these are very low-risk
or perceived low-risk.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.990
So I want to funnel more
and more money in here.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.890
And so the mortgage brokers and
the investment banks said

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.080
great, the only way we can get
more volume to satisfy all

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.700
these people who want to lend
money-- the only way we can

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.150
find more people to lend
money to, is by

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.460
lowering the standards.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.020
And this cycle went round
and round and round.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.820
And it really started because
this whole process of being

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.970
able to take a bunch of people's
mortgages together,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.630
package them up, and then turn
them into securities and then

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.270
sell them to a bunch of
investors-- this was a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.630
quote-unquote innovation in the
mid-'90s, or early '90s.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.810
I forgot exactly when.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.670
And it really started to take
steam in the early part of

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.860
this decade.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.000
So that's essentially why
housing prices went up.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200
And why kind of all of this
silliness happened.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.270
And in the next video, I'll talk
a little bit more about

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.320
maybe who some of these
investors were.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.300
And I'll tell you what a common
hedge fund technique.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.980
And I think it's very important
not to group all

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.760
hedge funds together.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.000
There are some good ones.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.270
But what a common hedge fund
technique was, to take

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.110
advantage of this virtual cycle,
to make the hedge fund

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.980
founders very wealthy.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.450
I'll see
