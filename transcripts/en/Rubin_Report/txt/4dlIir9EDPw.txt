Speaker 1:          00:02          All right. What's going on everybody? It is our monthly patrion exclusive live stream. We're changing it up this month. Uh, so what we've always been doing here with Patrion is I do this video, this live stream where I take questions from patrons and we only share the video with Patrion people. But I realized, uh, last month that when we were doing this that it's like, I think more of you want more people to be able to hear the questions you're asking. And here my answers. So I asked everybody basically, I was like, look, how about we let only patrion members submit the questions, but we'll post this video live to our youtube feed as we're doing right now and let everybody hear the answers. That way it gets more people hearing your questions, more people here in my answers. And hopefully for some of you guys that haven't joined us, uh, on Patrion, hopefully you will join us.

Speaker 1:          00:55          So if you want to get a question and to me first off, uh, it's patrion.com/rubin report and I think it's the, a level one tier gets ya, gets you right in on, on this. And I've got a trusty iPad here. My guys are sending me questions on the fly and we're going to do about an hour of Q and a totally uncensored. Whatever you want to ask me. I'm reading them right here. I haven't even looked at them yet. I've been doing patrion hangouts all day long. You know, we, for the higher tier members, we do small group chats. We used to do one on ones. Now we're doing them in groups. So I've been going all day long. I am wearing a hat, which people don't get to see me in a hat that often. Uh, but, uh, I haven't even showered today because it's been a crazy freaking day of Patriot hangouts and just catching up on life.

Speaker 1:          01:38          As you guys know. I've been, uh, last three weeks on the road with Jordan Peterson and we were in Denmark and Sweden and Norway and UK and Ireland. And, uh, definitely forgetting some other places, but we've been all over the place. It looks like we just signed on for probably another 30 shows in Europe in March and April. Uh, we got a whole bunch of stops in Australia in February. They're just great energy behind what we're doing. I'm, I'm so enthused and site and, uh, I just, I just feel great at the moment and a, and I'm looking forward to taking some questions. Oh, just real quick. Let me pimp out one, one event I've been doing. So I got back from Helsinki. Oh, Finland. I forgot about Finland. Uh, I got back from Helsinki, uh, two days ago and then I did stand up immediately that night in Braya.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Uh, and then I did stand up last night in Oxnard and both nights I a, I brought two members of the intellectual dark web. I always bring one. So I do about an hour of stand up and then I bring the guests from the IDW on. Uh, I bought, brought both Weinstein brothers on stage and we're just having a great time and, and it's, it's totally different. So I hope if you guys happen to be in a city, Warren, I'm doing stand up soon and I hope you'll come check it out. I'll be in San Jose on November 28th at the San Jose Improv and there will be an IDW member, uh, with me and you know, I do stand up but it's a lot of crowd work and we do live Q and a and it's really interactive and fun and I get the crowd going at each other and it's a politically diverse group of people and it's, and it's pretty cool and I'm psyched about that.

Speaker 1:          03:03          And if you want to just check out some more dates and tours and other things that I'm doing a, you can go to Dave rubin.com/events and before I start, I assume everybody wants to say hi to Emma. She's been hanging out all day long and here she is, 14 years old. A lot of you know the story about her. She's a rescue from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. So she's lived in New Orleans then. She lived in New York for about 10 years and now we've been living in La for a couple of years. She's been to the Grand Canyon. She's been to the White House. The girl has lived through a lot. Okay. Let's jump into questions cause that's what it's all about. So we will go right there. Uh, when are you coming back to San Francisco? So I've done a couple events in San Francisco. Well I will be in San Jose on November 28 that's pretty close to San Francisco.

Speaker 1:          03:47          So hopefully you can come check it out. I think we're going to do some more stuff in San Francisco and I just need to spend a couple of days there cause there's a lot going on on tech side of things as you guys can imagine these days with all the algorithm craziness and, and youtube stuff and Twitter shadow banning. So I need to spend some time in San Francisco. Um, so maybe, maybe on the 29th I'll do like some sort of public event there if I can figure out a way to do it. But 20th, I'm in San Jose, so do come and check it out. Um, Dave, uh, after listening to the Idw, I can no longer listen to conservative talk radio. It seems shallow. Uh, just like the mainstream media. What have you done to me? I've done something good my friend. This is what it's all about. Look, what is the IDW trying to do?

Speaker 1:          04:30          Uh, as Eric Weinstein said, who I think is sort of the, he was the sort of architect of this in some ways and I've been sort of the main facilitator and we've got all sorts of people that are part of it. It's like what do, what do we agree on most of them? What we agree on mostly is that we're allowed to think differently, but we agree on what a conversation is, what a respectful conversation amongst people who have different thoughts are, which is why I can sit in my studio with my own home across from Ben Shapiro when he'll tell me that he wouldn't attend my wedding anniversary. And we can, we can agree to disagree on things. So we can agree that we still want to live in the same societies, each other. I think what we've done with the IDW is we, we've shattered some of the notions that media and the political establishment has, has thrust on all of us about how we should behave, where everyone who disagrees with us is evil.

Speaker 1:          05:24          And everyone who disagrees with this is a bigot or a Lib tart or a racist or a homophobe. All of this stuff, it's not real. It's tearing us apart. It's making people crazy. And I can tell you guys, I just meant the, the last three weeks bouncing all over Europe, I spent the two months before that bouncing all over the United States. Uh, we've done 70 plus shows together. I think Jordan and I, a, it'll be well over a hundred by the time we're done. And people are good. They're out there, they want to solve problems. And one of the coolest things is so you right now, person watching this, most likely you're watching this alone, right? You're, you're watching it either on your phone or you're sitting at your laptop or your desktop. Um, you're not listening to this, right? Cause we're only live streaming this on youtube.

Speaker 1:          06:08          We will, I think we're going to put this up on the podcast feed probably. Um, but this is a sort of solo operation. Like maybe you're watching it on your smart TV, maybe your, your husband or your wife or your boyfriend or girlfriend is there, but it's a pretty solo experience ingesting all of this content. You know, you can walk around listening to these podcasts and it's a solo thing. And what I'm, what I'm really loving right now about the Peterson events and now doing standup again, is that people are coming into these rooms and they're looking around and you're going, holy cow. You know, for the standard shows, there's hundreds of other people laughing about the same shit that I'm laughing about at the Petersen shows. There's thousands of other people that are as interested in ideas and getting your life right before you fix the world, fix yourself.

Speaker 1:          06:51          And they're coming together and they're realizing, holy cow, I'm not alone. And yes, they disagree. All the people that come there disagree on all sorts of things. And I have people that come up to me after the shows. And you know, a lot of people of course say Dave, I'm sort of on the same political journey is you? I used to be a big lefty, but I'm a liberal and that has nothing to do with the left anymore. And people come up to me and say, I'm a libertarian and I've been waiting for some good liberals to join forces with. Some people say I'm a conservative and I disagree with you on some things, uh, but, but you know, I support what you're doing and all that. Um, so look, if you can't listen to talk radio anymore because of what we've done here, I think that's pretty good.

Speaker 1:          07:25          You know, I'm not putting down anybody and the people can do what they want and listen to who they want to listen to. But I think we've offered up something a little more and I'm really proud of that and I think we're just at the beginning again. So it's, it's pretty exciting. Um, okay. Let's see. Um, Dave, have you followed the leftist attacks on Peter but goes you unrelated to his pro bound grievance studies? I have, uh, first off, I love Pete. Pete's been on the show twice and if you haven't seen, uh, particularly the second one. So the first interview that I did with Peter was the first time we met and we did mostly a talk an hour long talk about atheism. And Pete wrote a book called a manual for creating atheists. We did that about three years ago. I think it was three years ago this month actually, it might've been this week and it was right before thanksgiving.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Um, and Pete was on again about a year ago in this studio. And we did, we talked about all sorts of stuff. But what was great, I think the first 20 or 30 minutes was about the nature of friendship. Actually, his father had just passed away. And, uh, you know, our friendship sort of blossomed because I tried to be there for him during that time. Um, he's, he's a really good guy. Look, these guys wrote, Pete and James Lindsey and Helen pluck, rose wrote these, uh, these fake academic papers that got accepted by peer reviewed journals and they just freaking flipped all of these nonsensical, um, all of these nonsensical ways that these departments figure out what's real and what's not real right on their head. I mean, it's actually incredible. So anyway, Pete is a philosophy professor at Portland State University and the school paper issued this statement all anonymously signed by professors and Grad students, uh, about how awful he is.

Speaker 1:          09:05          And it's like, man, you know, he's put his butt and his career and his life on the line to fight for what he believes in. And you guys won't even put your names to this paper, uh, to this statement against him. And it's like you're all cowards. If you were on the side of truth, you would stand up and be who you are, but you won't. And this guy is doing good work because what he, what Pete I think basically believes is that, that the gender studies and these types of disciplines that aren't pure reviewed, that don't, uh, that don't come from a place of empirical evidence like say the stems, uh, do, um, Pete would say they are infecting every part of academia. And it's not just Pete that says that it's plenty of other people at Jordan. Peterson says it, uh, plenty of other people in academia or realize what is happening.

Speaker 1:          09:53          And, uh, so I love Pete. I backbeat and I hope that, uh, what he's done will have wider effects and will ripple for a long time coming. And I do think they will. Um, what do you think is the future of comedy? Can it get back to being funny and not just political watch the Adam Sandler Netflix than recently, even though I was not a fan and I enjoyed it partly because the songs were funny and weird and because there was no political content, so I haven't seen that thing yet. You know, when I was younger, especially in college, I loved Sandler is comedy was off the wall. That wasn't political. It was completely ridiculous. Then he had like five or six movies in a row. There were absolutely horrendous. And then those Netflix movies have been pretty awful. The Sandy Wexler on was sort of okay, but some of the others are just terrible.

Speaker 1:          10:35          That one with David spade where he's a secret agent or science, it's not even a movie. They need another word for it. It's so bad. That being said, I haven't seen this yet, but, but if he got back to his off the wall roots where he, we know what's happening and this is what your questions about. It's like what's happening right now is that these comedians have become the same type of hectoring preaching blowhards that they're supposed to be making fun of. So imagine if George Carlin, who I think is the greatest stand up and the most prolific standup comic of all time, if he was alive today. Now first off he be getting booed off college campuses because he'd be an old white guy defending the patriarchy. I mean, it's so stupid, right? This is a guy who fought the his entire life. Um, but what would he be doing?

Speaker 1:          11:19          He would be using comedy to say what he wants to say, but if you go online now and you see what a lot of really famous, far more famous than me comics are doing, they're just yelling and preaching and they're all, they're all progressive activists and Democratic Party members and all that stuff and they're not funny anymore. I mean the amount of people who I used to like comedically, who now like make me kind of nauseous as sick, but that's actually why I'm doing standup again. And we did great show in Oxnard last night. We did a great show and Brian, as I said, I'm doing something that's like more of like a crazy road show slash town whole thrash interview slash Phil Donahue Slash Jerry Springer show than anything else. And I'm treating my audience with respect. We're doing some politically incorrect stuff. I hope people aren't a recording all of this stuff because what, what happens in accountability club is kind of sacred and a lot of comics, by the way, now the big, the big time comics like Rogan in Chappelle, who both are spectacular comedians.

Speaker 1:          12:16          They don't even let people bring their phones. You have to give up your phone. You put it in a bag before you even go in. Um, because that, you know, the comedy club is the place where you're supposed to experiment. And imagine if you were a scientist and you're experimenting and things were blowing up in your face, you wouldn't want that out there all the time. Man. You know, I Albert eyes, I didn't want all of his formulas out there while he was trying to figure him out. So I'm glad to hear that about Sandler. I will check out the, the, uh, the special one. I have a chance and a, and I do hope you guys will come check out the, the standup that I'm doing. So, uh, 28th in San Jose at the Improv. I'll be in the, at the, uh, the Improv in Irvine, California in January and we're, we're booking out a bunch of other stuff.

Speaker 1:          12:53          So yeah, there you go. Uh, love the Norway Q and. A. I just posted on the channel, I think yesterday, the Q and a from Oslo, Norway, uh, me asking Jordan questions. It's the only public thing that we've posted from the entire tour. So if you haven't seen a dude check it out. So thank you for that. Just so that Jordan Peterson is coming to Auckland, New Zealand, will you be accompanying him? I hope so. So that's right after Australia and I had something I have to do that week in the states, so I don't think I can, unfortunately. I'm sorry. Believe me, I would absolutely love to go to New Zealand for a million reasons. Of course. I've got to try your lamb. Uh, I get New Zealand lamb here, but like, and then that's just one of many reasons that I would love to go there. And I get a lot of email from a New Zealand also. So don't count me out just yet, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to happen. Um, okay. Let's see. What's your least favorite thing about touring with Peterson? Uh, we hear so much about how awesome it is. I'm curious if there's anything that bothers you at all.

Speaker 1:          13:55          Wow, that's a question. Um,

Speaker 2:          13:58          okay.

Speaker 1:          13:58          No, there, there really isn't. Um, you know, the travel can be a little bit exhausting at times. Like I'm actually a little beat right now. The reason I'm wearing a hat is I didn't even shower today because it's been so busy doing patrion hangouts today. And you know, I got back and I immediately went to the standup Gig and then this other standup Gig and I interviewed Bret Weinstein yesterday, which will be on our channel tomorrow. And I had so much business to catch up on. And, um, a mirror who's been our director for three plus years, uh, who's been just an absolute all star at every level. Uh, she actually accepted a new job, has moved on. So we now have a part time, part time or taken her job, which is clearly a fulltime job. It's many people's full time jobs as we're hiring for that.

Speaker 1:          14:41          And I know a whole bunch of you have submitted resumes and we're trying to figure all that out so there's just so much going on. So I would say the only thing that's a little sucky is that I feel like I'm a little bit behind on things. And actually one other thing related to the show, which I mentioned in a live stream last week, the one thing that I think has suffered on the show is that I haven't been able to do direct messages because we've been taping a lot of stuff in advance while I'm on the road. I did do two live streams last week. You know, this is live stream right now and I'm going to try to do more of these so that I can keep that connection with you guys. And so that I can, I can speak directly to you and you guys can ask and, and comment directly to me.

Speaker 1:          15:13          Um, but I do miss the direct messages. I mean, I think that's where I can give you my most clear, cogent thoughts because I write it out and I go directly to camera over there and do it. So I, I miss that a little bit. Um, but we'll, we'll get back to that kind of stuff. And I also want to change what we're doing and how we're doing it as, as the years go by and always remain fresh and all that good stuff. But in terms of the tour itself, nothing bad, nothing bad. Jordan and I have hit a nice rhythm together. I think we're really bringing out the best in each other. Um, I honestly feel like a better person than I was like five months ago. Like, if you guys think Jordan has affected you and if you think you've tried to incorporate the 12 rules of life to, to your life to fix yourself, it's like try being on the road with the guy for six months and try doing Q and A's where we do 45 minutes together in front of 2000 people and he's talking to them, but then he'll turn and you know, we're this close.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Right. And it's like there's powerful stuff there. Um, and that's been, uh, that's been very exciting. So it's all good. It's very, it's very cool. I see this, there hasn't been one of, actually the, the running joke with our tour manager John, who's also been wonderful. It's like this guy is like, this is the easiest tour ever. He's like, nobody's doing drugs. Nobody's drinking. Nobodys ripping up hotel rooms. He's like, the two of you, you know, you have dinner maybe or you shoot the shit after you drink some sparkling water and then talk about philosophy. He's like, this is the easiest thing ever. The only screw up of the entire tour is I think when we were in where the hell were, we were in like Ontario, Canada and I said that we were in Toronto or something like that, which is like, that's like tour screw up one oh one.

Speaker 1:          16:44          So yeah, it's really, it truly has been great. It really has, uh, Dave, many of us are such huge fan of yours. Would you ever consider a patrion reward where you would follow some of your fans on Twitter? That's actually kind of interesting. You know, I wouldn't want to make it about like that that feels like it would almost be like bribery or something. Um, you know, the Twitter feeds of just become such a mess. Let me, let me think about that one actually, because I suspect too that if, if you're a fan of mine and you enjoy what we do here, you probably treat Twitter with the same sort of respect that I do. So it probably wouldn't be such a bad idea. Let me think that one through. I think there might be something there. Um, how much worse do you think youtube, Facebook and Google have to become before someone who creates a competing service refuses to sell? And we start to shift over? I mean, look, this is the million dollar question, right? Like, we've been talking about this for months. If you didn't watch my livestream with Eric Weinstein from about six weeks ago or so, uh, we got into a little bit. There's no doubt that the billionaire class a is now paying attention to this. Um, there is a billionaire that I had on the show

Speaker 1:          17:50          not too long ago who knows what he's thinking about all this stuff. Um, I can't tell you everything at the moment, but yes, I think perhaps finally, um, we've hit critical mass with this. We're just today I tweeted out that I just don't see people's tweets anymore, especially the IDW crew. I never see Eric's tweets or Brett's tweets or Sam's tweets. Uh, may maybe. I see Jordan's every now and again. Christina Hoff Summers, I never see ion. I never see 'em a slew of them. I never see them. What I do see often is I see the conservative commentators that I follow like a bill Kristol or no Rockman. A couple of guys like that. I see their tweets all the time, but I never see my other guy's tweets. Now we know that there's some level of shadow banning going on. There's something being manipulated in the algorithm.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Who the hell knows? And again these companies can do whatever the hell they want. People just want some transparency. So yes, at some point will something come in and replace them? Yes, I do believe that. Hopefully I'll be part of something that that does do it and it's so funny. It's like, man, all you guys have to do, it's sort of like what I, what I generally say about the left at the moment, which is all you guys had to do these last couple of years was not be absolutely terrible. Like you could have been basically terrible. You know like you could have just been generically terrible and a lot of liberals and left. These would have kind of stayed with you because they would have been like, ah, the rights still is too scary for me. Or something like that. More the societal pressures to not move politically or whatever, you know, or the, the, the cries of racism and bigotry wouldn't have, would it stop people from moving, but instead they decided to be really awful and I kind of feel like that's what's happening with the tech companies right now.

Speaker 1:          19:28          It's like we don't know if videos get out to feeds anymore. I don't know how many of you actually are, are watching this live at the moment and did this get out to, you know, we've almost 900,000 subscribers. How many people actually got this notification? People tell me they get unsubscribed all the time. All of this stuff. It's like there's gotta be a better way to do this, to communicate information. There's such a starvation for, for good conversation and enlightening thought and, and, and not belittling and braiding everybody. So I think it's coming together. If you're not, let's see. I'd love to see your radical feminist or SJW on the show. How hard is it to get one to accept an invitation? Look, I think you guys know this. I am happy to talk to anybody that will have a decent, respectful conversation. If there is, there's a small crew of people out there that are always attacking me and mocking me and, and, uh, lying and slandering me and all these things and then demanding to come on the show.

Speaker 1:          20:22          And it's like, now I wouldn't want you in my life, but I wouldn't want you in my home much less my show. Um, but if there's someone out there from that line of thinking that will honestly defend their ideas and sit across from somebody and not call you a Nazi or racist, I'll be happy to do that. You know, I tweet out this list of lefties all the time that I would love to have on from, you know, Michael Moore and Rob Reiner and Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman and obviously Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and a, and a whole slew of, uh, of other people. So I'd be happy to do it, but they have to discuss things. Um, honestly and fairly, you know what, give me one second because my dog wants to get out of the studio and she's given me to look. Hold on one second.

Speaker 3:          21:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:13          Sorry. That was, that was six seconds. She gets, she's 14 years old. She gets up the stairs a little slower these days. Okay. Let's see. MMM,

Speaker 3:          21:21          yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:23          Uh, will you come to Cincinnati? Bring Peterson please. Um, actually Peterson did an event in Cincinnati, but I was not there. I had to go home for a, where was I going, I think for a wedding, so I missed that. Um, but I'd love to go back there and I've never, I've actually never been to Cincinnati, so I would absolutely love to go. One of the funny things he may, it might crazy travels over the last couple of weeks, um, was that in the midst of the whole European thing. Uh, Bob Saget who's, uh, you got, you guys all know Bob Saget comedian from full house, Fuller House, America's home videos and a good Julian other things and a legendary standup. Uh, I've become good friends with him and his fiance at the time. Kelly Rizzo, who's a great girl. And, uh, we, they were getting married and I left the UK. I flew home for one day, went to the wedding and then flew back to Amsterdam in the middle of the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          22:18          But the wedding was, was absolutely great and, uh, at a great time and they're just great. And it's like, you know what, when you're in the thick of things, it's like, I just didn't want to like do this and work this hard and then like, just miss important things too. So just doing my thing. Okay. Let's see. Hey Dave, a little worried when Jordan told the pug story in one of your recent lectures. So if you guys haven't seen this, this was Jordan was referring to the count dank yellow pug who made the Nazi salute. Uh, and you can watch this in our interview and from Norway, uh, just a couple of days ago. There are single lines out of that that the left could use to further create an alt right agenda. I think you'd understand the lines that could be edited out or combined with his and the audience laughed or any concerns.

Speaker 1:          23:01          I'm not concerned about it even though I think we made one or two jokes about that. Um, look, here's the deal. We cannot look, you know, Jordan's not racist. Okay. Um, the audience knows Jordan's not racist. Now, could these people selectively edit these videos? Could they do this to literally any of us at any time? Do they do it to me now? Yes. I see people, these, these awful Twitter anime avatars who will quote me on things and they will literally cut out the previous sentence where I said, I do not think, or no, this is not right. Can people do all of these things all the time? Yes they can. And we just live in that time right now. And I think the best thing you can do is what we do here, which is do not edit for content. And, and what I mean by that is we don't edit for content in that.

Speaker 1:          23:51          If my guests says something that is stupid or ridiculous or whatever it is, we let that stand. We do not add for content. The only thing we edit for occasionally someone like has a sneezing fit or a coughing fit or if a light blinks or something like that, like maybe we would do an edit around that. But we do not edit for content. We've only edited for content one time in the hundreds of interviews I've ever done. I don't want to throw the guest under the bus, but it was somebody that really was not in good shape for the interview. And it was, it was just a train wreck. And we, I didn't want to do it, but ultimately my team convinced me that that's what we should do just to save. This person's a lot of anguish. Let's just leave it at that. Um, but in terms of that, look, Jordan was mocking, he was making the point that you have to be free to express yourself.

Speaker 1:          24:35          You have to be free to make jokes. And I think he could have even taken it a step further that even if cow Dacula was racist, which Jordan is explicitly saying he's not racist, but you're still allowed to do that. And I would or I would argue that you're still allowed to do that. Now we have a stronger defense of free speech here in the United States with our first amendment than they do in Europe. And further, he talked in that Q and a about some of the things that are happening in the UK right now, particularly around speech. And you've got the Yorkshire for Yorkshire Police Literally tweeting out saying, you know, watch out for hate speech from your neighbors and report them. I mean, this is, this is dangerous totalitarian stuff that's spreading all over Europe right now. And we have to be very careful about this.

Speaker 1:          25:17          So I, I get what you're saying that someone could isolate one of that and then the audience laughed when he said this, but his intention, his intention was not, oh, let's make fun of what the Nazis did. The intention is to make fun of the Nazis made, you know, flip all of these things on their head. And I think that, you know, I think I said this to him in that interview, but you know, comedy, I think it's Mel Brooks, it's in comedy is tragedy plus time and you have to be able to look back and make fun of you of these things. And I think bart, with partly as long as you know, we're talking about this in the context of Nazis, that's why there's a lot of Jewish comics because there's a lot of tragedy in the, in the story of the Jews. And it's like, all right, well, you could either be dead or you can learn to understand your history and what happened and make fun of it to sort of own it again.

Speaker 1:          26:03          Um, and I think that that's just one way of coping and that's, and if we don't have comedy, I don't know what we have. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Have you ever heard the song politically correct by Sr 71 it's great. 20 years ahead of its time. It read the social trajectory and speaks uncannily to what is going on right now. I haven't heard it but I will keep this question up here guys. Don't delete that one so that I can check it out later. Um, let's see. Jordan Peterson is often mentioned that the left is essential and important to stem portrait, a potential tyranny of hierarchies of competence. I'm wondering, do you think that Jordan's audience can acknowledge this is important to this? A great question. Jordan has such nuanced and compassionate perspective. I'm curious if the audience, his audience resonates with this nuance or are they more attracted to the critique of roasting the left?

Speaker 1:          26:52          It's a difficult question to answer I guess, but interested in your thoughts and perspective. You might win best question of the day cause that's, that's seriously good. Okay, so in essence what you're saying there is when Jordan critiques the left, which is, which is sort of the red meat for the audience, is that what they're really into or is it when he does this more nuance thing, which is that we need a healthy left the way we need a healthy, right. Because as he would say, they cause a tension between each other. And that tension is, is sort of where a society should live so that it doesn't tilt one way too much or tilt the other way too much. Yes. I think they really, really are into that. The red meat, he doesn't do things for applause lines. Like, um, you know, he doesn't do just the easy things like get up there and be like feminism or not.

Speaker 1:          27:37          He never does that. He never does that. Um, as a matter of fact, one of the things that I'll say to him sometimes is, uh, you know, sometimes he'll get a big laugh on something and I can, sometimes it's intentional. Sometimes it's not intentional. Um, but he always will talk right through it because his intention up there is not to get laughs. And then when I go up there and then I, then I, my intention is to get labs and mess with him and have fun with the crowd. Um, but his intention is not for the audience reaction is intention is truly to expand what his thinking is. And I watched this guy doing it every night. It's pretty freaking awesome. Um, so as your question, one of the way he describes this is that you need this healthy left and right the way you would want a relationship in a marriage.

Speaker 1:          28:18          You wouldn't want to beat your wife and an argument, let's say, because then you're the winner and she's the loser, and then you're married to a loser. What you would want is that you could prove a point so and then sort of offer a handout and say, we can fix this together, and you would hope that that's the way the other side would treat you as well. I sense that a lot of people are into that nuance. I mean, I think that's sort of what's happening with the IDW. It's right. We're not just saying, look, we're all frustrated with the left. Most of us come from the left. Some of us, like Brett and Eric and Sam still still believe they believe they're on the left. I can't honestly say that anymore. I see a much healthier center, right? These days I see a much more interesting and rich and politically diverse group of Libertarians and conservatives these days and former liberals or classical liberals or former progressive that are making a really wide tent and better really interested in discussing ideas.

Speaker 1:          29:10          That's what I see and I'm, I'm very comfortable with them. Well, I'd be glad to talk to those people on their side, of course, but basically that you need these two healthy sides that have nuance, that have tension with each other because otherwise if you break this thing, then you got one sort of tyrannical side. And guess what? Look, I know that, uh, you know, most of you guys watching this right now, you're at your other classical liberals generally are your libertarians or conservatives. Um, but you don't want to wing to the point that there's no opposition because that opposition is what is the sort of gestalt of what a healthy society is made up of. Um, so I do think people are in on it for the nuance and, and he's given it to him. He really is. He's not doing the red meat stuff.

Speaker 1:          29:54          Um, let's see. Uh, do you ever fear of the IDW being hijacked? Example, you can all have conversations, but now what do you have conversations about? Can the tolerance go too far? A good question and there's a little bit of a follow up. Uh, Dave, I just want to tell you that you were awesome and Bray at this week and it was great to meet you. Oh, this is a different question. All right, I'll get to that one in a second. So do you ever a fear of the ITW being hijack? Look, it's, it's tough because what are we exactly like, you know, are we, are we a political movement? I think there's probably some legitimacy to that, but we're not a political party or we a publishing company. Are we a road touring group? Are we a podcast network? Are we a youtube replacement? Are we all of these things?

Speaker 1:          30:37          Are we a news network? I mean, who nobody really knows. I promise you we're having a lot of discussions about this, but in terms of being hijacked, look, I could see some, I see sometimes now mainstream trying to hijack some of these ideas, but I don't think you can fake it. We have, we have been in the primordial stew, uh, with you guys for years doing this. And I don't think you can fake it. And the things that we see and believe and talk about our real and authentic and these people, I promise you guys, these people, I look, I've done plenty of TV shows. Almost everyone that you see on a generic TV show, they are that on television and there's something else in real life. And you can even see it when the cameras go on something changes in them. And there are a different person, um, these, this crude.

Speaker 1:          31:23          It's not, it is, it is the real deal. And maybe look, maybe it could be a, maybe it could be hijacked in some way that, you know, who knows, maybe tomorrow, like CNN announces they have a show with their big thinkers and maybe they grabbed one of the ITW people. And throw a lot of money at them and whatever. I'm just not that worried. And it's almost like I just look, I'm just doing what I think is right and I'm going to keep doing it and I think we can fix some of this stuff and I think we are fixing some of this stuff so. So that's it right there. Um, Dave, just want to tell you that you were awesome in Bray at this week and it was great to meet you. I brought three friends with me and we all had a blast. The Weinstein brothers were great.

Speaker 1:          32:03          Also will probably come and again in January to Irvine and bring a few others. Keep it up. It's not a question, but I appreciate it. Yeah, I think we're really doing something different and I'm so, it's awesome. So I'm like, when I meet you guys after, and especially when I meet the Patriot on people, it's like you guys are supporting what I do and I, I, we showed you guys a great time and you just laugh and it's not that serious. And we make fun of all of this nonsense. And I'm a little bit different, you know, look, it's like when I do these live streams with you, I'm a little bit different than Dave doing the interview and I assure you when I'm doing comedy I'm a little bit different than, than Dave doing this right now. It's just like a different, it's like a different frequency that I'm operating at.

Speaker 1:          32:40          So I'm glad you came. And thank you for, uh, coming. And for those of you just tuning in, I will be at the San Jose Improv on November 28 and there will be at least one IDW member, uh, come in. Let's see. Uh, Hey Dave, how is it that you were the one who ended up being attached to Peterson and his tours? FYI, my podcast partner and I made it to one of the shows in Seattle months back and of course, love every second of it. Keep up the inspirationally profound work. Um, so the way this whole thing started was, you may remember last January I had Shapiro and Peterson in studio. And by the way, I'm doing a live stream with Peterson and Shapiro again, and we're going to cover all new ground on November 30th. So keep that in your, uh, in your pocket on your calendar.

Speaker 1:          33:24          But anyway, I had them in studio last January and that night Jordan was doing his first ever theater show. Uh, the book had just come out and they were just kind of testing it, like, could he sell out a theater and what would it be like and all that. And as he was walking out the door, I said to him, Hey Jordan, do you want me to open for you tonight? I'll, I'll warm up the crowd, see what happens. And he's just like, yeah, Dave, come on down. I don't know what kind of Peterson impression that was. Um, but anyway, he said, come on down. Anyway, we do the show. It's at the Orpheum here in la downtown. It's about 2000 people. And I just did a bunch of jokes about Jordan and about lobsters and all of these things. And the crowd just absolutely ate it up.

Speaker 1:          34:01          And then we did a Q and a after. So basically I do stand up, Jordan does an hour and a half or so, and then we do some Q and a together for another 45 minutes. And uh, Jordan's agents were there and they immediately were like, Whoa, we got to do something with this. And I signed with them like two or three days later, maybe a week later. Uh, and then we decided to do this tour and I gotta tell you it's, it's a, it's freaking fantastic. It really is. Um, let's see. Have you invited Barry Weiss on the Ruben report? She would be interesting. I have invited her many times. She has said she's going to do it. We haven't been able to coordinate the thing in La, uh, partly because of my travels, I think part of the cause of hers. But we will make that happen at some point.

Speaker 1:          34:41          Um, what do you think of attempting to brand these folks that are attacking free speech as illiberals in particular in particular using that word whenever referring that to them in order to distinguish between them and classical liberals that many of ourselves consider us to be. That's interesting. So that's like saying it's a little bit of those sort of regressive left thing like these people are not progressive for progress because being for progress would mean that you're for equality for everybody, not equity are for equality of opportunity for everybody. These people are regressive. They want us to regress. They want us to go backwards and start looking at people based on their immutable characteristics, their sexuality and gender and skin color and the rest of it. And that is not progressive. That is regressive. So illiberal it's good, right? I mean I've heard, I've obviously heard the word before, it's good because they are not liberal.

Speaker 1:          35:33          Liberal in its, in its essence means live and let live. It means you believe in the individual. You believe in individual rights. You believe in a light touch of the government. This is the reverse of what progressives are who believe in the collective. And they believe that the government has all the answers. They believe that the government gives you rights. I don't believe that the government gives you rights. I believe you person watching this right now, you are born free, you are born free. The government can protect your rights and it can take your rights away. But it did not give you those rights. It is your human rights. This is where, uh, someone on the more conservative side, if I had Shapiro or Prager, one of those guys, they would say, these are God given rights. I would say they are, they are rights by the, by the, the fact that you are a human makes you free.

Speaker 1:          36:20          You are born for human. It doesn't matter if it's God given or not. You are free and someone can take that away and lock you up. They did not give you your freedom. No Man gave you your freedom. You are free. Um, and they don't, they don't believe that. They believe that the government gave you those things. Um, so I like, I like the word illiberal, you know, it's like one of those things. It's like, look, I had those two years when this was all bursting forth originally where I said regressive left all the time because so many people realized there was something wrong with the left. And the and modularized came up with the phrase regressive left and it's so captured. It was an easy way of explaining to people what this segment of the left was. Now I would argue that segment of the left has no almost encompassed the entire world cleft.

Speaker 1:          37:03          It's almost everything, media and political establishment and the whole thing, but I don't say regressive left anymore. It sort of was becoming a little redundant and a bit memorable. Um, and, and, and I didn't want it to be a pejorative. I wanted it to be something that identified something. And I think we've really did that. We really did do that. And not only do we do that, but I, but I'm really proud to say that people talk about classical liberalism now, and I think I was one of the people, if not the really the first person in this space that got people starting to talk about that again. And then of course I did that Prager u video, why I left the left and I am mapping, I think it's their number one video of all time. And I think it woke up a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          37:42          So, you know, I wouldn't want to use any of these phrases as pejorative as to just mock. But if it's, if it's a phrase, if you say, if someone, if you're in an argument with somebody and they're telling you there are liberal, but therefore all these illiberal policies, you say, you know, you're not a liberal, you're in a liberal and here's why. Well then I think that's a pretty effective. Let's see. Um, for God's sakes, how can we get Eric Weinstein to post more on his youtube channel four posts in eight months. There are squirrels with Warren posts. What can you do to fix this? I will, uh, well I've spent the last two days with him doing stand up and some other stuff. Uh, I'm sure I'll see him in the next couple of days. I will tell him this and he will not out be out done by a squirrel, I assure you of that much.

Speaker 1:          38:25          All right, we got about 20 minutes left guys. Um, let's see. Um, do you enjoy studying science? That's outside of politics, learning for learning's sake. All right, so let me do it with the second part. I do like learning for learning sake. You know, I think one of the coolest things, if I've done anything right in this world, um, is that I get to learn every week. So I just yesterday interviewed Bret Weinstein, which were posting next week and this guy is a wickedly brilliant evolutionary biologist and he was put on the map obviously because of what happened at Evergreen. And he and his wife no longer have jobs and had to move out of the town that they love. And I don't want to give too much away of, of where they're at now because you'll see it in the interview next week. Um, but we did sort of half the interview on what happened to him and what his future is, but then the other half, and we did about an hour and a half together on, on evolutionary biology and explanations of all of the things that are seemingly out of whack these days.

Speaker 1:          39:27          And this recent talk that he had with Richard Dawkins and what they think, how, where they think that evolutionary biology bread thinks they forked at a certain point and what he thinks Dawkins gets wrong and what Dawkins gets right. I mean, the fact that I get to sit with these people or get to tour with Peterson or get to, you know, uh, listened to Eric Weinstein talk about mathematics or whoever it is. It's like I learn every week. So in a way that is learned it. Look, it's learning for learning's sake. I happen to be doing it on a show. I happened to be doing it on something that now has become a, a small production company. And that that is a profitable business that I'm super proud of, that it's allowed me to buy a home and build a studio here in all of these things. And, and we're completely fan funded, which is freaking amazing.

Speaker 1:          40:11          Um, but I do consider most of it learning for learning's sake if that's possible. It's like, it's really cool. Like I get to be around really cool people and not only that, but then when I go out and I do these public events and then I meet you guys and people, people give me books and they write these incredible letters and all of these things. And it's like, we're, we're doing something guys. Let's, let's keep doing it. And, and what we need more of you guys to do is share these videos, is tweet about these things, is get, get your friends and families to know these ideas. Um, because that's how we really can change these things. And I, and I think we're, we're actually doing it.

Speaker 4:          40:43          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:44          Um, do you have a fear that has tech companies veer left? Do you think things will progress beyond shadow banning and d platforming to outright hostile advocacy against competing views? I mean this is sort of like the question of like how much worse is it going to get before it gets better? And yeah, I mean it seems that, you know, look, they can be platform, they can screw with algorithms, they can get rid of likes, they can get rid of follower accounts, they can do all of these manipulations. But it's like, what are the next hostile moves? And what I would say here is it's like, forget what you think. I've said this before, but it's like Alex Jones as an example. It's like, look, you may think the guy's views are all horrible. He said some horrible things about Sandy Hook and a bunch of other things.

Speaker 1:          41:30          It's like, there are plenty of horrible people out there. Go look at Louis Americans Twitter and tell me that what he's saying on any given day in the videos that he's posting aren't probably worse than uh, what Jones was saying everyday or that Hamas who is committed to the destruction of all Jews on earth, uh, has a Twitter account. So those guys were allowed on there. But Jones can't be on Facebook or on, on youtube or on any of these things. Again, I'm not even, it's so boring to make this about Jones. I'm not even talking about him specifically, but it's like, look, if they can take out one person, they can take out anybody. And the Pete, the type of people who want to take people out are not people who ultimately believe in freedom. And again, this is not a defense of Jones, but it's like of Jones specifically.

Speaker 1:          42:15          But it's like if the type of people that do this, it's not like they take one person out and then they're suddenly like, wow, we're good to go. We want to get dinner. No, it's like, oh, we moved a lot. And how can we move that line a little bit further? And then you see what happened to bench pure or the last couple of days, I think it was Ohio state. He goes there and these people are chanting that he's a Nazi in this ridiculous bullshit and he's an Orthodox Jew and they're calling him a Nazi. And then there's this great video by this guy, I think his name is Joe Flakka, uh, where he's interviewing these kids that are protesting Shapiro and he gets the Migraine. But well, what don't you like about venture? And they don't even know any of his views. And it's like, it's become this, this leftist monster and I monsters the only word that makes sense to me around it as become an infection in young people's minds.

Speaker 1:          43:02          Unfortunately where they're protesting, they don't even know why they're protesting. They're protesting because they believe that victim hood, but it's not even just victim of that perceived victim hood is virtue. Edit is not virtue. Guys, what is virtue? Every movie that you love, think of your favorite movie right now. Think of the great adventure movies of all time. Luke Skywalker didn't look for someone else to blow up the death star. He went ahead and did it. You know what I mean? Frodo didn't be like, oh we're doing is the ring. Where's the ring? You could somebody take this ring and get it to your door and drop it in the thing for me. No, he did it. He didn't just sit there as the victim. He, it's everything. Neal, what a neo do you know an Eeo did? All of these guys, every movie it's like everyone comes from something and some of us come from shitty or things and some of us were born with more and some of us were born less than some of us got to limp and some of us are this color, that color and this sexuality and that cause none of it matters.

Speaker 1:          43:54          Get you've got your free. If you live in a Western society you are free. And if you're afraid to say what you think in a Western society, and we were in a bunch of countries in Europe and Sweden in particular, where people are really afraid to say what they think. Well do you think that your silence is going to somehow make it better? No. There are plenty of bad people who will take your silence and only use it to make more people be silent. So you better fight for what you believe in. I don't think I'm anyone special other than for some reason I feel like I can talk about this stuff and it hasn't stopped me yet. And, and you know what? Yeah, it's Shitty when, when these awful journalists and they're journalists, they're, they're, uh, they're, well, it's Candizolv and says their hit men.

Speaker 1:          44:36          Um, you know, when they, they're activists though, is what they really are. They're masking, rating or masking and masquerading as journalists. Uh, yeah. It's not fun having them write these things about you. And I know none of you would ever want that. And I don't like it when it happens to me, but you know what? We're all still here. Peterson's still here. Everybody's still here. That's been through this, this thing. And you'd be through it too. Uh, but everyone has to think about their own life, how, how they will and you responsibly hopefully in seriously. Um, but as Douglas Murray said, you know, uh, when you get in the pool, you might find out that the water is not that cold. And I think that that is it. Everyone's afraid of jumping in. But if you actually just put your foot in, you might find that it's actually more okay here.

Speaker 1:          45:15          And you might find that, yeah, you're going to lose some friends, but you're going to make better friends and you might find that you feel better. You physically feel better because you're being more honest with yourself. Uh, and I, and a slew of other things. So get out there and fight for what you believe in. Even if you believe in things that I don't believe I would be all for you doing that. Um, how do we begin to translate the important message concerning individual liberty that you and Jordan are doing to politics? Individual Liberty is not represented on the, on the traditional left, right? Political scale. Yeah. Well there hasn't been a great, um, there hasn't been a great, let's say stance for the individual in a long time. Like Rand Paul talks about the individual because he's basically a libertarian. Uh, um, what's his name? Paul Ryan would talk about the individual quite a bit and I know he was really influenced by Iran.

Speaker 1:          46:04          Um, but there isn't a real fighter for the individual the way that there should be. Um, you know, as more and more of the left goes to the identity politics thing and as the Democrats won, uh, just two weeks ago there they've realized, well, all right, well this may be, is a winning strategy now, so they're going to only go in on it more, which is why I wanted them to lose, I wanted them to lose because I thought, all right, if they lose maybe then the more extreme set of Democrats, the Democratic Socialists would be washed away. And then some decent liberals that used to exist would, would magically appear again. Maybe a JFK could appear again and then that that could actually be a decent democratic party against something that I could probably be part of again, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, but there is no, as they've done that the Republicans haven't done a great job or the Conservatives or whatever on the right have not done a great job of really explaining why the individual is the root of a free society and that we should only care about individual rights and we shouldn't be giving to this group and taking from that group and things of that nature.

Speaker 1:          47:07          This is a winnable argument because it's a clear, clean argument and it's the most human argument there is because every one watching this, everyone listening to this, you, me, everybody, we would only want to be judged as individuals. None of us are sitting or no one sitting there. If you're watching this and you're black, you're not sitting there going, I wish I could be judged the way all other black people are judged. They're a good, bad black people. There were bad black people there would use bad Jews. Nice Muslims mean Muslims. Everybody, you know, great gay people or gay people, everything is out there. And so that's why when these people say, I'm for women. So Mark Hamill, who's Luke Skywalker, and you guys know my feelings on star wars, he tweeted out this thing the other day about this, that we should have all women in politics, but he doesn't really mean that because you don't mean you want Nikki Haley and Sarah Sanders, uh, Sarah Huckabee, Sanders and Republican women.

Speaker 1:          47:57          You mean you want women who behave as you want them to behave. And that's the, the, the silliness and the foolishness. And the lazy thinking of collectivism is that you can't, if I'm for gay people really, are you four Republican gay people or you're for gay people who are into firearms and who happened to be prolife? No, you're not into those gay people. So to say you're for gay people is actually, that's actually sort of offensive. Say you're, I'm for certain things and certain individuals happened to be for those things, but I'm for women. And then the new thing is that if you're the, that there was this real push after the election from the left against white women and the women's march was teaching, we're going to have to teach white women and it's like, oh, really? Do we just have to bow to you forever because we have different political, uh, thoughts.

Speaker 1:          48:44          Oh, it's gross. It's actually greets gross and racist guys. Um, let's see here. Uh, we got about nine minutes left. I want to get to as many as possible. I would love to have you interview some of the climate change scientists who would challenge MSM mainstream media narrative. Have you talked to Mark Stein about that? You know, we were in touch with Mark Stein for awhile and I did Gutfeld show with him once about a year ago and then it just kind of fell apart. Um, so I don't know where that left off, but I'll ask my guys after this and I'm sure we can make that happen. Um, let's see. Uh, do you think the increase in California fires can be partly caused by the numerous red tape regulations to protect, to protect trees from humans? Uh, I don't know enough about the specific, I mean, I feel like this is a slightly trolling question perhaps.

Speaker 1:          49:31          Um, we, we don't know exactly what caused these fires yet. From what I understand. I think one of them, maybe it was a campfire. Um, look, a little of this is just nature. Nature does things now also, we've been in a crazy drought here in la, so I moved to La in February of 2013 so it's not even that, it's just about six years. If I tell you guys that in, in six years, I don't think I'm exaggerating when I would say we've had 20 days of rain, like real rainy days. We've had, you know, some drizzle here and there. There was a couple of years ago, we had like four days in a row where it really rained, but I don't know that we've had more than 20 days of bringing ballparking. It basically, I mean, we're in a pretty dry, pretty dry, uh, time. We're in a drought and you know, when you drive through the hills here in Los Angeles, there are times when when it's rained a little bit and everything's green, and then there's times when everything is just dry and it's like, man, you could set fire to everything just like that.

Speaker 1:          50:29          And then, you know, there's so many houses in these odd crevices and hills, and then the way these Santa Ana winds blow where once the fire starts, it blows it on too. I mean, it's literally blowing embers over there when this was, when they talk about jumping highways. Um, I don't know enough about it specifically related to regulations and everything else, but I don't think everything can just be solved by government regulations, obviously. Uh, and I don't think everything can be solved. I think nature is pretty freaking powerful. Um, so yeah, that's that. That's my thought on that. Um, California seems to be at the past the point of no return. What do you think would have to happen for a peaceful political remedy to the left? This bottomless pit. The state is in. I don't know. It's weird. I mean, look, we have super high taxes here.

Speaker 1:          51:16          I don't know that we get a ton for them. You know, our, our mayor, our governor now Gavin Newsome, uh, is uh, is as far left as you can get. He was the mayor of San Francisco. San Francisco is kind of gross. They have literally have an APP that tells you where human poop is so you don't step in it. The last time I was in Berkeley, our car got broken into on a nice street and they stole my bag. When my, uh, sister-in-law's, or when my brother in law's parents were visiting from out of the country visiting Berkeley about a month ago. They got mugged in broad daylight. They literally tore his mom's rings off her finger, broad daylight. Um, so, and I can look, we go to Seattle when I've been, now that I've toured the whole country, when we go to the cities that are more progressive, those are the cities where there are more drugs and more crime and more homeless people.

Speaker 1:          52:02          It just is. That is just a fact when I've gone to the cities that are more conservative, Salt Lake City, Dallas, things like that. They're beautiful. They're clean. It seems like the economy's you're strong there. You don't see as many homeless people. W I mean it all adds up to something, doesn't it? So I, so what can happen in California? I don't know. I do know that there is a growing, uh, conservative libertarian movement here in California. I don't know that it's really getting a lot of momentum, but when I had John Casick on who's the governor of Ohio who ran for president, obviously he was meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bunch of other people and look arms. Schwarzenegger was the governor, believe it or not, of California not too long ago. And he was a republican. So, you know, these things ebb and flow. Um, but I do think it's possible that eventually, you know, California will tax out all the good people who will just leave and they'll move to Florida and they'll move to Arizona, New Mexico and Utah and Colorado and, uh, and then who knows what will be left here.

Speaker 1:          52:58          I can also tell you this, uh, just from living here, there are way more homeless people here now than there were when I moved here. I don't know what that exactly means. I don't know exactly how all of those policies that have been put in by, by democratic and left the politicians of, uh, laid all of that out. But you know, we shall see. Um, let's see. You have an open invitation to the weekly wake up county libertarian party meeting in Raleigh. I will keep that in mind. Thank you very much. Um, let's see. Uh, Dave, I keep seeing these new laws regarding gender and sexuality and morality. How can people keep track of what's legal and what's illegal anymore? Things could be changing so fast. Um, I, well, I'd want to know exactly what laws you're talking about specifically. What I will tell you is, uh, is, is one of those interesting things that happened to us during the tour was that Jordan and I both had sort of circled a den, uh, Sweden as, as sort of an interesting stop because for us on my youtube channel here, the fifth most watched country, uh, is Sweden, which is really interesting because there are not a lot of people in Sweden.

Speaker 1:          54:08          I think there's around 12 million people. So it's a pretty tiny country. So us is number one, then it's UK and then it's usually Canada and Australia. They, they flipped between three and four and then, um, Sweden and I, you know, I've had a couple of Swedish people on the show, which I think is part of it. Aaron flamme who is a very popular comedian and I met him there and he's a great guy. Uh, and I've had a Tino Sanandaji who's an economist who I had on mostly talking about immigration. These are both a long time ago. Tino is a couple years ago. Right. Um, anyway, um, we both sort of circled Sweden as cause cause Jordan gets a lot of mail from there. We thought what's going on in Sweden, so a, the shows we did two shows in Sweden, they sold out in like five minutes each.

Speaker 1:          54:48          The crowds were phenomenal, like endless, endless cheering. They were so great. My need and greets after were absolutely packed. It was just such an interesting, cool group people. But the reason I bring this up, it related to your question is I thought that most people when we do the Q and a, we use this app called Slido. When people submit questions and people can up vote things. And then with Jordan's onstage, I go through the ones that I think are the best and I pick interesting ones. I pick funny ones, I pick off the wall ones, they pick heartfelt one's personal stories, whatever it is. And I thought mostly we were going to see things about immigration in Sweden because they definitely have an integration problem. Uh, and there were a lot about immigration but, but the vast majority of questions were gender related. Um, and there's, well, we'll have to do a show on this and when I have Jordan and studio, we'll talk about this a bit more, but it's really, really interesting because the Swedes and the Scandinavian countries in Nordic countries in general, I've done egalitarianism really well that men and women are equal and have been equal for a long time.

Speaker 1:          55:44          Sweden right now has a supposedly a self proclaimed feminist government. Men and women are equal completely. And as this has happened, um, what they've realized is that men and women are still different. B, despite equality, that women are more into people and men are more into things. So despite all of the equality that you would want in a society, and that's what they have in Sweden, that there are still more female nurses and there were still more male engineers. So it's like they ran the experiment of equality. We're going to treat everyone equally. Men and women can do whatever they want, everyone can live as they wish. And yet still there are, there are jobs, vocations that women want to do and that men want to do. And that just is so, it's like the social justice warriors of Sweden, which are now very embedded in the government, aren't letting the experiment of humanity.

Speaker 1:          56:33          They did the experiment. How can we do it? Let's keep it, make everyone exactly equal. That's what everyone should want. Well, we did it and now they've got the result. They've got the, they did the experiment, they got the results, but they won't let them have the result because they don't like it because there were still more women that are nurses then and there are still more men that are engineers. So they want to engineer a society. So you'd end up having people doing things that they don't want to do. So would it make more, would it be a better society if you had 50, 50, or exact proportion, uh, male nurses and female nurses and exact proportion, male engineers and female energies? I mean, does anyone think that would be a better free or happier society? Know that would very clearly be a worst tyrannical, authoritarian society.

Speaker 1:          57:13          So it's really interesting stuff over there. And I'll, I'll talk to Jordan about it when we have men. Anyway, I didn't get to everything here, but we'll keep some of these uh, catalog and we'll get to them next week or next month. Um, so yeah, if you haven't joined patrion.com/ruben report and if you join at level one, I take all patrion on questions here. We also do group chats, which I was doing all day, small chats. Sometimes there's three or four people in groups. Sometimes there's 15 or 16 people in, um, uh, there's all sorts of other rewards you can get free meet and greets to my stand up events and all that good stuff. I will be in San Jose at the Improv on November 28th. You can go to Dave rubin.com/events. I'll be at the Irvine Improv in January, um, at the Orpheum here in la on a December 1st with Jordan, uh, Jordan and Ben in studio on November 29th.

Speaker 1:          57:58          I'll be in Calgary and Vancouver first week of December with Jordan. What else? Hawaii with Jordan the day before thanksgiving. I'm literally flying there that morning and leaving that night, which is bananas, but you know, you're just do what you've got to do. And uh, what else? I think I'm at the University of Montana first week of December also, and a whole bunch of, and then we're going to be in San Diego and a whole bunch of other things in January. Whew. That's a lot of talking. All right. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it. Remember it's patrion.com/rubin report if you want to get in on this and we are fan funded and all that good stuff and I'm not going to talk to the rest of the day. All right. Goodnight everybody.
