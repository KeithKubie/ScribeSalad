00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.730
SPEAKER: So please give a warm
welcome to educator and spoken

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.510
word artist, Joseph Green.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.820
JOSEPH GREEN: There's a moment
when I walk onto a stage

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.340
or walk into a
classroom, whether it

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.090
be middle school, high
school, elementary, college,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.060
walk into a boardroom of a
million member organization,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.600
or merely walk into my
four-year-old son's room,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.510
there's a moment where I
panic and I worry about

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.330
whether or not I'm going
to be able to create

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.220
the necessary connection with
the people in that space,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.790
because if I can't then
why did I come here?

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.710
What was the reason for me
choosing to speak in this space

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.620
and be present in it?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.800
So I'm having that
same moment right now.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.930
And it's going to
motivate me, I believe,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.890
to try my hardest
to reach everybody

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.100
who's listening in a particular
and unique way for them.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.880
The power of story is best
shown through storytelling.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.720
So I'm going to jump right
into the deep end here,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.070
and I'm going to do a poem--

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.240
a spoken word poem--

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.950
to begin.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.460
And up until three
days ago I was

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.950
going to do a completely
different poem to start,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.330
but this has happened
again, and again, and again,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.880
and it affects the young
people I work with.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.220
It affects me as a black man.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.240
It affects my son as
a person of color,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.180
who will one day be 6' 7",
if the doctors are correct.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.410
And so I felt like if I was
going to have an opportunity

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.470
to speak at Google, which
is a big deal to me,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.690
if I was going to
have this opportunity

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.520
to try to encapsulate within
45 minutes my life work

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.440
and what that means
to me, I would

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
have to be true to
the voice inside,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670
and this is what the
voice inside has to say.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.500
He's a nice guy.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.900
This poem is
dedicated to my son,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.090
to all those fighting
for black lives.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.590
"Today I am doused in
guilt, and I don't know

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.690
what to do with these hands.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.400
Facebook and Twitter
have informed me

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.000
that my friends have joined
together in digital solidarity

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.470
to fight for our
rights, or your memory,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.110
so this never happens again.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.230
Photos from the front
line of our most righteous

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.950
of selves, inspirational
memes, and hashtags.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.530
I realize this has
happened before.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.820
I wonder if I listen to the
recordings of your murder,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.500
will I feel anything
different to me?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.940
Your life and death is no
more than a Facebook update,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.170
a trending topic on Twitter.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.530
#Ihopesomebodyis
stillprayingforyourmother.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.700
#insertyourchild'snamehere.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.410
#allblackbodiesl
ookalikeuntilthey'remurdered.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.320
I am overwhelmed by
the irrational rantings

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.900
of a society too busy
arguing about whether or not

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.840
black lives are important enough
to fight for, to actually fight

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.850
for black lives,
but as I stand here

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.540
ranting I realize it's
because I don't know

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.610
what to do with these hands that
must hold and protect my son.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.170
They are not bulletproof.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.120
They are made of the
same brown material

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040
that I have seen
so many murdered.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.620
But before I bow at the
altar of suburban flight,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.750
I realize that somewhere
somebody is still

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.510
crying for you.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.570
That somewhere a black
mother is gathering

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.830
all the suspicious
clothing her children own,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.950
dressing the scarecrow
in the front yard

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.160
and burning our post-racial
society in effigy.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.190
That somewhere a black female
is being followed in the Macy's

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.380
on suspicion of being black.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.420
That somewhere hands
up, please don't shoot.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.010
That somewhere why
did you shoot me?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.390
You told me to get my ID.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.640
That somewhere please
don't shoot, it's only a--

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.460
That somewhere I'm sorry my
music is too loud for you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.900
to hear my humanity.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.390
That somewhere, we
still can't breathe.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.270
That somewhere they are toasting
the man who did this to you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.500
and the clans are gathering.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.290
Only this time they
won't be wearing hoods.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.099
They'll be dressed in
suits, cloaked by law.

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.640
Charged with
progressing the doctrine

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.860
that if you do not look
like you belong here,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.920
you can be murdered.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.270
That if you look like you
belong here you can be murdered.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.680
I will not always be
able to protect my son.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.710
I pray that by then black
children and fear, black women

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.720
and violence, black queer
and assault, black trans

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.290
and endangered,
black male and thug,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.580
black bodies and deceased
are no longer synonyms.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.610
At night, when I take my
four-year-old son's clothes off

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.760
I say, "Hands up, Henry."

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.660
He thinks we are playing a game.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.950
I pray that when his
time comes, he will

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.830
know what to do with his hands.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.312
Thank you.

00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:44.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.664
So what's the story
behind that poem?

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:53.330
I feel like I could have started
this presentation in many ways.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.288
I could have said, Hi,
my name is Joseph Green.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:57.590
And I could have added
to the resume of things

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.530
that I have accomplished, but
I feel like in our society

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.530
part of the problem is that
we start most conversations

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.900
as if what we do is who we are.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.860
And as somebody who works with
young people on a regular basis

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.700
to create spaces where
they can share a story,

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.680
and believes that story is the
strongest fiber connecting us

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.720
as people, and nowadays the most
neglected fiber connecting us

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.260
is people, I thought it was
important to be vulnerable

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:35.030
first and say that I wrote that
poem out of the greatest fear

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.590
I've ever known.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.490
I wrote that poem
because I was afraid

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.870
that if I didn't tell
my story, that I would

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.320
be complicit in my
son's death if something

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.680
were to ever happen to him.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.010
And that means-- not that
everybody should find a stage

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.230
like this to speak--

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.470
but that everybody
has a story to share

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.930
and there are spaces where
it's appropriate to share.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.460
This is what I do.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.710
I have trained myself to be a
presenter of thoughts and ideas

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:19.190
and a facet of multiple, excuse
me, a multiplicity of spaces.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.270
And sometimes I think when
I get into these spaces

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.420
and say, you should do
this, or like learning

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.900
how to share your story is
so important, that people

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.610
think I mean like this.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.340
When I mainly mean
in conversation.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.310
When I mainly mean over
Thanksgiving dinner.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.560
When I mainly mean for
young people in spaces

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.560
where inappropriate
things are being

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.240
said, but they're
afraid to speak out

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.360
because of being ostracized.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.700
When I grew up in
northern Virginia,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.130
I grew up in a
primarily white space.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.980
And what that creates is
an opportunity for you

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.390
to sympathize--

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:16.810
inappropriately-- on the behalf
of people who don't necessarily

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.560
need your sympathy or
deserve your sympathy, which

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.820
is to say that I went
around apologizing for all

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.130
of the white people
in my life because I

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.500
had good friends
which meant that,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.695
oh, these people must have
within them the same thing

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.320
that my friends have,
even though there

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.549
were times when my friends
called me out of my name,

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.590
but they were my friends.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.048
They were only
friends that I knew.

00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:44.890
Even though my first
college girlfriend's family

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.050
suggested that they would
take her out of school

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.610
if she continued to date me.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.670
Even though-- and I
kept making apologies

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.560
because I hadn't taken the
time to discover my story

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.456
as a black person in America.

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.080
And it's not the only
thing I identify.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.730
As I say, I'm a male, I'm
a teacher, I'm an educator,

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.230
I'm a poet, but it's one of
the things that identifies me

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.800
before anything else does.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.170
So obviously it's very important
in how I see and reflect myself

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.700
in society.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.880
And so I originally wrote
that poem as a middle finger

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.000
to people who were
only using social media

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.860
to protest this issue.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.550
And I wrote the poem
before my son was born.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.940
So all of that stuff about my
son was added two years later.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.484
I wrote the poem two weeks after
Trayvon Martin was murdered.

00:09:38.484 --> 00:09:40.150
It was a challenge
from a friend of mine

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.460
who was tired of the type
of writing that I did,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.570
which is basically family
relationships, and women,

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.430
and things of that sort,
things that I felt safe in,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.430
because I had not taken the
time to examine what my role was

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.260
in America as a black man.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.440
How dare I bring that up
as a topic in my writing,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.830
in my poetry?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.580
And so I wrote the poem.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.470
I was lucky enough
to be on a team

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.750
from DC that represents DC
at the National Poetry Slam

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.670
that happens in a
different city every year.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.220
It was actually in Oakland
the year that I went.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.037
And I was challenged
by my teammates

00:10:17.037 --> 00:10:19.620
to do something that I had been
challenging young people to do

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:27.290
for a decade at that point,
which was to strip away

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.980
your hate, and your
anger, and your fear,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.564
and that which you use to
protect yourself from making

00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:36.980
sincere connection
with the world,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.340
and talk to me about the thing
that scares you the most.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.360
Put that in this poem.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.460
Put that in front of people
and see what type of reaction

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.959
you get.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.660
That is the very essence
of what I do for a living.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.750
Back in DC I started an
after-school creative writing

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.230
program, a nonprofit
called Poetry Now.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.720
I ran it for five years and then
I was asked to work at a place

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.360
called Split This Rock, which
is poetry and social justice,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.070
smushed into one.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.320
They've been doing
it for 10 years.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.930
They've had youth
programs for five.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.430
I had programs at 14
schools in Virginia.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.110
They had programs in
12 to 15 schools in DC.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.990
We merged them
together and now my job

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.720
is director of youth
programs for Split This Rock.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.900
And people ask me, do I think
poetry can save the world?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.170
Because you speak of
it so passionately.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.320
And I think about that poem
that I just did for you guys.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.090
And I think about the--

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.530
at this point-- hundreds
of thousands of people

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.170
that I've performed it for.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.320
And the work that it's gotten on
the internet and the response.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.550
It was picked up by PBS.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.010
It was put onto their website.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.110
And the spaces where
I've gone, I've

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.250
done that poem in middle
schools in northern Virginia

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.520
where it's nothing but young
white people in the audience.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.340
I've done that in
middle schools in DC

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.950
where there's nothing but young
black people in the audience.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.860
And the conversations that
come from both of those spaces

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.780
would not have come if I had not
been willing to present myself

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.180
in that space, in that
way rather, in that space.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:24.300
And so when we talk about how
do we get one another down

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.960
to have a conversation where
we're not screaming and yelling

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.860
facts and beliefs, I think
it starts with story.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.310
And I've seen it happen
time and time again.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.350
We sponsor an event
called the Hyperbole.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.740
It's a clever name,
I came up with it.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.480
Think about it.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.577
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.910
You're not laughing, so I'm
assuming it didn't click it.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.520
But that's OK,
it's all right, no.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.609
Maybe it's just not funny.

00:12:52.609 --> 00:12:54.400
Hyperbole is a play
off the word hyperbole.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.370
We are the great-- there
you go, there you go.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.910
All you googlers out there.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.330
The idea is though,
we bring together

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.984
100 to 200 young
people into one space.

00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:08.650
And these young people
have been working

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.940
on poems for about a year
in their individual clubs.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:20.070
And they don't realize how
much they have in common

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.430
with one another.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.890
And in DC--

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.800
I don't know what would be
comparable here-- but in DC

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.510
you have DC, Maryland,
and Virginia.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.770
We call it the DMV.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.860
Very different populations of
people in all three of those

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.520
places.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.000
We purposely go out of
our way to bring people

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.190
from all of those
spaces together

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.600
to tell their story
to one another.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600
We do it through poetry.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.891
Some people do it through song.

00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:44.370
Some people do it
through painting.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.977
Some people do it
through forensics,

00:13:45.977 --> 00:13:48.060
which is speech and debate
and so on and so forth,

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.520
but we do we do
it through poetry.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.920
And we find it to be
a very powerful tool.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.170
And so they get together
and it's a competition.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.050
It's also social
justice workshops.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.730
It's also an open mic.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.620
And it's also an
opportunity for one of them

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.150
to win a scholarship.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.510
But above all of
that, it's one day

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:17.970
where they are asked to share
what's most important to them.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.990
They're given space to do it.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.240
It's at George Mason University.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.810
So just imagine you're
a young man who's

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.030
never been off his
three blocks in DC

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.450
and you're transported in
the middle of George Mason

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.380
University.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.790
And there are all
of these people

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.940
and they're all saying, oh
my, oh my god, your story.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.860
It's amazing, it moves me.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.040
And I can see now
for the first time

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.920
that beyond, behind
what is presented

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.764
to us on the news, what's
behind the fear that

00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.180
drove our parents
to move out here

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:59.010
to the burbs in the first place,
behind the media, and movies,

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.760
and songs, and all of the
things that hit the mainstream,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.720
you're just a dude.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.030
And you like comic books.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.140
And I like comic books.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.930
Now, you live in a pretty
crappy neighborhood.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:11.860
Why is it crappy?

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.480
Do I have anything
to do with that?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.220
Does my privilege have anything
to do with creating that space?

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.720
?

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.340
Or can I use my privilege
to deconstruct that space?

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:26.110
Why are we so far apart
when geographically we

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.150
are so close together?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.590
That's the power of
story to transform lives.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.260
These young people
become doctors

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.420
and lawyers and activists.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.700
I am not someone who is
a proponent of putting

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.070
more poets into the world.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.670
I have enough
competition as it is.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.720
And someone once said,
and I can't remember it,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.040
but if you don't have
anything new to add to poetry,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.480
poetry doesn't need
you, so we're good.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.550
There are some people
who have to be in it,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.100
and I welcome in
the space, but I

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.960
think what we're
trying to create

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.867
are poetically-minded
people, right?

00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:05.700
And I will get into
this a little later when

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.580
I have my little
graph up, but the idea

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:14.500
that poetry storytelling,
art in general,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.610
is a way to put down what's
going on in your life

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:24.970
into a space in front of you and
edit it and share it and make

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.507
it a useful tool as
opposed to the weight

00:16:28.507 --> 00:16:30.340
that a lot of our trauma
and a lot of things

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.330
that happen in our life
present themselves as.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.830
And it's not just
for people who are

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.880
good at it, which is the other
thing, we'll get to that later.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.070
So my name is Joseph Green.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.570
I am the director
of youth programs

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.250
at Split This Rock in DC.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.090
I am also a professional
spoken word artist

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.510
and motivational speaker,
whatever that means.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.510
I'm also a person who is
in long-term recovery.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.230
And when I talk about
poetry saving lives,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.454
this is the example that I give.

00:17:05.454 --> 00:17:07.079
So I'm going to do
another poem for you

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.230
all after I take
a drink of water

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.619
because this is
a lot of talking.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.030
And then I'm going to tell
you the story of the poem.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.140
How are y'all doing?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.150
Are we good?

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.020
So far, so good.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.199
Cool, awesome.

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:23.740
I'm assuming that
everybody out there

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.079
is also nodding at their desk.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.420
I appreciate whomever,
and it's funny

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.520
because I'm looking
off into the--

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.750
as if they're all there.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.635
This poem is called "Talk Ugly."

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.120
"The last time I saw
you alive I wish I

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.840
would have talked ugly to you.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.940
Said, put the straw down.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.880
No, I don't want to
take another line.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.790
I should be writing them.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.980
My friend, you are a
composer of music and magic.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.910
Instruct your limbs to
serve a purpose greater

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.140
than self-indulgence.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.380
Do not be fooled into thinking
your pain has sharper teeth

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.000
than anyone else's.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.280
I had a chance, but said
nothing because I was high.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.810
This is how I got started.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.610
A bottle of Jack and a mirror.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.220
Memories and scissors,
dreams drenched in ether,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.919
sliced by razors, potential
rolled like $20 bills,

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:30.710
numbing the feeling on
the tip of my tongue

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.230
that I or this tongue should
be serving a greater purpose.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.530
In a last ditch attempt
at self-assessment

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.420
I decided to look at my life
through the eyes of loved ones,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.499
for they see everything,
especially the ugly.

00:18:42.499 --> 00:18:44.165
From years of drug
use, from lying with,

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:47.390
to lying to angels, friends
I had forsaken taking so much

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.510
more than I had given.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.890
I streamlined self-centeredness
into a science,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.710
but there was a
righteousness there.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.970
A willingness to craft these
ills to alchemy and poetry

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.220
into to a seer
stone, but honestly

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.140
how could I speak ugly
to you when I was yet

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.700
to speak it to myself?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.460
In these nightmares of
hindsight there is no poetry.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.500
No alliterations
to soften the blow.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:15.070
Some realities have no
simile, truth is like truth.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.270
How could I form my lips to
call your suicide a tragedy when

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.700
I left you alone in
that room, kept company

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.680
by narcotics and a
thousand ghosts draped

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.330
in your disappointments?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:29.510
I can imagine all the voices
you heard, all but mine.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.760
Smear make up on to
disgust if you must.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.250
Trust the truth
is seldom pretty,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.560
but she is always beautiful.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.180
It is in times like
these that I need

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.160
you to please talk ugly to me.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.420
My pain needs it.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.510
Too many times we caress sadness
when it needs to be shaken,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.370
torn from its place
of comfort, forced

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.590
to grow wings to survive or die.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.650
Just don't tell me I can grow
up and be whatever I want.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.810
Tell me that whatever I
want better be something

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:54.920
I'm willing to achieve.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.800
That dreams will dissipate
under the weight of addiction,

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.050
and that there is a distinct
difference between living

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.920
like a rock star and
actually being one.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.620
Sometimes, no matter how
many poems you've written,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.360
you are just a
coke-head and a poser.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.300
Fear not, we are all
divinely flawed individuals,

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.070
perfectly ugly.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.800
There's no point in
hiding behind pretty lies.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.770
We are the sum of
the hideous scars

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.980
that hold together the
remainder of our pretty pieces.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.560
The last time I saw you alive,
the last time I saw you alive,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.800
the last time I saw
you alive I wish I

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.250
would have talked ugly to you.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:41.344
It would have been the most
beautiful thing I never said."

00:20:41.344 --> 00:20:42.808
Thank you.

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.248
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.290
So here's one of
a million examples

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.200
of how poetry has saved lives.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.670
So I did a lot of drugs
when I lived in New York.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.290
And I had a few friends and
we rolled in the same circle,

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.404
and we became thick as thieves
or thick as drug users.

00:21:08.404 --> 00:21:10.070
I don't know what the
phrase is, but you

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.500
understand what I'm getting at.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.600
I was fortunate enough to have
still a close relationship

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.940
with my family, which
is to say that I really

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.826
wasn't talking to them, but
they were still talking to me.

00:21:22.826 --> 00:21:24.200
So I knew in the
back of my head,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.510
behind all of the
damage and the drugs

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.460
and the fear and the
guilt and the shame

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.330
that my family was still there.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.140
My friends didn't
have that same thing.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.770
About three years
into it all, I hit

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.950
what we call in the biz
the proverbial rock bottom,

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.650
and I went back home to DC.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.640
My father is a
recovering alcoholic

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.750
helped me into recovery.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.260
And not just
physically here you go,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.990
but like through his life
and his story, and the fact

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.510
that he had overcome
this demon in his life.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:01.490
His life was a statement
of inspiration.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.230
A year later I get a phone call.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.330
My friend John has committed
suicide in a hotel room.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.090
And I went back
up to the funeral.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:19.950
And as is too often the
way in this space, when

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.970
we have lost one of our
own, those of us who

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.630
suffer from substance
use disorder,

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.350
we tend to mourn by
doing the same thing that

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.510
killed the person
that we loved, right?

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.220
So it's go to the funeral, go to
the bar, go to someone's house,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.670
snort it away, shoot
it away, drink it away.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.580
After the funeral
I had a choice.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.440
Do I go to the bar?

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:50.350
Even though it's
been a year now.

00:22:53.666 --> 00:22:55.040
Or do I go back
to my hotel room?

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:06.307
I had this line in my head, if
I had only talked ugly to you.

00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:08.640
I've been a writer for a
while, so every once in a while

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.950
you get a line that sticks in
your head and it's just there

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.810
and it's gnawing at
you and it's annoying,

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.559
and you don't know
where it's going to go.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.820
I decided to go back
to my hotel room--

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.680
sorry, dramatic pause over--

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.830
and I wrote the first
draft of this poem

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.650
that I just read for you,
which is when I first wrote it,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.350
it was six pages long.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.010
And I believe that--

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.270
you know, there's no
way to prove this--

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.630
there was a crossroads there.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:43.190
I had been exposed to art, the
transformative power of art

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.280
enough that I was able
to make a decision that I

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.000
think saved my life.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.375
I don't know if
I would have used

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:54.480
that night and OD'd or whatever,
because that's typically

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.040
what happens.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.740
You go a long period of time,
you mess up, you go back,

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.490
and your body can't handle it.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.320
But I didn't, so there you go.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.930
It goes further
than that though.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.380
I didn't just sit on it, right?

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.870
I took the poem to
a friend of mine.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.190
He helped me edit it.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.060
I presented it at a
poetry competition.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.600
It did well.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.470
But that's not
what was important,

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.890
what was important
is the young lady who

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:33.560
came up to me
afterwards and said,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.850
I haven't known what to do about
this situation that I'm in.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.380
I have a friend who's using
and she's going too far.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:49.290
Thank you for telling
me your story,

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.630
because now I know what to do.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.350
I want to be very
clear about this.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.310
For everybody who
has lost somebody,

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.670
there is no guarantee
that saying something

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.320
will change what happened.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.900
But the inverse of
that is also true.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.560
There's no way of knowing
if you had said something

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.400
what change it could have made.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.360
And so when given that
sort of logical argument,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.330
you move forward.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.350
You do the thing.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.420
And that has repeated
itself 100,000 times since.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.800
That one poem got heard
by this group of people,

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.700
who told that group of people.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.910
And now I have the privilege
to go around the country

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.990
and share my story based on this
poem that I wrote a decade ago.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.890
It saves my life
every time I do it.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.130
It reminds me of
what's at stake.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:52.360
And hopefully it has
been used as inspiration

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.330
to people who do this work
to keep at it because there's

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.980
very little reward in it.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.490
And for those who are
actually suffering,

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:05.230
young people, to make a
change and make a choice

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.880
and make a decision to
do something about it.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.480
But now that speaks to my work.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.450
Now, how does that speak to
my work now as an educator?

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.360
I think any demographic
gets its own best

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.430
advocate for whatever it is
that's ailing that demographic.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:26.510
For example, my poem is
powerful, I like to think.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.400
It is twice as
powerful coming out

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.390
of the mouth of
someone who you believe

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.510
is going through a
similar time of life

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.590
or a similar understanding
of the world as you are.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.110
So empowering young people--

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.130
if the last month
in America hasn't

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:54.530
proven to you what happens
when young people are fed up,

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.916
have had enough, and are
speaking to each other,

00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:59.290
and are making things happen
regardless of whether or not

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:06.130
we give them permission to do
so, there's a lot of things

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.904
that we can talk about
as far as this movement

00:27:08.904 --> 00:27:09.820
coming out of Florida.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:18.906
I was honored enough to speak
at a local march a week before.

00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:20.530
And I spoke about
the intersectionality

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:25.060
of race and gun violence and
how it's super important for us

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.920
to bring all that
stuff to the table.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.290
And that argument and that
conversation needs to happen,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.540
but the fact of the
matter is this population,

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.610
who we often write off as
being so self-absorbed to not

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.610
actually be able to do
anything other than worry about

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.440
themselves, have created this
space where now a generation

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.880
of young people--

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.990
it's a long game, right?

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.780
It's not like--

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.710
2018, are enough
of them going to be

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.280
able to vote that they change
the landscape of politics?

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.020
I don't know, but I
know now that there

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.610
are millions more
young people on notice

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.780
that are paying attention,
that will register to vote,

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.870
that understand
social activism to be

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:16.510
a part of the contract of
being a citizen of a country.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:21.900
And that is powerful, and
they did it with words, right?

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.709
They did it by speaking
to one another.

00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:25.250
They did it by
sharing their stories.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.820
If you look at the
footage of the march,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.130
most of those
presentations were stories

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:34.240
of what happened to them, not
statistics, even though they

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.980
were there.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:41.220
It was story because that is
what gets the metric moving.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.750
You can sit next
to someone and say,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.150
this many people died
from gun violence.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.620
And the reaction is--

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.980
because it's hard to put
humanity into numbers--

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.220
you can sit next to somebody and
say, this is how my son died,

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.320
or this is how I almost
died, or this is what's

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.760
happening in my neighborhood.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.330
This is the fear that I feel,
and I look like your daughter,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.380
and I look like your son.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.890
How would you react?

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.495
And now that puts them on
blast, as we like to say.

00:29:09.495 --> 00:29:10.620
I don't know who the we is.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.440
I like to say,
put them on blast,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.540
to where they have to
address the humanity

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.760
and choose to ignore it or not.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.441
And that's something else, it
gets to people's real motives

00:29:20.441 --> 00:29:20.940
and things.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.800
Because how can you
sit next to someone

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.190
who is opening themselves up,
who is crying, who is broken,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.690
and say, no, I still
think the thing

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.900
that broke you is more important
than how you feel right now.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.356
This motivation is coming
from somewhere else.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:35.950
I'm getting a little
bit off track,

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.783
but that was a really
important thing for me

00:29:37.783 --> 00:29:40.190
to talk about because
it's happening right now.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.200
I thought that it
would be appropriate

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.910
for me to bring an example
of how my young people--

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.780
my young people, I like to think
of them as my young people--

00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.160
how the young people I work
with have taken their story

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.290
and created it into a tool for
advocacy, a tool for change.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.439
And so I have a video
that I'm going to present.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.480
If you're watching out
there you want to hang on.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.930
This is going to
be amazing video.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.660
Whatever you thought
of what I just did,

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.880
these young people do
it 10 times better.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.710
And so we're going to get on
that technical side of things

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.320
and we're going to
make this happen.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.240
Instead, I'm going to
end with one last poem

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.560
before we get into the
Q&amp;A. And I wasn't expecting

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.470
to do this poem, except for, if
you were here at the beginning,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.710
this was the poem I was
going to do at the start.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.010
And it's a sweeter poem.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.910
You might even laugh.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.020
"In a dream I saw the
adolescent version

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.920
of myself leaning against the
wall at a middle school dance.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.660
Appearing nervous
with our head down,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.940
he seemed wanting, if not
needing of some advice.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.330
I pulled out a napkin,
composed a letter.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.790
A literal self-help manual.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.100
Slipped it into my
own prepubescent hand,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.630
looked down and read.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.515
Dear me, dance.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.870
Though you will not be good
at it until your early 20s.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.420
Bear witness to how
solar systems are created

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.320
within the orbits of thighs, how
stars always seem to burn out,

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.960
but shine on as you two-step
through the universe,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.100
don't forget to breathe.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.690
If she approaches,
it was meant to be.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.820
If not, Big Dipper
or supernova, you

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.150
will discover painfully that
the wonder behind dancing,

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.365
like love, is not solely
predicated on the idea

00:31:35.365 --> 00:31:36.990
that you will always
have another there

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.040
to do it with you.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.160
You will often find that you are
doing dancing and loving alone,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.080
but don't you dare stop.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.660
Dear me, or best friend an
imaginary turtle could have,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.400
pick a job, a trade, a hobby,
anything, just not only art.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.530
I'm hungry.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.260
And while this poetry is
feeding my soul, the rest of me

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.490
is famished.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.550
Dear me, or future
obsessive compulsive,

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.470
you have an addictive
personality.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.900
Do not try drugs.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.430
You are going to
like them a lot.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:09.489
They will cause you to forget,
to lose things, most of which

00:32:09.489 --> 00:32:11.280
the universe will never
see fit to give you

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.230
a second chance
with, all of which

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.030
will break your mother's heart.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.630
Dear me, or would-be
knight in shining armor,

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.210
there are monsters
underneath your father's bed.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.910
Those videotapes and
magazines are not manuals.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.440
Only the wrong
kind of people will

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.700
want to be treated that way.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.680
Yes, there is such a thing
as the wrong kind of person.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.740
You will have a hand
in creating some.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.980
Warning, the people labeled
broken-on-arrival cannot be

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.970
saved, just loved and accepted,
as you will one day hope to be.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.062
Joseph, put down the blade.

00:32:41.062 --> 00:32:42.270
Lower the heat in the shower.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.980
Pens are not tourniquets,
paper a poor Band-aid.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.270
It will be years before poetry
will attempt to yellow sun,

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.110
red cape, Superman
save you, stop it now.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.890
Your soul will heal long
before those scars do.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.140
Dear four-eyed
oracle, some wounds

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.320
won't heal magically
with mother's kiss.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.050
Won't make sense
for years to come.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.076
This is just a writing exercise.

00:33:04.076 --> 00:33:05.200
There's no sense in it all.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.460
If I could actually give
you life in a manuscript,

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.090
the instructions would simply
read, only change the parts

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.920
where you hurt people.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.990
Everything else is miracle.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.540
Besides, what's the
worst that could happen?

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.350
You grow up to be me, a
shattered but mending,

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:23.880
sometimes unemployed
literary freestyle

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.680
specialist with a vampire's
thirst for the universe's

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.240
lifeblood.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.530
And young man, I have
loved you all along.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:36.370
Sincerely, Joseph LMS Green."

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.250
Thank you.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.960
I am also that guy with his face
plastered on his own website.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:55.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:56.400
- Hi.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.108
My name's Aniyah.

00:33:57.108 --> 00:34:01.257
I'm 17 years old, and my
poem is called "Dependence."

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.520
"The girl in my math
class thinks the best way

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.500
to go is by her own hand.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.310
Says she wants to wear
a noose like a necklace

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:22.050
and know how it feels to have
sadness stands by her bedside.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.219
I want to lend her mine.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.230
To give her the bits
of this brokenness

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.780
and let her try it on like
a second-hand sweater,

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.719
feel the weight of every
suicide note on her chest,

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.960
and show her how it feels
to make breathing a chore,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.230
and make her rethink making
this seem less burden and more

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.270
beauty, but who am I to judge
her when I'm still writing

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.870
my sickness in present tense?

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.500
As if depression and I still be
lovers entangled beneath my bed

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.110
sheets, instead of a
distant darling that

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.150
smells like yesterday's
dirty laundry,

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.639
the kind I never
bothered to do anyways

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.440
because for once
something smelled worse

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.320
than the stench of death
I grew far too fond of

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.765
because what else would
you expect someone who

00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:04.890
was already dead to smell like?

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.980
And maybe I like being sick.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.160
Maybe it makes me feel
interesting, or feel

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.470
anything at all
because the numbness is

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.710
enough to drive me crazier
than they already think I am.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.170
I'd rather be
suffering than stoic.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.480
And maybe that
makes me a masochist

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.430
for wanting to die just to feel
alive, just to feel at all.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.360
And is it still relapse when
you never really recover?

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.250
When you threw away
the razors, but didn't

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.450
stop hurting yourself.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.240
Just learned to make scars
that don't show up on skin.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.060
Is it still relapse
when you're doing it

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.390
because you love yourself?

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.800
Because your body
believes it's bloodshed,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.880
a sacred kind of beauty, thinks
you're more martyr than murder.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.140
Is it still self-harm when
it doesn't hurt anymore?

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.170
When it's so easy to
want to stop breathing,

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.680
it's like breathing is still
self-harm when you like it.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.610
When it feels good to
feel this bad, still bad.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.990
When it's more security
blanket than sickness.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.960
Feel safe in its grasp
because you know if you go,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.690
it'll be by your own doing.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.230
Without it, you are
a glass half empty,

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.650
and it's no fun having
a head above water

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.744
when you're used to
being so full of sadness

00:36:13.744 --> 00:36:14.410
you're drowning.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.920
And when the girl
in my math class

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.376
says she wants to know how
it feels to be suicidal,

00:36:20.376 --> 00:36:23.240
I will want to lend
her my sadness,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.370
but won't because after
all, what am I without it?"

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.270
- Hi, my name is Lauren.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.190
And the name of my
poem is "So Far Gone."

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:46.790
"Three teenagers squish
into the back seat, cloudy.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:51.400
The blunt is finally
passed and ash falls,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.950
burns a hole in her sweatshirt.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.900
She doesn't notice.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.420
She wonders just
how far gone are you

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.410
when you know how to manipulate
the backseat of a car

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.300
better than your confidence?

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.890
Just how far gone
are you when you

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.670
can read minds and take orders
before they are even spoken?

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.380
Just how far gone
do you have to be

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.445
before you realize you're
going in the wrong direction?

00:37:14.445 --> 00:37:16.440
See, nobody ever
asks after the kids

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.880
who familiarize themselves with
the contours of a back seat.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.370
Or the kids who
can twist and bend

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.920
our bodies to angles too
acute and obtuse to ever

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.520
be considered right.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.970
Nobody ever asked how
corrupted their minds have

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:31.210
to be to feel at home in the
confines of a clouded car.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:33.970
Nobody ever ask about the
correlation between drug use

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:38.560
and sexual assault, smoke
and ashes, liquid's emission.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.720
How far gone do they have to be?

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.140
How far gone was I that I
couldn't bear to lift a hand,

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.730
kick a leg in defiance?

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.220
How far gone are you when
your body feels like noodles

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.050
in the hands of a two-year-old?

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.050
Putty, clay, ready to
be molded and folded.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:55.870
Real boy turned Pinocchio.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.220
Lifeless limbs.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.060
Soul-less stares.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:58.690
Heavy hands.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.200
Liquid lust.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.250
Still smoke.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.590
Nobody ever asked if
the kid's so depressed

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.700
that they get high just
to balance out their lows.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.970
So backseats are all they know.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:08.950
How far gone do they have
to be before somebody

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.890
realizes that they are
not doing this for fun?

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:15.030
Memorizing contours and
controls of backseats.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.810
Taking orders before
they are spoken.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.640
Too far gone to protest.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.300
How far gone do we have to
be for somebody to send help?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.940
How far gone will we be when
somebody finally sends help?"

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.380
- I think I wrote this
poem for two reasons.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:39.690
One was to sort
through and kind of

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.360
figure out all the things
that I was feeling in regards

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.310
to my own mental health.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.050
And the second
was because I feel

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:50.970
like it's so important for not
only youth, but youth of color,

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.700
to hear poems like this
about mental health,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.310
to kind of release the
stigma around it because

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.240
in the African-American
community,

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.829
especially it's something
that's not talked about.

00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:02.120
You keep it kind of hush, hush.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.950
You keep it in the closet.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.660
They tell you
like, go to church.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.530
Pray about it.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:15.120
Like I wanted to write this
poem to give not only myself

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.540
a voice, but other
people a voice

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.180
for what might be going
on inside of their head.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.380
I think one big correlation
between addiction and substance

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.610
abuse and mental illness,
especially when it comes

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.810
to youth, is sometimes when
we say things about the way

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.440
that we're feeling, we're
not taken seriously.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.560
So we want to take
it into our own hands

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.840
and to make this feeling
go away in any way

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.540
possible that we can.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:51.510
So you start finding things,
anything, to take away

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.410
how you're feeling.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.520
And I equate addiction
a lot of the time

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.680
with self-harm because people
look at it and they're like,

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.900
oh, they're doing that
to take away the pain.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.600
But I think addiction
is the same thing.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:15.560
Kids who are self-medicating,
using pot, or like prescription

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.900
drugs are doing the
exact same thing

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.330
that kids who are
self-harming are doing.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:26.110
It's us trying to do
whatever we can to take away

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.400
those feelings that
we're feeling when

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.750
people aren't listening to us.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.890
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:38.812
JOSEPH GREEN: So yeah, those
are two of the young people

00:40:38.812 --> 00:40:39.520
that I work with.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.230
And I think those poems
speak for themselves.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.370
And if you add
what I said earlier

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:52.410
about what the work
does when people see it,

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.930
you realize why it is
important for those poems

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.040
to be coming out of those
bodies to the young people who

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.555
are listening.

00:41:00.555 --> 00:41:02.430
Telling a young person
that if they do drugs,

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.500
bad things will happen.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.060
Well, it wasn't
effective for me.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.670
And so I can't
imagine-- and I know

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:11.307
from work in these spaces-- that
it's not effective for them.

00:41:11.307 --> 00:41:13.140
But to hear someone who
has gone through it,

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.410
who is two years older than
you, and is brave enough

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:19.500
to come out and say this in
front of a group of people,

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.280
the goal is hopefully
we can prevent people

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.580
from having to
live it to know it.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:28.080
Hi.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.170
SPEAKER: Hi, thank you.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:33.070
Thanks for a very powerful
and authentic presentation.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.480
I appreciate that.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.640
I wanted to start with
a question that really

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.660
talks about intersectionality.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.250
You gave us so much of your
personal self and very freely

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:48.010
were vulnerable and shared
your personal story.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.690
And so it prompted
me to want to talk

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.610
to you about the
intersectionality

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.310
between our
self-talk, about what

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.380
happened between like last
year and this year, what

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.330
do people normally do.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.400
And you wrestled
in your self-talk

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.170
with what choice were
you going to make.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.503
Were you going to go to the bar?

00:42:03.503 --> 00:42:06.160
Where you going to
go to your hotel?

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.320
But then you also
told your story.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.810
And I think that both
of those are in play.

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.180
That there's an intersection
between the story

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.550
we tell ourselves and
actually telling our story.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.300
JOSEPH GREEN: Yes.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.679
OK, so to sum it up as quickly
as possible, to fit in more--

00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:24.220
this is me telling myself so I
don't speak too much because I

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.390
tend to talk too much.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:35.090
Once you have your story,
anything of real value

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.570
can only fulfill this
potential when it's shared.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.337
You think of love.

00:42:39.337 --> 00:42:40.170
You think of wisdom.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.530
You think of joy.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.080
All of those things are
great when you have it,

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.400
but they're best when they're
shared in communion, right?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.730
And so the same thing
with, all right, I

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.160
have this voice in
my head telling me

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.970
to try to do the right thing.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.580
How did that voice get there?

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.650
Well, it got there because
other people around me

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.310
at some point in time
had implanted it,

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.470
through lessons, through me
just seeing things happen

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.850
or whatever.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.910
The purposefulness of the
conversation with my father.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.330
The intentionality behind
the parts of his life

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.280
that he then opened
up and shared with me.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.070
Those were all there
forming that voice.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.680
And so that was wisdom
that other people had

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.900
that they shared, and it
came to fruition for me

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.590
in that moment when I was
able to make that decision.

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:31.430
And so when you work with young
people, or you have children,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.580
you realize that
you aren't going

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.550
to be there to make the
decision for them, right?

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:41.960
So when they get
there, you want them

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.000
to have every tool possible.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.120
And if knowing that you
had already been there

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.520
would be a deterrent from
them making the decision,

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:53.520
then you have an obligation
to share that you were there.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.050
And that, again, not necessarily
in a spoken word poem, but just

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.990
a conversation, or in front
of your classroom or wherever

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.490
it is.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:09.050
And I think our society is
made worse by the misconception

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:14.690
that professionalism means no
vulnerability and no openness

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.490
to one's true self.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.650
People work in
cubicles for 20 years

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.680
beside someone who could
be from the same town

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.240
that they're from,
but they never

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.485
have a conversation about that
because that's not supposed

00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:27.610
to happen in the workplace.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.590
Well, I spend 60
hours at work a week.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.660
If I'm not meeting
people, if I'm not

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.540
connecting with other
human beings in that space,

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.531
when am I doing it?

00:44:36.531 --> 00:44:38.030
And the same thing
for young people.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.510
Like my son is in
school 40 hours a week.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.030
If they're not teaching
him how to connect

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:50.870
with other young people and
seek truth and connectivity

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:54.140
through sharing your
own story, then they're

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.300
just teaching them
how to take tests.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.439
And that's I think a
disservice to our humanity.

00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:00.230
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.640
I appreciate that.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.224
Last week at Google we had
Dr. Brené Brown here who does

00:45:05.224 --> 00:45:06.890
research in the field
of vulnerability--

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.306
JOSEPH GREEN: Yeah,
very familiar.

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:12.290
SPEAKER: And she described
vulnerability as uncertainty,

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.770
taking risk, and
emotional exposure.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.000
And you represented
all of that--

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.122
JOSEPH GREEN: Well,
I wish one day

00:45:20.122 --> 00:45:21.830
that her and I could
be in the same room,

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:26.520
and I can say thank you for
what her work has done for me.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.910
It wasn't so much that
she presented it and I was

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:29.990
like, oh, vulnerability.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:33.350
It was she allowed me
to put a name to it.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.800
And the easier I can
access it and reference it,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.840
the easier I can give
it to other people.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.800
And so I really appreciate
her work and what she does.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.440
It's cool that
anything I do like

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.040
brought her name
up in your head.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.290
SPEAKER: Yeah, that's awesome.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:52.580
Well, it also made me think, as
I was listening to that, about

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.860
vulnerability and
certainly, you gave us

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:58.580
a lot of exposure into your
emotions and into your life.

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.270
And a lot of people use the
spoken word as an outlet.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:05.360
So it's something that they
do on the side as a way

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.362
to nurture and do self-care.

00:46:07.362 --> 00:46:08.570
What do you do for self-care?

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.220
What's your outlet?

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.400
JOSEPH GREEN: So meditation.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.200
Meditation, meditation.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:22.970
It seems so simple, but
practice, having a practice

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.870
of anything, whether
it's yoga, or kickboxing,

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:30.260
or whatever, meditation,
having a consistent thing

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.150
over and over again, it
brings you back down to earth

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:39.080
when the world is
trying to tether

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.910
that string with
all of the stress

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:43.760
and BS that is everyday life.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.420
I try not to flirt with
the idea of-- you know,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.290
with greater meaning,
why are we here?

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:50.960
So on and so forth.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.260
But it allows me to
look at the battles that

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:58.160
are right in front of me and
say, OK, come back to yourself.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.060
Humble yourself.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.790
Relax yourself so that you can
be the best version of yourself

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:02.960
to continue to do this work.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.820
Because it's bruising, right?

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.970
Whenever you help someone
else with their trauma,

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.867
you expose yourself
to that trauma,

00:47:09.867 --> 00:47:12.200
and therefore, it becomes a
traumatic experience for you

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:12.910
also.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.990
And I think people who
do this work sometimes

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:17.762
find that out, most times
find that out the hard way.

00:47:17.762 --> 00:47:19.970
They was like, they wanted
to do it their whole life.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.590
They've been in social work
for three years and all

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.060
of a sudden they're
burned out, and they can't

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.590
do anything about it anymore.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.570
And they can't feel anymore.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:30.900
I think I hit that road
maybe five years ago.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.740
And then mindfulness,
Buddhism, all of those things

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.100
came into my life.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.450
And that's how I
take care of myself.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.160
And to try to spend as
much time with the people I

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.020
love as I possibly can.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.000
SPEAKER: So recently
there have been incidents

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.760
in places from
Sacramento to Parkland

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.710
that have impacted
families and young people

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:56.220
to create movements, like March
Our Lives, that you referenced.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.610
How are the kids you work with
using these to create movements

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.020
to change our world?

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.960
And how can adults engage
and support our children?

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.280
JOSEPH GREEN: OK.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.300
So what we do in DC
with Split This Rock

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.990
and the spoken word movement
that we have in DC is not new.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.470
We're not the only organization
in America doing it.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:24.230
And I can think of 15
in California alone.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:27.170
Resources speak volumes.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:31.490
So I have young people
who do poetry slams.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.380
And they look out
in the audience

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.770
and they see five adults.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.930
Before I came here, the
day before I came here,

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.592
was our grand slam final.

00:48:40.592 --> 00:48:42.050
The five young
people, they've been

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:43.840
part of hundreds
of young people who

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.230
have been trying to get
to this one little space.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:53.180
And the adults in the room gave
validation to their experience.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.820
They also paid to get
in, so that helps also

00:48:55.820 --> 00:49:02.560
to allow them to go on this
trip now to the Brave New Voices

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.210
competition, that's sponsored
by Youth Speaks, which is out

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.580
of the Bay Area.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.590
And it's that.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:15.370
When we talk about what are the
revolutionary things that we

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.740
can do on a daily
basis, it's not always

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.990
destroying or tearing
something down,

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.810
even though that is
necessary and a natural part

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:23.890
of existence.

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:29.270
But the conversations that
they have, the creativity that

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:33.740
is shared, and doing
everything they

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.220
can to create these
spaces and then back up.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.170
I create space.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.930
I bring in facilitators who talk
about social justice issues,

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.340
and then I go away.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.900
And I let what's going to
happen in that space happen.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.650
And then when the young
people come to you

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.050
and say, I have this idea,
well, how can you hope make

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.660
that idea come to fruition?

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.790
And I think the
March for Our Lives

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.070
is a great example of that.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.130
Young people had an idea.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.630
They didn't have
the money to do it.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:01.880
They had the idea.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.420
Adults gave them the
support that they could,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.340
the years of wisdom and
experience and resources,

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.320
and they were able to
make this idea happen,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.730
and they get out of the way.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:12.720
And look what's going on.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.220
Yes.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:13.910
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:14.960
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious to know.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.418
Something I really
connect with you

00:50:16.418 --> 00:50:19.850
is sharing like an
authentic voice in story.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.760
I'm wondering if
you ever kind of had

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.620
wanted to release
a poem, or didn't,

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.080
because it kind of affected
someone else in your life?

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.615
Because I feel a lot of that
messaging is share your story.

00:50:29.615 --> 00:50:31.240
And I've wanted to
share certain things

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.829
and then people
are like, well, you

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.370
know, if you're in
a bad relationship

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:36.120
or someone in your
family has hurt you,

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.800
how do you know to like cross
that line of sharing versus you

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.010
might really hurt
someone in your life?

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.710
JOSEPH GREEN: That is a very
great question and something

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.290
that I have dealt with directly.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.200
So I alluded to
my father earlier.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.800
I have a poem that's just
about our relationship,

00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.490
and how I ran into
addiction, running away

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.970
from the broken man that
I had saw growing up,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:09.080
and how him seeking
recovery when I needed it,

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.300
he was there for me.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.560
So it ends well.

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.170
But to do that I had to expose
certain things about him

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.980
that members of our
family didn't know.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.670
And I think that
there's two things.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.740
One, you always have
to measure for yourself

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.530
is the juice worth the squeeze.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:28.690
The juice for me in
this space was the lives

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.490
that I think I have affected
and maybe even partially saved--

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.330
been part of the saving of--

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:38.060
because I was willing to
put that story out there.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.630
I remember that night he
saw it the first time.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.080
I did it for him an event.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.579
My parents don't come out
to a lot of my events.

00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:46.870
The spoken word world isn't
really where they hang out.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.670
They're church folks.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:50.170
But they do support
when they can.

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:52.480
So he came out, I said, dad,
I've been doing this poem.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.700
I feel kind of bad that I
haven't done it in front

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.949
of you, or shared it with you.

00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:58.030
So I gave him a
book with it in it,

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.300
and then I did the poem in front
of this place of 200 people.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.750
And in that moment he
cried and gave me a hug

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.910
and it was beautiful.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.430
Fast forward six months.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.800
I'm at a different event,
somebody records it.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.939
They ask if they
can put it online.

00:52:13.939 --> 00:52:15.980
It's going to go to some
people who do this work,

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.150
and they can use the poem,
maybe 600 people or so.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:25.490
It gets picked up by not
BuzzFeed, somebody else,

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:28.120
one of those things.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.497
And it goes viral.

00:52:29.497 --> 00:52:31.330
And all of a sudden
he's getting phone calls

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:34.930
from family members, did you
know your son put this out

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:35.860
about you?

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.620
And then it became a problem.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:45.450
And then he read the
comments underneath the poem.

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:49.260
And I think that's
where his anger went.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.140
I think that if you've
messed up in your life

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.570
at some point in
time, and you know

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:59.100
that there are going to be
people who are made better

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.130
or made whole by
hearing your story,

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.440
if your heart is
in the right place,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.970
you learn how to suck it up.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.270
You know, you realize
that this is a good thing.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.870
That being said, I've
seen it go both ways.

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:15.100
It's your story though.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:20.082
And we can't interact with
people in this world assuming

00:53:20.082 --> 00:53:21.790
that if I do something
bad, they're never

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.280
going to say anything about it.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.716
Because that's
two wrongs, right?

00:53:25.716 --> 00:53:27.340
That's the wrong of
me doing the thing,

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.580
and then the wrong of me
hoping that you don't share it,

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.570
which means that you
have to sit on this thing

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.610
that I did to you.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:35.350
And that's not fair.

00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:37.960
So as long as it's your
story and you're not

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.390
using it to purposely
defame someone,

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:45.210
I think you have
to do it, personal.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.950
Juice is worth the
squeeze though.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:47.783
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:47.783 --> 00:53:48.914
JOSEPH GREEN: Thank you.

00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:50.580
SPEAKER: Thank you
for coming to Google.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.600
We so appreciate
your being here.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.220
I know it was about 18
months to get you here.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:59.010
How do we stay in contact and
continue the conversation?

00:53:59.010 --> 00:53:59.760
JOSEPH GREEN: Yes.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.090
So I would love for everyone
who's out there listening right

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.980
now to just find me online.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.060
You can go to my website
and it's lmsvoice.com,

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.110
as in last man
standing, lmsvoice.com,

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:20.640
or it's Joseph LMS Green
on all social media.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.550
I do my best to post
stories of the young people

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.600
that I work with.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.360
I do my best to
tell the experiences

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.040
that I'm going through.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.344
I use my social media
to hopefully bring joy,

00:54:33.344 --> 00:54:35.760
because I feel like that's the
most important thing that I

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.960
can give.

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.850
I've fought so hard to
get it and to share it.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:43.650
So that's what you would be
getting if that's the case.

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:45.540
And also, if you're
a person out there

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.880
who works with
people who you think

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.295
could benefit from
the work that we do,

00:54:50.295 --> 00:54:52.890
if you shoot me an email
through my website,

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.320
we have an online curriculum
at Split This Rock

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.940
that is free for everybody.

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.600
And I will send you
the link to that.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.410
And it's hundreds of
workshops and writing prompts

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.660
and ways to start
clubs and movements

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.140
in your own community.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.660
So either one of those things.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.999
Please be in touch.

00:55:07.999 --> 00:55:08.790
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:09.580
JOSEPH GREEN: Happy to be here.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.540
Thank you.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.790
And thank all of you!

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:14.540
