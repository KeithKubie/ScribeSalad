00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.960
Hopefully, once your app is
launched on the Google Play store,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.840
you will have lots of users who
will use your app constantly.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.110
So if you've got Analytics enabled,
then every time a user does

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.580
anything with your app,
a hit will be sent to Analytics.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.500
But now you might start worrying about
impact on performance and battery drain

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.210
from sending all these outbound requests
over the network so frequently.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.660
Because every outbound request
needs to wake up the battery.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.670
Relax, you don't need to
worry about battery drain,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.750
because the engineers at Google
already worried about it for you.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.540
They designed the Google analytics
class to batch up requests,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.310
to reduce pings to the battery,
which means adding analytics to your app

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.020
has a minimal effect on performance and
battery usage.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.340
Android devices have a central analytics
service, that's shared by all apps.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.230
So when a user uses an app,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.590
that app sends a hit request
to the analytic service.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
This is not an outbound
request over the network, so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.110
the radio receiver and
the battery are not involved.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.630
So the analytics services collects
the hits from all the apps and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.660
batches them up, and sends them
together in two minute intervals

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.450
With the maximum hit of 20 per batch.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.680
It's only this batched request
that goes out over the network.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280
The analytics service takes
care of sending the hit

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.310
at intervals that don't have
too much impact on the battery.
