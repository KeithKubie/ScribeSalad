1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,830
You do what? You Ping Pong? Hate off of
one another. Yeah, unless it's funny.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,660
It can be funny sometimes funny.
Sometimes he hey, good. Hey, funny.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,630
It's just between yourselves.
It's like Patrice. Patrice was,

4
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:17,160
it was one of the best, one of
the best funny haters. Okay.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,570
You okay? You, you bring up a good
point. Comedic hate is a different guy.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,550
A different kind of hate. Yeah.
Communicate Right. [inaudible] in peace.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,530
One of the, not one of the, probably the
best Patrice. Patrice [inaudible] time.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,010
I remember when I would talk and if I was
saying something to you would just here

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,680
now, what would you tell him
about? He's like, Ugh, what?

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,220
What are you talking about?
He's like, just the way you talk

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,390
voice, everything about your voice just
makes me want to punch you in the face.

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,720
We talking about here.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,900
Go after you to,
it's kind of made you feel good too.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,530
Like if you're a comment specially
if you're a comic, like a,

15
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,960
I called opie and Anthony once I
was talking to them and Anthony.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,290
Anthony always has a gun on him.
He carries a gun everywhere.

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,100
Like he has a concealed carry permit
and shit. And I said to him, I said,

18
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,020
do you ever worry that maybe you're
putting out this energy and you're

19
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:25,890
manifesting something like some
sort of an attack on you? Yeah.

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,490
Because you're constantly dwelling on
it and you always have this gun and

21
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,240
Patrice goes, Joe, believe in

22
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,590
magic. Believe me. Conjuring up to where,

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,780
hey man, a positive relative just
starts laughing at sea. He is mad.

24
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,360
And I'm like,
when he would go after you mad,

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,050
it's like you just want
to step back and watch.

26
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,210
I remember he got bill burrs so mad on
time. Oh bill used to get so fucking mad.

27
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:57,390
Beautiful thing about bill burble.
We'd be snap it.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,540
Bill bill was got to get my bag here.

29
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,230
Funny if you went up to him.
None of it's funny.

30
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,750
You're laughing. Can you build
like where's the punchline in it?

31
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,490
There's no punchline. He is so
fucking mad. We the comedy cellar,

32
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,470
the days that we had their man Bill
Berber trees on nail, Keith Robinson,

33
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,240
Jim Norton, Collin Quinn, myself. Um,

34
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,840
when I say we would sit at this table,

35
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,490
we sit at this table for four to five
hours and it will be nothing but beautiful

36
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,000
trash bins to one another.

37
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,210
When I say they used to
give me so much shit,

38
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,970
that's probably why it's
so hard to bother me.

39
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:44,971
Mouth the trashcans that I took from
the age 20 to 24 and my young comedic

40
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:50,530
career about how awful I was.
I had a joke,

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,010
I had a joke way at the beginning
of my career because at a time,

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,030
let me preface this,

43
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:00,031
this was way in the beginning of my
career was a joke that I had about uh,

44
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,440
about a little people midgets
at the time and it's, you know,

45
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:07,240
it was so bad.
She was,

46
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:12,241
I got robbed by cross side Niche and the
joke was I didn't know he was robbing

47
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,000
me cause I was with somebody else.

48
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:20,290
So he was looking at my
friend but he was robbing me.

49
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,380
It was like a play on being
crowd was very, very awful joke.

50
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,160
I remember telling this joke and a
phone book comes flying on the state,

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,400
put trace through a fucking
phone book at me. I'm talking,

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,020
this is the where the Boston comedy club,
people in the crowd, tiny little place.

53
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,220
All you heard was,
and you sit back,

54
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,110
it hits the floor. And I say, Yo, what
the fuck was that? And Patrice said,

55
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,430
read it is better material in
it than what you're saying now.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,390
Crawls does laughing. He's Ugh. They all,

57
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,230
they used to trash me
so bad. So bad man. Uh,

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,010
d your legendary Patrice of news story,

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,560
a corporate trees jerking
off at my house before

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,910
I moved to La. I'm staying in the two
bedroom apartment. I had just got there.

61
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,220
Patrice was coming out. I said, Yo,
you need play Sas. I got two bedrooms.

62
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,020
You can come there. It's my ex wife at
the time. Uh, you know, I come home,

63
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,040
it's like afternoon, like
Patrice. I'm like, Yo,

64
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,570
you haul but traced,
portrays.

65
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,910
I go out in the back, open up the
door. I said, as big as computer

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,673
Paul,

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,190
all I see is his back hunched over like,
like,

68
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,390
it's like baby oil. Right?
And I come in, I'm like, Yo,
what you doing? He's like, Yo,

69
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,380
get out. Get Out. Get Out.
You're jerking off at my house.

70
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,620
He's so sick. He's so fucking sick. Daddy.

71
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:04,454
He didn't stop.

72
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,450
He was so concerned with finishing
that he didn't even break stride.

73
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:18,100
He didn't turn around. If we nothing you
get out. Can you just saw his back hunch?

74
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,120
He came out like seven minutes later.
It was like my bed.

75
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,530
I ain't know you was coming home.
Did

76
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,050
I fucking Patrice Man, I love him
to death. Love him to death. Yeah.

77
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,230
He had the most, don't give a fuck
of any comic I ever met. 100%.

78
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:39,670
Most 100%. Good and bad
though. You know, there was,

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,540
there was a good to it and there
was also some bad to, you know,

80
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,560
a lot of things that didn't have been
for Patrice probably could have happened,

81
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,630
but I think the level of
not giving a fuck, uh,

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,730
prevented some of those days where
he was almost two authentic. Yes.

83
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,190
Like his like GMC. That
was it. Charlie Sheen's

84
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,110
rose who's roast was it that he did where
he just torching everybody else that

85
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:06,470
was on the rose window and then he got
up there and after he signed he saw the

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,010
fuckers on my level.
Why am I here?

87
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,970
What you guys, who the fuck
is this man? Who's this bitch?

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,120
Oh my God. Patrice has so many of those
things. Yeah. So many things. One of,

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,350
one of the best to do it. Uh,
if you, if you are listening in,

90
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,890
I educated at one Patrice on,
yeah,

91
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,280
just I asked did you just
watch a elephant in the room?

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,490
One of his specialists, some of that,
some of the funniest shit ever, man.

93
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,340
And so insightful. He was so
wide, very business smart.

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,970
The way people thought and
behaved would say shit.

95
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,240
Like one of the things that he said
that I tell people all the time, it's a,

96
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,190
it's a brilliant thing that he said it
was, um, I forget what controversy it was,

97
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:51,510
but he was on television with some woman
who was saying that you should never

98
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,540
tell jokes about certain
things, you know, and they were,

99
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,710
they were getting mad at someone,

100
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:58,740
I think it was opie and Anthony
about a joke and he said,

101
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:01,560
you got to understand that all
jokes come from the same place,

102
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:05,160
the ones you like and the ones you don't
like, the ones they make you laugh.

103
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,110
And the ones that make you mad,
they all come from the same place.

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,260
Someone's just trying to be funny. Yeah.
Like sometimes they just don't work.

105
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,950
I, I had a talk, I had
a talk with the, the,

106
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,130
I forgot her name,
I forgot her name,

107
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:21,520
but it was when I was doing all the promo
of upside and I kept trying to break

108
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:24,730
down, you know, where, where,

109
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,870
where the jokes come from.
You know, Kevin, these uh,

110
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,570
insensitive jokes that you told
back then why? What makes you,

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,130
why would you even say those things?
And the hardest thing for me to explain,

112
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:39,964
I was like,

113
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,090
do you think people think of jokes and
while thinking of them think that they're

114
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:47,980
not going to be funny?

115
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,640
Everything that you
think of in a joke form,

116
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,030
you're thinking of it because you think
you're going to get a laugh behind it.

117
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,290
Yeah. The gamble is if I get
the lab versus not get the lab,

118
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,620
you don't get the laugh.
The joke was not funny.

119
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,050
If I get a laugh and I
guess I'm on to something,

120
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,100
there isn't a bunch of thought that goes
into the funny moments that we think

121
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,650
may be great bits.
Yeah.

122
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,120
I wish that I had a more logical answer
to put behind it. I said, well, I don't,

123
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,420
especially at that time, my career,
I just thought it would be funny.

124
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,040
The same way that some people thinks
are jokes funded offer. It's a thought.

125
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,880
Comedians are constantly
throwing shit out there. Yeah.

126
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,120
You're constantly rolling a dice
shit out there. Had the shits.

127
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:35,320
You role and good. Right. It's not
going to be good. The other half,

128
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,260
maybe all right,
may be kind of good,

129
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,450
but it's all with the intent
of entertaining is not
what the intent of being

130
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,810
malicious is.

131
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:49,390
Not what the intent of sparking hatred
is all trying to make you laugh.

132
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,880
Yeah. That's it. Like it's,

133
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,890
it's literally that simple from a
thought within a comedian's mind.

134
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,930
Yeah. Nothing, nothing else. And
they kept trying to look for this,

135
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:05,100
like a hard definition of why.
And I was like,

136
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,480
I don't have it.

137
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,580
I don't have the reason why
I thought it would be funny.

138
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:15,150
And it wasn't.
That's the downfall.
