00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.580
Thanks to the modern miracles that are science
and the post office it’s possible to get

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.910
just about anything in the mail now, from
uncooked meals to DNA tests to a wig for your

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.910
dog.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.099
And while I could talk about dogs in wigs
all day, this episode is actually about those

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.359
DNA kits.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.000
Just how accurate are they, and how much stock
should you put in the results?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.029
Private companies have offered these DNA tests
for over a decade, but recently they’ve

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.029
gone mainstream.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.670
We even had an episode where Trace and Amy
tried them out.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.689
The concept is pretty simple, you just spit
in a tube and send it off to a stranger, except

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.360
this time they actually want your spit for
once.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.180
The company’s lab extracts your DNA from
the cells in your spit and compares it to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.340
DNA in their database.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.489
A couple of months later, you get a breakdown
of information about your ancestry, how at

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.100
risk you may be for some disease, and a bunch
of other stuff.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.100
Such and such percentage from Africa and a
high risk for maple syrup urine disease and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.100
so on.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.489
It sounds cut and dry but there are a ton
of asterisks along the way.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.260
First there’s the fact that only a small
percentage of your DNA is getting tested.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.101
You’ve got over 6 billion base pairs in
your 46 chromosomes (go you) and they get

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.100
passed on randomly from your parents.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.850
The results can vary a lot, even among siblings.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.479
One test of fraternal twins found one twin’s
DNA was nearly twice as British and Irish

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.560
as the other.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.930
Obviously they have the same parents so they
have the same family history, but the DNA

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
that was passed down to them and then tested
was wildly different.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.750
To complicate things further, there is no
one definitive gene from anyone that pinpoints

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.020
where they’re from.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.950
Instead there are sets of genetic markers
that populations might share.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.810
Not everyone in that group will get all those
genes, and some people from other places may

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.530
have some of the same genes by coincidence.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.229
So when you get your results back from these
tests and you see that you’re 25% european,

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.450
it doesn’t mean one quarter of your ancestors
were european.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.300
It means a quarter of the genetic markers
they were able to test seem to be prevalent

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.490
the most in Europe.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.840
Plus, the DNA you send in is not getting compared
to a massive representative sample -- these

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.790
companies are using as few as 115 people from
certain regions to define what the genetic

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.930
markers of people from that region are.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.210
That’s not a ton of people, and remember
how much genes can vary even between siblings.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.229
So using these tests to trace where you come
from is fuzzy at best.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.300
But they do have another compelling use: identifying
if you carry the genes for certain diseases.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.620
Again, this topic isn’t as straightforward
as you might think.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.480
These tests can identify if you have genes
associated with certain diseases, but they

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.300
can miss minor variations to the genes, leading
you to think you’re not at risk for a disease,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.670
when in fact, you are.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.390
But even if you do test positive for one of
these genes it doesn’t mean you will 100%

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.489
get that disease, it just means you are more
likely to get it.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.410
You are at risk, and you can pass that risk
on to your children.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.670
If you take a DNA test that shows you carry
genes associated with parkinson's disease,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.040
your risk of getting it is higher, but other
factors like age could have more of an impact

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.910
than just having this gene.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.470
These results are nuanced, and it’s important
to go over them with a doctor who can walk

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.319
you through what they really mean.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.190
These tests can be empowering and help you
learn about who you are and what your future

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.269
might hold.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.800
But they’re less like the gospel truth and
more like a horoscope with more accurate results.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.209
I wouldn’t plan your entire identity and
future around one DNA test.
