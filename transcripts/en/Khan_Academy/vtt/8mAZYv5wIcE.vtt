00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.800
So I've got three lines in R2,
and I want to find their

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.600
intersection.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.430
So the first one is 2x minus y
is equal to 2, the second one

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:20.550
is x plus 2y is equal to 1, and
the third one is x plus y

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.520
is equal to 4.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.790
So let's first just graph these,
just to have a visual

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.040
representation of what
we're trying to do.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.380
So I like writing my lines in
y equals mx plus b form.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.040
So this top line becomes what?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.630
Minus y is equal to minus
2x, minus 2x plus 2.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.810
I just subtracted 2x
from both sides.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.140
Or we could write that y
is equal to 2x minus 2.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.900
That's the first line here.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.350
The second line-- I'm doing it
in green --we could write this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.630
as 2y is equal to minus x plus
1, or we could write that y is

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.130
equal to minus 1/2 x plus 1/2.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.540
I just divided both
sides by 2.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.880
And this last line right here,
we could write this as y is

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.760
equal to minus x plus 4.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.440
Go straight here.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.360
y is equal to minus x plus 4.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.570
Now let me graph these.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.100
Let me draw an axis,
that is my y-axis.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
I can call it my y-axis since
we're actually dealing with x

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.590
and y's now.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.710
I'll do it slightly lighter.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.670
I'll do it in this
grey as well.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.470
I'd say that is my x-axis.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.790
Just like that.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.580
And this first guy is going
to be 2x minus 2.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.180
So it's y-intercept is going
to be at minus 2.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.920
It's going to have a slope of
2, so it's going to be a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.720
pretty steep line,
just like that.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.870
So that's that first line,
just like that.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.270
2x minus 2.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.780
The next line is 1/2,
minus 1/2, plus 1/2.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.290
So if we go plus 1/2, that's
right there, and then the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.760
slope is minus 1/2.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.290
So for every 2 we go
over, we go down 1.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.760
So it's going to be like that.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.289
It's actually going to
be orthogonal, right?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.355
Because it's the negative
inverse of this guy.

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:14.820
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.940
We draw it like that,
just like that.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.150
And this guy is minus
x plus 4.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.940
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, and you go
minus x, so for every 1 you go

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.000
over, you go down 1.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.290
So this other line is going to
look something like this.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.540
This other line, this last
line, is going to look

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.610
something like that.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.680
Just like that.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.340
Now, I said at the beginning of
this video that I want to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610
find the intersection of
these three lines.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.570
But notice, there is
no intersection

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.880
of these three lines.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.330
They all intersect the other
two, but they don't all

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.440
intersect each other
in one point.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000
We can kind of call the system
as being overdetermined.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
We've overconstrained it.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.740
There is no intersection of
all three of these points.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.360
So if I were to actually try to
solve this system, I would

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.850
find no solution.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.070
And to say that this has no
solution is equivalent to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.170
saying that this
matrix, or this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.290
equation has no solutions.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.930
Let me write this.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.690
I'm just going to rewrite
the system like this.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.450
This is equivalent to the
matrix, let me make sure I get

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.660
this right, the matrix times
the vector xy is equal

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.610
to 2, 1, and 4.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.440
And so, this first equation is
2 times x, minus 1 times y.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.850
So it's 2 and minus 1.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.340
2 times x minus 1 times
y is equal to 2.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.410
That's that first equation
over there.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.050
The second equation-- actually
I could even, well I won't

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.490
color code it, that'll take
forever --that's 1 times x

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.960
plus 2 times y is equal to 1.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.650
And then we have x plus
y is equal to 4.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.770
This system and this equation,
this system right here, these

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.760
are equivalent.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.410
Now, this isn't going to
have any solution.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.330
You could try to find
a solution to this.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.270
You could create an augmented
matrix, put it in reduced row

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.960
echelon form.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.220
But there is no intersection
to the three things.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.690
So you're not going to find
a solution to A times some

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.550
vector-- we could call this some
vector x --is equal to B.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.480
Or another way to say it, is
that B is not in the column

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.690
space of this matrix
right here.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.370
Now, we learned in the last
video that sure, we can't find

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.590
a solution to Ax equals B.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.600
Ax equals B has no solution.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.890
We see it graphically here;
these lines don't intersect

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.410
with each other.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.820
And you could prove it for
yourself algebraically by

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.076
trying to find a
solution here.

00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:43.680
You'll end up with
a 0 equals 1.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.300
But we can almost get
there by finding a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.780
least squares solution.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.970
And we find a least squares
solution if we multiply both

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.820
sides by A transpose.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.890
We know that A transpose times
A times our least squares

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.330
solution is going to be equal
to A transpose times B.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.180
So at least we can find the
closest fit for our solution.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.160
So let's find the vector
x this is our

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.310
least squares solution.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.120
So what is A transpose
times A?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.730
A transpose looks like
this, you'll have 2

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.760
minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.740
That is A transpose.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.290
And then of course A is
just this thing: 2

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.210
minus 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.760
So A transpose A is going to be
equal to-- We have a 2 by 3

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.620
times a 3 by 2 matrix, so it's
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.240
So it's going to be
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.660
So what do we get, we get 2
times 2 which is 4, plus 1

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.620
times 1, plus 1 times 1.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.800
So it's 4 plus 1 plus 1.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.620
So that's equal to 6.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.770
And then we have 2 times minus
1, which is minus 2, plus 1

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.470
times 2, so those cancel out.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.820
Minus 2 plus 2 is 0,
plus 1 times 1.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.070
That's just going to be 1.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.680
And then we get minus 1 times
2, which is minus 2, plus 2

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.470
times 1, which is 2.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.540
So the minus 2 plus 2 is 0, plus
1 times 1, so we get a 1.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.670
And then finally, we get minus
1 times minus 1, which is

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.710
positive 1.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.870
Plus 2 times 2, which is
4, so we're now at 5.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.880
Plus 1 times 1, so this
is going to be 6.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.950
So this is A transpose A.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.840
Now, what is A transpose
times B?

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.190
A transpose is 2, 1,
1, minus 1, 2, 1.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.200
And then B is just the 3 by 1
vector, the vector that's a

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.680
member of R3, 2, 1, 4.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.470
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.770
This is going to be equal
to-- We get a 3.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.300
Sorry, this is a 2 by
3 times a 3 by 1.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.640
We're going to get
a 2 by 1 vector.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.620
You get a 2 by 1 vector here.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:19.330
So 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1
times 1, so that's plus

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.010
1, so that's 5.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.884
Plus-- let me actually write it
down, I'm going to make a

00:07:22.884 --> 00:07:26.940
careless mistake --2 times 2,
which is 4, plus 1 times 1,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.370
which is 1, plus 1 times
4, which is 4.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.210
Then here, you have minus 1
times 2, which is minus 2, 2

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.640
times 1, which is 2, plus
1 times 4, which is 4.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.790
So A transpose times B is
equal to 9, and this

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.090
is going to be 4.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.970
So we can rewrite this guy right
here as the matrix A

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.560
transpose A.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.630
Which is just 6, 1, 1, 6 times
my least squares solution-- so

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.620
this is actually going to be in
the column space of A --is

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:12.510
equal to A transpose times B,
which is just the vector 9 4.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.890
And this'll be a little bit more
straightforward to find a

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.530
solution for.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.740
In fact, there will
be a solution.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.160
We proved it in the
last video.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.750
So to find a solution, let's
create our little augmented

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.450
matrix: 6, 1, augmented
with a 9.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.850
You have the 4 there,
you get a 1 and a 6.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.630
Just like that.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.860
Let's put the left hand side in
reduced row echelon form.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.200
Actually, first I'm going
to swap these two rows.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.150
That's my first row operation
that I choose to do, just

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.520
because I like to have
that 1 there.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.230
It's a nice pivot entry.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:51.640
So then it goes to 1,
6, 4, and 6, 1, 9.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.180
And then let me replace my
second row with the second row

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.180
minus 6 times the first row.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.250
So I'm going to keep my
first row the same.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.210
So I have 1, 6, and 4.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.190
And then my second row, I'm
going to replace my second row

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.610
with a second row minus
6 times the first row.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.480
So 6 minus 6 is 0.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:23.890
1 minus 6 times 6, that's 1
minus 36, so that's minus 35.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:29.250
And then a 9 minus 6 times
4, is 9 minus 24.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.480
This one always gets
me in trouble.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.510
So 9 minus 24, that's the
negative of 24 minus 9, so

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:41.460
that is minus 15.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.320
Let me make sure I didn't
make a careless mistake.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:51.930
1 minus 36 is minus 35, 9
minus 24, is minus 15.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.710
So that's what I get
right there.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.260
And then let me go to the right
now, so let me let me

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.020
divide this row right here, let
me divide it by minus 35.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.250
So I'm going to keep my
first row the same.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.980
1, 6, and 4.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.190
And then this guy right
here, I'm going to

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.300
divide by minus 35.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.810
So I'm going to get 0, 1, and
then minus 15 over minus 35.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.940
That's 15 over 35, or
that's 3 over 7, so

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.620
that is equal to 3/7.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.300
And then let me just put this
in complete reduced row

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.110
echelon form.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.840
That'll be nice.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.830
Let me keep my second
row the same.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:39.280
So my second row is
0, 1, and 3/7.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.710
And then my first row, I'm going
to replace it with my

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.180
first row minus 6 times
my second row.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.590
So 1 minus 6 times 0 is 1, 6
minus 6 times 1 is 0, and then

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.610
we have 4 minus 6 times 3/7.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.990
So 4 is 28/7.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.360
Let me write it up here.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.690
So we have 4, which is 28/7,
minus 6 times 3/7, so minus

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.980
18/7, right?

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.220
That's 6 times 3/7.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:18.120
So this is going to
be equal to 10/7.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.590
And just like that, I've solved
this new equation.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.010
So you could say that-- Let
me write it this way.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:28.410
We could write that x star--
This is going to the first

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.280
entry of x star, which
we could call x,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.300
is going to be 10/7.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.010
Let me write this.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:42.130
x star, the solution is going
to be 10/7 and 3/7.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.390
So I'm saying that if you take
x is equal to 10/7 and y is

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.210
equal to 3/7, you're going
to get as close to

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.490
a solution as possible.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.240
Let's see what that looks
like visually?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.050
What is 10/7?

00:11:54.050 --> 00:12:05.330
Let me write this down. x star
is equal to 10/7 and 3/7.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.245
We're saying the closest-- Our
least squares solution is x is

00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:13.850
equal to 10/7, so x is
a little over one.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.320
And then y is going to be 3/7,
a little less than 1/2.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.720
So our least squares solution
is going to be

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.860
this one, right there.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:30.510
And so this, when you put this
value for x, when you put x is

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:39.080
equal to 10/7 and y is equal
to 3/7, you're going to

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.340
minimize the collective squares
of the distances

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.600
between all of these guys.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.300
I drew this a little bit
too small to show that.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.790
But let's actually figure out
what our least, what our

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.670
minimized difference is.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.660
Remember, the whole point of
the is to minimize the

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.370
distance between Ax star, is
to minimize the distance

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.450
between Ax star and B.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.660
Or between B and Ax star.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.366
Now, what was Ax
star equal to?

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:20.560
Ax star was equal to 9/4.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.250
So this right here.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.730
Sorry, Ax star, that's not
equal to 9/4, that's A

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.040
transpose Ax star
is equal to 9/4.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.360
Ax star is our original matrix
A, which is this one right

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.590
here, so 2-- Let me write
it down here.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:37.880
I know it's off the
page right now.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:43.410
So our original matrix A was
2, minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.150
That was our original matrix
A right there.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.010
And then our x star,
we were able to

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.710
determine, is 10/7 and 3/7.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.240
So Ax star is going to be
this product, so what

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.740
does it equal to?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.120
It is equal to, it is going
to be a 3 by 1 matrix.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.460
So we got 2 times 10/7, which
is 20/7, minus 1 times

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.010
3/7, so minus 3/7.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.830
And then we get, let me see,
yep, that's 10 minus 3/7, and

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:28.210
we have 10/7, minus 2 times
3/7, so minus 6/7.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.490
Or plus, sorry, this
is a plus.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:30.850
Right?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.280
2 times 10/7 is 20/7 minus 1
times 3/7, then we have 1

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.775
times 10/7 plus 2 times 3/7.

00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:44.180
And then we have
10/7 plus 3/7.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.600
So Ax, so this is A and x
star, our least squares

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.450
approximation for x, is
equal to what is this?

00:14:53.450 --> 00:15:02.590
This is 17/7, this is 16/7,
and this is 13/7.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.750
We want to find out with this
minimum distance is.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.290
So, let's see, this is going
to be this thing.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:17.770
So 17/7, 16/7, and 13/7
minus our original B.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:23.690
Our original B was
2, 1, and 4.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.790
So I'm claiming that my solution
that we just found,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.530
this minimizes this distance.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:32.900
Because this is the projection
of B onto the

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.980
column space of A.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.970
We saw that before.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.910
So our B we see all the
way up here is 2, 1,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.850
4, just like that.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.850
So if we take the length of
this-- let me switch colors

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.450
--this is equal to the length.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.530
Let me write all of us
in sevenths-- I'll

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.340
just do it in my head.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.280
I don't want to waste
too much time.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.150
So this is 17/7 minus
14/7, right?

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.690
2 is 14/7, so this is
going to be 3/7.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:09.980
Then it's 16/7 minus
7/7, so that's 9/7.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.210
And then we have 13/7 minus
28/7, so that is

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.150
minus 15 over 7.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.280
So this is the vector that
separates the B that was not

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.970
in my column space of A from
the projection of B.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.740
And if we find it's length,
it's length is going to be

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.710
equal to-- Let's find the square
of it's length first.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.900
The square of its length is
going to be 3/7 squared, so

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:53.310
that is 9/49, plus 9/7 squared,
which is 81/49, plus

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.470
minus 15/7 squared.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.650
What's 15 squared?

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.860
15 squared is 225, I think.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.440
Let me make sure.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.920
I'm prone to careless
mistakes.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.659
5 times 5 is 25, 1 times
5, this is 75, and

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:10.180
then I have a 150.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.260
Yep, 225.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.109
So plus 225/49.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:24.960
Which is equal to-- So 9 plus 81
is 90, and then so 225 plus

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.510
90, to get a 5, was a 315.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:35.640
So this is equal to 315/49.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.690
Or, if we actually wanted the
difference, that's going to

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.530
square root of this.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.130
So if we take just the regular
distance, that's equal to the

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.180
square root of that.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:56.250
So it's equal to the square
root of 315 over 7.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.310
And square root of 315,
it looks like that is

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.380
simplifiable.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.740
Does 9 go into it?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.880
Looks like 9 goes into it,
maybe 35 five times?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.440
So it would be what, 3 square
roots of 35 over 7.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.680
So that is just a measure.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.500
Let me put it this way, you're
not going to be able to find

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.150
any member of R2, any values
of x and y, that's going to

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.660
give you a smaller value than
this when you find the

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.260
distance between it's solution
and the solution you were

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.040
trying to get to.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.300
So this, based on our least
squares solution, is the best

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.040
estimate you're going to get.
x is equal to 10/7,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.700
y is equal to 3/7.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.560
A little bit right,
just like that.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.180
Anyway, hopefully you found
that useful, and you're

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.620
starting to appreciate that the
least squares solution is

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.240
pretty useful.
