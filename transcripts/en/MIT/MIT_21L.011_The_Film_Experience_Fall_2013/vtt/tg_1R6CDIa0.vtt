00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.190
DAVID THORBURN: One of the
central arguments of my film

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.689
course-- and this
is one of the ways

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.250
it's different from
a traditional film

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.770
course in a university,
in a cinema studies

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.950
program, or even in an English
department-- is that it sees

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.950
the advent of television as a
critical factor in the history

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.400
of the movies, much more
central and critical than most

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.390
contemporary
histories acknowledge.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.120
Because what I try to
show is that the function

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.000
that the movies had in American
society before the advent

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.940
of television was the
function that the novel had

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.250
in the 19th Century in
Europe, and the function

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.030
that Shakespeare's public
theater had in Shakespeare's

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.580
day, a form of popular narrative
that's articulated a kind of

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.990
assumed or imagine
consensus of values

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.840
for the whole of the society.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.180
That made it a culturally,
and anthropologically,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.260
and socially much
more important medium

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.000
then a mere artistic
medium, even

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.790
though it's artistic quality
remains very important.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.330
So that one of the
ironies of entertainment

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800
is it can become a
space, especially

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400
public forms of
entertainment in cultures,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.270
like Shakespeare's
public theater,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.630
or like the public theater
of the American movie

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.840
system in the studio era, these
public spaces can become spaces

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.310
in which the body politic, the
political and social community

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.330
entertains ideas
about its own nature,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.460
entertains,
considers, speculates,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.480
holds in its mind
accounts of its origins,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.650
stories of its values
And what we can say then

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.610
is that the space
of entertainment

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.310
becomes from in a certain angle
in virtually all societies,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.470
a space of discourse, a space
in which-- exactly because it's

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.420
a space recognized as not
real, as make believe,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.060
is therefore licensed or
allowed to explore possibilities

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.640
that might be too dangerous
or too disturbing to explore

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.850
in other way.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.910
And I taught both television
and film in this way.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.130
In an ironic way, it's
a deeply literary way

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.330
to teach the medium.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.830
So the argument ends up
being that the movies

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.100
after television, the
movies after about 1970,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.850
are profoundly a
different animal.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.860
The old studio system is dead.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.760
Movies have become
much more single,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.940
individual deal-making
events using great stars,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.010
and particularly bankable
scriptwriters, and scripts,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.450
and so forth, nothing
like the great factory

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.570
for the making of
stories, the story machine

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.350
that the movies had been until
the advent of television,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.170
and that television became
as it took on that consensus

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.270
function.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.360
I think it's a powerful
and central insight that

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.650
helps to explain the
tremendous changes that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.610
overtake American
movies after, certainly,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.370
after 1970 and beyond.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.570
Another way in which
I think my film course

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.040
is not fully a film course,
even though every text we study

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.750
is a movie, all the scholarship
site is movie schol-- not all.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.120
But some is movie scholarship.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.960
And I try to teach them about
the history of film in ways

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.860
that I think are
helpful to them.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.120
But there is a profoundly
literary dimension

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.980
to my teaching.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.850
And I think of as deeply
as a literature course.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.560
It's a course that,
if a student takes,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.670
serves as a prerequisite for
advanced subjects in literature

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.070
as well as in media.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.660
And my reasons
for that is that I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.530
treat the problems one confronts
in a film from the perspective

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.260
of a professor of literature,
from the perspective of one

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.540
who's a specialist in narrative.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.970
Remember, many of the narratives
that I have taught all my life

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.050
we're not printed
texts like novels.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.350
They wear all narratives,
like Homer's Odyssey.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.300
Or, they were dramatic
presentations.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.800
Like Shakespeare's plays.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.400
Literature has never
meant simply printed text.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.110
And I think my field is
narrative of all sorts.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.700
And what I try to do is show
them, among other things,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.820
certain kinds of
linkages or continuities

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.870
across different
forms of narrative.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.270
And I certainly try
to make them see

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.950
that movies in a certain era,
television in another era,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.860
were like the literature
of earlier eras.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.170
And it makes my film course a
much more centrally literary

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.100
and humanistic subject than
would be the case if it

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.320
were taught in a more
conventional kind of cinema

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.240
studies sequence.
