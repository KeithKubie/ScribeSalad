00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:01.363
- [Voiceover] So we have these two graphs

00:00:01.363 --> 00:00:02.500
that look pretty similar,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.681
y equals f of x and y is equal to g of x.

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:06.831
And what they asked us to do is

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:10.499
write a formula for the
function g in terms of f.

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:11.880
So let's think about how to do it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.030
and like always pause the video

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.716
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.070
All right, well, what I'd like to do is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.102
I'd like to focus on this minimum point

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:22.700
because I think that's a
very easy thing to look at

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.220
because of them have that minimum point

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.241
right over there.

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.203
And so we can think,
but how do we shift f?

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:30.107
Especially this minimum point,

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:33.984
how do we shift it to get
to overlapping with g?

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:36.504
Well, the first thing that
might jump out of this is

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:40.218
that we would want to shift to the left.

00:00:40.218 --> 00:00:43.144
And we'd wanna shift to the left four.

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:46.824
So let me do this in a new color.

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:50.051
So I would wanna shift to the left

00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:52.169
by four.

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:55.542
We have shifted to the left by four

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:58.342
or you could say we
shifted by negative four.

00:00:58.342 --> 00:00:59.967
Either way, you could think about it.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:02.465
And then we're gonna shift down.

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:03.884
So we're gonna shift, we need to go

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:08.138
from y equals two to y is
equal to negative five.

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.263
So let me do that.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:13.026
So let's shift down.

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.455
So we shift down by seven

00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:17.810
or you could say we have
a negative seven shift.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.215
So, how do you express g of x

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:22.454
if it's a version of f of x
that shifted to the left by four

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:24.009
and shifted down by seven.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.633
Or, you could say I have a
negative four horizontal shift.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.106
I have a negative seven vertical shift.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:33.146
Well, one thing to think
about it is g of x,

00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:37.548
g of x is going to be equal to

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:39.644
f of,

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:41.569
let me do it in a little darker color,

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.104
it's going to be equal to f of x

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:48.949
minus your horizontal shift,

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:52.327
all right, horizontal shift.

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:55.008
So x minus your horizontal shift

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.637
plus your vertical shift.

00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:03.637
So plus your vertical

00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:05.689
shift.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.709
Well, what is our horizontal shift here?

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.648
Well, we're shifting to the left

00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:12.192
so it's a negative shift.

00:02:12.192 --> 00:02:15.327
So our horizontal shift is negative four.

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:16.894
Now, what's our vertical shift?

00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:18.670
Well, we went down so
our vertical shift is

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.574
negative seven.

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.257
So it's negative seven.

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:23.476
So there you have it.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.227
We get g of x.

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:28.544
Let me do that in the same color.

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:33.544
We get g of x is equal to

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:37.464
f of x minus negative four

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:40.444
or x plus four

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:43.314
and then we have plus negative seven

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:46.146
or you can just say minus seven.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.382
And we're done.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:48.787
And when I look at things like this,

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.966
the negative seven is somewhat,

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:53.412
it's more intuitive to me.

00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.890
As I shifted it down, it made sense

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.256
that I have a negative seven.

00:02:56.256 --> 00:02:57.424
But first, when you work on these,

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.014
you say, "I shifted to the left.

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:02.741
"Why is it a plus four?"

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.455
And though I think about it is

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:07.705
in order to get the same
value out of the function,

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:09.830
instead of inputting,
so if you want to get

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.150
the value of x of zero,
you now have to put

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.890
x equals negative four in.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.910
And then you get that same value.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.313
You still get to zero.

00:03:20.313 --> 00:03:22.205
So that's, I know if that helps or hurts

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.225
in terms of your understanding,

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:27.151
but it often helps to try out
some different values for x

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:30.122
and see how it actually
does shift the function.

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:32.026
And if you just try to get
your head on this piece,

00:03:32.026 --> 00:03:34.023
the horizontal shift, I
recommended, you know,

00:03:34.023 --> 00:03:35.068
not even using this example.

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:37.529
Use an example that only
has a horizontal shift.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.050
It will become a little more intuitive.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.605
And we do, we have many videos that go

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:42.625
into much more depth that explain that.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:45.272
Let's do another example of this.

00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:48.999
So here, we have

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.926
y is equal to g of x in purple

00:03:50.926 --> 00:03:52.981
and y is equal to f of x in blue.

00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:54.768
And they say given that f of x

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:58.820
is equal to square root
of x plus four minus two,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.820
write an expression for
g of x in terms of x.

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:05.162
So first, let's me just try to,

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.774
expression for g of x in terms of f of x.

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:08.633
We can see once again,

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:10.978
it's just a shifted version of f of x.

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:13.381
And remember, I'll just
write it in general.

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:17.578
So g of x is going to be equal to

00:04:17.578 --> 00:04:22.465
f of x minus your horizontal shift

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:29.613
plus your vertical shift.

00:04:29.613 --> 00:04:31.749
And so to go from f to g,

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.414
what is your horizontal shift?

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:36.597
Well, your horizontal shift is,

00:04:36.597 --> 00:04:38.176
if you take this point right over here,

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:42.100
which should map to that point
once we shift everything.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.675
Your horizontal shift is two to the left

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:48.907
or you could say it's a
negative two horizontal shift.

00:04:48.907 --> 00:04:50.961
So that should be negative two.

00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:53.116
And then, what is a vertical shift?

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:54.962
Well, a vertical shift is removed,

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:58.360
we go from y equals negative
two to the y equals three.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.672
So we're shifting five up.

00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:04.687
So this is a vertical
shift of positive five.

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:06.823
So your vertical shift is five.

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:08.095
So if we just want to write g of x

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:11.628
in terms of f of x like we just
did in the previous example,

00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:16.047
we could say g of x is
going to be equal to f of x

00:05:16.047 --> 00:05:19.751
minus negative two which is x plus two.

00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.039
And then we have plus five.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.583
But that's not what they asked us to do.

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:25.023
They asked us to write.

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:26.207
They, whoops.

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:28.482
They asked us to write an expression

00:05:28.482 --> 00:05:30.607
for g of x in terms of x.

00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:32.104
And so here we're actually gonna use

00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:34.786
the definition of f of x.

00:05:34.786 --> 00:05:36.342
So let me make it clear.

00:05:36.342 --> 00:05:40.147
We know that f of x is going

00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:42.377
to be equal to square root

00:05:42.377 --> 00:05:46.833
of x plus four minus two.

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:49.635
So given that,

00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:52.513
what is f of x plus two?

00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:56.619
Well, f of x plus two
is going to be equal to,

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.372
everywhere we see an x,
we're gonna replace it

00:05:58.372 --> 00:05:59.672
with an x plus two.

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:04.672
Square root of x plus two plus four

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.565
minus two

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:09.350
which is equal to the square root of

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.043
x plus six minus two.

00:06:13.043 --> 00:06:14.228
Well, that's fair enough.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:15.691
That's just f of x plus two.

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:19.310
Now, what is f of x plus two plus five?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.310
So f of x plus two plus five

00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:28.368
is going to be in this thing
right over here plus five.

00:06:28.368 --> 00:06:31.131
So it's going to be
equal to square root of

00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:33.903
x plus six minus two

00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:37.029
and I'm going to add five,
with a different color.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.523
So plus five,

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.543
so plus five.

00:06:40.543 --> 00:06:43.249
And so what we end up with

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.255
is going to be square root of

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:49.157
x plus six minus two plus five

00:06:49.157 --> 00:06:50.840
is going to be plus three.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.302
So that is equal to g of x.

00:06:53.302 --> 00:06:54.997
Just as a reminder, what do we do here?

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:58.482
First, I expressed g of
x in terms of f of x.

00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:00.293
Let's say, hey, to get
from f of x to g of x,

00:07:00.293 --> 00:07:01.853
I shift two to the left.

00:07:01.853 --> 00:07:03.068
Two to the left.

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:05.056
So we're kinda intuitive, plus two

00:07:05.056 --> 00:07:07.305
makes it a shift of two to the left.

00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:10.103
This was minus two would be
shifted two to the right.

00:07:10.103 --> 00:07:12.285
But like I just said in
the previous example,

00:07:12.285 --> 00:07:13.748
it's good to try it some x's

00:07:13.748 --> 00:07:15.559
and to see why that makes sense.

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:17.219
And then we shifted five up.

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:19.367
So this was g of x in terms of f of x.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:22.547
Then they told us what f of
x actually is in terms of x.

00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:25.543
So we said, "Okay, well,
what is f of x plus two?"

00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:28.248
F of x plus two, we
substituted x plus two for x

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.571
and we got this.

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:32.961
But g of x is f of x plus two plus five.

00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.445
So we took what we figured
out f of x plus two is

00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:38.081
and then we added five
and that's what g of x is.

00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:39.955
And then we are all done.
