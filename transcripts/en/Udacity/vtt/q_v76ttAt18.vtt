00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.170
In order to help the garbage collector do its job,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.400
you want to be sure you're not holding on to objects

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.020
that you no longer need. The easiest way to do

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.650
this is to use an appropriate scope for your variables. Instead

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.160
of using a global variable, that you then have to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.529
dynamically allocate and de-allocate, just use a function scope local variable.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.830
When it goes out of scope the garbage collector can take

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.050
care of it. Also, be sure to unbind any event listeners

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.960
before the dumb objects they're bound to are to be removed.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.350
And finally, if you're using a local data cache be sure to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.400
clean the cache through using aging mechanism to avoid any large

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.340
chunks of data being stored that you don't really need any more.
