00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.230
This problem is from chapter
five of the Kotz, Treichel,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.860
Townsend Chemistry and Chemical
Reactivity textbook.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.280
So they tell us, suppose you
want to know the enthalpy

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.090
change-- so the change in
total energy-- for the

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.140
formation of methane, CH4,
from solid carbon as a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410
graphite-- that's right there--
and hydrogen gas.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.640
So we want to figure
out the enthalpy

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.590
change of this reaction.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.130
How do we get methane-- how
much energy is absorbed or

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670
released when methane is formed
from the reaction of--

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.740
solid carbon as graphite
and hydrogen gas?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.080
So they tell us the enthalpy
change for this reaction

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.590
cannot to be measured in the
laboratory because the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.440
reaction is very slow.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470
So normally, if you could
measure it you would have this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.320
reaction happening and you'd
kind of see how much heat, or

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.140
what's the temperature change,
of the surrounding solution.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.820
Maybe this is happening so slow
that it's very hard to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.380
measure that temperature change,
or you can't do it in

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.600
any meaningful way.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.140
We can, however, measure
enthalpy changes for the

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.660
combustion of carbon, hydrogen,
and methane.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.420
So they're giving us the
enthalpy changes for these

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.660
combustion reactions--
combustion of carbon,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.760
combustion of hydrogen,
combustion of methane.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.050
And they say, use this
information to calculate the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.410
change in enthalpy for
the formation of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.370
methane from its elements.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.440
So any time you see this kind
of situation where they're

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.740
giving you the enthalpies for a
bunch of reactions and they

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
say, hey, we don't know the
enthalpy for some other

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.710
reaction, and that other
reaction seems to be made up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.590
of similar things, your brain
should immediately say, hey,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.530
maybe this is a Hess's
Law problem.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.960
Hess's Law.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.450
And all Hess's Law says is that
if a reaction is the sum

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.610
of two or more other reactions,
then the change in

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.520
enthalpy of this reaction is
going to be the sum of the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.890
change in enthalpies
of those reactions.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.600
Now, when we look at this, and
this tends to be the confusing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.240
part, how can you construct
this reaction out of these

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.790
reactions over here?

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.560
And what I like to do is just
start with the end product.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.630
So I like to start with the end
product, which is methane

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.120
in a gaseous form.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.870
And when we look at all these
equations over here we have

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.100
the combustion of methane.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.850
So this actually involves
methane, so

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.140
let's start with this.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200
But this one involves
methane and as a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.070
reactant, not a product.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.480
But what we can do is just flip
this arrow and write it

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.820
as methane as a product.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.260
So if we just write this
reaction, we flip it.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.090
So now we have carbon dioxide
gas-- let me write it down

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.680
here-- carbon dioxide gas plus--
I'll do this in another

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.720
color-- plus two waters-- if
we're thinking of these as

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.100
moles, or two molecules of
water, you could even say--

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.950
two molecules of water
in its liquid state.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.570
That can, I guess you can say,
this would not happen

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.680
spontaneously because it
would require energy.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.450
But if we just put this in the
reverse direction, if you go

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.160
in this direction you're going
to get two waters-- or two

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.330
oxygens, I should say-- I'll
do that in this pink color.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.140
So two oxygens-- and that's in
its gaseous state-- plus a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.390
gaseous methane.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.380
CH4.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.160
CH4 in a gaseous state.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.670
And all I did is I wrote this
third equation, but I wrote it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.420
in reverse order.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.460
I'm going from the reactants
to the products.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.220
When you go from the products
to the reactants it will

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.720
release 890.3 kilojoules
per moles of the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.290
reaction going on.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.920
But if you go the other way it
will need 890 kilojoules.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.380
So the delta H here-- I'll do
this in the neutral color-- so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.650
the delta H of this reaction
right here is going to be the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.720
reverse of this.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.290
So it's positive 890.3
kilojoules

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.160
per mole of the reaction.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.390
All I did is I reversed
the order of this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.660
reaction right there.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.810
The good thing about this is I
now have something that at

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.690
least ends up with what
we eventually

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.350
want to end up with.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.630
This is where we want to get.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.000
This is where we want
to get eventually.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.130
Now, if we want to get there
eventually, we need to at some

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.000
point have some carbon dioxide,
and we have to have

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.590
at some point some water
to deal with.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.410
So how can we get carbon
dioxide, and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.300
how can we get water?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.980
Well, these two reactions right
here-- this combustion

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.550
reaction gives us carbon
dioxide, this combustion

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.920
reaction gives us water.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.380
So we can just rewrite those.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.180
Let me just rewrite them over
here, and I will-- let me use

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.720
some colors.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.060
So if I start with graphite--
carbon in graphite form--

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.630
carbon in its graphite form
plus-- I already have a color

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.980
for oxygen-- plus oxygen in
its gaseous state, it will

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.870
produce carbon dioxide
in its gaseous form.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.430
It will produce carbon-- that's
a different shade of

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.840
green-- it will produce carbon
dioxide in its gaseous form.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.620
And this reaction, so when you
take the enthalpy of the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.370
carbon dioxide and from that you
subtract the enthalpy of

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.030
these reactants you get
a negative number.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.120
Which means this had a lower
enthalpy, which means energy

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.960
was released.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.440
Because there's now
less energy in the

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.660
system right here.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.890
So this is essentially
how much is released.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.180
But our change in enthalpy here,
our change in enthalpy

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.850
of this reaction right here,
that's reaction one.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.630
I'll just rewrite it.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:45.240
Minus 393.5 kilojoules
per mole of

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.290
the reaction occurring.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.850
So the reaction occurs
a mole times.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.260
This would be the
amount of energy

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.270
that's essentially released.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.540
This is our change
in enthalpy.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.300
So if this happens, we'll
get our carbon dioxide.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.020
Now we also have-- and so we
would release this much energy

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.820
and we'd have this product to
deal with-- but we also now

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.780
need our water.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.390
And this reaction right here
gives us our water, the

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.360
combustion of hydrogen.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.590
So we have-- and I haven't done
hydrogen yet, so let me

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.770
do hydrogen in a new color.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.000
That's not a new color,
so let me do blue.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.110
So right here you have hydrogen
gas-- I'm just

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.180
rewriting that reaction--
hydrogen gas plus 1/2 O2--

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:32.200
pink is my color for oxygen--
1/2 O2 gas will yield, will it

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.910
give us some water.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:41.960
Will give us H2O, will give
us some liquid water.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.820
Now, before I just write this
number down, let's think about

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.580
whether we have everything
we need.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.250
To make this reaction occur,
because this gets us to our

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.000
final product, this gets
us to the gaseous

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.960
methane, we need a mole.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.380
Or we can even say a molecule
of carbon dioxide, and this

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.460
reaction gives us exactly one
molecule of carbon dioxide.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.790
So that's a check.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.990
And we need two molecules
of water.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.840
Now, this reaction only gives
us one molecule of water.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.200
So let's multiply both sides
of the equation to get two

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.550
molecules of water.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.280
So this is a 2, we multiply this
by 2, so this essentially

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.830
just disappears.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.830
You multiply 1/2 by 2, you
just get a 1 there.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.360
And then you put
a 2 over here.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.470
So I just multiplied this
second equation by 2.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.540
So I just multiplied-- this is
becomes a 1, this becomes a 2.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.280
And if you're doing twice as
much of it, because we

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.720
multiplied by 2, the delta H
now, the change enthalpy of

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.950
the reaction, is now going
to be twice this.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.490
Let's get the calculator out.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:49.640
It's now going to be negative
285.8 times 2.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.260
Because we just multiplied the
whole reaction times 2.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.890
So negative 571.6.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.470
So it's negative 571.6
kilojoules

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.920
per mole of the reaction.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.250
Now, let's see if the
combination, if the sum of

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.820
these reactions, actually is
this reaction up here.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.330
And to do that-- actually, let
me just copy and paste this

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.270
top one here because that's kind
of the order that we're

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.700
going to go in.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.680
You don't have to, but it just
makes it hopefully a little

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.070
bit easier to understand.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.990
So let me just copy
and paste this.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.070
Actually, I could cut
and paste it.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.610
Cut and then let me paste
it down here.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.540
That first one.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.470
And let's see now what's
going to happen.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.179
To see whether the some of these
reactions really does

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.980
end up being this top reaction
right here, let's see if we

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.350
can cancel out reactants
and products.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.690
Let's see what would happen.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.730
So this produces carbon dioxide,
but then this mole,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.100
or this molecule of carbon
dioxide, is then used up in

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.350
this last reaction.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.000
So this produces it,
this uses it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.910
So those cancel out.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.210
Let me do it in the same color
so it's in the screen.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.070
This reaction produces it,
this reaction uses it.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.390
Now, this reaction right
here produces the two

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.440
molecules of water.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.660
And now this reaction down
here-- I want to do that same

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.960
color-- these two molecules
of water.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.110
Now, this reaction down
here uses those two

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.920
molecules of water.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.590
Now, this reaction right here,
it requires one molecule of

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.840
molecular oxygen.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.640
This one requires another
molecule of molecular oxygen.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.580
So these two combined are two
molecules of molecular oxygen.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.700
So those are the reactants.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.040
And in the end, those end
up as the products

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.130
of this last reaction.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.500
So those, actually, they go into
the system and then they

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.250
leave out the system,
or out of the sum

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.060
of reactions unchanged.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.730
So they cancel out
with each other.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.620
So we could say that and
that we cancel out.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.850
And so what are we left with?

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.610
What are we left with
in the reaction?

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.820
Well, we have some solid carbon
as graphite plus two

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.260
moles, or two molecules of
molecular hydrogen yielding--

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.530
all we have left on the product
side is some methane.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.210
So it is true that the sum of
these reactions is exactly

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.240
what we want.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.690
All we have left on the product
side is the graphite,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.770
the solid graphite, plus the
molecular hydrogen, plus the

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.200
gaseous hydrogen-- do it
in that color-- plus

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.300
two hydrogen gas.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.390
And all we have left on the
product side is the methane.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.260
All we have left is the methane
in the gaseous form.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.920
So it is true that the sum of
these reactions-- remember, we

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.020
have to flip this reaction
around and change its sign,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.060
and we have to multiply this
reaction by 2 so that the sum

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.470
of these becomes this reaction
that we really care about.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.840
So this is the sum of
these reactions.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.660
Its change in enthalpy of this
reaction is going to be the

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.240
sum of these right here.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.860
That is Hess's Law.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.860
So this is the fun part.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.190
So we just add up these
values right here.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.350
So we have negative 393.--
no, that's not

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.880
what I wanted to do.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.120
Let me just clear it.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:14.710
So I have negative 393.5, so
that step is exothermic.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.600
And then we have minus 571.6.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.270
That is also exothermic.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.570
Those were both combustion
reactions, which are, as we

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.930
know, very exothermic.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.580
And we have the endothermic
step, the reverse of that last

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.400
combustion reaction.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:38.480
So plus 890.3 gives
us negative 74.8.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.650
It gives us negative 74.8
kilojoules for every mole of

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.930
the reaction occurring.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.800
Or if the reaction occurs,
a mole time.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.530
So there you go.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.800
We figured out the change
in enthalpy.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.380
And it is reasonably
exothermic.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.270
Nowhere near as exothermic as
these combustion reactions

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.060
right here, but it is going
to release energy.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.660
And we're done.
