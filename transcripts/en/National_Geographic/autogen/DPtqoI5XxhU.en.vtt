the right spot one of the most unique
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830
the right spot one of the most unique
things about this particular Eclipse is

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
things about this particular Eclipse is
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.659
things about this particular Eclipse is
that it crosses a very interesting

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
that it crosses a very interesting
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.139
that it crosses a very interesting
archaeological site Easter Island and on

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
archaeological site Easter Island and on
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580
archaeological site Easter Island and on
Easter Island they're at these great

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
Easter Island they're at these great
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.979
Easter Island they're at these great
statues that were erected a thousand

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
statues that were erected a thousand
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720
statues that were erected a thousand
1500 years ago a lot of mystery about

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
1500 years ago a lot of mystery about
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.510
1500 years ago a lot of mystery about
these statues but in any case this is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
these statues but in any case this is
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160
these statues but in any case this is
the first total eclipse that's hit the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
the first total eclipse that's hit the
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.260
the first total eclipse that's hit the
island in about 1400 years so during a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
island in about 1400 years so during a
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.990
island in about 1400 years so during a
total solar eclipse the moon comes

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
total solar eclipse the moon comes
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.360
total solar eclipse the moon comes
between the Sun and the earth and it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
between the Sun and the earth and it
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.520
between the Sun and the earth and it
casts a shadow on the earth and for

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
casts a shadow on the earth and for
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110
casts a shadow on the earth and for
those people that happen to be in that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
those people that happen to be in that
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540
those people that happen to be in that
that small area where the shadow is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
that small area where the shadow is
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.070
that small area where the shadow is
they're going to experience what we call

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
they're going to experience what we call
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.280
they're going to experience what we call
a total solar eclipse and basically the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
a total solar eclipse and basically the
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.880
a total solar eclipse and basically the
moon exactly blocks out the solar disk

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
moon exactly blocks out the solar disk
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460
moon exactly blocks out the solar disk
which is a good thing for those of us

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
which is a good thing for those of us
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230
which is a good thing for those of us
that study the outer atmosphere because

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
that study the outer atmosphere because
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.080
that study the outer atmosphere because
in blocking out the very very bright

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
in blocking out the very very bright
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.870
in blocking out the very very bright
solar disk we are then able to view the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
solar disk we are then able to view the
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120
solar disk we are then able to view the
outer atmosphere called the corona which

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
outer atmosphere called the corona which
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249
outer atmosphere called the corona which
is much less bright it's about a million

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
is much less bright it's about a million
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920
is much less bright it's about a million
times less bright than the disk so the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
times less bright than the disk so the
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.380
times less bright than the disk so the
the solar eclipse provides a rare

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
the solar eclipse provides a rare
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240
the solar eclipse provides a rare
opportunity to view the outer atmosphere

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
opportunity to view the outer atmosphere
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.730
opportunity to view the outer atmosphere
and the moon just happens to be at the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
and the moon just happens to be at the
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950
and the moon just happens to be at the
exact perfect distance away from the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
exact perfect distance away from the
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109
exact perfect distance away from the
earth that it completely blocks out just

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
earth that it completely blocks out just
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.880
earth that it completely blocks out just
the disk of the Sun

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950
