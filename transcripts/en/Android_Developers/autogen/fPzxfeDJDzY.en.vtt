talked about the language and the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950
talked about the language and the
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.070
talked about the language and the
language features outside of Kotlin just

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080
language features outside of Kotlin just
 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.350
language features outside of Kotlin just
the language in general and today we're

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360
the language in general and today we're
 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.260
the language in general and today we're
going to go through examples in android

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
going to go through examples in android
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.680
going to go through examples in android
how the language features can be used to

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690
how the language features can be used to
 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.480
how the language features can be used to
basically clean up a bunch of sort of

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490
basically clean up a bunch of sort of
 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.280
basically clean up a bunch of sort of
rough edges of how you write Android

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290
rough edges of how you write Android
 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620
rough edges of how you write Android
code so the first thing to start with is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
code so the first thing to start with is
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870
code so the first thing to start with is
you know here we have a boring main

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
you know here we have a boring main
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.140
you know here we have a boring main
activity and what's interesting to note

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150
activity and what's interesting to note
 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.810
activity and what's interesting to note
is that this parameter is actually

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820
is that this parameter is actually
 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.730
is that this parameter is actually
nullable so if your app process is

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740
nullable so if your app process is
 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.290
nullable so if your app process is
starting from scratch this is going to

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300
starting from scratch this is going to
 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.390
starting from scratch this is going to
be null and the way that we've now

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400
be null and the way that we've now
 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.510
be null and the way that we've now
represented this in Java is with noble

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520
represented this in Java is with noble
 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.670
represented this in Java is with noble
annotation support annotation and what's

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680
annotation support annotation and what's
 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.260
annotation support annotation and what's
great is that as these have been being

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270
great is that as these have been being
 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.180
great is that as these have been being
added to your code and sport library

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190
added to your code and sport library
 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.050
added to your code and sport library
code when you start writing Colin the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060
code when you start writing Colin the
 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.030
code when you start writing Colin the
fact that the method that you're

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040
fact that the method that you're
 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.160
fact that the method that you're
overriding has that annotation means

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170
overriding has that annotation means
 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.889
overriding has that annotation means
that Kotlin indicates that it's a noble

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899
that Kotlin indicates that it's a noble
 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.510
that Kotlin indicates that it's a noble
type so all of the work that you've been

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520
type so all of the work that you've been
 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.150
type so all of the work that you've been
doing to annotate over the last few

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160
doing to annotate over the last few
 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.310
doing to annotate over the last few
years is now going to pay off in Kotlin

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320
years is now going to pay off in Kotlin
 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.960
years is now going to pay off in Kotlin
where the type system models null

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970
where the type system models null
 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.580
where the type system models null
ability

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.699
 
similarly in Android 4.1 a lot of work

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709
similarly in Android 4.1 a lot of work
 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.860
similarly in Android 4.1 a lot of work
was done to normalize the getters and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
was done to normalize the getters and
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.880
was done to normalize the getters and
setters on all the views and if you saw

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890
setters on all the views and if you saw
 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.470
setters on all the views and if you saw
these are traditionally called beans in

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
these are traditionally called beans in
 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.610
these are traditionally called beans in
the Java programming language and what's

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
the Java programming language and what's
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.900
the Java programming language and what's
nice is that Colin takes these and

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
nice is that Colin takes these and
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.880
nice is that Colin takes these and
collapses them into what's called

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890
collapses them into what's called
 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.130
collapses them into what's called
property so in Java you refer to them

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
property so in Java you refer to them
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.710
property so in Java you refer to them
directly but if we rewrite this in Colin

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720
directly but if we rewrite this in Colin
 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.259
directly but if we rewrite this in Colin
you'll see that we're referring to just

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269
you'll see that we're referring to just
 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.240
you'll see that we're referring to just
an alpha property and when we're reading

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
an alpha property and when we're reading
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860
an alpha property and when we're reading
from edit calls together and when we're

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
from edit calls together and when we're
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.990
from edit calls together and when we're
writing to it it calls the setter so all

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
writing to it it calls the setter so all
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.180
writing to it it calls the setter so all
of that work that was done again now

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
of that work that was done again now
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.140
of that work that was done again now
pays off in Colin

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150
 
 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.150
 
okay so here's some sample code that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160
okay so here's some sample code that
 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.650
okay so here's some sample code that
iterates there illustrates when you need

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
iterates there illustrates when you need
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.450
iterates there illustrates when you need
to perform some operation over the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460
to perform some operation over the
 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.760
to perform some operation over the
children inside of the view group view

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
children inside of the view group view
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.950
children inside of the view group view
group is very similar to a collection

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960
group is very similar to a collection
 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.470
group is very similar to a collection
but it doesn't have any of the niceties

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480
but it doesn't have any of the niceties
 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.270
but it doesn't have any of the niceties
of collections like being able to use a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280
of collections like being able to use a
 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.570
of collections like being able to use a
for each loop if we rewrite this in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580
for each loop if we rewrite this in
 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.910
for each loop if we rewrite this in
Kotlin we get much more declarative

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
Kotlin we get much more declarative
 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Kotlin we get much more declarative
syntax the first thing to note is the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930
syntax the first thing to note is the
 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.500
syntax the first thing to note is the
range here we're using that in fix

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
range here we're using that in fix
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.740
range here we're using that in fix
function and it actually will you know

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
function and it actually will you know
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.440
function and it actually will you know
even though it's a function it's so it's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450
even though it's a function it's so it's
 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240
even though it's a function it's so it's
like an intrinsic in the compiler so you

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250
like an intrinsic in the compiler so you
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.790
like an intrinsic in the compiler so you
still get a for loop that uses indexes

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800
still get a for loop that uses indexes
 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.940
still get a for loop that uses indexes
in the bytecode and then here you can

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950
in the bytecode and then here you can
 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.120
in the bytecode and then here you can
see that the child count property that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
see that the child count property that
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.180
see that the child count property that
we're calling again comes from the get

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190
we're calling again comes from the get
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.950
we're calling again comes from the get
child count method which is in Java what

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960
child count method which is in Java what
 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.570
child count method which is in Java what
we can do we can do a lot better than

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580
we can do we can do a lot better than
 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.770
we can do we can do a lot better than
this right this isn't that much

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780
this right this isn't that much
 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420
this right this isn't that much
different it's just a little bit more

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430
different it's just a little bit more
 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.410
different it's just a little bit more
clean how can we make viewgroup behave

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420
clean how can we make viewgroup behave
 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.750
clean how can we make viewgroup behave
more like other collections well you saw

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760
more like other collections well you saw
 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.310
more like other collections well you saw
the extension methods you can add an

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320
the extension methods you can add an
 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.530
the extension methods you can add an
extension method to view group which

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
extension method to view group which
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.210
extension method to view group which
does this iteration and then your

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220
does this iteration and then your
 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.880
does this iteration and then your
calling code becomes you know much more

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890
calling code becomes you know much more
 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.370
calling code becomes you know much more
like you would over a normal collection

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380
 
 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.300
 
the nice thing to note here is that

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
the nice thing to note here is that
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.480
the nice thing to note here is that
extension methods will be sugar into a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490
extension methods will be sugar into a
 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.550
extension methods will be sugar into a
static method where the view group is

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560
static method where the view group is
 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.510
static method where the view group is
just the first parameter an important

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520
just the first parameter an important
 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.160
just the first parameter an important
thing to note is so this is a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170
thing to note is so this is a
 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.690
thing to note is so this is a
higher-order function it takes in a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700
higher-order function it takes in a
 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.210
higher-order function it takes in a
function as its parameter this will

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220
function as its parameter this will
 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.070
function as its parameter this will
actually cause an anonymous class to be

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080
actually cause an anonymous class to be
 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.680
actually cause an anonymous class to be
created at the call site that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690
created at the call site that
 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.690
created at the call site that
encapsulates the code inside the lambda

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700
encapsulates the code inside the lambda
 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.820
encapsulates the code inside the lambda
so this can become prohibitively

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830
so this can become prohibitively
 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.890
so this can become prohibitively
expensive right if we're using all these

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900
expensive right if we're using all these
 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.480
expensive right if we're using all these
higher-order functions and creating all

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490
higher-order functions and creating all
 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360
higher-order functions and creating all
these anonymous classes deck size goes

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370
these anonymous classes deck size goes
 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.650
these anonymous classes deck size goes
up method count goes up well we can

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660
up method count goes up well we can
 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.620
up method count goes up well we can
actually do is mark this as being an

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630
actually do is mark this as being an
 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.930
actually do is mark this as being an
inline function so this wasn't mentioned

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940
inline function so this wasn't mentioned
 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.240
inline function so this wasn't mentioned
by Hadi what it does is it basically

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
by Hadi what it does is it basically
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.680
by Hadi what it does is it basically
takes the implementation of this method

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690
takes the implementation of this method
 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.020
takes the implementation of this method
and in lines it in to the call site and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030
and in lines it in to the call site and
 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.390
and in lines it in to the call site and
so because the code has been moved you

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400
so because the code has been moved you
 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.980
so because the code has been moved you
no longer have to create that anonymous

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
no longer have to create that anonymous
 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.340
no longer have to create that anonymous
class and so this method essentially

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350
class and so this method essentially
 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.390
class and so this method essentially
becomes free so

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400
becomes free so
 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.420
becomes free so
use so one thing that you might have

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430
use so one thing that you might have
 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.920
use so one thing that you might have
missed is we actually lost the ability

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
missed is we actually lost the ability
 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.110
missed is we actually lost the ability
to know what index of child we're

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120
to know what index of child we're
 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.540
to know what index of child we're
looking at but that's easily solved with

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550
looking at but that's easily solved with
 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.870
looking at but that's easily solved with
second extension method that allows the

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880
second extension method that allows the
 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.909
second extension method that allows the
index to be passed in and again it's an

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919
index to be passed in and again it's an
 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.290
index to be passed in and again it's an
inline function we have no additional

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300
inline function we have no additional
 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.980
inline function we have no additional
overhead here so that was for iteration

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990
overhead here so that was for iteration
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.560
overhead here so that was for iteration
iterating on the child views but there's

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570
iterating on the child views but there's
 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.120
iterating on the child views but there's
a lot of other things we can do to view

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130
a lot of other things we can do to view
 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.890
a lot of other things we can do to view
group to make it behave a lot more like

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900
group to make it behave a lot more like
 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.000
group to make it behave a lot more like
a traditional collection so for example

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010
a traditional collection so for example
 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.480
a traditional collection so for example
if we add a get message as an extension

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490
if we add a get message as an extension
 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.409
if we add a get message as an extension
function we can now pull out child views

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419
function we can now pull out child views
 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.900
function we can now pull out child views
as if it was you know list or array we

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910
as if it was you know list or array we
 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.210
as if it was you know list or array we
can refer to them by index and have that

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220
can refer to them by index and have that
 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.409
can refer to them by index and have that
corresponding view returned key thing

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419
corresponding view returned key thing
 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.640
corresponding view returned key thing
here again that how do you pointed out

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650
here again that how do you pointed out
 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.770
here again that how do you pointed out
this is an operator function so it we're

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780
this is an operator function so it we're
 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.710
this is an operator function so it we're
declaring that it has a special call

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720
declaring that it has a special call
 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.749
declaring that it has a special call
sight syntax and that's what all of

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759
sight syntax and that's what all of
 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.879
sight syntax and that's what all of
these are going to be so how about

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889
these are going to be so how about
 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.600
these are going to be so how about
adding and removing views well we can

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610
adding and removing views well we can
 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.659
adding and removing views well we can
add - assign + + assign and so this

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669
add - assign + + assign and so this
 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.159
add - assign + + assign and so this
allows us to use you know a shorthand

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169
allows us to use you know a shorthand
 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:19.760
allows us to use you know a shorthand
syntax for removing and again adding

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770
 
 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.770
 
one more would be looking up to see if a

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780
one more would be looking up to see if a
 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.750
one more would be looking up to see if a
child's already in and again the

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760
child's already in and again the
 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.310
child's already in and again the
implementation of these functions we're

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320
implementation of these functions we're
 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.530
implementation of these functions we're
just reusing the methods that you

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540
just reusing the methods that you
 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.230
just reusing the methods that you
otherwise would have been calling but

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240
otherwise would have been calling but
 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.300
otherwise would have been calling but
getting a better syntax at the call site

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
getting a better syntax at the call site
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.610
getting a better syntax at the call site
which be hated which allows the view to

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620
which be hated which allows the view to
 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.880
which be hated which allows the view to
behave much more like a collection and

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890
behave much more like a collection and
 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.370
behave much more like a collection and
so this wasn't highlighted in haughty

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380
so this wasn't highlighted in haughty
 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.010
so this wasn't highlighted in haughty
stock but you know it kind of looks like

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020
stock but you know it kind of looks like

this is magical right when you're
looking at the code at the top where

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770
looking at the code at the top where
 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.800
looking at the code at the top where
you're using these operators how do you

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810
you're using these operators how do you
 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.230
you're using these operators how do you
know what implementation of that is

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240
know what implementation of that is
 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.360
know what implementation of that is
actually running well a cool trick in

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370
actually running well a cool trick in
 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.220
actually running well a cool trick in
IntelliJ and Android studio is that if

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230
IntelliJ and Android studio is that if
 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.780
IntelliJ and Android studio is that if
you actually put your cursor on one of

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790
you actually put your cursor on one of
 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.480
you actually put your cursor on one of
the operators you can command B into it

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490
the operators you can command B into it
 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.890
the operators you can command B into it
and will actually take you to the

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900
and will actually take you to the
 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.480
and will actually take you to the
corresponding function so even though

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490
corresponding function so even though
 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.850
corresponding function so even though
you get the nice call side syntax you

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
you get the nice call side syntax you
 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.320
you get the nice call side syntax you
still have the visibility into what the

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330
still have the visibility into what the
 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.810
still have the visibility into what the
implementation is doing and if you want

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820
implementation is doing and if you want
 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.330
implementation is doing and if you want
you can actually call these methods as

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340
you can actually call these methods as
 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.910
you can actually call these methods as
if they are extension methods not using

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920
if they are extension methods not using
 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.240
if they are extension methods not using
the operator syntax because again

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250
the operator syntax because again
 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.430
the operator syntax because again
they're just normal functions so

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440
they're just normal functions so
 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.960
they're just normal functions so
extending a type isn't limited to just

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970
extending a type isn't limited to just
 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.150
extending a type isn't limited to just
methods we can also add properties and

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160
methods we can also add properties and
 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.659
methods we can also add properties and
so how about adding the number of

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:30.669
so how about adding the number of
 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.000
so how about adding the number of
children as a size property which is

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010
children as a size property which is
 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:41.270
children as a size property which is
what a list or array would expose

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280
 
 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.470
 
interesting thing to note here again

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:43.480
interesting thing to note here again
 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.720
interesting thing to note here again
using string interpolation also

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730
using string interpolation also
 

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:53.870
using string interpolation also
mentioned in hoti stock okay

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880
mentioned in hoti stock okay
 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.800
mentioned in hoti stock okay
this one's a little more advanced but

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.810
this one's a little more advanced but
 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.150
this one's a little more advanced but
having the for each function that we

00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160
having the for each function that we
 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.060
having the for each function that we
added only allows us to do that type of

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.070
added only allows us to do that type of
 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.280
added only allows us to do that type of
iteration where as a list we have all

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.290
iteration where as a list we have all
 

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.980
iteration where as a list we have all
these other higher-order functions

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:05.990
these other higher-order functions
 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.440
these other higher-order functions
filtering mapping that we can use that

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.450
filtering mapping that we can use that
 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.540
filtering mapping that we can use that
we can no longer use on view group

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.550
we can no longer use on view group
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.130
we can no longer use on view group
because you know it doesn't extend that

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.140
because you know it doesn't extend that
 

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.190
because you know it doesn't extend that
base type what this code does which you

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:16.200
base type what this code does which you
 

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.780
base type what this code does which you
don't have to like really look into and

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:17.790
don't have to like really look into and
 

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.150
don't have to like really look into and
understand is add the ability to create

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160
understand is add the ability to create
 

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.030
understand is add the ability to create
an iterator of children and so now we

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.040
an iterator of children and so now we
 

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.730
an iterator of children and so now we
get access to using the traditional for

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740
get access to using the traditional for
 

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.540
get access to using the traditional for
each loop and if we want we can use

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.550
each loop and if we want we can use
 

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.920
each loop and if we want we can use
those higher-order functions that exist

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:30.930
those higher-order functions that exist
 

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.740
those higher-order functions that exist
of that expire order extension functions

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:33.750
of that expire order extension functions
 

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.070
of that expire order extension functions
that exist on iterable so here I'm

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080
that exist on iterable so here I'm
 

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.430
that exist on iterable so here I'm
collecting the height of all the visible

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
collecting the height of all the visible
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.330
collecting the height of all the visible
views very declarative and these if

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:44.340
views very declarative and these if
 

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.810
views very declarative and these if
they're inline functions you lose you

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.820
they're inline functions you lose you
 

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:55.520
they're inline functions you lose you
lose the overhead as well so extension

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:55.530
lose the overhead as well so extension
 

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.630
lose the overhead as well so extension
functions are great for encapsulating

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640
functions are great for encapsulating
 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.090
functions are great for encapsulating
repetitive tasks so if you're using

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100
repetitive tasks so if you're using
 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.400
repetitive tasks so if you're using
custom trace point because an example I

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.410
custom trace point because an example I
 

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.070
custom trace point because an example I
always forget to put the N section and

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080
always forget to put the N section and
 

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.630
always forget to put the N section and
especially if you're refactoring code

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:08.640
especially if you're refactoring code
 

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.670
especially if you're refactoring code
that has trace voice in it it's very

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680
that has trace voice in it it's very
 

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.940
that has trace voice in it it's very
easy to rearrange you know which n

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:13.950
easy to rearrange you know which n
 

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.530
easy to rearrange you know which n
section is applied to which begins

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540
section is applied to which begins
 

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.230
section is applied to which begins
section and it ended up screwing up you

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240
section and it ended up screwing up you
 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.750
section and it ended up screwing up you
know the systrace output what we can do

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760
know the systrace output what we can do
 

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.790
know the systrace output what we can do
is just go back and use this trick over

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800
is just go back and use this trick over
 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.170
is just go back and use this trick over
and over again we can encapsulate that

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180
and over again we can encapsulate that
 

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.270
and over again we can encapsulate that
code inside of an inline function and so

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:28.280
code inside of an inline function and so
 

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.350
code inside of an inline function and so
and this will perform the beginning and

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360
and this will perform the beginning and
 

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.380
and this will perform the beginning and
end and then it will execute our lambda

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:33.390
end and then it will execute our lambda
 

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.840
end and then it will execute our lambda
in the middle but as an inline function

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:35.850
in the middle but as an inline function
 

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.570
in the middle but as an inline function
we don't pay the cost of allocating

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580
we don't pay the cost of allocating
 

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.180
we don't pay the cost of allocating
anything and so now our call site just

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:41.190
anything and so now our call site just
 

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.590
anything and so now our call site just
becomes trace with the tag and then

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600
becomes trace with the tag and then
 

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.450
becomes trace with the tag and then
whatever is in the body is automatically

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:44.460
whatever is in the body is automatically
 

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.939
whatever is in the body is automatically
wrapped in begin and end

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:47.949
 
 

00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:49.990
 
another nice thing is that you can

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000
another nice thing is that you can
 

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.600
another nice thing is that you can
actually return from these functions and

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:52.610
actually return from these functions and
 

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.730
actually return from these functions and
so if you're computing something we

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:54.740
so if you're computing something we
 

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.699
so if you're computing something we
don't lose the ability to capture return

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:57.709
don't lose the ability to capture return
 

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:05.439
don't lose the ability to capture return
value okay so same tricks over and over

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:05.449
value okay so same tricks over and over
 

00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:07.509
value okay so same tricks over and over
again a lot of times when you writing

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519
again a lot of times when you writing
 

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:10.749
again a lot of times when you writing
the same boilerplate code you can get

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:10.759
the same boilerplate code you can get
 

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:12.879
the same boilerplate code you can get
this like tunnel vision where you lose

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:12.889
this like tunnel vision where you lose
 

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:15.040
this like tunnel vision where you lose
track of the ability to differentiate

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.050
track of the ability to differentiate
 

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.660
track of the ability to differentiate
whether something is correct or a

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.670
whether something is correct or a
 

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.579
whether something is correct or a
mistake because we're so used to seeing

00:10:18.579 --> 00:10:18.589
mistake because we're so used to seeing
 

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:20.860
mistake because we're so used to seeing
it you just gloss over and so you might

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:20.870
it you just gloss over and so you might
 

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.689
it you just gloss over and so you might
have missed looking at this that we're

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:22.699
have missed looking at this that we're
 

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:25.090
have missed looking at this that we're
actually missing setting the transaction

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.100
actually missing setting the transaction
 

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.220
actually missing setting the transaction
to successful and so the Alva code and

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.230
to successful and so the Alva code and
 

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.050
to successful and so the Alva code and
this block wouldn't have even ran this

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.060
this block wouldn't have even ran this
 

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.790
this block wouldn't have even ran this
is another one where we can just apply

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800
is another one where we can just apply
 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.889
is another one where we can just apply
the same trick write an inline function

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:32.899
the same trick write an inline function
 

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.530
the same trick write an inline function
that encapsulates this this ceremony

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.540
that encapsulates this this ceremony
 

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.850
that encapsulates this this ceremony
around interacting with a database

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:36.860
around interacting with a database
 

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.920
around interacting with a database
transaction and then our call site

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:38.930
transaction and then our call site
 

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.639
transaction and then our call site
becomes extremely simple and declarative

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:41.649
becomes extremely simple and declarative
 

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:44.040
becomes extremely simple and declarative
this one is especially interesting

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.050
this one is especially interesting
 

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.499
this one is especially interesting
because we still have to refer to the

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:47.509
because we still have to refer to the
 

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:50.710
because we still have to refer to the
database inside the transaction block it

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720
database inside the transaction block it
 

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.939
database inside the transaction block it
would be nice if we somehow could

00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:51.949
would be nice if we somehow could
 

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:53.920
would be nice if we somehow could
associate the statements inside the

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:53.930
associate the statements inside the
 

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.319
associate the statements inside the
block with you know the enclosing

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:56.329
block with you know the enclosing
 

00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:58.269
block with you know the enclosing
transaction because we already specified

00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279
transaction because we already specified
 

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:00.400
transaction because we already specified
it on the database so it's redundant to

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.410
it on the database so it's redundant to
 

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.269
it on the database so it's redundant to
say it over and over again one way to

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279
say it over and over again one way to
 

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:05.980
say it over and over again one way to
accomplish this would be to change the

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:05.990
accomplish this would be to change the
 

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.750
accomplish this would be to change the
lambda that's being passed into the

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760
lambda that's being passed into the
 

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.199
lambda that's being passed into the
function such that we inject the data to

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:11.209
function such that we inject the data to
 

00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:13.150
function such that we inject the data to
the database reference back into it and

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160
the database reference back into it and
 

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.090
the database reference back into it and
this allows our code to pass this into

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:16.100
this allows our code to pass this into
 

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.410
this allows our code to pass this into
the body this allows our codes are

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.420
the body this allows our codes are
 

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.110
the body this allows our codes are
referred to the it parameter which is

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120
referred to the it parameter which is
 

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.150
referred to the it parameter which is
when there's a only a single argument

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160
when there's a only a single argument
 

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.620
when there's a only a single argument
being passed the lambda you can just

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:23.630
being passed the lambda you can just
 

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:28.449
being passed the lambda you can just
refer to it as it this isn't as nice as

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:28.459
refer to it as it this isn't as nice as
 

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:29.889
refer to it as it this isn't as nice as
it could be though because now every

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:29.899
it could be though because now every
 

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:31.509
it could be though because now every
statement that we put inside this lambda

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519
statement that we put inside this lambda
 

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:35.250
statement that we put inside this lambda
has to have it prefix in front of it so

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:35.260
has to have it prefix in front of it so
 

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.960
has to have it prefix in front of it so
just like we had extension functions

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:37.970
just like we had extension functions
 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.069
just like we had extension functions
which add methods to a type we can

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079
which add methods to a type we can
 

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:45.699
which add methods to a type we can
create extension lambdas or as I believe

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:45.709
create extension lambdas or as I believe
 

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.559
create extension lambdas or as I believe
cotton calls it lambdas with receivers

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:47.569
cotton calls it lambdas with receivers
 

00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:50.050
cotton calls it lambdas with receivers
what's the same trick where if we change

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.060
what's the same trick where if we change
 

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.939
what's the same trick where if we change
the parameter of the lambda that's being

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:51.949
the parameter of the lambda that's being
 

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:54.759
the parameter of the lambda that's being
passed in to itself be an extension

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:54.769
passed in to itself be an extension
 

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:57.220
passed in to itself be an extension
function of the database

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.230
function of the database
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.680
function of the database
this means that the body inside the

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:00.690
this means that the body inside the
 

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.840
this means that the body inside the
lambda is going to execute as if it was

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:02.850
lambda is going to execute as if it was
 

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.560
lambda is going to execute as if it was
a method on legalized database and such

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.570
a method on legalized database and such
 

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.810
a method on legalized database and such
we can call methods without having to

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820
we can call methods without having to
 

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.030
we can call methods without having to

our call Sai only mentions the database

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:12.960
our call Sai only mentions the database
 

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.420
our call Sai only mentions the database
once and then we can just call the

methods for performing you know inserts
 

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.740
methods for performing you know inserts
updates and deletes without having to

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:18.750
updates and deletes without having to
 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.660

qualify them with this database

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:20.670
qualify them with this database
 

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:29.140

doing you know inserts like this is not

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760
doing you know inserts like this is not
 

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.480
doing you know inserts like this is not
terrible or deletes I guess in this case

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:34.490
terrible or deletes I guess in this case
 

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.540
terrible or deletes I guess in this case
but the problem is actually the database

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.550
but the problem is actually the database
 

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.520
but the problem is actually the database
that underlies that you know has to

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:40.530
that underlies that you know has to
 

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.280
that underlies that you know has to
execute this it has to parse the query

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.290
execute this it has to parse the query
 

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.200
execute this it has to parse the query
every single time you know figure out

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.210
every single time you know figure out
 

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.000
every single time you know figure out
that it's syntactically correct figured

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.010
that it's syntactically correct figured
 

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.330
that it's syntactically correct figured
out where the question marks are that it

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:50.340
out where the question marks are that it
 

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.390
out where the question marks are that it
needs to bind arguments into and so if

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:53.400
needs to bind arguments into and so if
 

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.740
needs to bind arguments into and so if
you're running this over and over and

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:54.750
you're running this over and over and
 

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.390
you're running this over and over and
over again you're basically wasting time

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:56.400
over again you're basically wasting time
 

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.890
over again you're basically wasting time
in the database for having it to parse

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:57.900
in the database for having it to parse
 

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.540
in the database for having it to parse
your query every single time the way

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:02.550
your query every single time the way
 

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.610

that this is solved in the sequel ATP is

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620
that this is solved in the sequel ATP is
 

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.910
that this is solved in the sequel ATP is
is by compiling a statement ahead of

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920
is by compiling a statement ahead of
 

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.860
is by compiling a statement ahead of
time and then reusing that over and over

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:09.870
time and then reusing that over and over
 

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.960
time and then reusing that over and over
again and so now the database only has

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:11.970
again and so now the database only has
 

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:17.540
again and so now the database only has
to parse this one and then it just kind

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:17.550
to parse this one and then it just kind
 

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.850
to parse this one and then it just kind
of remembers creates a model of what the

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860
of remembers creates a model of what the
 

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.190
of remembers creates a model of what the
query is and then when you execute it

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200
query is and then when you execute it
 

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.140
query is and then when you execute it
and only has to insert the arguments and

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.150
and only has to insert the arguments and
 

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.020
and only has to insert the arguments and
execute them so this is nice we get a

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.030
execute them so this is nice we get a
 

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.400
execute them so this is nice we get a
performance win if we're calling this a

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:28.410
performance win if we're calling this a
 

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.890
performance win if we're calling this a
bunch of times but we actually change

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:30.900
bunch of times but we actually change
 

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.810
bunch of times but we actually change
this such that if we were calling delete

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820
this such that if we were calling delete
 

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.700
this such that if we were calling delete

class is created which is usually the
 

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.240
class is created which is usually the
main thread and so we move database work

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.250
main thread and so we move database work
 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.540
main thread and so we move database work
onto the main thread the weight if this

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:47.550
onto the main thread the weight if this
 

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.150
onto the main thread the weight if this
is fixed is with a feature called

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160
is fixed is with a feature called
 

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.010
is fixed is with a feature called
delegation and this was property

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.020
delegation and this was property
 

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.320
delegation and this was property
delegation it's basically allowing you

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.330
delegation it's basically allowing you
 

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.280
delegation it's basically allowing you
to supply code behind a property that

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:58.290
to supply code behind a property that
 

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.830
to supply code behind a property that
can run whenever it's called whenever

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:00.840
can run whenever it's called whenever
 

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.470
can run whenever it's called whenever
it's assigned to or read from so in this

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480
it's assigned to or read from so in this
 

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.550
it's assigned to or read from so in this
case what we're doing is we're

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560
case what we're doing is we're
 

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.370
case what we're doing is we're
delegating the implementation of this

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380
delegating the implementation of this
 

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.879
delegating the implementation of this

and to a Kotlin built-in Kotlin feature

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:13.369
and to a Kotlin built-in Kotlin feature
 

00:14:13.369 --> 00:14:16.119
and to a Kotlin built-in Kotlin feature
which is going to make it lazy so lazy

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:16.129
which is going to make it lazy so lazy
 

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:19.090
which is going to make it lazy so lazy
takes in a lambda now that only gets

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.100
takes in a lambda now that only gets
 

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.789
takes in a lambda now that only gets
called the first time that you get the

00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:21.799
called the first time that you get the
 

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:25.479
called the first time that you get the
value from this property and so what

00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:25.489
value from this property and so what
 

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:27.729
value from this property and so what
we've done is now allowed this to have

00:14:27.729 --> 00:14:27.739
we've done is now allowed this to have
 

00:14:27.739 --> 00:14:30.280
we've done is now allowed this to have
the same behavior as the original where

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.290
the same behavior as the original where
 

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.849
the same behavior as the original where
it was parsed on the background thread

00:14:32.849 --> 00:14:32.859
it was parsed on the background thread
 

00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:35.109
it was parsed on the background thread
but now it only does it once instead of

00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:35.119
but now it only does it once instead of
 

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:39.819
but now it only does it once instead of
many times there's a lot of examples of

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:39.829
many times there's a lot of examples of
 

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:41.949
many times there's a lot of examples of
where delegation on properties can be

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959
where delegation on properties can be
 

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:46.269
where delegation on properties can be
useful another built-in one is

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279
useful another built-in one is
 

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:48.759
useful another built-in one is
observable which allows the lambda that

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:48.769
observable which allows the lambda that
 

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:51.879
observable which allows the lambda that
used to fly to be called every time the

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:51.889
used to fly to be called every time the
 

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:55.119
used to fly to be called every time the
property value is changed so I write a

00:14:55.119 --> 00:14:55.129
property value is changed so I write a
 

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:57.639
property value is changed so I write a
new property to this name and if the

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:57.649
new property to this name and if the
 

00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:00.099
new property to this name and if the
delegate calls this lambda with the old

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:00.109
delegate calls this lambda with the old
 

00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:06.159
delegate calls this lambda with the old
value the new value for properties that

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:06.169
value the new value for properties that
 

00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:07.809
value the new value for properties that
aren't immediately going to be

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:07.819
aren't immediately going to be
 

00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:10.090
aren't immediately going to be
initialized that you know will very soon

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.100
initialized that you know will very soon
 

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.609
initialized that you know will very soon
be initialized instead of marking them

00:15:12.609 --> 00:15:12.619
be initialized instead of marking them
 

00:15:12.619 --> 00:15:14.590
be initialized instead of marking them
as nullable which requires you to

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600
as nullable which requires you to
 

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.869
as nullable which requires you to
initialize it immediately when the class

00:15:16.869 --> 00:15:16.879
initialize it immediately when the class
 

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:19.179
initialize it immediately when the class
is created you can use a delegate that

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:19.189
is created you can use a delegate that
 

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:22.090
is created you can use a delegate that
allows you to it's sort of defer setting

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.100
allows you to it's sort of defer setting
 

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.129
allows you to it's sort of defer setting
the value and so if you try to read from

00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:24.139
the value and so if you try to read from
 

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:25.569
the value and so if you try to read from
this without setting a value it's going

00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:25.579
this without setting a value it's going
 

00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:27.850
this without setting a value it's going
to throw an exception but if you write

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:27.860
to throw an exception but if you write
 

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.679
to throw an exception but if you write
to it and then read from it totally fine

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:29.689
to it and then read from it totally fine
 

00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:31.210
to it and then read from it totally fine
so this is perfect for cases like

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.220
so this is perfect for cases like
 

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.129
so this is perfect for cases like
activities and fragments where you don't

00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:33.139
activities and fragments where you don't
 

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:35.859
activities and fragments where you don't
control the creation of the class but

00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:35.869
control the creation of the class but
 

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:37.239
control the creation of the class but
there is a method in the lifecycle

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:37.249
there is a method in the lifecycle
 

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:39.159
there is a method in the lifecycle
that's very early where you usually set

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:39.169
that's very early where you usually set
 

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:43.569
that's very early where you usually set
up these properties and you can write

00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:43.579
up these properties and you can write
 

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:45.479
up these properties and you can write
your own delegate delegates just the

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:45.489
your own delegate delegates just the
 

00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:47.679
your own delegate delegates just the
interface that you can implement so we

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:47.689
interface that you can implement so we
 

00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:50.710
interface that you can implement so we
have one which allows us to bind views

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720
have one which allows us to bind views
 

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.439
have one which allows us to bind views
so it automatically if this is like in a

00:15:53.439 --> 00:15:53.449
so it automatically if this is like in a
 

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:56.619
so it automatically if this is like in a
view subclass it will lazily look up

00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:56.629
view subclass it will lazily look up
 

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:58.329
view subclass it will lazily look up
this view the first time that you access

00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:58.339
this view the first time that you access
 

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:02.699
this view the first time that you access
it

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:02.709
 
 

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:06.130
 
another feature of delegation is class

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.140
another feature of delegation is class
 

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.800
another feature of delegation is class
delegation so the transitions framework

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:08.810
delegation so the transitions framework
 

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.050
delegation so the transitions framework
lacks a base class that you can extend

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.060
lacks a base class that you can extend
 

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.910
lacks a base class that you can extend
from such that you only have to override

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920
from such that you only have to override
 

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.210
from such that you only have to override
one method wouldn't be nice if we

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:16.220
one method wouldn't be nice if we
 

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.280
one method wouldn't be nice if we
somehow could only override the method

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:18.290
somehow could only override the method
 

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.190
somehow could only override the method
we needed and then have have something

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.200
we needed and then have have something
 

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.720
we needed and then have have something
else that we delegated to for those

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:22.730
else that we delegated to for those
 

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.090
else that we delegated to for those
empty implementations well you can do

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:25.100
empty implementations well you can do
 

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.980
empty implementations well you can do
this you can create a class this is a

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:26.990
this you can create a class this is a
 

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.079
this you can create a class this is a
object class which is a singleton in

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:29.089
object class which is a singleton in
 

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.900
object class which is a singleton in
Kotlin and it has empty limitations of

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:31.910
Kotlin and it has empty limitations of
 

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.889
Kotlin and it has empty limitations of
all the functions and so now on our

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:35.899
all the functions and so now on our
 

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:37.660
all the functions and so now on our
original type what we can say is that

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:37.670
original type what we can say is that
 

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.430
original type what we can say is that
we're implementing transaction listener

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440
we're implementing transaction listener
 

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.380
we're implementing transaction listener
but we're going to delegate every call

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:41.390
but we're going to delegate every call
 

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.750
but we're going to delegate every call
to the singleton type except for the

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:43.760
to the singleton type except for the
 

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.360
to the singleton type except for the
ones that we override and what Kotlin

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.370
ones that we override and what Kotlin
 

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.130
ones that we override and what Kotlin
will do is basically just add the

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.140
will do is basically just add the
 

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.720
will do is basically just add the
overrides in the class automatically

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:49.730
overrides in the class automatically
 

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.790
overrides in the class automatically
call the delegate for the ones you

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800
call the delegate for the ones you
 

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.190
call the delegate for the ones you
haven't overwritten and your code that

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.200
haven't overwritten and your code that
 

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.410
haven't overwritten and your code that
is overwritten for the single method

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.420
is overwritten for the single method
 

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.600
is overwritten for the single method
will be used only for that one for

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.610
will be used only for that one for
 

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.689
will be used only for that one for
testing we abstract away espresso we

00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:04.699
testing we abstract away espresso we
 

00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:06.039
testing we abstract away espresso we
have these things called robots which

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:06.049
have these things called robots which
 

00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:07.840
have these things called robots which
are just kind of high-level methods that

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:07.850
are just kind of high-level methods that
 

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.439
are just kind of high-level methods that
we can interact with instead of putting

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:11.449
we can interact with instead of putting
 

00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:14.319
we can interact with instead of putting
espresso on every single test and what's

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:14.329
espresso on every single test and what's
 

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.970
espresso on every single test and what's
great is that the you know in Kotlin we

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:15.980
great is that the you know in Kotlin we
 

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.590
great is that the you know in Kotlin we
can call this in a very readable and

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600
can call this in a very readable and
 

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.069
can call this in a very readable and
declarative way but again another trick

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079
declarative way but again another trick
 

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.380
declarative way but again another trick
you can do is with these extension

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.390
you can do is with these extension
 

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.530
you can do is with these extension
functions and lambdas with receivers is

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:25.540
functions and lambdas with receivers is
 

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.090
functions and lambdas with receivers is
take that kind of weird-looking

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:28.100
take that kind of weird-looking
 

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.700
take that kind of weird-looking
constructor initialization and the apply

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.710
constructor initialization and the apply
 

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.930
constructor initialization and the apply
method which doesn't really make sense

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:31.940
method which doesn't really make sense
 

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.030
method which doesn't really make sense
in this case and turn it into something

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040
in this case and turn it into something
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.669
in this case and turn it into something
that's much like a DSL and so you can

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679
that's much like a DSL and so you can
 

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:38.799
that's much like a DSL and so you can
build these type safety ourselves out of

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:38.809
build these type safety ourselves out of
 

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:41.200
build these type safety ourselves out of
anything that you any like domain that

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.210
anything that you any like domain that
 

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.970
anything that you any like domain that
you have in your app the testing is just

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:42.980
you have in your app the testing is just
 

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.900
you have in your app the testing is just
of one example

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:45.910
of one example
 

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.909
of one example
and so finally field classes got to

00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919
and so finally field classes got to
 

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:50.650
and so finally field classes got to
mention as well so these are basically

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:50.660
mention as well so these are basically
 

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.230
mention as well so these are basically
type hierarchies that are that are

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240
type hierarchies that are that are
 

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.840
type hierarchies that are that are
closed that other you know downstream

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:55.850
closed that other you know downstream
 

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.870
closed that other you know downstream
consumers can't add an implementation of

00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880
consumers can't add an implementation of
 

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.480
consumers can't add an implementation of
a great use of this on Android is for

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:01.490
a great use of this on Android is for
 

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.060
a great use of this on Android is for
recyclerview payloads so let's say

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.070
recyclerview payloads so let's say
 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.190
recyclerview payloads so let's say
you're you're displaying tweets and you

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200
you're you're displaying tweets and you
 

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.539
you're you're displaying tweets and you
know when you click them or when you

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:07.549
know when you click them or when you
 

00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:10.180
know when you click them or when you
receive data from the web service you

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.190
receive data from the web service you
 

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.880
receive data from the web service you
want to update the counts and the icons

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:12.890
want to update the counts and the icons
 

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.040
want to update the counts and the icons
so we can write a steal class for each

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.050
so we can write a steal class for each
 

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.000
so we can write a steal class for each
of these events

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.010
of these events
 

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.860
of these events
which are the objects that we'll send to

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:17.870
which are the objects that we'll send to
 

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.740
which are the objects that we'll send to
recyclerview as payloads so that it

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:20.750
recyclerview as payloads so that it
 

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.230
recyclerview as payloads so that it
knows to only change a number or only

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240
knows to only change a number or only
 

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.340
knows to only change a number or only
change an icon and here we're using data

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:27.350
change an icon and here we're using data
 

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.930
change an icon and here we're using data
classes again also mentioned and what's

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:31.940
classes again also mentioned and what's
 

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.450
classes again also mentioned and what's
great about this is we can use a lot of

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:34.460
great about this is we can use a lot of
 

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.970
great about this is we can use a lot of
the language features to make this

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:36.980
the language features to make this
 

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.360
the language features to make this
really readable on the consuming side we

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.370
really readable on the consuming side we
 

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.940
really readable on the consuming side we
get the nice looping with the lambda

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:41.950
get the nice looping with the lambda
 

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.490
get the nice looping with the lambda
then we can use the wind block which

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:45.500
then we can use the wind block which
 

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.940
then we can use the wind block which
allows us to do the smart casting so for

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:48.950
allows us to do the smart casting so for
 

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.070
allows us to do the smart casting so for
each of these branches they have

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080
each of these branches they have
 

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.870
each of these branches they have
associated properties in the data

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880
associated properties in the data
 

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.050
associated properties in the data
classes so each each one can now

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:56.060
classes so each each one can now
 

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.820
classes so each each one can now
reference the properties without having

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:57.830
reference the properties without having
 

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.480
reference the properties without having
to do the explicit cast because the Len

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.490
to do the explicit cast because the Len
 

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.930
to do the explicit cast because the Len
expression took care of it and so we add

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:04.940
expression took care of it and so we add
 

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.920
expression took care of it and so we add
the other branches and we get this nice

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:08.930
the other branches and we get this nice
 

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.080
the other branches and we get this nice
readable payload implementation instead

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.090
readable payload implementation instead
 

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.930
readable payload implementation instead
of what we have in Java which is you

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:13.940
of what we have in Java which is you
 

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.190
of what we have in Java which is you
know a bunch of objects and a bunch of

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200
know a bunch of objects and a bunch of
 

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.940
know a bunch of objects and a bunch of
manual casting and so hopefully all

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:18.950
manual casting and so hopefully all
 

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.990
manual casting and so hopefully all
these examples have really really

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000
these examples have really really
 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.880
these examples have really really
resonated I mean there's so many things

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:24.890
resonated I mean there's so many things
 

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.130
resonated I mean there's so many things
over and over that we do in Java that we

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.140
over and over that we do in Java that we
 

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.290
over and over that we do in Java that we
can take the features of the Kotlin

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.300
can take the features of the Kotlin
 

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.640
can take the features of the Kotlin
programming language and apply them to

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:30.650
programming language and apply them to
 

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.440
programming language and apply them to
to make the code more fun to read and

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450
to make the code more fun to read and
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.480
to make the code more fun to read and
more fun to write and so now I'm going

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:34.490
more fun to write and so now I'm going
 

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.070
more fun to write and so now I'm going
to turn it over to Kristina who will

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080
to turn it over to Kristina who will
 

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.810
to turn it over to Kristina who will
talk to you about how you can adopt the

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:37.820
talk to you about how you can adopt the
 

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:48.810
talk to you about how you can adopt the
language in your organization

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:48.820
 
 

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.580

this is IO 2017 and we have a session

00:19:59.820 --> 00:19:59.830
this is IO 2017 and we have a session
 

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.610
this is IO 2017 and we have a session
about Kotlin a lot of people who made

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:02.620
about Kotlin a lot of people who made
 

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.410
about Kotlin a lot of people who made
that hop in there in the room both the

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.420
that hop in there in the room both the
 

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.720
that hop in there in the room both the
Googlers and the people from jetbrains I

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:06.730
Googlers and the people from jetbrains I
 

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.970
Googlers and the people from jetbrains I
know I appreciate it can we give them a

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:08.980
know I appreciate it can we give them a
 

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:18.850
know I appreciate it can we give them a

been talking about into three steps the
 

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.850
been talking about into three steps the
first one and the easiest is you you

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860
first one and the easiest is you you
 

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.190

say it and who you say it to that
control it gives you a lot of power the

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260
control it gives you a lot of power the

can fix that because if you care enough
 

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.260
can fix that because if you care enough
to introduce a new tool

about that I have been on stage and I've

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120
about that I have been on stage and I've
 

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.540
about that I have been on stage and I've
said hey there's this magic argument you

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:29.550
said hey there's this magic argument you
 

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.460
said hey there's this magic argument you
can use you just walk into someone's

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:31.470
can use you just walk into someone's
 

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.440
can use you just walk into someone's
office and then you say give me this

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:33.450
office and then you say give me this
 

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.810
office and then you say give me this
language and I'll give you an NP e or

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820
language and I'll give you an NP e or
 

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.100
language and I'll give you an NP e or
relatively NP e

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.110

there's a will there's a way
but this is a great argument the more I

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:44.550
but this is a great argument the more I
 

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.860
but this is a great argument the more I
talked about it with you in the

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:45.870
talked about it with you in the
 

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.990
talked about it with you in the
community though the more I realize that

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000
community though the more I realize that
 

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.060
community though the more I realize that
it boils down to something much more

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.070
it boils down to something much more
 

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.590
it boils down to something much more
fundamental and that is that Kotlin and

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600
fundamental and that is that Kotlin and
 

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.620
fundamental and that is that Kotlin and
languages like it they help us offload

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:57.630

our computer and we already do this a

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820
our computer and we already do this a
 

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.570
our computer and we already do this a
lot the way I know that we do this is

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580
lot the way I know that we do this is
 

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.430
lot the way I know that we do this is
that we all collectively freak out

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440
that we all collectively freak out
 

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.010
that we all collectively freak out
anytime our computer breaks I know I do

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020
anytime our computer breaks I know I do
 

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.900
anytime our computer breaks I know I do
it I've seen other people do it and

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:11.910
it I've seen other people do it and
 

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.310
it I've seen other people do it and
that's because computers are

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320
that's because computers are
 

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.110
that's because computers are
fundamentally a huge part of our life

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120

things that we're really really bad at
and that frees us up to do some of the

and that frees us up to do some of the
 

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.230
and that frees us up to do some of the
more creative thinking the architecting

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240
more creative thinking the architecting
 

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.000
more creative thinking the architecting
the making sure that it works for your

critical thinking tasks are things that
we get to focus on more and when talking

the spirit though and and too that means

the spirit though and and too that means
 

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.570
the spirit though and and too that means
that you shoulder all that work on

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:48.580
that you shoulder all that work on

is just hitting widespread adoption and
 

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.810
is just hitting widespread adoption and
what that means from your perspective is

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:12.820
what that means from your perspective is
 

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.930
what that means from your perspective is
that we don't have 20 years worth of

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:15.940
that we don't have 20 years worth of

practices and books and all of the
things of that nature and that means

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:23.740
things of that nature and that means
 

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.889
things of that nature and that means
that when you introduce Kotlin into your

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:25.899
that when you introduce Kotlin into your
 

00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.870
that when you introduce Kotlin into your
code base you get to have those

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:27.880
code base you get to have those
 

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.690
code base you get to have those
conversations and as a developer that's

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:30.700
conversations and as a developer that's
 

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.020
conversations and as a developer that's
fun but it's also time away from your

fun but it's also time away from your
work and what does this look like it

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399
work and what does this look like it
 

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:37.980
work and what does this look like it
looks like you adding Kotlin to your

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:37.990
looks like you adding Kotlin to your
 

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.740
looks like you adding Kotlin to your
code and having almost you know two ways

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:40.750
code and having almost you know two ways
 

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:43.260

to do almost exactly the same thing we

to do almost exactly the same thing we
 

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.970
to do almost exactly the same thing we
need to standardize our code base
