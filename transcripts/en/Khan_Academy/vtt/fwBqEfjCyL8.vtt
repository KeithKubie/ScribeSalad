00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.090
- [Voiceover] A circle in
the xy-plane has a diameter

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.320
with endpoints at eight, comma, 10

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.790
and negative two, comma, zero.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.520
Which of the following is
the center of the circle?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.590
So let's think about it.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.420
If you have some circle in the xy-plane,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.580
so this is my best attempt
at drawing a circle,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.710
and if you had two end
points of a diameter,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.590
so let's say

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.150
that this is a diameter

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.490
right over here.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.510
It looks something like this.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.090
So let's say that's our
diameter right over there

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.550
and that this point was the
point negative two, comma, zero,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.320
and this was the point eight, comma, 10.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.410
What would be the coordinates
of the center of the circle?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.550
Well the coordinates of
the center of the circle

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.350
is going to be the midpoint
of these two end points

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.250
of a diameter.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.990
In fact the center of the
circle is always going to be

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.210
the midpoint of the two
ends points of the center

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.550
of a diameter.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.690
If the diameter was this right over here,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.020
if the diameter was this over here,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.950
then once again the center
of the circle is a midpoint

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.590
of that point, and that
point right over there.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.290
So to answer this question,
we just have to find

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.090
the midpoint of this point and
this point right over there.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.052
And to find a midpoint, we
just have to find the average

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.050
of the x coordinates and the
average of the y coordinates.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.090
So let's see this is going
to be eight, the x coordinate

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.590
the average of eight and
negative two is eight

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.320
plus negative two,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.450
plus negative two over two,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.750
and the average of 10 and
zero, we know that's five,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.020
but we could say that's
10 plus zero over two.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.650
And let's see eight plus
negative two is six,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.120
divided by two is three and then

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.550
10 divided by two is five.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.920
Three, comma, five.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.219
And we see it right over there.
