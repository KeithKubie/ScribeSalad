[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.846
[DONG]

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:09.310
[CHIMES]

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.726
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.360
We talk about this all time.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.890
The urge to create is like
a knot in your stomach.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.730
When you finally
output something,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.515
when you have functional
aesthetic output, when

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:36.600
you create something
artful in the world,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.216
all of a sudden that
anxiety is gone.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:42.540
All of a sudden that knot
in your stomach dissipates.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.220
Right?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.190
Instead you enter a modality
of cognitive ecstasy.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.090
You enter an
exhilarating neuro-storm,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.940
as we were talking about.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.120
An intense,
intellectual pleasure.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.210
A dopamine rush, a feeling of
you've made a contribution.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.690
And that's what Shots of
Awe is to all of us here.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.640
To you holding the
camera, you know.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.800
To Jordan, to Barry,
helping to produce.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.920
To Tom, you know, the crew
of people that get together

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.170
to ban as we try to like
literally go out of our minds

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.020
in order to use our
minds for the first time.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.720
You know, to scramble with
self, to transcend the ego,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.880
to see what's up, to
put it all out there

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.030
to transcend the
specific and only talk

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.640
about the universe for a second.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.992
Leave the trick at the door.

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:37.701
Right?

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:38.700
That's what we're doing.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.260
That's what Shots of Awe is.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.080
To share our ecstasy,
to share subjectivity,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.245
to break through the
screen, to do what we always

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:51.287
hoped technology would help us
do, which is to come together.

00:01:55.743 --> 00:02:02.090
Warp space and time
and [MMPH] connect.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.240
That's what we want to do.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.590
