00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.434
So you have GERD. 

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.636
-I have GERD -Gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.773
Me too, GERD boys.
GERD boys in the house.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.074
Where did that come from?

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.308
Because I have GERD!

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:10.276
You feel-- you have GERD?

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.645
I have GERD.
I took this medication for GERD

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.815
and then when I take-
my side effect is can't sneeze.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.984
I thought my forehead was going
to blow up and I was like

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.185
(mimics sneezing)

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.154
And I would just go
choo choo choo.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.688
Not hing came out.
One day-

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.490
One day I forgot
my GERD medicine.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.159
I sneezed at - dude - the shit

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.227
that was coming out
of my nose was wild.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.797
-Wow you got nose
constipated. -Absolutely.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.435
Hey what's up, everybody.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.237 line:85%
I'm Chris Distefano.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.006
Tonight's guest, Matthew
Broussard. 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.575
You can follow him on Twitter 
@MondayPunday

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.011
and he's got an album
out called Pan-dantic

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.113
-Pedantic. It's pronounced
"pedantic." -Pedantic.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.081
It's pronounced "pedantic."

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.283
-You know what that word means,
Chris? -No.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:53.152
It means ostentatious
or showing of one's knowledge.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.321
Well don't I feel
like a pandan-dick.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:00:59.826 line:78%
Is that- Can we just do it?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.596
Okay so Matthew Broussard,
follow him @MondayPunday.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.264
I was just with him in Vegas
and I

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.466
was trying to have a good time

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.668
and he was just
making me guess puns.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.304
Okay so this is a man.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.640
I see Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods
with a dragon.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:15.908
What's the dragon doing?

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.945
The dragon is creeping,
leaning, bending down!

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.379
What am I doing?

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:21.514
Uh, creeping around.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:24.117
He's looking over. Looking
dragons on my shoulder.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.085
Does he-does he want you to see
him?

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.919
-No, no he's hiding hiding.
Hiding.-Yeah.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.823
-So Tiger... hide... a tiger in
hiding! -No no no.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.658
I love that you believe that was
the answer.

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.993
<i> Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i>!

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.728
<i> Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i>.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.098
I love you, mom.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:41.801
Alright, next stupid question:

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.305
Using the elliptical machine.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.141
-Yeah that's dumb
-Yeah that's dumb.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.376
That's not real.
What does that simulate?

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.211
Looks like a cross country
skiing over moguls.

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:53.980
Yeah, do you do the elliptical?

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.715
No. No, no.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.750
-Get on the StairMaster. -But
you exercise a lot? 

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.552
-Yeah, yeah.
-You're ripped.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.054
I saw you in Vegas. You kept
being like let's go to the pool

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:04.090
and I'm like I don't want to go
to the pool with you.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.592
Do you understand
that? I have fluffy fat nipples.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.628
-And you're just built like a...
-I have back hair.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.029
But you work hard! You do have
back hair.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.030
-You saw it.
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:13.432
Upper and lower, now. That's the
secret, people 

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.901
are like
"you're not really Jewish"

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.202
I'm like "you should
check out my back hair

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.436
"you'll see where it's all
happening."

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:18.704
That's what I-
that's what I like.

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.139
There's always balance
in the world.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:21.474
You know a handsome guy,
you're ripped,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.742
and then when you turned around

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.443
I was like oh there it is
he's got back hair.

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.078
-Like a frickin dirty...
-And bacne!

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.214
Yeah the bacne was gross. I was
like, yeah!

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.684
All right next stupid question.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.826
No. Well... In certain
situations it's great.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.161
Or you look like if I...

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:44.063
Like, if I was able
to like press a button

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:46.132
and make my khakis
into a person it's you.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.867
It's the nicest thing anyone's
ever said to me.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.734
Dude, you're my frickin boy.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:49.869
What are you-
What are you, though?

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.938
I guess like a mozzarella stick
if it could talk or like

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.839
I don't know- I guess it is...

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.875
You're if a UFC T-shirt was a
person.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.379
Thank you so much
for doing the show.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.615
I'd like to give you
a stupid gift now.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.350
Now, you know, I know
you were a swimmer

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.651
and even
if you weren't a swimmer

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:08.821
you are the definition of
STF "swim team face."

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:11.257
So I wanted to give you
a swim cap.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.625
Oh.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:14.293
I hope- I don't know
if it fits your head or know

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:15.695
if it's one size fits all.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.797
I just figured though
if it's made for swimmers

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.532
head you have a swimmers head.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:23.502
-Dude look at that.
-Boom. Yes. Yes.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:25.638
Thank you for diving into
<i> Stupid Questions</i>

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.574
with Chris Distefano.
This is Matthew Broussard.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:31.010
Find him on on Twitter
and Instagram @MondayPunday

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:33.513
and he's got his album
Pun-dantic, is that right?

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.416
-I can't hear you. -Okay.
I think it's Pun-dantic so...

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.517
This like ruined my hair.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.585
It didn't ruin-

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:40.619
How do you take off

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.588
that swim cap and your hair
is still perfect?

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.857
Wow. I want to punch you
and also kiss you.
