00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.406
&gt;&gt;Gulfport, Mississippi's
Harrison Central High School

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:20.376
hasn't changed much since
it was founded in 1957.

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.786
It still has sports
teams and cheerleaders.

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:28.366
It still offers practical
courses in subjects

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:30.226
like cooking and horticulture.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:34.776
But over the past several years
there's been a quiet revolution

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:37.776
going on that has transformed
Harrison's curriculum.

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.706
In almost every classroom
cutting edge technology tools

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.026
are facilitating a
new way of learning.

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.566
&gt;&gt;During the guilded
age what could be said

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.096
about national politics.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:51.776
Is it A, the republican party
held the majority of voters?

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now history lessons
are as exciting as game shows.

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:57.646
&gt;&gt;What is your final answer?

00:00:58.386 --> 00:01:01.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Digital cameras
help reveal the principles

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:01.886
of physics.

00:01:02.636 --> 00:01:03.506
&gt;&gt;Donnie: Are we collecting?

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Probes
and laptops are used

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.466
in real world scientific
explorations.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:11.176
&gt;&gt;They even use technology

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:14.056
to improve their nationally
ranked cheerleading squad.

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:16.316
&gt;&gt;Dianne: Okay, breathe
three times.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.246
In with the good,
out with the bad.

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:22.956
And rest for just a minute.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.706
&gt;&gt;When we had tryouts
we realized a lot

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.586
of our cheerleaders were not as
physically fit as they needed

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.366
to be to be able to go
through a competition routine

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.626
that it only lasts two minutes

00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.486
but those two minutes are
jam packed with stunts.

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.566
So we try to come up with
a conditioning program

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.476
and we use the computers
and the probes

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:43.156
to tell us what the heart rate
was before they exercised,

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:45.716
and then what it was afterwards
and also the respiration.

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:47.836
&gt;&gt;Like without this
stuff we'd have no idea

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:50.556
like how much things have
changed in, you know,

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.856
where we started and
where we're at now.

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:53.636
It lets people know you know

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:55.576
that they've either been
working hard enough or they need

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:56.456
to work a little bit harder.

00:01:57.586 --> 00:01:59.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Data from the
cheerleader workouts is given

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.626
to students in an Algebra
II class for analysis.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:05.216
&gt;&gt;The cheerleaders
gave us the information

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:08.846
and we have plotted it
by using our calculators.

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:11.626
We used a thing called
linear regression

00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:14.996
to get basically the
average increase or decrease.

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.156
&gt;&gt;Charlotte: These students
are just learning how

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:21.906
to graph equations and instead
of just plain graphing numbers,

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:25.226
we're graphing real data so they
can have something meaningful

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:26.036
for their work.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Math teacher,
Charlotte uses technology

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:31.636
to help students
make connections

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.186
between abstract concepts

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:36.796
and real world applications
whether they're graphing local

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:37.826
hurricane tides-

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:40.566
&gt;&gt;On the tide tables
it was point seven feet

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:44.666
at twelve-oh-five P.M. which
our X values are the times

00:02:45.026 --> 00:02:45.636
and Y values are-

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:48.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or taking virtual
field trips around the world.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.656
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to
find antique carousels online

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:52.746
around the world.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.776
&gt;&gt;Most of our kids never
get out of Harrison County

00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:59.686
so when I can send kids
on a virtual field trip

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:02.976
around the world,
it's just amazing.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:12.546
[Student playing instrument]

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.216
&gt;&gt;Right now I'm tracing myself

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:17.616
so I can determine my
velocity of the ball-

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:20.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this physics
class students use video

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.856
cameras, photo gates, and
other high-tech gadgets

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:28.136
to explore the science behind
their personal passions.

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.666
&gt;&gt;Olivia Graves: If you
consider a minute ago you went

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:33.576
from up there to the floor
in a thirtieth of a second.

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:38.016
So your acceleration and
your average velocity was a

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:39.106
lot faster.

00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:43.616
&gt;&gt;The idea that students are
actually going to benefit

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:48.006
from sitting in the desk all
day long I think is a fallacy

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:52.406
and a problem with education and
this gets them moving around,

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:54.376
discovering, learning.

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:58.896
Discovery to me is the most
important part of education.

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:02.226
&gt;&gt;I'm going to measure the
sound wave and the acceleration

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:03.296
or velocity of my strokes.

00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:05.396
Like I thought this course was
going to be like oh my god,

00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:06.856
physics formulas, math.

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:08.976
But actually when you're
actually doing things it makes

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:09.406
it fun.

00:04:10.346 --> 00:04:12.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fun is also
part of the lesson plan

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:14.656
for this American History class

00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:16.956
which combines a
game show format

00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:20.106
with a new remote control
technology called e-Clicks.

00:04:20.756 --> 00:04:22.996
&gt;&gt;A, Colorado, B-

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:25.006
&gt;&gt;Karen: I notice that
the kids really enjoy it

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:29.076
and I've actually compared test
scores after I've done reviews

00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:32.036
with the e-Clicks and with
scores where we haven't done it

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:33.706
and their scores
are actually better.

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:36.016
&gt;&gt;Or is it D, Troubelist?

00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:38.766
&gt;&gt;Karen: Then it's good
for me because I can go in,

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.196
print the results, and I can
see who is having problems

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:43.776
with what area and I can
cover it again if I need to.

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:48.816
&gt;&gt;Tell me why Wyoming
wanted to have women vote?

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:51.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Most of the men were
leaving so they brought women in

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:53.716
and gave them rights to vote
so they would bring the-

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:58.976
it would bring all the
men back to the state.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:02.046
&gt;&gt;It helps you learn because
it get everybody involved.

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:06.986
It's fun or whatever so we
can just you know all be-

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.996
&gt;&gt;Together, interact, yeah.

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:12.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Harrison
students often get a chance

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:14.286
to interact with
outside experts.

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:17.116
&gt;&gt;Expert: Usually you can
do that by rapid profiling.

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.346
It's computer generated.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:19.316
It's got two lasers.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:22.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this computer-ed
tech class students get advice

00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:24.756
on their individual
computer designs

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:26.406
from an expert in plastics.

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:28.206
The buttons are in the eyes.

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:30.286
The right one is the
distraught button

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.806
and when you push it it pops
out of his mouth and it's kind

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:35.036
of like he's sticking
his tongue out.

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:35.536
&gt;&gt;Expert: That's probably one

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.566
of the cheapest designs
you probably could come

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.116
up with that here.

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:39.486
That's a good one.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:42.486
&gt;&gt;Angela: We are going
to actually plot points

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:45.866
at the edges of every
building at the corners,

00:05:46.186 --> 00:05:48.816
and then find the distance in
between, and then we're going

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.126
to create what from ArcView?

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:50.866
&gt;&gt;Maps.

00:05:51.826 --> 00:05:53.416
&gt;&gt;Angela: Okay very
good, excellent.

00:05:53.616 --> 00:05:55.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
sophomore math class, seventh

00:05:55.996 --> 00:05:59.386
and eighth graders from nearby
North Gulfport Middle School are

00:05:59.386 --> 00:06:03.296
the visiting experts teaching
the older Harrison students how

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.936
to use GPS devices.

00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:07.356
&gt;&gt;This shows you
the coordinates.

00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:08.736
There's the north coordinate.

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:10.146
There's the west coordinate.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:15.386
&gt;&gt;Angela: The students in eighth
grade are just beginning to grow

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:17.776
and mature and so
for them to be able

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:20.726
to show older students is
just an incredible experience

00:06:20.726 --> 00:06:20.966
for them.

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:22.786
&gt;&gt;The northwest corner.

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:23.076
Yeah.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:25.346
&gt;&gt;So write down "30 degrees".

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:28.206
&gt;&gt;For latitude, longitude,
or elevation?

00:06:28.366 --> 00:06:29.356
&gt;&gt;Latitude.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.906
&gt;&gt;Angela: I have students
who are high achievers.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:34.416
We've got some that are low
achievers and we've got some

00:06:34.416 --> 00:06:37.326
in the middle and once they get
their hands on this technology

00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:39.076
that just doesn't even matter.

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:41.586
They rise up to the standard
that you set for them

00:06:41.956 --> 00:06:45.086
and this is something
that's new, it's innovative,

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:48.376
and one day many of these
kids will be doing this

00:06:48.376 --> 00:06:49.306
for their career.

00:06:49.306 --> 00:06:50.366
&gt;&gt;What was it, 30?

00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:50.926
Uh-huh.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.236
&gt;&gt;At this point you should
know which types are probes

00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:54.946
and what data collection
you're going to be making.

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:57.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In an outdoor
science classroom built

00:06:57.256 --> 00:06:59.356
by students preparations
are underway

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:02.956
for the weekly lab assignment.

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.786
After a 15 minute trek

00:07:04.786 --> 00:07:07.566
on the school's nature
trail students stop

00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:10.556
at specific points along the
stream to take water samples.

00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:13.886
The data they collect and
analyze is then passed

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:16.486
on to local water
quality agencies.

00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:17.876
&gt;&gt;How cold is it?

00:07:17.876 --> 00:07:18.676
&gt;&gt;We're at three point eight.

00:07:19.076 --> 00:07:20.506
&gt;&gt;Donnie: One way that
you can excite kids is

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.766
by getting them outside
of the classroom,

00:07:21.766 --> 00:07:23.316
letting them get their
hands on something

00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:25.446
and get a feel of
what's going on.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.986
&gt;&gt;Take your one milliliter
of water, pull your film up,

00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:29.776
place it on the center,
lay your film back down

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:30.776
and just run your
finger across it.

00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:31.806
That's all you've got to do.

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:35.176
&gt;&gt;When you can take kids out and
actually show them something,

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:38.026
let them participate, let
them figure out how to do it

00:07:38.026 --> 00:07:40.816
on their own, and then let them
interpret what they figure out,

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:42.646
then it has real
meaning for them.

00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:44.486
&gt;&gt;So you're doing PH over time?

00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:45.186
Um-hum.

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:47.956
&gt;&gt;Donnie: So within a minute
it's realistic to expect

00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:50.686
that you would collect
900, 1,000 data sets?

00:07:50.996 --> 00:07:51.826
&gt;&gt;Geez, okay.

00:07:51.956 --> 00:07:52.226
&gt;&gt;Donnie: Okay?

00:07:52.836 --> 00:07:53.976
&gt;&gt;Those are the kinds of skills

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:56.066
that I think kids need,
analytical skills.

00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:59.916
Not just simple memorization
or comprehension.

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:03.076
You know we need to take them
beyond that level to being able

00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:04.776
to explain their reason.

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:06.906
&gt;&gt;It's a good water-quality
indicator so

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:10.726
and then the crawfish are
under fair water quality

00:08:10.796 --> 00:08:13.276
so I guess the water
down there is okay.

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:16.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And then
you're going to graph it?

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For district
technology coordinator,

00:08:18.236 --> 00:08:20.726
Charlotte this is
the kind of learning

00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:21.746
that makes the challenge

00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:24.346
of technology integration
worth the effort.

00:08:24.646 --> 00:08:26.276
&gt;&gt;Charlotte: I love to
watch the students learn.

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:28.226
I like to see the
light bulb go off.

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:31.266
I like to see the teachers
feel successful that yes!

00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:34.816
When you know you did it, that
spark, when you see that happen,

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.146
when you see the classroom gel,

00:08:36.146 --> 00:08:38.036
when you see the
students sparkle,

00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:40.846
when you have them running
up to you and they want to be

00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:42.346
at school and they
want to learn,

00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:45.076
you know that you've done
what you're supposed to do

00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:47.666
because learning is life-long
and learning is exciting

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:49.616
and it's fun, but
it's also personal.

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:51.906
And we try to make
learning personal

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:52.966
in Harrison County Schools.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:59.726
