00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.740
One must agree on a common standard.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.240
And the standard therefore has to be something

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.220
which is reproducible

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.980
and should be convenient.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.520
And should also be permanent.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.280
And since so many measurements did depend
on feet,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.280
and indeed we still use the word foot to indicate
one of our basic units.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.660
Have a look at this picture.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.840
Which comes from a German book on geometry
of about 1550.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.040
And here you see

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.980
a group of men, lined up,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.440
and the only time I've ever seen people lined
up like that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.850
were not men, but girls in a beauty competition.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.440
Well, obviously, they are no beauties.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.840
So why are they doing it?

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.700
You see, they are all standing heel to toe

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.840
along this line.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.299
And the purpose of that was indeed to carry
out

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.580
what someone had found, and really it was
very brilliant idea,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.980
of getting an average foot.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.780
Because this was a way in which the average
foot in one village,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.880
could be more nearly to the size of an average
foot in another village,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.020
by having not, just picking one man at random
in each village,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.840
but by taking a number of them.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.100
And there was a very precise drill.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.620
You waited until church service on a Sunday
morning.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.960
You stopped the first 16 men coming out.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.720
Now that was rather dangerous procedure in
a way,

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.509
in that there was an element of selection
about it.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.620
They might easily be the first 16 anxious
to get across the local public house for a drink.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.719
But nevertheless you picked them and you told
them to,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.860
to step up... to stand along a line.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.760
And we will do this, not with 16 because it
would take rather a lot of time,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.000
there isn't much room, but with eight.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.640
Can I have eight volunteers, to imitate the
gentlemen in this picture?

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.160
And what we do, is you all stand, as best
you can like that, heel to toe.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.900
All in a line.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.300
You don't have to have both feet, but one
foot as there like that.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.380
One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.640
Yes, we've got eight, Bill.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.500
Oh sorry. 
- That's OK.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.100
Now.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.920
What the next instruction was, that whoever
was the man responsible in the village,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.720
had to take a piece of string and stretch
it out,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.440
from the heel of the last man, to the toe
of the first. Right?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.480
Cut it like that and now you see, we've got
a piece of string,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:12.510
which is equal in length to the sum of eight
feet.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.040
In this case 16 feet, taken at random.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.680
And then to get the average down to one of
the eight, or one of the 16.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.820
This very beautiful and very simple trick.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.660
Was just to take the string like this.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.180
And now that is exactly half, so it's four
feet.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.680
That is now down to two feet.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.740
And you had to use very flexible string so
as not to lose much in the bend.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.760
And there is the average foot taken from our
eight volunteers here.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.390
A very beatiful trick. Again you see the scale
of two coming in.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.450
And that was why specifically it was 16 men
you had to take

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.900
in order to get an average which would be
on the average a square root of 16,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.980
four times as less variable than if you had
taken one man alone.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.630
Right, so, there was the way in which if you
hadn't got a standard,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.260
an actual physical standard, you could indeed,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.320
you could indeed get a reasonable average.
