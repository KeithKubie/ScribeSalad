challenges both in terms of how they
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630
challenges both in terms of how they
pronounce individual words as well as

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640

many other things you could do to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
many other things you could do to
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310
many other things you could do to
improve the speech recognition system

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
improve the speech recognition system
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740

machine learning application there could

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
machine learning application there could
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539
machine learning application there could
be 50 different directions you could go

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
be 50 different directions you could go
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670
be 50 different directions you could go
in and each of these directions is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
in and each of these directions is
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740
in and each of these directions is
reasonable and would make your system

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
reasonable and would make your system
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.440
reasonable and would make your system
better but the challenge is how do you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
better but the challenge is how do you
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.249
better but the challenge is how do you
pick which of these to focus on and even

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
pick which of these to focus on and even
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.719
pick which of these to focus on and even
though I've worked in speech recognition

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
though I've worked in speech recognition
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.999

quickly and then iterate what I mean by
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.870
quickly and then iterate what I mean by
that is I recommend that you first

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
that is I recommend that you first
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.359
that is I recommend that you first
quickly set up a definition and metrics

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
quickly set up a definition and metrics
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.369
quickly set up a definition and metrics
so this is really you know deciding

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
so this is really you know deciding
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.520
so this is really you know deciding
where to place your target

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
where to place your target
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.930
where to place your target
and you get it wrong you can always move

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940
and you get it wrong you can always move
 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.400
and you get it wrong you can always move
it later we just set up a target

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410
it later we just set up a target
 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.730
it later we just set up a target
somewhere and then I recommend you build

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740
somewhere and then I recommend you build
 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.260
somewhere and then I recommend you build
an initial machine learning system

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270
an initial machine learning system
 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.330

if error analysis causes you to realize
 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.500
if error analysis causes you to realize
that a lot of the errors are from the

you're building so for example there's a

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049
you're building so for example there's a
 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.660
you're building so for example there's a
large academic literature on face

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670
large academic literature on face
 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.789
large academic literature on face
recognition and if you're trying to

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
recognition and if you're trying to
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.979
recognition and if you're trying to
build a face recognizer it might be okay

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989
build a face recognizer it might be okay
 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.960
build a face recognizer it might be okay
to build a more complex system from the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970
to build a more complex system from the
 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.500
to build a more complex system from the
get-go by building on this large body of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510
get-go by building on this large body of
 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.080
get-go by building on this large body of
academic literature but if you're

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090
academic literature but if you're
 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.420
academic literature but if you're
tackling a new problem for the first

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430
tackling a new problem for the first
 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.149
tackling a new problem for the first
time then I would encourage you to

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159
time then I would encourage you to
 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.270
time then I would encourage you to
really not overthink or not make your

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
really not overthink or not make your
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.100
really not overthink or not make your
first system

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110
first system
 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.110

- complicated which has build something
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.179
- complicated which has build something
quick and dirty and then use that to

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:30.189
quick and dirty and then use that to
 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.189
quick and dirty and then use that to
help you prioritize how to improve your

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199
help you prioritize how to improve your
 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.950
help you prioritize how to improve your
system so I've seen a lot of machine

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960
system so I've seen a lot of machine
 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.140
system so I've seen a lot of machine
learning projects and I've seen some

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150
learning projects and I've seen some
 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.209
learning projects and I've seen some
teams overthink their solution and don't

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219
teams overthink their solution and don't
 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.129
teams overthink their solution and don't
get me too complicated I've also seen

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139
get me too complicated I've also seen
 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.809
get me too complicated I've also seen
some things under thinking and build

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819
some things under thinking and build
 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.610
some things under thinking and build
something maybe too simple but on

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620
something maybe too simple but on
 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.490
something maybe too simple but on
average I've seen a lot more teams

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500
average I've seen a lot more teams
 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.450
average I've seen a lot more teams
overthink and build something too

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
overthink and build something too
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.550
overthink and build something too
complicated and I've seen teams you know

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560
complicated and I've seen teams you know
 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.309
complicated and I've seen teams you know
build something too simple so I hope

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319
build something too simple so I hope
 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.499
build something too simple so I hope
this helps and if you are applying to

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509
this helps and if you are applying to
 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.149
this helps and if you are applying to
your machine learning algorithms to a

your machine learning algorithms to a
 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.700
your machine learning algorithms to a
new application and if you main goal is

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710
new application and if you main goal is
 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.070
new application and if you main goal is
to build something that works um as

opposed to if you main goes to invent a

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
opposed to if you main goes to invent a
 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.689
opposed to if you main goes to invent a
new machine learning algorithm which is

new machine learning algorithm which is
 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.390
new machine learning algorithm which is
a different goal the remain goes to get

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400
a different goal the remain goes to get
 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.980
a different goal the remain goes to get
something that works really well I'd

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990
something that works really well I'd
 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.540
something that works really well I'd
encourage you to build something quick

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550
encourage you to build something quick
 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.820
encourage you to build something quick
and dirty use that to do bivariate

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830
and dirty use that to do bivariate
 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.890
and dirty use that to do bivariate
analysis use that to do error analysis

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900
analysis use that to do error analysis
 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.950
analysis use that to do error analysis
and you see results of those analysis

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960
and you see results of those analysis
 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.540
and you see results of those analysis
that helps you prioritize where to go

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550
that helps you prioritize where to go
 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:29.360
that helps you prioritize where to go
next
