SHIGERU MIYAGAWA: So I developed
the MOOC Visualizing Japan,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.160
which is an MITx HarvardX joint
project with John Dower of MIT,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.870
Annie Gordon of
Harvard, and also

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.880
Gennifer Weisenfeld of Duke.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.070
I incorporated the MOOC material
into my residential class

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.780
in 2014, and it
changed everything.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.410
It changed literally everything.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.220
And I continued to use it right
up until my last offering,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.150
which was fall of 2016.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.860
Before 2014, it was a
very traditional class

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.100
with lectures, PowerPoints,
and a little bit

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.920
of student discussion.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.530
When I incorporated the
MOOC material in 2014,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.370
I didn't anticipate
any major changes.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.680
I simply said,
why don't you look

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.440
at these video lectures
we just produced

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.540
and see what you think,
and think about them?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.140
And what I realized
right away was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
that students would
come into class,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.150
and they would have
a lot of knowledge,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.720
which was not the case before.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.850
So I would ask, so when
did Perry come to Japan?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.540
1853.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.120
When did Meiji era begin?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.137
1868.

00:01:31.137 --> 00:01:31.845
Why did it begin?

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:32.940
Blah, blah.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.890
So, my goodness.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.950
I had a whole set of
PowerPoints which I had

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.710
created from years of teaching.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.250
I did not show a
single PowerPoint.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.290
For 70 minutes, I just
asked them questions, just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.740
to see if I can find something
that they didn't know.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.630
They knew the whole thing.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.680
And I said, gee,
this is different.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.620
And without realizing it--

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.560
I didn't even know what
a flipped class was--

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.060
I just did a flipped class.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.979
I did not lecture
for a single minute.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.460
It was just question,
answer, discussion,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.950
posing deeper questions
for students to discuss.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.000
And I was absolutely,
absolutely stunned

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.770
that just in this one
class, the way I teach

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.460
changed fundamentally.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.270
So by having flipped the class,
one big concrete thing that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.630
came out of it--

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.370
this is MIT.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.560
So one of the
students was actually

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.280
getting some data on this.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.650
So there were a
couple times when

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.070
I had a traditional
lecture class,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.110
because I had to do something.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.560
And this student timed me.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.020
And she found that I was
speaking 80%, students 20%,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.380
which for a traditional
lecture class, that's not bad.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.622
And then so she told me that.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:10.580
And I said, well, look.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.690
Why don't you do the same thing
when we do the discussion?

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.660
So she did that, and she
found that it was 50-50.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.960
And qualitatively, it's
just completely different,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.566
completely different.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:26.000
I remember we had
a bunch of visitors

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.280
from Japan the second
week of the class.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.990
And I was doing the
interactive style.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.860
And they came up to me and said,
so how many months have you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.210
been teaching this class?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.250
I said, two weeks.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.760
They are like, it's
quite remarkable.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.160
I mean, just the sheer amount
of knowledge the students gain

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.520
from this new way of
teaching you cannot compare

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.450
to the previous.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.440
We like to lecture.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.590
We all like to lecture.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.500
And I miss lecturing.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.720
A lot of faculty members
who flip class tell me this.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.930
In their quiet moment in
the corner of their room,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.980
they whisper, I miss lecturing.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.310
But we all know that
this flipping class makes

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.530
it so much more effective.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.640
What's really important is to
have good material for students

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.830
to study ahead of class, and
I strongly recommend video.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.860
Video is a very rich
source of knowledge.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.930
And if you combine
that with reading,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.240
you'll be amazed at how much
students bring into class.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.890
And as one of my
colleagues, Rhonda Gibson,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.580
who has flipped her
materials class has said,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.450
the reason why flipped
class is so effective

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.680
is the students touch the
same material several times.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.550
Once when they viewing it
before coming to class,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.360
and second time when
we're discussing it,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.390
and third time when they do
a piece that's based on it.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.521
That's why it's so effective.

00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.020
Yeah.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.832
I think lecturing is going to
go the wayside of blackboards.
