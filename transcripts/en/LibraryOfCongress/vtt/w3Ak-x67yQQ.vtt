00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: So, good afternoon.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.940
Welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.240
I am Grant Harris.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.940
I am head of the European
Reading Room

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.980
over in the Jefferson
Building across the street.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.130
Together with the Embassy of Italy
and the Italian Cultural Institute,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.280
we are delighted to
welcome our special guest,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.200
distinguished professor Salvatore
Settis who will discuss his timely

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.270
and acclaimed book,
"If Venice Dies."

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.010
Let me mention that the
Library of Congress is proud

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.400
of its 400,000 volumes
from or about Italy.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.150
It includes an extensive collection
of monographs on the subjects

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.270
of Italians in the United
States, for example.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.610
We acquire each year much

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.040
of the best research level
materials from or about Italy.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.850
And we are proud to have the works

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.980
of Professory Settis
in that collection.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.000
I counted well over 50
items in our collections

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.980
where he's written maybe
a forward, or edited,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.110
or curated so we're very
pleased to have you here today.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.360
In talking about the collections
let me also mention the two people

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.640
within the library who have helped
with this very much, Tirus Spiegel,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.210
if just raise your hand there,
in the European Division.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.720
And Lucia Wolf who is
our specialist for Italy.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.960
And if you have questions
about using the collections,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.300
please get hold of
Lucia Wolf now or later.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.240
The European Division is
responsible for providing reference

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.830
and for developing the
library's collections relating

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.570
to continental Europe and Lucia
does that for Italy, and Malta,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.350
and Italian materials
from Switzerland,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.460
Vatican City, and San Marino.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.780
I think I've listed
most of it right.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
Now after the lecture we will
have a few minutes for questions

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.310 position:56%
and answers before the book signing.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.200
We hope you have a
pleasant time here today

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.870
and that you'll come back
and use the collections.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.400
Please turn off your cell
phones and recording devices

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.720
for the duration of the program.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.540
Also be aware that this event is
being recorded for a later webcast.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.350 position:56%
Renato Miracco, the cultural attache

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.050
at the Italian Embassy
cannot be with us today.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.520
He was instrumental in
putting this together.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.020
Unfortunately he has a family
bereavement back in Italy

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.590
so we hold Renato and his
family in our thoughts today.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.020
I welcome Michael Wise,
co-founder of New Vessel Press,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.830
and publisher of the English
translation of "If Venice Dies."

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.170
New Vessel Press specializes

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.050
in making foreign works
available to English speakers.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.710
"If Venice Dies" has been ably
translated by Andre Naffis-Sahely.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.870
Michael Wise has been a foreign
correspondent for Reuters

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.220
and the "Washington Post."

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.560
He is the author of a book
on German architecture

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.410 position:56%
and his writing has appeared in many
publications that I personally like,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.870
"The New York Times," "The Wall
Street Journal," "The New Yorker,"

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.090
"The Atlantic," and
"Foreign Policy."

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.390
That's quite a list.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.730
That's not all though.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.620 position:56%
So I would welcome Michael to speak
to us now and introduce the speaker.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.420
Thank you.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.630
[ Applause ]

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Wise: Thank
you very much.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.360
We are very grateful to
the Library of Congress

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.730
for arranging this program.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.340
I'm co-founder with Ross
Ufberg of New Vessel Press

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.290
and we're extremely
pleased to be the publisher

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.100
of the English translation
of Salvatore Settis' book

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.760
which appeared two years ago in
Italy as [foreign language spoken]

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.260
and now as "If Venice Dies,"
translated by Andre Naffis-Sahely.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.510
Salvatore Settis is an
archeologist, and art historian,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.250
and former director of both
the Getty Research Institute

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.310
of Los Angeles and the Scuola
Normale Superiore of Pisa.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.980
He's currently the chairman of the
Louvre Museum Scientific Council

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.720
and can be considered the
conscience of Italy for his role

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.810
in spotlighting the
country's neglect

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.960
of its national cultural heritage.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.530
And I think you'll soon
understand why that is

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.260
when you hear him speak today
about his concerns that he

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.890
so cogently lays out
in "If Venice Dies."

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.250
Washingtonians may remember that
he delivered the Mellon lectures

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.750
at the National Gallery
of Art in 2001,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.520
and he also gave the
Isaiah Berlin Lectures

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.760
at the Ashmolean at Oxford in 2000.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.520
His research interests
are centered on ancient

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.830
and Renaissance art history and
his many publications include

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.420
"The Future of the Classical,"
[Foreign Language spoken],

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.580
and he was co-editor of
"The Classical Tradition."

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.800
He has served as chair
of Italy's high council

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.070 position:56%
for cultural heritage and landscape.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.420
And his most recent book,
[Foreign Language spoken],

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.350
deals with the current debate about
constitutional reform in Italy

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.240
in which Professor Settis has
been extremely active ahead

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.980
of a referendum to be held
in Italy in early December.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.610
He finds time as well to curate
exhibitions including last year's

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.270
opening pair of shows at the
Fondazione Prada in both Milan

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.410
and in Venice about
classical sculpture.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.180
And he's also now working on
an exciting new exhibition

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.680
that will be held in Rome
in 2018 of the collection

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.630 position:56%
from the Museo Torlonia, the largest
private collection of classical

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.840
and Greek Roman sculpture
[inaudible] in the world.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.360
As an example of this impressive
array will be shown atop the

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.270
[Foreign Language spoken] in Rome
and we would be very fortunate

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.540
if it comes to the
United States as well.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.520
Finally, I'd be remiss
as his American publisher

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.660
if I didn't urge you to
buy a copy of his book

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.770
which is on sale outside.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.750
The book has received
considerable acclaim,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.110
most recently a wonderful
review in the "Washington Post."

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.630
And as you'll hear now, "If
Venice Dies" is an eloquent appeal

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.420
to save the soul of one of
the world's greatest cities

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.450
and a wake-up call for us
all to heed what's happening

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.590
to our own lives and
what could happen

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.510
to historic cities everywhere.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.890
[ Applause ]

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.190
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis:
Thank you, Michael,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.490
for this generous introduction.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.790
I'm particularly glad to be here.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.390
And thank you all for inviting me
to give a talk here about my book

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.510
and about Venice more generally.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.870
I'm very grateful to
the Italian Embassy

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.970
and to Renato Miracco
particularly and Angela [Inaudible]

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.200
who is here now, and to
the Library of Congress,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.680 position:56%
particularly to Lucia Wolf and Tirus
Spiegel for organizing this event.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.620
And I particularly like
to thank Michael Wise

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.220
for translating my book in English.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:37.220
My lecture is, you will understand
quite soon, is based on my book

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.650
but not identical with my book.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.940
By way of introduction let
me make two short remarks.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:48.020
First, while my book's focus
from the title on Venice,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.440
it is not only about Venice.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.550
It is about the destiny of
historical cities around the world,

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.310
in Italy but not just in Italy.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.830
Second point, "If Venice
Dies," putting death

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.600
in the title is not necessarily
a good idea but I what I wanted

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:13.670 position:56%
to stress is that death is a good
vantage point where from we may look

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.050
at trauma, at problems of life.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:26.160 position:56%
So as in private life when we have a
trauma from some death of a mother,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.550 position:56%
father, of a person who is dear to
us, this will bring us to think more

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.420
about our life and
in different terms.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.450
So "If Venice Dies," this is not
just to comply with the [inaudible]

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.980
of death in Venice, but to
reflect what will happen,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.250
what might happen if Venice dies.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.130 position:56%
And just to start with, what you see

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.510
on the screen is not
Venice but Las Vegas.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:00.090
[ Laughter ]

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.890
Of course you may recognize the
proximity of different buildings,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.840
the Rialto Bridge which
is much nicer

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.980 position:56%
than this one and the Doge's Palace.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.560
Okay. Cities die in three ways.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.710
When a relentless enemy
destroys them

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.450
like the Romans did
with Carthage in 146 BC.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.010
When a foreign nation
installs itself with force,

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.470
driving away the natives
and their gods

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.440
like the [inaudible] land before
it was transformed into Mexico City

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.180
and wiped out in 1521
by the conquistadors.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:45.230
Or when the inhabitants of a given
city lose the memory of themselves

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.280
and without realizing it they
become strangers to themselves.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.810
They become their own enemies.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.500
This was the case for Athens
which, after the glory

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.050
of the classical polis and evidence
of culture, art, and history opened

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.130
up by the likes of Sophocles,
Euripides, Pericles, [Inaudible],

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:09.050
and so forth and so on, lost
first it's political independence

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.400
and later ended up forgetting
every memory of itself.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.180
We often tend to consider Athens as
unchanged the remaining centuries,

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.020
and able and tend to believe that
it flowed with renewed splendor

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.300
when Greece became
independent in 1827.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.450
But this is not the case.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.390
It was the end of the twelfth
century when the [inaudible],

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.520
Michael Choniates,
arrived from Constantinople

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.650
as the new bishop of Athens.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:42.620 position:56%
He was shocked, as he tells us in a
text which preserved, he was shocked

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.590
at the terrible ignorance
of the Athenians.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.760
He says, "They no longer
knew anything

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.080
of ancient glories
of their own city.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.520
They cannot even identify the
[inaudible] which are still intact.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.770
They were not able to
indicate where [Inaudible],

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:05.150
or Plato, or Aristotle had taught.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:10.890
The Parthenon was at the time a
Christian church which was covered

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.860
in icons and where
liturgical songs were heard

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.200
and incense filled the air.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.110
It was [inaudible] cathedral.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.080
It was plundered repeatedly
by Italians, by Florentines

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.470
and Venetians particularly, without
the thing as lifting their finger

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.240
to defend the Parthenon
or the monuments.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.280
When Athens was [inaudible]
by the Turks in 1456,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.520
three years after Constantinople,
the Parthenon was transformed

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.770
into a mosque as you can
see here and even the name

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.070
of the city was forgotten.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.070
What remained was a small village
with outgrowing here and there

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:54.010
and Athenians, reduced to a few
thousand people called it Satinee

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.310
[phonetic spelling],
Satinus [assumed spelling],

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.760
a mispronunciation of the name.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.070
So even, Athens had
lost even its name.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.920
But Athenians had begun to forget
themselves long before this time.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.240
Already by around 1430 AD, the
new Platonic philosopher, Plautus,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.680
who lived very close
to the Acropolis,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.700
tells of having seen Athena,
the goddess of the Parthenon,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.810
in a dream, who, having been
driven from her seat asked

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.670
for hospitality in Plautus' house.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.570
This nostalgic dream
clearly conveys decline

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.100 position:56%
of a culture and its self-awareness.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.450
Now today we have forgotten

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.050
that even Athens eventually
forgot itself.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.310
But perhaps we should recall the
darkness of the forgotten memory

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.810
if we want to avoid suffering

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.580
in our contemporary world
the same affliction.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.460
Now we come to Venice,
a special city,

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.370
greatly loved and very fragile.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.140
We all know the monumental
areas frequently visited

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.860 position:56%
by tourists including ourselves even

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.020
if we have never explored
its [foreign language spoken]

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.460
or minor churches which
are extraordinarily rich

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.010
in urban and artistic merit.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.820
Let me mention very briefly some
unique characteristics of Venice

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.630
such as an urban framework
which has evolved

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.920
over centuries always maintaining
only two means of getting

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.710
about for people and wares,
by foot or by waterway.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.510
An extraordinary richness
of monuments or works of art

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.910
which reflect the enormous
prosperity of the [inaudible].

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.520
The constant decrease in
the resident population,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.400
which I will come to later, the
continual increase of mass tourism

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.990
which invades most famous
areas of the city, and finally,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.780
the fashion of having a second home
in Venice which most of us would

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.690
like to have as many have which
has the effect of inflating prices

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.210
and transforming Venice
into a city of second homes

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:05.320
which often remain empty
for almost the whole year.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.510
Venice is enclosed in its
lagoon like a pearl in an oyster

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:14.510
but few understand the nature
between the lagoon and Venice.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.180
The city extends into 118
islands linked by bridges

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.660
but to this should be added
other islands such as San Giorgio

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.710
or Torcello, accessible
only by water.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:31.690
City, islands, and lagoon make
up an ecosystem unparalleled

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.930
for the balance between natural
environment and human places.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.170
Lagoon has never been for Venice
either a limit or a neutral space.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.510 position:56%
It has been and it is, it should be,
the very condition of its existence.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.500
And this transforms itself over
time in harmony with the city,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.780
reflecting its beauty and
its history with the sort

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.850
of counter melody [foreign language
spoken] I would say in Italian

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.300
without which even the
voice of Venice would fade.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.080
This intimate union was
represented in maps.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.950
For example, in the plan
by Benedetto Bordone, 1528,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.190
which the islands of the lagoon and
the ring of land around the city

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.000 position:56%
from Mestre to Lido, were considered
as a sort of periphery [inaudible]

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.350 position:56%
into the urban dimension by means of
accurate [inaudible] in indicators.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.340
In this plan we already
see, for example, Marghera,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:35.720
which is highlighted on
the corner of top left,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.470
where a place I will mention later.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.910
Marghera is indicated by
name so it does belong

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.050
to the urban space
although it is rather

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.430
on the terra firma
than in Venice itself.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.020
The territory of the community of
Venice, [Foreign Language spoken],

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:58.650
in current administrative
[inaudible] includes a vast area

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.410
of mainland of which Marghera,
Mestre, and other areas is shown

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.130
on the slide including the
Tessera airport are part.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.110
And the population is
moving towards this areas

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:14.060
in recent decades especially the
younger generations but mostly,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.000
not because they like
it better there,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.730 position:56%
but because it's much less expensive

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.220
and they don't have enough
money to live in [inaudible].

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:28.240
If we look at the population
statistics for Venice [inaudible],

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.540
we see a noteworthy drop of 100,

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.500
000 fewer inhabitants
in the last few decades.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.700
But if we distinguish,
as it's necessary,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.360
the mainland from the
historical center,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.160
we see that the situation
is much more dramatic.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.920
You have the statistics as reported
in my book in the English edition,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.690
which is updated by in
relation to the Italian edition,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.280
but I add for this
lecture a [inaudible] slide

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.200
with the statistics count

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.880
on June thirteenth [inaudible]
a few days ago but a few less,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.590
that now we are at 54
thousand and a few hundred.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:22.800
Now we know that 2.6
people on average move away

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.180
from Venice every single day.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:32.500
All the progress I was
talking about had to be seen

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.090 position:56%
against this very worrying backdrop.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.440 position:56%
Decrease of population in Venice has
started [inaudible] in other words,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.830
doesn't necessarily
mean increase in numbers

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.760
of mainland Venice inhabitants
as shown by the chart here.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.670
You see the historic center is in
blue and the terra firma is in red.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.060
The [inaudible] of terra
firma is declining.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:00.190 position:56%
Now if Venice is to die, it will not
be on account of enemy invasions.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:06.670
It will because most
of Venetians and most

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.050
of Italians have forgotten
about Venice.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.550
And forgetting [inaudible]
for a community today,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.130
that's not only mean
forgetting one's own history.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.340 position:56%
It also means the lost understanding
of the specific role of every city

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.040
with respect to others of
the uniqueness and diversity

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.670
of every city which is
perhaps no other city

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.480
in the world possesses
as much as Venice.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.560
Which is that I think
as necessary in a world

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.610
which the urban dimension
is not only grown enormously

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:42.110
but has been distorted by the
growth of gigantic mega-cities,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.110
human [inaudible] where in name
of productivity tens of millions

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.580
of people gather often condemned
to conditions and patterns of life

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.850
that have little to do
with the original sense

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.280
and spirit of the city.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.510
Let me mention as an example
a place where I've never been,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.670
Chongqing in China which in
1930 had 600,000 inhabitants

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:11.790
and today has almost 34
million people living in it.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.910
Thirty-four million
people in last few decades.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.790
The very notion of a city, a
cultural creation which is a hotbed

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.640
of thought and civilization,
elaborately for social relations

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.440
and culture tends to become
the shell of the shapeless

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.100
of apparently spontaneous
[inaudible] by small,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.170
wealthy minorities while the
majority of citizens are holed

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.390
up in squalid housing
blocks and are considered

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.560
of not the citizens
but this workforce.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.150
This development is coming
about with unequal speed

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:48.600
in various parts of the world.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.900
[Inaudible] to perceive
the difference

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.200
between the old former [inaudible]

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.460
and the [inaudible]
idea of megalopolis.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.220 position:56%
In Italy distinction between the old
city of citizens and the new form

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.620 position:56%
of worker ants which are also a
necessary consumer ants is expressed

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.450
in the harsh contrast
between historical centers

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.520
and peripheries which besiege them.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.590
Having grown up in [inaudible]
in less than a few decades

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.100
under the push of property
speculation in land rents,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.120
Italian [inaudible] are in general
[inaudible] by an architecture

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.020 position:56%
of extremely poor aesthetic quality.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.730
[Inaudible] with their respective
historical centers by the poverty

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.020
of spaces for social life.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:36.240
In hilltop cities like Sienna we
still see its form from far away

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.480
but in other cities,
like for instance Naples,

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.940
we see that they are [inaudible]

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.980
by an apparently unstoppable urban
sprawl that actually translates

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.430
in a relentless erosion of
the varied idea of a city,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.360
or more accurately,
immense metastasis in lots

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.770
of indecipherable growth
entailing the destruction

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.350
of everything with
surrounding spaces.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.870
The center is old,
city, countryside,

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.840
harmony which made Italy the garden
of Europe has died a violent death

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.250
and at the hands, not of invaders,
but of the Italians themselves.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.430
Cities are not only made of
buildings and roads but of men

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.200
and women with their cultural,
religious, and social connections.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.620
Urban form has been created and
modified over time according

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.750
to powerful mechanism which Henri
Lefebvre has termed "the production

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.050
of space," [foreign
language spoken].

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:38.350
The space in which we live, being
by its very nature a social space,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.910
is indeed the product of people and
results from economic processes,

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.530
from political decisions,

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.160
from cultural choices
which come together.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.930
Therefore the space for industrial
civilization is radically different

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.680
from that of another culture.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.580
For this reason Venice, with
its unique history and relation

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.880
with the lagoon, [inaudible]

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.670
of the centuries [inaudible]
itself a culture and social space

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:10.270
of [inaudible] and originality
with very few possible comparisons.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.250 position:56%
Beyond the visible city of buildings

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.890
and roads there is
an invisible city,

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:19.280
a city I would say with a soul.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.570 position:56%
It defined by a double relationship,
a relationship of the city

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:28.880
with the human body, i.e. the
citizens who inhabit that city.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.340 position:56%
And there's a relationship with
nature, the surrounding countryside,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.980
in the case of Venice, the lagoon.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.360
And it entails a relationship
of proportions between the body

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.930
of the citizen and
the body of the city.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.540
I would say that the body
of the city mimics, repeats,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.170
enhances the citizen's body.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.800
It welcomes and guides the citizen.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.930
It echoes the voice, and steps,
and leads him or her to streets

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.370 position:56%
and bridges, to [inaudible] grace
with a lift and flow that in Venice,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.240
as much as elsewhere
historic cities,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.460
is a collective creation involving
aristocrats and merchants, artisans

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.040
and sailors, glass workers and
[inaudible], men and women.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.160 position:56%
In its long history Venice conquered
the right to the city for those

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.210
who dwell in it which in this city
also means the right to nature,

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.490
a right to the wellbeing of the
lagoon which has been integral

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.450
to Venetian life and
history for millennia.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:35.400
Today though hundreds
of million people live

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.000
in [inaudible] areas called
[inaudible] by tens of millions

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.430
of people, areas made to increase
the production for goods for all

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.740
and to increase the profits
for a few people without limit.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.470
And this process of
concentrating people

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:56.850
into giant beehives seems
destined to expand in the future.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.910
It's difficult, at least for me,
to believe that those who live

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.160
in such [inaudible] better
lives than those who live

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.200
in historic cities reflecting
[inaudible] urban culture

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.690
such as Venice.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.460
Yet mega-cities have become an
[inaudible] icon for our time

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.350
and are conventionally identified
with the very idea of modernity.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.690
Yet do we really want to think

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.590
that megalopolis will supplant
all other urban forms forever?

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:27.230
Or will it instead be worthwhile
to keep other alternatives in mind

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.920
when we think of the
city of the future?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.890
Do we wish, that's the
question, to nurture

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:38.630
or to destroy the multiplicity
and diversity for urban forms?

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.780
Venice and Chongqing are
two quite different models

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.700
of communal living thus in order

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.750
to better understand Chongqing
we must inevitably think also

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.050
of Venice.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.940
Like megalopolis the
skyscraper is taken as an icon

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.400
of modernity especially
where skyscrapers are not

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.980
so common, such as in Italy.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.210
And it is perhaps for
this reason that as part

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.770
of the project presented
the Venice [inaudible]

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:15.440
in 2010 [inaudible] architect with
Italian assistance to save Venice

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.090
from the high waters by
surrounding it by what,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.010
a corona of skyscrapers
built on artificial reefs

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:26.890
which surrounds the city,
protects it from the seas

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.940
and populates it with Venetians.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.660
Let me read from the site

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.350
of this [inaudible] study,
the [inaudible] text.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.130
"When looking at the not so
distant future, they say,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.640
we have a few certainties.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:47.950
Sea level will rise and global
warming will affect climate.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.600
Aqualta 2016, that's
the name of the project,

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.820
is an attempt to describe
this scenario.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.360
How do we protect the
city from the sea?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.010
What if we consider bringing a new
[inaudible] a linear city merging

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.840
from the water around
Venice, a new frame

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.680
and a new perspective
toward Venice to preserve

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.340
and enjoy the historical city.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.970
What does this city look like?

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.200
If it's along waterfront
stretching in front of Venice

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.040
and if the weather is
warmer, why not think of it

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.010
as the Italian Copa Cabana."

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.310
[ Laughter ]

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.160
I'm quoting.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.320
"A long beach submerged
by tropical vegetation."

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.620
What a nice view.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.920
What a nice perspective.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.380
"A vision of a vision,"
they continue.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.990
"The old Venice overlooking
the Bay of Ipanema.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.620
The new town beaches and houses
will have the glorious backdrop

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.730
of an unseen Venice."

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.110
So for the quote.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.950
Let's highlight two
points of this text.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.570
On one hand Venice is being
[inaudible] on two other latitudes

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.900
like might be sort of
periphery of Rio de Janeiro.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.000
On the other it is no
longer a city which to live

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.140
but rather a city to
observe from afar.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.050
In order to enjoy the view of the
historical city indeed it is good

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:14.910 position:56%
to think of it as glorious backdrop
for whoever will live in skyscrapers

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.780
which is the real place, the
place for real human beings.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.310
In a vision such as this
the Venetians would stay.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.080
The historical city would
be like fish in an aquarium.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.150
[ Laughter ]

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.230
A [inaudible] of skyscrapers was
also in the mind of a former mayor

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:36.110
of Rome who in 2010 send me
[inaudible] Venice [inaudible] said

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:40.790
officially he wanted to
make Rome's periphery denser

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.500
by constructing a column of
skyscrapers meant to rise

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.130
above the dome of St. Peter's

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.990
which so far is [inaudible] the
height limit for business in Rome.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:55.090
It will then, he said, have
a Rome of skyscrapers next

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.950
to the most important
city center in the world.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.800
That's in the words of
a former mayor of Rome.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.870
Skyscrapers in Rome, skyscrapers
in Venice, skyscrapers really based

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:13.940
in Milan, as you see here
in the on the screen.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.070
The party line goes as follows:

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.290 position:56%
In Italy in the last few decades
there have been too few high quality

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.660
architectural projects.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.960
Now is therefore the moment
to make up for lost time.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.780
This fever to update is
a provincial obsession

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.120 position:56%
that makes the skyscraper the symbol
[inaudible] of modernity forgetting

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.040
that actually skyscrapers
were really connection

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.910
with anything New York
or Chicago 100 years ago.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.630
Not now. Therefore,
even a great architect

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.850
such as Renzo Piano is now
building a skyscraper in Turin

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.470
which according to the
original project should be,

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:55.250
as in this picture, taller
than the Mole Antonelliana

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.790
and thereby breaking
city regulations.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:03.370
After many protests the height
was reduced by one foot.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.730
[ Laughter ]

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.730
A ridiculous difference
which is not the sign

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.620
of respect but instead as near.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.490 position:56%
However with these skyscrapers today

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:18.070
in Italy means updating Italian
cities to a century ago or better,

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:25.200
not imitating New York or Chicago
but Chongqing, Singapore, or Dubai.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.570
I hope you will forgive me if
I continue to prefer to Venice

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.610
by Odoardo Fialetti, a
rather glorious version

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.730
of the city even without
skyscrapers.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.790
Now before speaking of
more disturbing situations,

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:46.330 position:56%
I would briefly like to mention very
briefly the [inaudible] safeguarding

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.430
that [inaudible] heritage
currently in place in Italy.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:55.180
Nuns of all Italian states that
existed before the [inaudible]

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.020
of Italy mid-nineteenth century,

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.440
nuns of all the Italian states
including the Republic of Venice

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.730
and oldest in the world, and they
acquired new strength and impetus

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.340
from the notion of
[foreign language spoken]

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.180
or cultural heritage created
during the French Revolution

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.120
and imported into Italy.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.280
Current laws are restoring
to the basis of legislation

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.690
from the twentieth century.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.780 position:56%
Let me only mention that legislation
on landscape, the first law,

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:30.680
first Italian law on landscape
is dated 1920 and the Minister

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.800
for Education was the greatest
Italian philosopher of that time,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.470
Benedetto Croce when
a great philosopher

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.980
like Benedetto Croce
could be a minister.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.720
A very important turning
point was the constitution

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:49.220
of the Italian Republic in
1947 where Article 9 reads,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.380 position:56%
"The republic, the Italian Republic,
safeguards natural landscape

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.190
and historical [inaudible]
of the nation."

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:02.270
For the first time in 1947 the
principle of heritage entered

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.270
into the founding principles
of the constitution

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.050
of the modern state although there
are precedents in the constitution,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.430
particularly of the
Weimar Republic in Germany.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.060
Notwithstanding the constitution
and the laws, in Venice [inaudible]

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:22.350 position:56%
with the erosion of the very idea
of a city takes place also in Italy.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.020
Above all and the destruction
centuries old armory

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.570
between city and countryside.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:33.080
What elsewhere is countryside
for Venice is the lagoon

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.370
where the waters of the sea
mix with those of the rivers.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.940
Lagoon and city beckon together
from a complex [inaudible] system

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.260
through are preserved
and implemented in time

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.030
through mechanisms of surveillance
and management over the waters.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.330
The [foreign language spoken],

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:55.380
created in about 1510 had been
unfortunately abolished two years

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.830
ago by the Italian government.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:06.690
Now today Venice appears
to many as a city

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.810
like any other whose development
is only limited by the lagoon.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.800
The lagoon is seen as an empty
space, as a limit to the city.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.340
It has therefore been
proposed to save Venice

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.730
from isolation while the beginning

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:25.100
of the twentieth century the
futurists sought to fill in

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:31.280
and tarmac over the Grand Canal
[inaudible] they foresee a Venice

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:37.210
[inaudible] underground system in
order to create a single mega-city

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.590
out of the three with
underground lines

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.670
which would run under the lagoon.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.910
In shorter distance
Venice increasingly looks a

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.070
dramatically outdated.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.900
There are vast territorial
restructuring projects whereby the

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.070
city would change its
name in English.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.690
Veneto City or Venice Land.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:04.090
Huge built up areas
-- I'm just quoting.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.390
They're serious about it.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.950
I'm joking but they're not.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.160
Huge built up areas where
one imagines that real life,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.090
that of production and consumption
of goods, is carried out in areas

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:20.600 position:56%
of new construction while historical
Venice could be an exciting sort

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.970
of periphery on city
shore I think back.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.320
Such a Venice would be
actually a sort of Disneyland,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.690 position:56%
more like the creations of Las Vegas
than the city of the Doges Palace

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.560
and of St. Mark's Basilica.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.330
This process of Disney-fication
had been announced,

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:42.990
pre-announced many years ago and
I found an article in 1981 by one

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.200
of the leading professors
of architecture

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:54.430
in the Polytechnical di Milano
published in 1981 in the journal,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.280
"[Foreign Language spoken],"
whereby he said that, quote,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.710 position:56%
"The transformation of Venice into a
Disneyland could signal the passage

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:08.200
to a more creative, more cheerful,
and more festive way of living."

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.770
Actually nothing in the
world goes against the model

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.770
of urban development based
on urban densification

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.760
and architecture verticalization.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.840
Protected by the lagoon [inaudible]
symbiotic relationship this city

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.310
appears a happy island
in a world afflicted

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.150
by uncontrollable metamorphosis.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.130
According to architectural
historian, Manfredo Tafuri, quote,

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.590
"Venice is an unbearable
challenge to the world of modernity

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:45.720 position:56%
that elicits assaults by
developers, ambitions by architects,

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.240
and massive invasions of tourists."

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.190
And then, "All you need is to
stop for a few hours in Venice

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:57.690
to be threatened, gun to your
head, by the gusts of a modernity

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:01.960
that takes the form of mega-ships
almost the familiar skyscrapers

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.970
within the city itself.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:09.080
[Inaudible] of consumer reminder
I will show a few slides taken

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.370
from real life in Venice.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.450
A status of consumerism, the
cruise ships which invade the city,

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.590
destroying its skyline better
resemble a huge Las Vegas hotels

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.010
than ships.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.560
Like in Las Vegas, ships
with thousands of beds,

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.970
4,000 beds for instance, pass
themselves off as exclusive luxury

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:33.820
but are holiday machines that
sell illusions passing the most

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.480
[inaudible] of its
highly personalized ships

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:45.030 position:56%
that are [inaudible] and try their
best to look like a convention city.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.040
The big moment of glory
for these monster ships is

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.830
when they can show off
their [inaudible] arrogance

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.450
of being an artificial city
forcing their way into the docks

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.850
of San Marco challenging the
[Foreign Language spoken]

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.020
with their garish bulk.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.830
The mega-ships penetrate the
heart of Venice to see its beauty

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.080
but they overshadow and damage
the city, changing its perception.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.820
To mention but one, the ship called
Divina [assumed spelling] is 220

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:24.310
feet high, twice as tall as the
Doge's Palace, and 1,094 feet wide,

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.300
twice the breadth of
Piazza San Marco.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:34.430
At times up to a dozen liners have
entered the lagoon in a single day.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:39.210 position:56%
Mega-ships are only -- so you can be
in Venice and see things like this.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.220
Mega-ships are only the most
visible sign [inaudible]

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.530
that devastates Venice social
and [inaudible] family.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.180
Eight million tourists
pour into Venice's streets

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.170
and canals each year to
the point that tourists

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.740
out number Venetians 140 to 1.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.740
Such a disproportion has
impacted the [inaudible]

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.720
and is [inaudible] altering
the population and the economy.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.670
[Inaudible] from the island city
and thus will remain a shuttered

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.890
to serving of [inaudible],
restaurants,

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.400
and shop selling glass
souvenirs and carnival masks.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.770
Alarm at this state of affairs
led to recent UNESCO decision

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.780
to place Venice on
its World Heritage

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.650
In Danger List unless
substantial progress

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.400
to [inaudible] city is
made by February 2017.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.100
In Italy these ships
had the terrible habit

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.330
of passing dangerously
close to the coast.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:39.710
After the ship wreck of the
Costa Concordia in January 2012

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.420
that left 32 people dead
off the coast of Tuscany,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.620
the Italian government ruled
that major ships must stay

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.960
at least two miles away from shore

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.090
to prevent similar
occurrences in the future.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:56.320
And this has been enforced
with one exception,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.910
Venice where there is no limit.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:08.490
I think that this is very
telling, this inability to deal

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.400
with the problems of Venice.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.610
Besides the horrible
[inaudible] the mega-ships,

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.770
one can also add the significant
decrease of water quality.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.620
A high risk of pollution and the
subsequent spilling of hydrocarbons

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.920
in the heart of the city.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.650 position:56%
It is that the increases with number
of cruise liners that are allowed.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.590
Authorities try to deny
the fact of this pressure

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.240
and there is no clear
data, no official data

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.170
on pollution dust particles.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.080
Apparently 500 tons of dust
particles dumped by ships

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.990
in Venice in every single year.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:48.240
Or on the very [inaudible] data
on the presence of benzopyrene,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:55.380
highly toxic chemical being
[inaudible] in the lagoon.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.290
The [inaudible] contradicts
the model of modernity

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.470
with the [inaudible]
skyscraper of this symbol.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:08.440
On the other hand though a very
concrete project for the skyscraper

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.530 position:56%
in Venice and particularly in
Marghera has been seriously launched

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.590
by Pierre Cardin, a
French fashion designer

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.200
who is actually Pietro
Cardin, born in Treviso.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:27.130
His Palais Lumiere would cost
one and a half billion Euros,

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:32.060
licensed 820 feet high and
covering an area of 43 acres

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.960
in Marghera's dilapidated
industrial zone.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.130
Three interlacing towers, 60
habitable floors in western fashion

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.070 position:56%
and the offices, shops, [inaudible],
conference places, [inaudible],

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:48.140
major stores and sports grounds,
a vertical city presented

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.350
as a unique occasion to reclaim
an industrial area in decline

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.320
but also a dramatic transformation
brings the skyline high,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.790
more than twice the Campanile de
San Marco, that would be built

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.090
in defiance of all
the urban [inaudible].

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:09.160 position:56%
Impossible not to see it from the
Piazza San Marco especially by night

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.910
because if it is to be
a Palais Lumiere is has

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.330
to be very visible by night.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.910
Not only this, it would also cut

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:19.810
across flight paths violating
the height restriction imposed

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.060
by the National Civil
Aviation Board by three,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.910
by [inaudible], by 360 feet.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:30.740
So if this is ever built,
please don't fly to Venice.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:34.440
But fortunately the project
had been abandoned recently.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:42.690
And even the very negative public
opinion in Italy and elsewhere.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.970
But Pierre Cardin came so far
as to advertise apartments

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.200
in his Palais Luminere in
shop windows in France.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.270
And the dark stain you see
here, you see, what is this?

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.180
This is Venice, same profile.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.410
Venice as a backdrop.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.270
[Inaudible] to increase the price

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:08.860
of the different apartments
especially on the highest floors.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:15.010
So now the question is why,
what to the Palais Lumiere

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.230
and the cruise lines down the
Grand Canal have in common?

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.510
They are, some say, good
opportunities for Venice

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.670
but I ask why, if we want to
take tourists to Venice by sea,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.750
it is done with high
polluting cruise liners?

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:32.220
Why over the enormous area he would
have at his disposal does Cardin,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.120
or Cardin, not construct two,
or three, or five smaller towers

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.520
with the same purpose of this area?

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.480
Because he wants it to
be visible from afar.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.130
There's only one possible answer.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.830
In all these cases violating Venice
is not [inaudible] of consequence.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.800
It is rather the heart
of the project.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.600
It is as some have said essential
to [inaudible] this larger city

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.570
which irritates the
priests of modernity,

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:06.760
that's Tafuri general
commenting on the process.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.820
A larger city which irritates
the priests of modernity much

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.310
as an unwilling virgin
might irritate a womanizer

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.370
who thinks himself
irresistible like Don Giovanni

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.470
who thinks himself irresistible.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.020
The desecration rather the
[inaudible] of the desecration

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.900
versus strong symbolic meaning.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.750
This is statement of
hyper modernity.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.500
Now my little book that has
been recently published and also

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.560
in English thanks to Michael
Wise, is centered in Venice

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.790
as its title implies,
nevertheless my intention strives

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:40.330
for a wider scope namely the
destiny of historic sites,

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:44.440
of historic cities as contrasted
with a few dominant behavioral

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.860
and architectural models such as
the skyscraper or the megalopolis.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.980
I'm obviously aware that
Venice is subject perhaps more

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.340
than any other city to the
potentially dramatic consequences

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.410
of climate change and
rising sea level.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:03.250
This point is relatively marginal
in my book and in this lecture.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.090
It is definitely not because
I think it is not important,

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.060
but because it belongs
to a global [inaudible]

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.900
or scenario whereby Venice's
destiny is similar to that

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.780
of other cities worldwide
including New York City.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:18.280
You know, listen to this point that
is obviously critically important.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.760
I'm proposing Venice is a
privileged vantage point

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:25.050
that might inspire
thoughts or considerations

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.590
on an equally important issue,
namely the evolution, shape,

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.750
and destiny of the urban form.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.440
Ideas and social culture practices
about the city of the future seem

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.300
to be determined today by
three interrelated factors.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.280
[Inaudible] mentioned the
unstoppable growth major cities

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.280 position:56%
first and the verticalization factor

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.560
to the rhetoric of
skyscrapers second.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.220
Both exemplified in this slide.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.470
Let me add lastly the dissipation
boundaries affecting city

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.110
and countryside.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.180 position:56%
You see here in the wonderful fresco
in Sienna you all are familiar

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:10.130
with this boundary
very clearly defined.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:16.300
So let me go back between
the city and the countryside,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.680
that they're complimentary
to one another.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.530
We may say on the contrary
that what's going on is

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:24.830
that the wild boundaries
of the city separating

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.300
from a countryside intimately
connected with the city itself

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.400
like in Sienna are destroyed.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.330
And a new type of boundary
[inaudible] increasingly arise

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:37.860
in the boundaries within the city
as in this example from Brazil

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.380
in which the boundary is between a
gated community with tennis courts

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.430
and little pools on balconies
and they [inaudible] here.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:53.320
The boundaries within the cities
between gentrified and boundary

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.300
in neighborhoods and gated
communities further [inaudible].

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.750
While the suburbs are teaming
with all the new poor as seen

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.190
in this impressive example.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.370
What is, or rather, was the
countryside in Sienna, Florence,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.400
or the [foreign language spoken] in
Rome is still very much reasonable

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.960
in Venice as the lagoon more
than in any other place.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.000
This is one of the many
reasons why what happens

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.100
in Venice does not only
concern Venice but us all.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.700
Venice indeed, because
it is precious,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.080
it is unique, it is improbable.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.360
It is the most improbable
city in the world still.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.710
It is still there.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.680
And its very singular
connection with the waters

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.610
and the mainland is going against
the blade because it is naturally

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:43.190
for this generation and without
cars and is a dominant symbol

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:47.670
and a [inaudible] of the
human nature of historic city.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.380
Now the question is should
we preserve this [inaudible]

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.700
of space or dilute it?

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.220
Assuming that a new model, that
a mega-cities, skyscrapers,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:02.010 position:56%
boundaries within the city, social
economic boundaries within the city,

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.130
will it be the only possible
form for the city of the future?

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:11.980
Or do we have space for the
diversity in the shape of cities?

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.500
Let's say Venice is a potential
level to the litmus test where from

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.840
to look at the global decline

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.960
of historical centers often
not generalized and thought

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:29.810 position:56%
of as being left over in relation to
the real place where new buildings,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.220
possibly vertical are being built.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.430
[Inaudible] shape, having a
knowledge of that obvious goal

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:42.290
to erase diversity,
to homogenize cities,

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:48.750
to substitute civil conversation
among citizens for created spaces

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:53.790 position:56%
for citizen's machines for
production and consumption of goods.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.940
So let us pause for a moment
to think inspired by I hope

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.780
by this thoughtful Athena.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.420
As a better icon of the storied
city, Venice is precisely

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.880
for this reason the
most important target

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.380
for whoever [inaudible]
denying the very raison d'etre

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.250
of urban diversity.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.560
As most convenient scenario
were to experiment [inaudible]

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.910
of social and cultural life.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:20.080
But if we want to save Venice from
the offenses which can bring it

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.430
to death, it is not enough to
be indignant and to protest.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:28.820
The decisive move is to elaborate
the project for the future

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.810
of this city which
preserves its uniqueness based

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:38.560
on what I would call a
two-phase far sightedness.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.340
I mean the ability of, to
look simultaneously backwards

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.850
at historical legacy and
forwards, the future of Venice not

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:54.660
as a museum, not as a theme park,
not as a place for tourists.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:01.130
But as a city for human beings,
for its own citizens primarily.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:05.940
Then the tourist can come of
course but for citizens primarily.

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.440
We cannot reduce Venice
to a place of tourists

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.960
who all the citizens must
be servants to tourism

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.660
and not cultivate any
other productive

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.830
or creative human activity.

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:24.930
Our generation, not just in Venice,
but everywhere, has been tasked

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.010
with a great responsibility
to show that diversity

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:32.950
and beauty are not weighted
legacies from the past

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:38.090
but an extraordinary gift
to live with in the present.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:44.950
An extraordinary endowment to build
upon for guaranteeing the future.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:50.130
In the world in which we live we
should show that there is space

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:54.200
for diversity for urban mothers,
for diversity of cultures,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.740
of lifestyles, that the urban space
as developed in Venice as well

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:05.770
as in other historic city does have
a right of citizenship in the world

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:09.020
of today and of tomorrow
because if Venice dies,

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.960
that's reason for the
title of my book,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.370
it will not only be
Venice that falls.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.580
The very idea of the city will die.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:21.230
The form of the city as an open
[inaudible] space social life

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.800
as the very foundation
of civilization.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.770
And let me say, also, of democracy.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.570
Thank you very much indeed.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:44.340
[ Applause ]

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.640
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Okay.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:51.110
So I see the time is 3:55 so we
did start late by about 10 minutes

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.900
so let's keep rolling
a little further.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:58.070 position:56%
We don't have a lot of time for
questions but let's try maybe three.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.370
All right.

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.670
Are there questions?

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:08.640
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: There's
a question over there.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.630
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Speak loudly.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:16.540
&gt;&gt; Yes. I was just simply going to
ask what you would suggest those

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.830
of us who don't have the
knowledge of Venice that you do

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:26.540
but love the city can
do to help save it?

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:34.160
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Well, I think
that awareness by public opinion

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.210
in important countries,
particularly here in this country,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.160
particularly in this city,
awareness of what's going

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:49.540
on is extremely important and that
influence the government bodies

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.150
that have to take decisions
about it.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:55.700
And decisions are sometimes
not that difficult.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:51:00.140
For instance, if we think about
problems of second homes in Venice,

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.290
they've been calculated
that on average people

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.350
who possess a second home in
Venice, often very wealthy people

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:10.910
who buy a palazzo on the Grand
Canal, but they stay in Venice

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.100
on average two and
a half days a year.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.670
Now they are not citizens.

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:21.700
They cannot participate
in life of the city.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.600
Now it is possible to reduce the
number of second homes in Venice.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.900
Is it possible?

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.200
Yes. It is.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.190
Because in Switzerland they passed
the law two or three years ago

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:35.110
by which in each city
of the Switzerland even

00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:41.390
in smallest villages you can't
have more than 20% of second homes.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.690
This is Switzerland.

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.090
This is not a Communist country.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.250
So if this is possible in
Switzerland, why not in Italy?

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.720
Why nobody thinks about doing it?

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.260
Why nobody even proposes to do it?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.600
So I think awareness,
public opinion,

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.720
and pressure from public opinion
all over the world and particularly

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.650
in this country would
be extremely important.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:07.900
Would be extremely important to put
pressure on the governmental boards

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:15.490
who are very keen to hear
the business of developers,

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:22.100
or tourist organization,
or [inaudible] organization

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:30.680
in less inclined to understand
what the big problems are.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.560
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: I think
there's some questions that came

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.920
through [inaudible] in
the back who had -- .

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.630
&gt;&gt; It seems obvious that the
cruise ships need to be stopped

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.560
but obviously there
must be some desire

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.770
to have the tourist come
and spend the money.

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.310
So who could stop the cruise ships?

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:58.280
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Well, first
of all, apparently only ten percent

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:02.960
of the people who come to Venice on
those cruise ships finds the time

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.010
of going into Venice
and spend something.

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:12.590
So for most of them looking at
Venice from the highest balcony

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:20.980
of the ship is more than enough,
looking down at Doge's Palace

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:26.250
in bathrobe, that must be a very
interesting experience which -- .

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:31.900
But I actually never
did that so I can't tell

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.540
but for some reason
it is considered.

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.530
And there are several
projects on [inaudible].

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:42.340
One possibility is to bring
people in the neighboring place

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:49.010
like [inaudible] which is a lake
port with which is in [inaudible]

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:55.750
and then with the smaller or
to have them arrive somewhere,

00:53:55.750 --> 00:54:01.430
there are several problems but the
first thing to do is to make clear

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:06.810
that cruise ships cannot
enter the docks of San Marco.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.640
But you know the San
Marco cannot be entered

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.640
by those gigantic cruise ships.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.960 position:56%
This should be absolutely necessary.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.740
Now the [inaudible] it
is called in Venice.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.040
They have another problem.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.550
They want to excavate a
canal within the lagoon

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:27.570
for the cruise ships
bringing them somewhere else.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:33.960
But the excavating a similar canal
was the cause of the big flood

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:38.530
that happened in the same
year of the flood in Florence,

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.630
the, just in '66 I think.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:44.000
So now do we want something
like this to happen?

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.900
So there is a great reactions
against this and I hope

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:53.630
that eventually they will
decide to do it differently but.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.910
&gt;&gt; You choose.

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.210
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Yeah.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.510
Okay. I think this [inaudible].

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.700
&gt;&gt; Do you have any thoughts

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:12.900
on what industries might
supplement tourism in Venice?

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:19.800
Obviously some industries
[inaudible].

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.100
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: The,

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.400
in the area of [inaudible] there
was a big chemical industry

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:30.400
that contributed significantly
polluting the lagoon

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.980
and creating other, but to create
jobs in Venice and to create jobs

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:41.480
that would contrast to the
increasing unemployment

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.640
of young people which in
Italy, as you probably know,

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:51.540
is 38% by contrast
with 22% on average

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.080
in the states of European Union.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:01.300
So this is a big problem
that goes much beyond that.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:08.060
But in Venice it is possible
to imagine different activities

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.760
and particularly creative
activities,

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.880
something that works very well

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.490
in Venice is the [Foreign
Language spoken].

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:22.320 position:56%
Something that works very well are
the universities in Venice but many,

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.420
many young people who would like
to live in Venice while going

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:33.250 position:56%
to the university, they are unable
to do so because it's too expensive.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:38.810
So it's not very easy
to have [inaudible]

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:44.460
in general plan about Venice.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:48.290
But it is very easy to say
that if there are no attempts

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:53.660
at such a plan, the city
is condemned forever

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.530
which is something I'd
not like to happen.

00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:59.550
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: We'll
take two more questions.

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:00.850
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: One is there.

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:02.530
&gt;&gt; There's one that you're aware

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:05.540
of the irony is I know you say
you don't like cruise ships.

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:09.180
But obviously one of the
major industries there

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:15.190
in Marghera is the
construction of cruise ships.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.490
[Inaudible].

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.270
It's one of the main
industries there.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:22.210
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis:
Oh, well, but I think,

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:28.680
I think that those cruise
ships are not built there.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:35.730
I think that the presence of
cruise ships must be judged

00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:40.590
and decided upon based on
whether they pollute the lagoon,

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.390
whether they make the
life of citizens worse,

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:47.620
whether they make the protection
of cultural heritage more difficult

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:51.310
and this is something that
is already very clear.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:56.340 position:56%
So I understand that problems cannot
be solved from today in one night

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.360
but I think that starting
doing something

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.680
in that direction would
be very good.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:09.010
What happens instead that
whenever one of the many problems

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:13.750
of Venice is addressed such as by
the so-called [inaudible] the sort

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:22.090
of barrier to be created against
the high water, aqua alta.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:28.720
You may know, it's a very long
story in the last 30 years

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:35.400
or so with a story of corruption,
a terrible amount of money

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:41.240
that has been lost and thrown away.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.960
They've been calculated by a
book by a very good economist

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.760
who [inaudible] who is Italian
[Foreign Language spoken].

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:54.710
At least two billion Euros
were spent in corruption.

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:58.200
So if we spend in corruption
two billion Euros, why don't we,

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:03.670
why we shouldn't try to spend
something in helping people living

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:08.090
in Venice rather than moving away.

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:13.800
So that's the complexity of the
problem which I have tried more

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.060
in the book than the lecture
of course to give an idea of.

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.710
It's something to think about.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:22.010
One more question?

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:24.610
Just a quick question.

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:28.260
What's amazing about Venice is
that it's actually still standing.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:32.060
So I think my question is what is
the city doing or the government

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:38.020
of Italy doing to preserve
the foundation of Venice?

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.320
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Very little.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.080
At this moment very, very little
and unfortunately what is the fact

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.490
that little is doing for
preservation of the lagoon

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:55.450
in time will endanger
the entire city.

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:58.090
So I think we are still in time.

00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:07.680
It's, in making save public opinion
left and this expect to be very,

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.060 position:56%
very important so I hope that you
all in this room will be among those

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.500
who are aware of the problems
of Venice and contribute

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:25.900
to making this awareness
wider and more and deeper.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.490
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: You can
take just one really last

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:30.790
question [inaudible].

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:34.850
&gt;&gt; I have a question
about new technologies.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:36.190
Since you put an image
of [inaudible].

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:43.030 position:56%
I think it needs to be a big part of
problem because a high concentration

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:50.140
of cruises in very, three or
four places and everyone goes

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.480
to the same place, take
a picture, and goes.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.780
[Inaudible].

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.530
And so my question is about
new technologies and now

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:06.290 position:56%
that there's the possibility to sort
of reconstruct a lot of these places

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.880
and I think there's a
company called [inaudible].

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.180
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Yes.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.480
I know them.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.780
I visited them in Madrid
several times.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.790
&gt;&gt; So my question is what do
you think of that as a solution

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.790
to solve the problem of tourism.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.270
Is it [inaudible] or is it?

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:26.490
&gt;&gt; Salvatore Settis: Well, I
think that building a new Venice

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:33.080 position:56%
and convincing people to go to the
fake Venice instead of the real one,

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.340
I think this is something that
goes beyond my imagination.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:43.060
I like people from [inaudible]
and I visited their laboratory

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.580
and I also made the official speech

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.970
when the big [Foreign
Language spoken] painting

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:54.140
which was originally was in
the Louvre was [inaudible]

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.380
which is a wonderful copy
but it is very clear a copy.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.580
So and the copy in that
particular case is very important

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:06.180
because you have the [Foreign
Language spoken] is at the Louvre

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.930
and will never come back to Italy.

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:11.160
But seeing the [Foreign
Language spoken] painting

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.980
in a very well done
copy in the space

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:22.710
by [Foreign Language spoken] made
for that particular painting,

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:26.820
this changes totally the perception
of, in this case it is very good.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.640
But the idea of going the
very same thing somewhere in,

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:37.810
you can do it in Arizona if you
wish but this would not be Venice.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:40.030
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: We'll
have to stop there.

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:41.330
Thank you so much.

01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:43.300
[ Applause ]

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:46.960
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
