DAN GALPIN: I'm Dan Galpin,
Android Developer Advocate

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.840
here at Google.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.750
This is Android Tool
Time, and we're here

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.030
with Android Studio 2.2.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.475
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:10.360
[ALARM CLOCK RINGING]

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.910
At Google I/O this year, we
previewed Android Studio 2.2,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.640
promising a host of new
features and improvements.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.530
After testing and
integrating your feedback

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.240
during the preview
and beta phases,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.070
we're happy to announce that
Android Studio 2.2 is now

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.760
available for download
in the stable channel.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.950
Android Studio 2.2
offers improvements

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.210
for all phases of app creation--
prototyping and interface

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.350
design, code development
and iteration, and testing

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.350
and debugging.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
Let me walk you through
some of those changes.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.980
We revamped the Layout Editor
and added built-in support

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.630
for constraint layout,
an entirely new way

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.000
to build dynamic user interfaces
on Android in a visual way

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.830
by specifying view
positions and constraints.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.730
The Layout Editor features a new
blueprint mode and an attribute

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.320
panel for changing the
visual attributes of widgets

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.440
so you won't have to jump
into text mode as often.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
And for when you need
to debug your UI,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.960
we have a new layout
inspector that

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.970
lets you capture a snapshot of
the hierarchy and attributes

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.720
as they run on a
device or emulator.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.940
We're continually
improving the Code Editor,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.860
bringing you better
code analysis with new

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.640
and updated lint checks.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.430
You can now also
simply right click

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.210
to search across all
our samples on GitHub

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.190
when you need to consult
Android sample code

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.450
for the proper usage of an API.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.570
And we've upgraded
to IntelliJ 2016.1

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.610
with all its enhancements,
such as right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.910
to left language support and
method argument reordering.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.630
Thanks to the
Firebase integration,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.800
you can now easily add Firebase
services, like analytics,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.410
Cloud Messaging, and crash
reporting to your apps,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.620
including initial project
setup and adding dependencies.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.190
We include handy documentation
links and code snippets

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.960
that you can add to your app
to get the Firebase features up

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.976
and running quickly.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:50.350
To better understand
what happens

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.630
to your manifest during
merging, you can now

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.630
use the Merged Manifest Viewer.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.130
This lets you
preview the manifest

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.213
as it will look after the
build with contributions

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:00.360
from other manifest files
in libraries highlighted

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.722
in different colors.

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:04.680
For developers who want
to examine the finished

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.500
content of their APK,
we've built a new APK

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.120
analyzer in Android Studio.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.310
By simply opening
your app's APK,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880
you will be able to inspect
how much space each component

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.190
of your app takes up along with
an estimated download size,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.910
even taking into account any
compression applied by the Play

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.870
Store.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.160
With the compare feature,
it's easy to analyze

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.800
APK size regressions relative to
previous versions of your app.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530
You can also debug
Multidex issues

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.660
by drilling down
into classes.dex

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.930
as well as explore the
contents of resource files.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.422
Anyone working with native
code in libraries will be happy

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.600
to hear that we've added support
for C and C++ projects using

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.250
the CMake and NDK build systems.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850
Now you can seamlessly import
your native project in Android

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.510
Studio and take advantage of
the many improvements we've made

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.570
to editing and debugging
C and C++ code in the IDE.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.050
For those working with
OpenGLES directly,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.950
we're including a beta version
of a new GPU debugger which

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.980
records GL commands at runtime
and lets you replay and fully

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.640
inspect the GL
state in each frame

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.530
and after each
instruction, including

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.530
the contents of the buffers,
textures, and meshes.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.150
We're still working on a few
features for the GPU debugger,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.720
as well as improvements to
its speed and stability, which

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.330
is why it's marked as beta.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.940
Please give us feedback on this
new tool through the Android

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.990
Studio Google+ community
in Bug Tracker.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.490
With this release
of Android Studio,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.906
we're letting developers try
out our new tool for creating

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:26.060
UI tests for your
apps-- the Espresso Test

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.270
Recorder, also in Beta.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.530
The Test Recorder works by
recording your interactions

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.210
with the app within the emulator
and letting you add assertions

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.720
in a simple interface.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.830
The generated tests are
just plain Java code

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.340
using the Espresso library,
so you can customize them

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.260
later if needed.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.060
The release of
Android Studio 2.2

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.480
coincides with
the 25.2.2 updates

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.920
to the SDK Tools and
Android emulator.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.590
The emulator now lets you
simulate several Android

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.660
sensors, such as the
accelerometer, magnetometer,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.320
ambient temperature, and
more within the emulator UI,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.480
including a 3D
representation of the device

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.300
that you can move about.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.070
As always, the
newest Android Studio

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.240
brings many other
under-the-hod improvements,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.890
such as fixes to Instant
Run, build time improvements,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.940
support for annotation
processors in the Jack

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.030
compiler, new app packaging
code, and better accessibility

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.030
supporting the IDE.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.570
To make sure you get the most
of this version of Studio,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.350
remember to update your projects
to use the 2.2.0 version

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.779
of our Android Gradle plugin.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.490
Update your build
tools and emulator

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.760
images using the SDK
Manager, and make

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.949
sure to enable Instant Run.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.490
I think that you'll enjoy the
many new features and stability

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.520
improvements in
Android Studio 2.2.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.460
And as always, we're looking
forward to your feedback.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.410
