00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.960
There are movies about war.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.299
And there are movies about kids.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.820
But the movies about war starring kids are
more rare.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.530
Some are science fiction, like 2013’s Ender’s
Game.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.369
Others follow children trying to survive during
wartime, movies like Stephen Spielberg’s

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.720
Empire of the Sun starring a young Christian Bale.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
Or John Boorman’s semi-autobiographical
Hope and Glory about growing up in London

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.650
during the Blitz.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.830
But even fewer films are about children
who actually participate in war, like a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.150
2015 movie that tackled the real-life issue
of child soldiers.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.480
From its gritty, handheld camerawork, to its
charismatic leading performances, this grueling

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.539
drama is a masterclass in intensely vibrant
and subjective cinema.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
Let’s dig into Beasts of No Nation.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:54.840
[Intro Music]

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.280
Beasts of No Nation was a dream project for

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.730
writer-director Cary Fukunaga.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.069
He was fresh off two acclaimed features – 2009’s
Sin Nombre

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.600
and the 2011 big screen adaptation of Jane
Eyre –

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.450
as well as his stunning direction of the first
season of True Detective.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.820
So Fukunaga was able to cobble together a
tiny budget and haul a crew into the jungles

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.009
of Ghana to do the near impossible.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.219
Based on the 2005 novel by Nigerian-American
author Uzodinma Iweala

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.980
Beasts of No Nation takes place in a fictional,
nameless, African country torn apart by civil war.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
Various rebel factions battle the military
and each other for control of the nation,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.570
wreaking havoc, slaughtering civilians, and
leaving behind a wake of misery.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.120
The story follows a young boy named Agu, played
with incredible focus by Ghanaian actor Abraham Attah.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.840
Agu lives with his family in what’s called
the “buffer zone,” a protected safe haven

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.430
guarded by the United Nations.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.189
His life isn’t easy, but he’s sheltered
from the worst parts of the conflict and allowed

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.470
to maintain a pretty recognizable childhood.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.360
He plays with friends, jokes with his older
brother, and does chores for his family.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
That all changes when the government falls
and the war comes to his doorstep.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.979
Almost overnight, Agu’s family is split
apart and his father and older brother are

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.290
shot in front of his eyes.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.630
Agu barely escapes into the vast jungle, where
he’s captured by a battalion of the National

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.960
Defense Forces.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.640
The NDF is a ragtag rebel group made up of
young men and boys, led by a brutal, charismatic

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.420
man they call the Commandant

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420
The Commandant: What is this thing doing here?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.540
The Commandant: Who is responsible for 
 bringing this thing?

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.200
In a searing performance, Idris Elba inhabits

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.920
the role of the barbaric, yet fatherly leader
who specializes in indoctrinating child soldiers.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.480
The Commandant: Now what are they calling you?

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.440
Agu: Agu...

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.440
The Commandant: Oh, you must say it like you are prouder.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.300
Agu: Agu.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.320
The Commandant: One more time.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.540
Agu: Agu!

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.080
The Commandant: Well, Agu. That is what I'll be calling you, then.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.660
Under the Commandant’s direction, Agu endures
an initiation process that includes killing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.840
a captive man with a machete.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.730
And he’s forced to submit to the Commandant’s
predatory sexual assault.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.840
From there, Agu and his fellow NDF soldiers
follow the Commandant across the country,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.060
causing destruction and taking over towns,
until they’re called to the rebel capital

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.840
and the Commandant is demoted.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.420
This begins a downward slide that ends with
most of the child soldiers dead and the rest

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.490
abandoning the Commandant after he and Agu
hold each other at gunpoint.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.650
Rescued by UN peacekeepers, Agu and the other
children wind up in a coastal rehabilitation

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.670
school, struggling to recognize their own
humanity and recover some sliver of their

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.670
childhood.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.480
It’s an incredibly harrowing story, filled
with both darkness and violence.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.760
And Fukunaga’s skill with the language of
cinema makes it a mesmerizing film.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.420
From the opening shot, Fukunaga makes a nod
to the fact that what we’re watching is

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.420
an illusion.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.550
That no matter how hard it may be to watch,
it pales in comparison to real life.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.150
The film opens with a shot of young African
boys playing soccer in a field.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.310
The camera pulls back through an empty television
set.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.640
And that TV re-frames the game, presenting
it as if it’s happening on a screen.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.990
Just like the film we’re watching!

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.860
This device, the empty TV set, then becomes
an instrument of the plot used to reveal character.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.450
Agu and his buddies try to sell it as “imagination
TV.”

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.020
They set it up for the local guards and act
out various shows on the other side.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.480
It sets Agu up as resourceful, bright, and
funny – all qualities that will be tested

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.870
by the trials of the story to come.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.079
Writer-director Fukunaga, who also acts as
his own cinematographer, uses all the tools

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.170
of cinema to put us in the perspective of
his young protagonist.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.960
Many of the shots, especially early in the
film, are framed from low angles.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.870
Agu looks up to his father, his older brother,
and eventually to the Commandant.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.870
And so do we.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.570
The opening scenes have a vaguely gauzy look,
presenting much of Agu’s home life like

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.240
a traditional coming-of-age drama – from
the pranks with his brother and the family

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.160
dinner, to a celebratory church service.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.480
The film is patient with these scenes.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.130
Fukunaga and his editors, Pete Beaudreau and
Mikkel E.G. Nielsen, give us time to explore

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.580
Agu’s life, his community, and his deep
connections to his family.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.210
Just like Agu, we’re lulled into a false
sense of security by the look, feel, and pacing

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.550
of these early scenes.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.700
But that’s all about to change.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.350
Once the war decimates the village, Fukunaga
turns to much more brutal, jarring, and unpredictable

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.000
techniques to tell the story, which perfectly
mirrors Agu’s experience.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.960
The cinematography style becomes more aggressively
handheld, capturing the chaos of the violence.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.650
The editing becomes faster too, as Agu first
encounters the shock of war.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.220
Through it all, Fukunaga keeps the focus on
Agu and his point of view.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.220
We get close-up after close-up of the boy’s
face, followed by shots of what he’s looking at.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.800
This classic example of the Kuleshov effect
keeps us tracking his emotions, even as the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.070
camera becomes more frenzied.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.070
But that’s not the only trick up Fukunaga’s
sleeve.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.250
He uses extreme wide shots to help us dive
into Agu’s perspective too.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.150
Once Agu escapes from the village and finds
himself deep in the jungle, Fukunaga frames

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.870
him in extremely wide shots.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.889
This presents Agu as a tiny dot in a vast,
dangerous world, emphasizing his insignificance

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.040
and vulnerability.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.370
His life has been wrenched out of the comfort
of a community and a home, and suddenly becomes

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.130
extremely precarious.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.570
Most of the middle of the film is shot in
a realist style, with natural lighting, handheld

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.320
camerawork, and diegetic sound, or sound whose
source exists within the world of the film.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.700
And the effect of this realist style is one
of immediacy – we feel the intensity of

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.380
each second along with Agu.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.520
As he’s captured by the NDF troops, comes
face to face with the Commandant, and becomes

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.340
one of many child soldiers, he’s forced
to live in the moment.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.500
And the moment is often unfamiliar and terrifying.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.070
Violence, or the threat of violence, fills
every scene and lurks after each pan or cut.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.300
And we are right there with him.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.060
Occasionally, though, Fukunaga breaks this
realism to illustrate a big emotional turning point.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.111
One instance of this comes after the rebels
take down a convoy of military trucks, and

00:06:38.111 --> 00:06:41.010
the Commandant decides to complete Agu’s
initiation ritual.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.740
Agu, who’s been carrying ammunition for
the troops, is called over.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.270
And the Commandant orders him to take the
life of the last remaining enemy.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.950
The man is bound, on his knees, begging for
his life.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.080
The Commandant gives Agu a machete and talks
about how hard he’ll have to swing it to

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.270
split the man’s head open.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.060
Fukunaga extends the moment, drawing out the
suspense, as the Commandant urges Agu on and

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.980
the other soldiers watch in silence.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.850
The film cuts back and forth between increasingly
zoomed-in close-ups of Agu, and a medium close-up

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.130
of the captured soldier.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.630
When Agu finally swings his machete, the film
goes quiet for a split second.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.710
Then one of Agu’s fellow child soldiers,
a boy named Strika, steps forward.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.510
He swings his own machete, and joins Agu as
they chop the man to death.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.040
At this point, the film moves into slow motion,
and Fukunaga cuts out most of the diegetic

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.530
sound, replacing it with an echoey, low rumble.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.830
This droning sound crescendos as Agu swings
his machete.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.670
The camera keeps the boys in frame, with the
Commandant in the background, focusing on

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.070
their expressionless faces, rather than the
gore at their feet.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.740
This whole sequence has the effect of drawing
us into Agu’s intense personal decision.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.410
It helps us feel how he’s dissociating
from the violent act to preserve his sanity.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.729
Fukunaga uses this heightened reality to let
us absorb the brutality of Agu’s actions

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:58.220
and understand their emotional significance.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.440
And Fukunaga takes a different approach to
a very similar moment later in the film.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.440
When the rebels seize control of an enemy
city, Agu and a small group of child soldiers

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.310
are clearing a building when they discover
a woman and her two small children hiding

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.310
in a wardrobe.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.919
Beaten down by the violence he’s been forced
to both witness and commit, Agu mistakes

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:19.160
the woman for his mother, cries out, and clings
to her.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.860
When he discovers his mistake, he reels, crossing
into the next room where Strika is beating

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.520
one of the captured children.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.240
And then he turns back into the main room
and shoots the woman.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.040
It’s an intense, psychologically fraught
sequence.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.380
Agu’s reality warps and he responds with
the tool he’s been taught to use over and

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.569
over again: an act of violence.

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:42.149
But rather than film it in a traditional way,
by cutting up the sequence, Fukunaga chooses

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:46.290
to trap us in the moment with Agu by making
it a continuous steadicam shot.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.029
The camera tracks Agu through the entire scene,
in and out of the rooms, as he begins to crack

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:54.850
under the pressure that’s been building
up since his own village was destroyed.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.670
And because the shot never cuts, we feel
trapped too.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.699
Just like him, we’re unable to look away
from the horrors of war, with its many different

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:04.209
forms of violence.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:08.630
Another thing to consider when analyzing Beasts
of No Nation is the score by Dan Romer.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.339
Much like another war movie we discussed,
Apocalypse Now, there are times when the score

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.760
starts to feel like something from a science
fiction film.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.880
It’s subtle, but powerful in making scenes
and shots feel otherworldly, like Agu is lost

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.480
and far away from home.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.519
Like this isn’t even his version of Earth.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:49.249
It can make us feel like we’re seeing a
parallel version of Agu – like we’re

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:51.209
seeing an alternate, dark timeline.

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:55.240
And in fact, while the film draws heavily
on real-life experiences of child soldiers,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.290
it’s deliberately set in an unnamed, fictional
African country.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.959
So in a way, this actually is another world!

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.269
The film takes on a new language in the final
scenes, too, once Agu has freed himself from

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:08.429
the Commandant and been rescued by the UN
troops.

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:12.399
At the coastal rehabilitation school, the
filming style settles down.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:16.279
Fukunaga uses much less handheld camerawork,
and the shots last longer.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:19.670
Stylistically, the film becomes more stable,
just like Agu’s world.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:24.990
He has fresh clothes, plenty of food, an education,
and no one pushing him to fight or kill.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.209
And yet, he spends time apart from others,
watching the other former child soldiers running

00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:31.420
into the surf and horse-playing on the beach.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.649
In one devastating scene, an aid worker questions
Agu about his experiences.

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:38.950
She wants him to begin to articulate what
happened in hopes that he can work his way

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.699
through it all psychologically intact.

00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:45.819
When we met Agu in the opening scenes, he
was an expressive, clever, often joyful boy.

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:50.529
This Agu is stone-faced, hardened, and cut
off from his own emotions.

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:52.139
He doesn’t even come close to smiling.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.320
Eventually, he’s able to open up just a
little bit, tears hovering in his eyes.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.040
Agu: If I'm telling this to you.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.120
Agu: You will think that...

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.600
Agu:... I am some sort of beast.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.480
Agu: Or devil.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.320
We get the sense that he has a long way to
go, but also that this might be the first

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:21.329
step to recovery.

00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:26.290
The final shot shows Agu racing into the ocean
with the other boys, chasing and splashing,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.809
and maybe – just maybe – reclaiming
a small fraction of the childhood that had

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:32.130
been stolen from him.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.449
Beasts of No Nation can be a tough movie to
watch, but, in a way, it’s also a deeply

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:37.660
compassionate one.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.019
Director Cary Fukunaga’s deep grasp of the
tools of cinema keep us anchored in his main

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:44.790
character’s perspective in a really artful
way.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.060
And the grueling journey makes the sliver
of hope at the end all the more powerful.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.129
Next time, we’ll tackle apes, monoliths,
and a deadly computer in one of the most influential

00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:58.809
science fiction films ever made, Stanley Kubrick’s
2001: A Space Odyssey.

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:02.889
