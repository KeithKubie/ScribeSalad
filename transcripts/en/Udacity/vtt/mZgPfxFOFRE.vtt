00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; Congratulations on finishing Lesson four. In this lesson,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.000
we learned how to explore the relationship between two variables.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.560
Our main visualization tool, was the scatter plot. But we

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.330
also augmented the scatter plot, with conditional summaries, like means.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.620
&gt;&gt; We also learned about the

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.800
benefits and the limitations of using correlation.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.080
To understand the relationship between two variables

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.800
and how correlation may effect your decisions

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.980
over which variables to include in your final models.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.400
&gt;&gt; As usual, another important part of this lesson was learning how to

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.240
make sense of data through adjusting

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.230
our visualizations. We learned not to necessarily

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.550
trust our interpretation of initial scatter

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.310
plots like with the seasonal temperature data.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.220
And we learned how to use jitter and transparency to reduce over plotting.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.840
&gt;&gt; We'd love to hear your thoughts in the discussion forum and we

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.010
hope you learned a lot. Next, we'll move

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.550
onto lesson five, where we talk about multivariate analysis.
