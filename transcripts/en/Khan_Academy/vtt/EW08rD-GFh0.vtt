00:00:00.744 --> 00:00:03.786
- [Voiceover] So here I'm
gonna talk about the Laplacian.

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:04.619
Laplacian.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.942
And the Laplacian is a certain operator

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:09.985
in the same way that the
divergence, or the gradient,

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:13.050
or the curl, or even just
the derivative are operators.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.071
The things that take in
some kind of function

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:16.650
and give you another function.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.506
So in this case, let's say we
have a multivariable function

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:23.825
like F, that just takes in
a two-dimensional input,

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.241
F of X Y.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.167
So you might imagine its graph
as being something like this,

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.232
where the input space
is this X-Y plane here,

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:34.286
so each of the points,
X Y, is a point here,

00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:35.609
and then the output is just given

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.467
by the height of that graph.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.603
So the Laplacian of F is denoted

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.600
with a right-side-up triangle,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.595
and it's gonna give you a
new scalar valued function

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:45.431
of X and Y.

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:47.034
So it's gonna give you a new function

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:49.100
that takes in a two-dimensional input

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.516
and just outputs a number.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:53.071
And it's kind of like a second derivative,

00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:54.510
because the way that it's defined

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.018
is that you take the divergence

00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:58.268
of the gradient

00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.806
of your function F.

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:04.083
So that's kind of how it's defined,

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:05.824
the divergence of the gradient of F.

00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:08.252
And a more common notation
that you might see here

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:11.476
is to take that upside-down
triangle, nabla,

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:12.925
dot product,

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:14.449
with nabla

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:15.282
of F.

00:01:16.353 --> 00:01:18.791
So remember, if F is a
scalar valued function,

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.369
then the gradient of F
gives you a vector field,

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.715
a certain vector field.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.130
But the divergence of a vector field

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.267
gives you another scalar valued function.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:29.797
So this is the sense in which
it's a second derivative.

00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:31.818
But let's see if we can kind
of understand intuitively

00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:33.466
what this should mean.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.324
'Cause the gradient, if you remember,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.576
gives you the slope of steepest descent.

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:41.315
So it's a vector field
in the input space of X.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:43.613
And each one of the vectors
points in the direction

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.773
that you should walk, such that this graph

00:01:45.773 --> 00:01:47.700
is kind of a hill on top of you,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.256
it tells you the direction you should go

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:52.762
to increase your direction
the most rapidly.

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:54.643
And if that seems unfamiliar,
it doesn't make sense,

00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:57.870
maybe go take a look at that
video on gradients and graphs

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.798
and how they relate to each other.

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.120
So with the specific graph
that I have pictured here,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.209
when you have kind of the top of a hill,

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.812
all of the points around it,

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:07.158
the direction that you should walk,

00:02:07.158 --> 00:02:09.248
is towards the top of that hill.

00:02:09.248 --> 00:02:10.920
Whereas when you have
kind of like the bottom,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.219
a little goalie here,

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.658
all of the directions you should walk

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:16.818
to increase the value of
the function most rapidly,

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:19.102
are directly away from that value,

00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:21.912
which you might call a local minimum.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:24.188
So let's temporarily get rid of the graph,

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:25.627
just so we can look at the gradient field

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:27.020
here pretty clearly.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.739
And now let's think
about what the divergence

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.457
is supposed to represent.

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.127
So now the divergence, and
again if this feels unfamiliar,

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:36.100
maybe go back and take a look
at the divergence videos,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.700
but that divergence has you
imagining that this vector field

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.115
corresponds to some kind of fluid flow.

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:43.623
So you imagine little
like water molecules,

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:46.734
and at any given moment,
they're moving along the vector

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.429
that they're attached to.

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.217
So for example, if you
had a water molecule

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:51.773
that started off kind of here,

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:53.816
you would start by going along that vector

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:55.604
and then kind of follow the ones near it,

00:02:55.604 --> 00:02:59.018
and it looks like it kind
of ends up in this spot.

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:00.643
And a lot of the water molecules seem to

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.292
kind of converge over there.

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:05.115
Whereas over here, the water
molecules tend to go away

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:06.681
when they're following those vectors

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:08.469
away from this point.

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:09.546
And when they go away like that,

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:10.962
when you have a whole bunch of vectors

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:12.379
kind of pointed away,

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.376
that's an indication that
divergence is positive,

00:03:14.376 --> 00:03:16.001
because they're diverging away.

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.230
So over here, divergence is positive.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.761
Whereas the opposite case,
where all of the water molecules

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.549
are kind of coming in towards a point,

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.569
that's where divergence is negative.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.172
And in another area, let's
say it was kinda like

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:28.633
this center point, where you
have some water molecules

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.189
that looks like they're coming in,

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.744
but other ones are going out,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.857
and at least from this
picture, it doesn't seem like

00:03:33.857 --> 00:03:35.831
the ones going out are
doing so at a faster rate

00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.248
or slower than they are here.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:39.477
This would be roughly zero divergence.

00:03:39.477 --> 00:03:41.265
So now let's think
about what it might mean

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.678
when you take the divergence
of the gradient field of F.

00:03:44.678 --> 00:03:46.977
So let me kind of clear
up the markings I made

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.637
on top of it here.

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:50.103
Points of high divergence,

00:03:50.103 --> 00:03:52.100
points where it diverges a lot here,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.167
why are those vectors pointing away?

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.256
And if we pull up the graph again,

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:57.464
the reason they're pointing away

00:03:57.464 --> 00:03:59.484
is 'cause the direction of steepest descent

00:03:59.484 --> 00:04:02.549
is kind of uphill everywhere;
you are in a valley.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.383
Whereas in the opposite circumstance,

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:06.729
where divergence is highly negative,

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.818
'cause points are converging towards it,

00:04:08.818 --> 00:04:10.188
why are they pointing towards it?

00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:11.674
Well this is a gradient field,

00:04:11.674 --> 00:04:13.439
so they're pointing towards that spot,

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.133
because that's where anywhere around it,

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:19.035
you should walk towards
that spot to go uphill.

00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:21.729
So in other words, the
divergence of the gradient

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.260
is very high at points that are

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.322
kind of like minima, at points
where everyone around them

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:28.751
tends to be higher.

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.236
But the divergence of the gradient is low

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.674
at points that look more
like maximum points,

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:35.253
where when you evaluate the function

00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:37.482
at all of the points
around that input point,

00:04:37.482 --> 00:04:38.805
they give something smaller.

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:41.940
So this Laplacian operator
is kind of like a measure

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.352
of how much of a minimum
point is this X Y.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.861
You will be very positive

00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:50.044
when F evaluated at that point

00:04:50.044 --> 00:04:51.831
tends to give a smaller value

00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:54.246
than F evaluated at
neighbors of that point.

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:55.756
But it'll be very negative

00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:57.590
if when you evaluate F at that point

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.819
it tends to be bigger than its neighbors.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.166
And this should feel kind of analogous

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.999
to the second derivative
in ordinary calculus,

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.138
when you have some kind of graph

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.926
of just a single variable function,

00:05:06.926 --> 00:05:09.713
the second derivative of X

00:05:09.713 --> 00:05:11.733
will be low, it'll be negative

00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:14.217
at points where it kind of
looks like a local maximum.

00:05:14.217 --> 00:05:16.748
But over here, the second derivative of x

00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:19.209
would be positive at points that kind of

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:20.626
look like a local minimum.

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:22.530
SO in that way, the Laplacian is sort of

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.014
an analog of the second derivative

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:28.265
for scalar valued multivariable functions.

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.671
And in the next video, I'll
go through an example of that.
