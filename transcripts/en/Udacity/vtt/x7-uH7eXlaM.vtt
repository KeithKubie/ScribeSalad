00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.710
So let's see if we can figure out the answer

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.850
here. Hopefully the first thing you did was try to

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.290
figure out what the sequence of letters is here at

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.830
our bottom strand. The first one is A, or adenine.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.250
The next one is guanine or G. Then G, A,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.660
T, C, G, A, and T. Now, if we follow our base pairing rules over

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.960
here on the right. We'd see that A pairs with T, G pairs with C, G

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.790
with C, T, A, G, C, T, A. And the only answer that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.480
fits with that is this third anser right here, TCCTAGCTA.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.070
The other answers wouldn't match in every place. The

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.290
first answer would pair right away T with

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.820
A. But, the second letter G doesn't pair

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.270
with G. It needs to be a C, so that doesn't work. C can't be the first

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.450
position, as we can see here in the second answer. And the fourth

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.770
answer starts with an A, not a T, and A doesn't pair with

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.610
an A. So hopefully, you can use the base pairing rules and figure

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.970
out what the complement should always be of a single stranded molecule of DNA.
