Sal: What I want to do in
this video is talk a little

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.700
bit about the curly
arrow conventions used in

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.300
organic chemistry and the
slight variations I use

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.400
in many of the videos
here on Khan Academy.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.233
There's two types of
curly arrows you will see.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.333
You will see a curly full arrow like this,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.966
a curly full arrow like this.

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.500
And I make sure to draw it curly,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.566
you will always see the curly like this.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.800
And you will see a curly half
arrow that looks like this,

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.546
curly half arrow or fish hook arrow.

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.700
The convention is a full
arrow or a typical arrow

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.433
that you're used to
seeing, this is talking

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:39.466
about the movement of
pairs, of electron pairs.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Movement of pairs is the convention.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.900
I'll show you in a second
that I do a slight variation

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.833
of that, and I do that
because it helps me account

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.766
for electrons, and it
helps me at least visualize

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.700
or conceptualize how
things are, or essentially

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.633
how things are happening,
a little bit better.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:01.633
The general convention is
that this is movement of

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:06.766
pairs and this is movement
of electron by itself.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:12.800
Electron, electron not part,

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.933
electron by itself, maybe
I'll write it this way.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.966
By itself.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.633
The full arrow is what you're going to

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.634
see through most of organic chemistry.

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:28.633
This is the one that you're going to

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:31.766
see most typically, the movement of pairs.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.566
The movement of electrons
by itself, this is going to

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.633
show up more in free radical
reactions, which we do do,

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.233
but this is later on, and
most of organic chemistry

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.200
is going to be dealing
with the movement of pairs.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.766
What I've drawn over here is a curly

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.233
arrow showing the same thing happening.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.433
I'm showing you the slight
variation that I do.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.233
I do it because it helps me, once again,

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.300
account for the electrons, and it helps

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.000
me conceptualize what is going on.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:05.233
The typical way that this type
of mechanism will be shown,

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.300
we'll say you have this
electron pair on this oxygen,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.100
and this electron pair,
sometimes we will say,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.366
and you will learn about this
reaction in not too long,

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.966
is going to the carbon,
or I guess you could say

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.433
it's attacking the carbon right over here.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:23.100
The reason why this I find
a little bit less intuitive

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.366
is that the whole pair is
not going to the carbon,

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:29.766
that the oxygen is still
going to maintain half

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:32.356
of this pair and it's
going to form a bond.

00:02:32.356 --> 00:02:34.900
Essentially one end of this
pair is going to end up at

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.433
the carbon, one end of this
pair is going to end up

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.100
at the oxygen, and they
are going to form a bond.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.900
The way I draw it, still
drawing the full arrow.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.100
Here I'm still talking
about pairs but I'm talking

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.300
about the movement of an
electron as part of a pair.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.833
That's kind of the slight non-conventional

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.300
thing that I do with the full arrow.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:08.733
Movement, movement of electron,
electron as part of pair.

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:14.100
I'll often times draw the back
of the arrow from that electron,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.966
but It's important to recognize
that electron is not moving

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:21.900
by itself, it's just ending
up on one side of a bond,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.273
it is moving as part of a pair.

00:03:24.273 --> 00:03:26.367
Another way to think of
it is this electron is

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.900
going to be on the other side of the bond.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.966
I also want to be clear again.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.766
When I talk about electrons
on either side of bonds,

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:35.233
I like to think about that because it

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:38.033
helps me do it for accounting purposes.

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.100
We know that these covalent
bonds, this one electron just

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.900
doesn't sit on one side of a
bond and the other electron

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.700
doesn't just sit on the
other side of the bond.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.300
In fact everything we do
in organic chemistry isn't

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.633
anywhere near as clean as
the way we draw it, but I do

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:54.700
this to remind myself that
there are two electrons here,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.366
and when you have a bond
there is some probability

00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:59.566
that one of the electrons
is closer to the hydrogen

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.966
and there's some probability
that that electron is

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.033
closer to the carbon, and
so you can kind of imagine

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:07.700
that there are electrons on
either sides of the bond.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.566
The actual reality is that
there's a blur over them and

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.433
depending on which molecule
is more electronegative

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:14.767
the probability blur is a
little bit more weighted on

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:17.833
one side or another, but
of course we like to clean

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.733
things up with these
formalisms right over here.

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.566
This is kind of the example
when you have this attacking

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:26.166
pair, why I like to
think of the full arrow

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.933
as the movement of an
electron as part of a pair.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:32.233
And this breaking bond over
here is another example.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.766
In the typical convention
you have this bond here.

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:37.100
Remember a bond is made up
of two, this covalent bond

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.433
right over here is made
up of two electrons.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:42.233
If they wanted to show this
bond breaking and both of

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:45.766
these electrons going to
this bromine, the convention

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:49.966
is to go from the middle
of the bond to the bromine.

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:53.766
That I've never found that
intuitive because here,

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:57.900
once again, bromine already
essentially had part of

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.233
the bond, it was already
on one end of the bond.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.700
I like to visualize that it's
getting the other electron

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.001
that it wasn't, it's now
getting both electrons.

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:10.766
One part of the bond was
already closer to the bromine,

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.800
now it's getting the other,
it's the other part of the bond.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.233
We're going to use full
arrows for these mechanisms,

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.366
just as we would typically use
full arrows, but I'll often

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:22.900
conceptualize it as the movement
of an electron as part of

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.166
a pair, as opposed to the
entire pair, but the full arrows

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.933
are still used the way it
would be conventionally used.

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:33.833
Later on when we do free
radical reactions we're

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.700
going to talk about an
electron moving by itself.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.833
Notice this electron right
over here, it's moving or

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:44.053
it's doing something and
it's not part of a pair,

00:05:44.053 --> 00:05:46.500
it's by itself so we use
the fish hook arrows.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.100
Right over here we see a
bond breaking but instead

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.967
of both electrons going
to one of the atoms or

00:05:52.967 --> 00:05:54.767
another one of the atoms,
as right over here.

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:57.433
When both electrons went to one
of the atoms we use the full

00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:00.346
arrow, this already you can say
had one and now it's gaining

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:03.433
another one so use the full
arrow, but here the bond is

00:06:03.433 --> 00:06:07.833
breaking and each electron
is going to a different atom.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.509
Once again the electron is moving,

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.300
the electron is moving by itself.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.767
Maybe I'll put this
right, moving by itself,

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:19.566
and here is a movement of the
electron as part of a pair.

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:21.700
Hopefully that clarifies it a little bit.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.100
It's important to keep in
mind a lot of the notation

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.100
I use is a departure from
the traditional organic

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.033
chemistry notation, but I
think at least in my mind it's

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:32.300
helped me build more of an
intuition of what's going

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.700
on in the mechanisms and
account for the electrons.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.966
If you're in a course, and
especially depending on how it's

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:44.566
graded, you might want to
stick to whatever the professor

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:46.966
uses, which is probably going
to be a little bit closer to

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:51.966
the using the full arrow as
the whole pair, and going from

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:54.767
the middle of the bonds, the
middle of the pairs, as opposed

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.734
from one of the electrons
moving as part of the pair.
