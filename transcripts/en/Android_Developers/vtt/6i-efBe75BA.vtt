00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:11.540
RAMZI RIZK: The four
of us that founded

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.335
the company are
photographers at heart.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.780
And when we got
together in 2010,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.530
the first thing we
did was actually

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.680
launch a photography
competition.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.170
It was the world's first
mobile photography exhibition,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830
and we realized that we had
tapped into something that

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.910
is way bigger than
we had thought.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880
And it became clear
that there was

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.155
potential there to
build a company.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.010
EyeEm is a community at heart.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.050
It's a community
for photographers.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.352
It's a way for you to take
photos, process them, share

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:41.327
them, and get a lot of feedback.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:41.910
You can learn.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.451
You can become a
better photographer.

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:46.597
It also has quite a wide array
of discovery functionality

00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:49.804
that lets you sort of discover
places and people based

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.345
on the kind of photos that you
take and the kind of interests

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:53.310
that you have.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.350
It's about the beauty
of photography.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.850
It's about photography
in its purest form.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.329
MATIAS CASTELLO: Design is a
big, big part of what we do.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.870
And the photos are
not created by us.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.340
So what we try to
build and design

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.500
is a canvas for any photo
to look at its best.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.850
We made several changes
to make our app simpler,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.200
to streamline the experience.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.080
And that definitely plays
into our engagement metrics.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.180
The most visible one
is probably the menu.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170
We removed several items
from the navigation

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.129
to make it clearer
what EyeEm is about.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:25.670
Now you have access to the three
main parts of the app, which

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.200
are our Discover feed
to discover new content

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.940
and content that was
published around you;

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.690
your Friends feed,
which is where you find

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.023
all the photos of your friends
and the photographers you

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:37.860
follow; and Missions are photo
competitions where people post

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.880
photos around a certain topic,
and then win prizes, and get

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.250
published.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.560
They access Friends and Discover
somewhere between 50% and 80%

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.570
more than before.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.760
And Missions saw a more than
100% increase in access.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.150
We also saw an increase
in people participating

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.130
in Missions because of the
way we restructured the data.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.000
One of the other additions
we've made to the Android app

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.020
to make photographers'
life easier

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.800
was to improve the Camera button
and the interactions with it.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.450
So you tap on the Camera button.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.120
It pulls your most
recent images,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.500
no matter where they come from.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.170
And you also have the option
to use your camera or access

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.500
to the full gallery.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.580
By keeping a single
action there,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.650
we've seen a 73% increase in
people accessing our camera.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.910
We've also seen increases across
the board of people editing

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.737
photos with EyeEm and
uploading photos, as well.

00:02:27.737 --> 00:02:30.320
Designing for different screen
sizes and different resolutions

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.870
is not as hard as
people usually say.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.520
The Android guidelines help you
navigate through the different

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.810
formats-- be it phones
or tablets, portrait

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.170
or landscape-- and
definitely act as a guide,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.900
and help you adapt your
design and the feature

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.560
sets you have to
different screen sizes.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.820
We think it's important
to follow Android design

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.280
guidelines, because that's
what people expect when

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.720
they're on the Android platform.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.282
It's important to keep
those patterns in mind

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:58.990
and also to leverage
them, because that's

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.520
the easiest way for people
to know how your app is used.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280
RAMZI RIZK: What started as
a facelift became, basically,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.795
us stripping down the app.

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.890
And what that led to is a much
more photo-centric experience,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.690
a much more
streamlined experience,

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.892
a much faster experience.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.720
We saw broad engagement,
and retention,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.170
and usage across the board
on every single metric

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.070
that we have.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.120
