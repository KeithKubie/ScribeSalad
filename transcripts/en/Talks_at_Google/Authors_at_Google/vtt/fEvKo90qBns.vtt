&gt;&gt;Thomas Sharon: Hi everyone. Thanks for coming.
My name is Thomas Sharon. I'm a UX Researcher

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.320
here.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:10.309
And without further ado, I would like to introduce
you to Eric Ries, the founder of the Lean

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.669
Startup movement. And thank you for coming.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.200
[applause]

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:25.759
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: See, I don't know. It's hard
to know when you have an audience you don't

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.759
know.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.990
It's hard to know what to say.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.660
So, some of you maybe know the blog, Startup
Lessons Learned. Anybody? Quick show of hands.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.440
OK, good. We have true new people. So, thank
you. Thank you for coming to check it out.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.070
So my name is Eric Ries. I don't really want
your undivided attention. So keep your laptops

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.480
on. That's fine. And in fact, if everyone
do me a favor and take your phones out of

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480
your pockets.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.149
I mean, I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to have this one, but if can turn them on.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.960
No, I'm not joking around. Out of the pockets,
please. 'Cause this is gonna be a talk. You

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.559
might get bored and you might wanna tweet
amongst yourselves.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.329
Or I don't know, whatever special internal
tools you guys use. Whatever it is, please

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.579
feel free. All I ask is that you use the Lean
Startup hash tag, at least if you're on Twitter.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.960
Okay. Is that fair? I won't tell anybody.
Don't worry.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.980
I'm in New York because I'm writing a book.
So one of things you do when you're writing

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.210
a book is you have to go to tell as many people
as possible that this book is coming out.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.470
It'll come out in the fall. I thank you in
advance for preordering it. You can do so

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.470
at lean.st.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.310
That's my life now is as a professional expert
selling books, which is a far cry from how

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.110
I started, which is as a programmer writing
code.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.189
So I'm one of those people that grew up writing
code. I used to write code for a living, which

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.030
is a job I knew really well and understood.
I was pretty good at it.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.340
And then, I started doing startups and I started
to have to manage people who wrote code for

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.520
a living. I knew that slightly less well.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.720
And then I was managing people who managed
people who write code for a living.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.219
And now, I am this professional expert. And
so I advise people who manage people who manage

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.149
people who write code. So I've become very
far removed from the actual work of product

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.149
development.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.810
But that journey has taken me from just writing
code to doing this because I actually think

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.619
the way that we organize new product development
is basically wrong. And that most of the energy

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.830
that we are investing into what is called
'entrepreneurship', when it's two guys in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.890
a garage, or 'disruptive innovation' or something
else buzzwordy when it's done inside a big

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.250
company, is wasting a lot of people's time.
And I think we can do something about it.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.880
So that's what I wanted to talk to you guys
about. Thanks for coming.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.790
So anyway, and this book, of course, will
be available in stores everywhere in the fall.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.440
So, if you read the book, you will learn five
principles of the Lean Startup. And we'll

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440
go through them today.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.410
And I wanna invite you to ask questions either
on Twitter, if you're not feeling that courageous,

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.720
or interrupt me at any time or we'll have
time at the end. All right?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.700
So, entrepreneurs are everywhere. The first
thing is, especially in an audience like this,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.400
I wanna be clear, that entrepreneurship is
not just about two guys in a garage eating

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.620
Ramen noodles. In fact, what makes you an
entrepreneur is not what kind of noodles you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800
eat, but the context in which you operate.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.030
And as I've been travelling around talking
about Lean Startup, what I have learned is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.210
that there are entrepreneurs in all kinds
of places you wouldn't necessarily expect.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.520
And we have a lot more in common than people
realize, because entrepreneurship is management.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.200
But not the kind of general management we're
teaching MBAs and that we have studied for

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.720
the last hundred years, something fundamentally
different. It is management of a kind of work

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.790
that is measured by validated learning, rather
than just making stuff.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.530
We accelerate that learning through something
called the 'build-measure-learn feedback loop'.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.790
And then we measure and hold entrepreneurs
accountable using a new accounting system

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.200
called 'innovation accounting'.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.560
Now, I apologize. You came to a very, I'm
sure, you saw the signs up here like, "Ooh,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.880
an exciting talk about entrepreneurship and
startups and that's gonna be cool." And what

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
did you get?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.590
You got management and accounting, which are
perhaps the two most boring topics on Earth.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.560
So if anybody wants to leave now, I won't
be offended. It's OK.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.540
Because the truth is, what do people know
about entrepreneurship? I feel like -- who

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.850
saw 'The Social Network'? OK. Right. I feel
like that's probably the best modern example

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.390
of the entrepreneurship story we're all used
to.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.650
And you see this in magazines and you see
it in 'The Social Network'. I noticed last

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.000
night that the story, 'Ghostbusters' -- remember
'Ghostbusters', the movie? It's an entrepreneurship

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.680
story. They start a business. They, Dave,
everythingâ€™s the same. It's like the same

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.950
plot structure as 'The Social Network', believe
it or not, except it has a Stay Puft Marshmallow

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.950
Man, which is awesome.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.620
In these entrepreneurship stories, what happens?
It's a story in three parts.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.540
Act One: The plucky protagonist, his character,
his character flaws and how he came up with

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.810
his amazing idea.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.790
Act Two: What I call the photo montage. It's
usually about two minutes long. It goes from

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.330
"they finally get the thing to work". Then
they're writing on whiteboards and drinking

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.500
some beer, pounding on some keyboards. And
then they get their first customer. And then

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.600
that's pretty much it. No dialogue or anything
in the photo montage.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.790
And then Act Three: Now that we're on the
cover of magazines, how do we divide up the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.650
spoils? And who's in charge? And who's in
Who's Who? And how do we deal with the EPA

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.800
and all that stuff? For fans of 'Ghostbusters'.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680
What I think is really interesting about these
stories about entrepreneurship is that 95

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.530
percent of the time of the movie is spent
in Acts One and Act Three, even though in

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.030
real life, all of the important work of entrepreneurship
happens during the photo montage. But the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.940
problem is, for a story-telling point of view,
the photo montage, even though it has no dialogue

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.060
and only lasts two minutes, is it's unspeakably
boring.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.320
What do we do as entrepreneurs that actually
makes a difference? We spend our time trying

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.710
to figure out which customers to listen to
and who to ignore, how to product-prioritize

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.710
product features.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.990
I mean you guys, how many product prioritization
meetings do you go to? It's not exactly the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.980
stuff of movies. It's unbelievably boring.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.640
And how do we hold people accountable? How
do we measure to figure out if we're actually

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.840
making progress or building something that
nobody wants? See, watching somebody pretend

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.210
like they don't have anxiety that their vision
is wrong, is not very good for movies. But

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.920
that's what most entrepreneurs do.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.331
And so, we're gonna have to talk about stuff
like management and accounting, 'cause it's

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:58.320
time to go inside the photo montage and try
to figure out what can we do to make the actual

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.310
work of entrepreneurship more effective. So,
entrepreneurs are everywhere.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.090
My goal, my mission in doing this whole Lean
Startup thing has been to try to put the practice

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.460
of entrepreneurship on a more rigorous footing.
And so, I started out with a definition. Here's

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.570
mine: What is a startup? "A human institution
designed to create something new under conditions

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.270
of extreme uncertainty."

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.500
So I think the most important part of this
definition, and for our purposes today, a

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.170
very important part of our discussion is what
it excludes. It doesn't say anything about

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.490
what the size of your company is. It could
be five people, 5,000, or 50,000. It really

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.490
doesn't matter.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.720
It doesn't matter what sector of the economy
you work in. It really doesn't even matter

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720
what industry you're in.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.170
If you fundamentally are operating with extreme
uncertainty about who is your customer, what

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.930
product do they actually want, and how do
we build a sustainable business, then you

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.422
are an entrepreneur. And when I work with
large companies, one of the things I have

00:06:49.422 --> 00:06:54.480
been trying to do, is to get them to adopt
entrepreneurship as a job title.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.990
Entrepreneurship is a career. When you become
an entrepreneur, you are no longer an engineer.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.440
You are no longer a marketer. You are no longer
a UX designer. Whatever it is you used to

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.550
do, all of a sudden now, you have a different
job title and you've entered a new career

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.550
path.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.081
But unfortunately, we don't get the memo that
tells you that. So, it can be a little bit

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.260
confusing.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.780
That's all a fancy way of saying a startup
is an experiment. What I mean by "experiment"

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.710
is not just like let's ship it and see what
happens, OK? That's not science. If you just

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.700
put some compounds in a beaker and heat it
up, you might look like you're doing science.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.419
But unless you have a hypothesis that you're
trying to test, you have theory, it suggests

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.230
which experiments are gonna help you and then
you make specific predictions, then, fundamentally,

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.500
you're not conducting an experiment.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.820
And we mean, in a Lean Startup model, "experiment"
in the scientific sense. We're trying to create

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:50.270
a science of entrepreneurship that will help
us to stop waste people's time, because that's

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.699
what we're doing on an industrial scale.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.820
And you guys know. Anyone's who's worked on
new products knows that most of them are doomed

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.699
to failure. And when you get at the end of
that product -- I mean as an engineer, I kept

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.540
having over and over again the experience
of working on amazing technology that is today

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.080
sitting on a shelf or worse, that fundamentally
nobody is using. And I kept looking for more

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.860
and more technical solutions to that problem.
I thought, "If we could just get the right

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.430
development methodology, if we just had the
right amount of unit tests or the right this

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.070
or the right that, then we could stop that
happening."

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.360
But the biggest waste that product development
faces today is not building things inefficiently,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.690
but building things very efficiently that
nobody wants. And I brought a demonstration.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.380
We all know that most startups fail. Who remembers
Web 2.0? Remember Web 2.0 when that was really

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.500
cool? At the height of Web 2.0, 2006, a graphic
designer put together this graphic. Have you

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.960
seen this before? This was the like the logos
of all the incredible Web 2.0 companies that

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.680
were gonna change the world.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.430
And in just three years, in 2009, a different
graphic designer was feeling a slightly different

00:08:53.430 --> 00:09:00.390
set of emotions when they put together this
graphic. Our three year report card in Web

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.500
2.0. I mean, the blood red Xs, these are all
companies that are just dead. I think for

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.510
our purposes today though, a much more important
part of that chart to look at are the green

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.000
circles. I won't point at any of them in particular,
but some of those green circles are supposed

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.150
to be the success stories of Web 2.0. But
for this chart, what that means is there are

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.700
companies that were acquired by a larger company,
including this one.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.400
And listen, I'm all for people making money.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.290
So when a company gets acquired by another
company, usually investors and the founders

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.730
make some money and that's all good. But my
question is which of these companies are actually

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:37.360
success stories? Success stories by the higher
definition, not of "did anybody make money?"

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.300
But rather, which of these companies succeeded
in living up to the aspirations, dreams, time,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.710
talent, and energy of the founders and their
investors? And more importantly, their employees.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:54.370
See, look, we all know that when big companies
buy startups, at least half the time, they

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:59.320
die afterwards. So we buy something for hundreds
of millions of dollars. And then we wind up

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.930
selling it three years later for tens of millions
of dollars.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.580
That's not supposed to happen. In general
management, that doesn't happen. When you

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.510
buy an asset, it depreciates in a predictable
way. But when big companies buy startups,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.390
it doesn't happen exactly like itâ€™s supposed
to.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:20.150
And I think the problems that corp-dev departments
have when deciding how to buy startups and

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.000
which startups to buy and then how to integrate
them into the parent company, are the exact

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.110
same problems that internal innovators who
are trying to create brand new startups inside

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.310
big companies have. And they're the exact
same problems that venture-backed entrepreneurs

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.360
have with their investors.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.620
All of us lack a theory of entrepreneurship
to guide our behavior and so we're falling

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.820
back on tools and methods that are not appropriate
to entrepreneurship. That's my belief. So,

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.480
I don't think it has to be this way.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.580
See, it's one thing if startups were failing
because they were taking too much risk. If

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.589
one of these companies was working on teleportation
and then it turned out to be too hard -- we

00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:58.260
couldn't quite get the technology for quantum
entanglement like we thought -- I accept that

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.810
kind of failure; that happens.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:05.150
But I chose Web 2.0 for my demonstration,
especially for you guys. You know. There's

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.800
not a single company on this chart where you
would say, "Boy, I wonder if that can be built."

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.080
Right? "Geez, I wonder if that new social
network -- is it possible to build it?" We

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.760
all know. Software companies, we can build
anything we can imagine. Think about that

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760
for a second.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.480
The dominant question of our time is not can
it be built, but should it be built. And the

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.410
issue is can we build a sustainable business
around a particular product? So, the future

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.620
of our society, our economic growth in the
future, the GDP growth of industrialized countries

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.810
in the future is going to be dependent on
the quality and character of our collective

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.300
imaginations, which I think is a very strange
place to be.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.740
That is really different than the kinds of
economic problems that general management

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.209
was designed to solve in the 20th Century.
Now, most of my startups have failed. So I

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:57.440
know that's not how you're supposed start
one of these talks, like, "Hi. I'm a professional

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.231
expert and I have had more failures than successes.
So you can be just like me if you'll follow

00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:02.231
my advice."

00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:05.520
So, I'm sorry about that. But those of you
who spend any time around entrepreneurship

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.060
know the truth that where there's startups,
there's a lot of failure. And it has to be

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.450
somebody's fault in a talk like this and obviously
it shouldn't be my fault 'cause I'm the expert.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.690
And preferably, it should be the fault of
someone who's dead so that they can't argue.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.950
So I chose this guy.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.080
[laughter]

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.820
This is Frederick Winslow Taylor. He died
in 1915, which is very handy for the purpose

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.500
of this talk because it means he can't talk
back. So, sorry, Fred.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.500
Fred Taylor invented something called "scientific
management" in the early 20th Century, which

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.610
today, we call "management". See, people don't
really remember Fred Taylor.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.709
And those who've studied scientific management
in school probably remember him for some of

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:47.290
his outdated and really ridiculous ideas,
like time and motion studies or the idea that

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.290
a worker is basically just an automaton and
should be told what to do. The reason we don't

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.400
give Fred Taylor the credit he deserves is
because he invented things that to us are

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.880
so obvious, we can't imagine them ever having
been invented. It doesn't make sense.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.960
Like, everybody knows that work should be
done as efficiently as possible, right? And

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.860
that we should treat work like a system and
that we should have managers organize that

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.190
system. That's just plain common sense.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.370
And my favorite, Fred Taylor, invented something
called "The Task and Bonus System", which

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.250
we just call "tasks". The idea was if you
want to do a large project, the best thing

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.370
to do is decompose that project into a series
of individual tasks, assign those tasks to

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.649
functional specialists. And everyone just
does their part knowing that if everybody

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.690
does their part well and everybody else does
their part, the whole will actually work out

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.770
like the manager said.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:40.089
And here's the best part. If you do your task
particularly well, better than expected, you

00:13:40.089 --> 00:13:46.760
should be paid a bonus rather than being penalized.
What could be more obvious? Except in the

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.750
19th Century, the way work was organized is
that if you did your task better than expected,

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.750
you were penalized.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.750
[pause]

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.140
Why? Because that showed a lack of integrity.
You obviously could have done it better before.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.000
But you didn't. So that proves that you're
a liar.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.670
It gets worse. Not only are you a liar, but
what about all your compatriots, your coworkers,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.519
who do the same task the old, slow way? They're
liars, too. All of you have been lying this

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:11.890
whole time and you should all be penalized.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.850
Imagine working in a factory where if you
can come up with a better way to do your repetitive

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.630
job, not only would you be penalized, so would
all your coworkers. Can you imagine the culture

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.070
that would grow up around such a thing? That
everybody is working really hard to make sure

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:31.420
that nobody ever does anything in any way
better because then we'll all be in trouble.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.490
That phenomenon was so widespread in the 19th
Century, they had a name for it. They called

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.770
it "soldiering". That all the workers were
intentionally soldiering on, trying to do

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:44.910
work as slow as possible so that nobody would
get in trouble. Now, we laugh when we think

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:50.550
about that kind of thing happening in a factory.
Because to us, the way that we manage physical

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.459
products, and just all regular general management,
is light years beyond what was possible in

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:57.140
Fred Taylor's day.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.730
But they also believed something else that
I think maybe you'll find a little bit familiar.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.830
They had this idea that what basically was
the great man theory of work. That fundamentally,

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.790
the job of managers was to select the best
possible person. Of course, this is the early

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.790
20th Century.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.760
So a great man of upstanding character with
good integrity, the right attributes, put

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.089
them in the job and fundamentally leave them
alone. Because if you just trust a great man

00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:24.600
to figure out what needs to get done, they
would figure it out.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.651
Does that sound familiar? We still manage
knowledge work and innovation work that exact

00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:33.840
same way. We still believe in the great man
theory of entrepreneurship and we believe

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.240
it especially about the great man software
developers.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.110
And yet, when we look back on this time, decades
from now, I think we're gonna laugh at the

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:45.279
kinds of things that we do when we need to
develop new products. It will seem as antique

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:51.250
to our future selves as Fred Taylor feels
to us. Because I think that entrepreneurship

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.471
is management. It's just a different kind
of management than the general management

00:15:55.471 --> 00:15:58.060
that has been practiced since Fred Taylor's
day.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.779
So, we need to create a different paradigm
for management that's not better than general

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:09.519
management. It's not worse than. It's simply
a parallel discipline specifically for entrepreneurship.

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:10.890
And so, here's my attempt.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.589
The first concept in the entrepreneurial management
toolbox is this thing we call the "pivot".

00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:21.200
Who's tired of hearing about pivots already?
Anybody? OK, I apologize. In Silicon Valley,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.050
everybody's hand is up, by the way. This word
has become ridiculously overused. Believe

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:30.120
it or not, I saw this just the other day in
the New Yorker magazine. Can you read this

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.589
caption? "I'm not leaving you. Iâ€™m pivoting
to another man."

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:35.410
[laughter]

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:40.300
So this word started in Lean Startup and then
it became this monster of an overused, overhyped

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:45.110
concept. Typical for Silicon Valley. We went
from not knowing what the concept was to being

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.580
tired of hearing it and claiming that it's
overhyped, without having passed through the

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.930
intervening stage of ever learning how to
use it correctly. That's just â€“ that's how

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.950
we operate with the hype-cycle in Silicon
Valley. So, I'm sorry about that. I really

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.019
didn't intend.

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:01.980
But you can't understand anything about entrepreneurship
unless you have a word for this concept, because

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.769
it is the universal constant of all successful
startups. If you can get the real story of

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:11.289
what actually happened in the early stages
of a company, you will find out that successful

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:16.299
startup founders do not, do not, have better
ideas than the failed ones. Contrary to what

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:21.059
you see in the movies, most startup founders
of successful companies had ludicrously bad

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:23.109
ideas at the beginning.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.819
And what's amazing about the successful startup
founders is not that they just persevered

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:31.639
indefinitely, but that they had this funny
combination that when they run into difficulty,

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:36.259
it's not just that they gave up ship and went
home. Neither did they persevere the plane

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:37.259
straight into the ground.

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:41.690
They do this thing we call the "pivot". By
analogy to basketball, one foot firmly rooted

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.690
in what we've learned, changing one other
thing about the business at a time. And the

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.249
premise of the Lean Startup is as follows:
If we can reduce the time between pivots,

00:17:50.249 --> 00:17:53.799
we can increase our odds of success before
we run out of money.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:58.220
See, the way you think about startup runway,
is not how many months of burn do I have left?

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.440
It's fundamentally how many opportunities
to pivot do I have left? And sure, we can

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.039
extend the runway by raising more money.

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:10.239
But we can also extend the runway by figuring
out how to pivot sooner. And every day we

00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:15.429
shave off that time is a magical extension
of our runway by a proportional amount. Does

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:19.289
that make sense? OK, I'm getting at least
a few nods. That's good.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:24.240
So, to increase the odds of success, we need
to figure out how can we pivot sooner. We

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.570
need to bring our focus to a validated learning.
Anyone know this? This is the waterfall methodology

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.369
of software development. It's traditional
in one of these talks when you're gonna beat

00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:38.190
up on methodologies to call one the "waterfall
methodology". So this is mine.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.419
This is just Fred Taylor's idea as applied
to software development. When I was trained

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:46.389
as an engineer in Silicon Valley, I was taught
this as the manufacturing metaphor of software

00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:49.389
development. You can imagine, incidentally,
how pissed off I was when I found out that

00:18:49.389 --> 00:18:52.669
they don't use this in manufacturing anymore.
This is way obsolete.

00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:56.429
So it's not clear to me what our excuse is
in software development for copying an obsolete

00:18:56.429 --> 00:18:59.179
model of manufacturing. But I understand why
itâ€™s so appealing.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:03.669
The idea is that since software is so intangible,
we like to imagine our work travelling on

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:07.361
an assembly line, a virtual assembly line,
from department to department. And if everybody

00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:12.070
does their part and trusts everybody else
to do their part, everything works out fine.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.631
It's entertaining to beat up on the waterfall
methodology because it has such a bad track

00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:21.039
record. But itâ€™s important to understand
that waterfall works as long as the solution

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:26.309
and the problem are both relatively well understood.
So if we were building something that is fundamentally

00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:29.440
similar as things we have built in the past,
this works great.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.960
If you're building a video game sequel, amen.
If you're building the next iteration of a

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.529
product that zillions of people already use,
that's fine. But entrepreneurship doesn't

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:40.980
deal with those circumstances. So it's basically
a waste of time.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.539
Now, when you do waterfall, you have this
problem I call "achieving failure" where you

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:52.029
successfully build the wrong thing and you
boast about how good you are at doing it.

00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:55.970
My question is, if you go to a startup board
meeting, or a milestone review meeting for

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:00.720
most new products, what do we talk about?
Milestones, right. We are on track. We're

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.100
building features we said we were gonna build.
We talk about our gross numbers like â€“ hey,

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.140
we have this many customers just like we said.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.840
I remember being in a company once that was
looking, had a plan. They said we were gonna

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.739
have this nice hockey stick-shaped growth.
And we're on the nice, long flat part, and

00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:16.419
everything's going according to plan. Sounds
a little familiar, maybe.

00:20:16.419 --> 00:20:19.779
And you're going to court like, the plan is
genius. Like, nobody is using our product

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:23.000
as expected, as expected. But next week, it
should turn up.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.580
And how do you know if you were on the long,
flat part and you're gonna just, or you're

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.789
on the hockey stick and you're gonna just
coast indefinitely? I believe we can actually

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:32.769
answer those questions quantitatively. We'll
get to that.

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:36.609
So, to me, we are bragging about how we're
building a product that nobody wants. But

00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:40.609
we're doing it on time and on budget. As if,
I have this image of a general manager driving

00:20:40.609 --> 00:20:44.590
a car off a cliff and while they're driving
their like, "But I'm getting great gas mileage,"

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:49.840
right off the cliff. That's what startup failures
mostly look like.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.590
And I think that's true in big companies,
too. Not that I would presume to talk about

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.460
you. But in other companies I've seen, for
sure. So, in manufacturing, they abandoned

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.830
that linear way of working. That's why we
call it Lean Startup by analogy to lean manufacturing.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.840
These are two other unfortunately deceased
men who made this possible. Deming is famous

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.300
for having said, "The customer is the most
important part of the production line." By

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.869
which he meant everything that we do should
be gauged to be decided by whether the customer

00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:17.979
cares that we do it.

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:21.700
So if the thing is of high quality in the
customer's eyes, that matters. But if we're

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.450
doing a lot of internal transport, with the
meetings that we have, the specifications,

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.529
the customer doesn't care about any of that
internal stuff. So let's try to eliminate

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:29.529
it.

00:21:29.529 --> 00:21:32.179
When these ideas were handed down to me as
a Silicon Valley engineer, they looked like

00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:36.940
this. There's our very own guru of extreme
programming, Kent Beck. You guys know Agile

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.809
very well, so I won't bother getting into
it.

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:46.070
Suffice to say that all Agile methodologies
have their origins inside the IT departments

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.049
of big companies. Every single one. And there's
a reason for that. They are designed for situations

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:54.960
where it is the problem that's known, but
the solution is unknown. And so, by building

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.060
something that is well-understood iteratively,
we can increase the odds that the project

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.060
will be successful.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:05.039
So, the classic -- Chrysler Corporation needs
a new payroll system. Agile to the rescue.

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:08.889
But this isn't the world that we live in as
startups either. If the customer is the most

00:22:08.889 --> 00:22:12.769
important part of the assembly line, what
do we do if we don't know who the customer

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:18.220
is? That in whose eyes should we judge our
work? In extreme programming, which customer

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.049
should we sit down next to the engineers to
tell them what to do?

00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:25.809
The assumption of Agile and all previous management
approaches is that there is somebody who can

00:22:25.809 --> 00:22:31.809
give us an authoritative, definitive answer
to design questions. And in entrepreneurship,

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:33.049
that assumption breaks down.

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:39.060
We are working on products where nobody knows
what the customer wants. At best, we have

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:44.879
a theory, a hypothesis, a plan, a hope. And
so, this is what Lean Startup looks like.

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:48.489
Now, at Lean Startup we have our own guru,
Steve Blank. He's still alive, but I put him

00:22:48.489 --> 00:22:50.090
in sepia tones just to be consistent.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.090
[laughter]

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.361
Steve invented something called "customer
development", which is an iterative process

00:22:54.361 --> 00:22:58.370
of trying to figure out who your customer
is, which we can merge in parallel with Agile

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:03.049
development to this company-wide feedback
loop of learning and discovery. This changes

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:07.999
the unit of progress from making stuff to
validated learning.

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:13.229
Let me try to illustrate what I mean. I created
a company called IMVU in 2004. We make a 3-D

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:18.980
avatar instant messaging technology. And at
that time, we wanted to be the next AOL back

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:25.059
when that was still cool. And we wanted to
take over the hot, new social technology of

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:26.100
IM. We really thought that was the wave of
the future.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.679
Whoops. And here was our plan. See, everybody
knows that instant messaging is a network

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:35.450
effects business, right? So, therefore, if
you wanna get someone to switch from their

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.509
IM network to yours, it's kind of a pain 'cause
they'd have to bring all their friends with

00:23:38.509 --> 00:23:40.460
them. So there's high switching costs.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.099
And therefore, IM isn't an industry characterized
by high barriers to entry. That's the MBA

00:23:45.099 --> 00:23:48.279
analysis of the instant messaging market.
And we spent a lot of time figuring that out

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:49.279
at the whiteboard.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:53.529
And we said, "Ah, we need a strategy. A strategy
for avoiding that problem and here it is.

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:58.289
We'll create an instant messaging add-on that
interoperates with all of the existing networks

00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:03.269
and can bring 3-D avatar technology to your
IM client. So we take your boring 2-D IM and

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:04.940
make it 3-D. Wow."

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:09.479
This is before 'Avatar' and the current 3-D
craze. So we thought we were on to a real

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:14.739
trend. And so, here's the reason we got so
excited about that strategy. It would be inherently

00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:18.659
viral. Because when you would decide you wanna
go 3D, you would have to be IMâ€™ing with

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:22.399
somebody and they would automatically get
a text link inserted into the chat stream

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:26.509
that they could just one-click, pick-up boom,
IMVU installs. Now you're both in 3D.

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:31.639
Doesn't this seem like a good idea? Well,
we met with investors at that time. The strategy

00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:35.599
part of it, they're like, "That does sound
very promising." And when I tell the stories

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.500
to MBAs now, I get a lot of nods, like "That
is good stuff. I don't know what the hell

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.059
this guy's been talking about until now, but
this I understand. This is strategy."

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:45.470
And the strategy actually is very good, except
for the tiniest, tiniest problem, which is

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.720
that every single thing I just said is false.
Customers actually don't have high switching

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.249
costs for IM. Their network effects are way
overblown and our customers refused to invite

00:24:54.249 --> 00:24:56.110
their friends. It was a total deal breaker.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.629
We'd have customers come in an in-person usability
test. We're paying them to be there. And we'd

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:04.619
be like, "OK, download our instant messaging
add-on." The customer would be like, â€œWhat

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:08.729
is that?" "An instant messaging add-on. It
interoperates with all your IM." And you gotta

00:25:08.729 --> 00:25:12.979
picture of a 16- year old like, "What? Is
it an IM client?" And we're like, "No, no.

00:25:12.979 --> 00:25:16.129
You won't have to run a whole other IM client."
They're like, "Why not?" Like, "Oh, it would

00:25:16.129 --> 00:25:20.129
be so complicated to download." They're like,
"Dude, I have like seven IM clients. What's

00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:21.929
the big deal?" And we're like, "There are
seven IM clients?"

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:22.929
[laughter]

00:25:22.929 --> 00:25:23.929
So that was problem number one.

00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:27.039
We're like, "Listen, we are paying you to
be here. So how about you download this thing?

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:31.889
OK?" "All right. Fine." "Download the thing."
OK. "Customize your avatar." They love this

00:25:31.889 --> 00:25:35.590
part. "Like, ooh, that's really cool, interactive
like that." Great. "OK, now you customize

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:41.491
your avatar. Invite one of your friends."
"No way." "Why not?" "I don't know if this

00:25:41.491 --> 00:25:44.619
thing is cool, yet and I'm not gonna invite
my friends to something that turns out to

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:45.619
be lame."

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:48.360
See, I know people who are selling like business
software are used to the concept of "mission

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.239
critical". We didn't understand that in our
business, mission critical, like the law of

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:55.330
commandments of mission critical software,
one of them needs to be like, "Do not make

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.720
teenager look lame in front of their friends."
Total deal breaker.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.560
They wouldn't do it. We were like, "We're
paying you to be in this usability test."

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.139
And it's just like, "I'm not doing it. You
can keep your money. I will not. It's not

00:26:05.139 --> 00:26:10.159
worth it to me." And they kept saying things
like, "Let me use it with -- let me try it

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:14.389
out first. And if it's cool, then I'll invite
one of my friends." And we were like, "Oh,

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:15.980
OK." We're from the video game industry.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:21.869
So we knew what that meant. That meant single-player
mode. So we built another version of the product,

00:26:21.869 --> 00:26:26.560
single-player mode. Allowed you to -- we had
another teenager come in for a usability test.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.700
"Hey, download this instant messaging add-on."
"I don't know. What the hell is that?" "Just

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.009
do it." "OK." "Customize your avatar." "Oh,
that's cool." "OK, try it by yourself."

00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:34.599
And they could check out the avatar, dress
it up, do the moves and the whole thing. Learn

00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:39.740
how to use the chat bubbles. And then we're
like, "OK, now invite one of your friends."

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.889
Teenager, "No way." "Why not?" "This thing
is lame." And we're like, "But we told you

00:26:44.889 --> 00:26:46.289
it was gonna be so lame."

00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:48.850
I mean, we're supposed to be listening to
customers, but they don't know what the hell

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:52.359
they want. And they told us to build this
thing and we're like, "It'll be so cool once

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:56.510
you invite some of your friends." And they're
like, "Listen, old man. I'm not doing it."

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.510
[laughter]

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.529
And we were really devastated. Okay.

00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:02.000
So anyway, long story short, this was a total
deal breaker. This strategy is completely

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.559
flawed in every respect because itâ€™s based
on empirically incorrect facts.

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:11.609
Now, we wound up having to pivot the company
and we created our own instant messaging network

00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:15.450
and it all turned out fine. But I'd like you,
if you would, just for a minute to sympathize

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.549
with me personally. OK? Because I was the
engineer. I was the CTO of this company.

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:24.519
It was my job to write the software to do
instant messaging interoperability. So I wrote,

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:31.320
I don't know, 25 thousand lines of code or
something. I did it all Agile, refactored,

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.059
really elegantly structured if I do say so
myself. Good unit test coverage, the whole

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:38.729
shebang. And all of my code got thrown out.

00:27:38.729 --> 00:27:39.729
[pause]

00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:43.799
The good code got thrown out and the bad code
got thrown out. The well-factored code got

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:46.570
thrown out. The stuff I was proud to show
my mom and the stuff that I wouldn't want

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.340
anyone to see at all was equally thrown out.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:54.169
Because a [ ] of quality is if you don't know
who the customer is then you don't know what

00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:58.409
quality means. So failure is a great equalizer
of quality. It all had to be thrown out.

00:27:58.409 --> 00:28:02.549
And I was really depressed. Because you gotta
understand, we had spent six months killing

00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:06.830
ourselves to build this product. And we had
spent I don't know how many hours of my life

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.849
that I can never get back arguing with each
other about the following. Which bugs did

00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:16.269
we absolutely, positively have to fix. And
which ones could we live without? Sound familiar?

00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:21.019
Which features just had to be in version one
or which ones could we just maybe could maybe

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:25.460
postpone to a different release? That's what
we spent all of our time doing.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.789
And yet, we had this problem, which was that
customers would not download our product.

00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:33.159
Like, this product sucked. It was really buggy.
It would crash your computer. I was really

00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:36.320
embarrassed to have shipped it. And we almost
didn't ship it, I was so embarrassed.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.840
But then, I was actually relieved cause nobody
found out how bad it was because nobody would

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:46.570
use it. And I was like, "Wait, something is
not right here. Why am I relieved that nobody's

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.009
using the product? That doesn't seem right."

00:28:49.009 --> 00:28:53.719
And long story short, my cofounders dragged
me, kicking and screaming, to the realization

00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:56.609
it was time to pivot. We had to throw that
code away. And we created a standalone IM

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.830
network and we were much more successful,
la di da.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:03.320
But here's the thing. I had to make myself
feel better somehow because I was like, "Gosh.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.429
Would the company have been just as well off
if I had spent the last six months on a beach

00:29:07.429 --> 00:29:10.929
somewhere, having nice drinks and doing nothing?"

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:15.489
And I was, "Did I even need to be here given
that all the work that I did was thrown away?"

00:29:15.489 --> 00:29:19.789
Anyone feel like that's true? Anyone know
what the excuse I used was to make myself

00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:20.789
feel better?

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:22.710
You can shout it out. It's OK. I guess, yeah.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.259
&gt;&gt;audience 1: You built a team.

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:25.259
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: What's that?

00:29:25.259 --> 00:29:26.259
&gt;&gt;audience 1: You built the team.

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:29.469
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: We had the team at the beginning.
What did they need me for? Why was it worth

00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:31.629
having done this exercise in the first place?
What's that?

00:29:31.629 --> 00:29:32.629
[audience 2]: You learned something.

00:29:32.629 --> 00:29:34.370
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Because I learned something.
Thank you. The last excuse in the book. If

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.419
you've utterly failed to execute, you can
always claim to have had a good learning experience.

00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:41.090
At least you learned something. I mean, I
don't tell you guys.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.080
In general management, you claim to have learned
something, you're likely to be fired. A general

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.380
manager who learned something -- one of two
things is true. Either they didn't make a

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.720
very good plan, in which case, definitely
should be fired. Or even worse, they made

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.909
a really good plan and failed to execute it.
I'd definitely fire that guy.

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:59.549
So, I think itâ€™s natural that we have a
little bit of an aversion to wanna just say

00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:03.619
that we learned anything because that is very
dangerous. But in entrepreneurship, failure

00:30:03.619 --> 00:30:08.769
is, not only is failure an option, it's practically
the only option. It's what happens when reality

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:09.830
intervenes with our plans.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.409
&gt;&gt;audience 2: So, what did you learn?

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:16.570
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: So here's what we learned specifically.
We learned the hard way, that customers did

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.019
not wanna use our product to connect with
their existing friends. They wanted to use

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.769
it to make new friends.

00:30:23.769 --> 00:30:27.710
That doesn't seem like a very big deal. I
mean, it's all a very modest change in semantics.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.739
But from a code and product point of view,
that is a radically different product. It

00:30:31.739 --> 00:30:35.460
required a very different experience. And
we didn't throw out every line of code. But

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.710
we had to throw out a lot.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.840
The pivot was quite dramatic. And I made myself
feel better with this whole learning story

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.029
until I asked myself the following question.
I mean, literally, I was up nights once I

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:45.440
had this question asked to me.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.450
Which was, "Wait a minute. If my goal of the
last six months was to learn this important

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:54.710
thing about customers, why did it take six
months? How come the word 'learning' is only

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.239
coming up now after we failed and we need
an excuse? We never used the word 'learning',

00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:04.899
not one time during those six months. All
we ever did was argue about features and bugs."

00:31:04.899 --> 00:31:08.089
And then I was like, "But would we have had
the same learning if we'd built a slightly

00:31:08.089 --> 00:31:12.570
different first product?" Like, for example,
did we have to support all seven IM networks?

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.339
What if we'd supported only three? Would the
learning value have been the same? Sure. Customers

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:20.499
won't download, so who cares? What if we'd
supported only one network? Learning values

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:23.889
the same. Now, that's a lot of code between
seven networks and one, that's a lot less

00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:25.539
code that needed to be written.

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:29.440
But this is the thought that literally made
me sick to my stomach. I'd say, "Wait a minute.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.489
What if we had just created a single web page
and in three hours created a photo mockup

00:31:34.489 --> 00:31:38.539
of what the product was going to look like
and said, 'Hey, download this amazing 3D avatar

00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:42.909
instant messaging add-on.' And had a big download
button. Would we even have had to create the

00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:47.610
second page where we admit that we didn't
build the product, or would a 404 have been

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:53.570
adequate?" Come on, it's the 404, obviously.
Because nobody would download the product.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:59.179
It was a deal breaker. Nobody wanted it. That
meant that we didn't even need page two.

00:31:59.179 --> 00:32:03.360
And that was really upsetting to me, personally.
Why? Because I look at my business card and

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.239
what did it say? It said a lot of things,
but all I saw was "guy who writes code." My

00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:10.009
job is to make features.

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:14.759
So if I went home at the end of the day and
I write good code, I had a good day. And now,

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:19.839
but if my goal is to learn this thing about
customers, and I can do it without code, is

00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:20.849
that my job?

00:32:20.849 --> 00:32:24.469
Is it possible that something I could do in
three hours is just as meritorious as something

00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:27.830
that requires 25,000 lines of code? It didn't
seem right.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:33.399
But I think that's actually true. Fundamentally,
startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:36.649
business. We call it "validated learning"
'cause we have to back up that learning quantitatively.

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:39.330
Any old idiot can tell a good story.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:44.509
But we need a system for rigorously assessing,
"Are we actually learning how to build a sustainable

00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:49.649
business?" And everything else is a complete
and total waste of time, including our precious

00:32:49.649 --> 00:32:51.259
code.

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:55.380
Now, in the lean manufacturing revolution,
the first question they had to teach people

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.339
to ask was "what is the difference between
value and waste"?

00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:01.589
And in a factory, this is actually relatively
straightforward. Value is the stuff that we

00:33:01.589 --> 00:33:05.889
make. The customers want. And waste is everything
else. But if our unit of progress is gonna

00:33:05.889 --> 00:33:10.479
be learning, then our unit of value has become
intangible and now we have an issue. Which

00:33:10.479 --> 00:33:15.279
is -- OK, we can eliminate all the stuff that
we do that doesn't contribute to learning.

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:20.299
So, we have this concept in Lean Startup called
"minimum viable product", which is, what really

00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:24.379
needs to be in that first version? And now
we have a good answer. Only what is necessary

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:29.749
to learn whether our plan is correct or not.
Everything else is extraneous.

00:33:29.749 --> 00:33:34.229
But that's still a little bit vague. And so
the next step in lean manufacturing was to

00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:38.879
focus on cycle time. And so what that looks
like is this. Very simple heuristic. This

00:33:38.879 --> 00:33:42.879
is the flux capacitor of Lean Startup.

00:33:42.879 --> 00:33:47.070
All we are as a software startup is a catalyst
that turns ideas into code. When customers

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.779
interact with that code, they create data
which we can choose to measure quantitatively

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:54.940
and qualitatively. And then if we want, we
can learn impacting our next set of ideas.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.659
This, we can use to put the concept of the
pivot on a more rigorous foundation.

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:04.659
A pivot is one major turn through this feedback
loop. And the heuristic for any kind of startup

00:34:04.659 --> 00:34:09.020
advice that anyone wants to give you is really
simple. Does it minimize total time through

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.020
this loop?

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.250
So I don't know about you, I go to a lot of
startup talks, I read a lot of startup blogs.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:17.929
All the advice is like this. "You know, it's
really important to have great design. Design

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.520
always wins. Except craigslist didn't have
very good design and neither did EBay. So

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.001
sometimes it's fine to have no design. But
make sure its very scalable, cause you don't

00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:28.669
want to be the next Friendster. Except that
Facebook wasn't very scalable and it was fine.

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:32.120
So make sure you have good design and design
doesn't matter. It's scalable, but not too

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.120
scalable."

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.490
It's not very helpful advice and if you go
down the list, it's like make sure you raise

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.970
plenty of money, but not too much money. Make
sure you have the right kind of people, but

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:42.570
not those other kind of people, but actually,
sometimes those other kind of people are fine.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.730
And we focus on all this contradictory stuff
'cause for any particular piece of advice,

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.930
I can find you somebody who followed that
advice and then made a lot of money. I can

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:53.290
also find you somebody who didn't follow that
advice and made a lot of money. I can find

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.040
you people who followed that advice and made
no money and people who didn't follow that

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.140
advice. I can find you all four quadrants
of a logical possibilities chart.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.910
So, how do we know what advice to take and
what not? I think this is the heuristic you

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:08.821
wanna use. If it gets us through this feedback
loop on a sustainable basis faster, it's a

00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:11.390
good idea. And if not, not.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:17.130
There's a lot more, of course, to Lean Startup.
There's a zillion things on this graph. You

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.540
can read them all on my blog, Startup Lessons
Learned. Of course, you can buy a certain

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.840
book. I've heard it's coming out in the fall.
It's really good.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.180
All of these techniques, like continuous deployment,
where we put software into production, like

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:33.790
50 times a day on average. So, 20 minutes
from the main trunk to production, no branches.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.730
Things like net promoter score where we can
evaluate in real time using a tracking survey,

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.990
what customers really think about our product.
Everything you know about usability tests,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.910
five whys, which is drawn from the Toyota
production system.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.590
Each of these techniques has -- they operate
at one stage of the feedback loop, but they

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:54.390
have the net effect of minimizing total time.
That's what the Lean Startup is about.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:36:00.300
But I wanna mention one more really boring
topic called "innovation accounting". See,

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.840
we've forgotten what accounting was designed
for. I mean, we think of accounting as that

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.660
thing that the really boring people do to
keep track of where the money goes, right?

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.470
That's pretty much what it is. It's just a
ledger that says, "Where did all the money

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.470
go?"

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.670
But accounting was invented for a very different
reason. It was invented to drive accountability

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:22.430
across departments. Because if you wanna have
a large company with many different divisions,

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.760
you have to be able to hold the managers of
those divisions accountable to some things

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.160
so that you know that they did a good job.
General Motors, which invented most of our

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.630
modern management paraphernalia, had this
concept.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.861
When I first read this concept, I literally
laughed out loud; I couldn't believe it. It

00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:41.760
was called the Standard Volume. It was the
ideal number of cars that General Motors should

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:48.000
sell, division by division, in an ideal year.
And they actually had the math, and staff,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.890
the macroeconomic staff to figure out, given
all the macroeconomic data available, how

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.840
to translate the standard year into our coming
actual year.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.721
So they could go division by division and
tell each manager, "Given that we're in a

00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:04.940
recession, or the economy is booming, you
should sell this number of Oldsmobiles. And

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.750
therefore, if you sell more than the standard
number, you get a bonus. And if not, you failed."

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.140
And it's not fair if you didn't have that
concept, then if it's a good year, all the

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.710
managers seem like they're doing well. And
in a recession, everyone seems like they're

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.270
doing badly. You can't tell which manager
actually made a difference.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.090
Now when I read that concept, I laughed out
loud because I was like, "Wait a minute. Are

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.690
you telling me there was a time when people
could make forecasts about what was going

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.340
to happen in the future, and then it actually
happened?"

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.230
I don't know about you. I have never in my
whole life seen a forecast of anything that

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:37.620
turned out to be remotely accurate. No startup
I have ever worked for has had a roadmap that

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.300
turned out to be remotely true. I have never
seen a company say how many customers they

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.230
would have in the future and then deliver.
Never seen it.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.490
So to me, the idea of the standard volume
is ridiculous. But I understand when you have

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.940
a sufficiently large company and you have
a sufficiently long operating history, you

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.650
can do this. Maybe this sounds a little bit
familiar.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:58.510
So, if we're using accounting to drive accountability,
but all of our accounting depends on having

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:03.380
a long operating history and a lot of customers,
how do we drive accountability if there's

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.380
no customers yet?

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:09.850
If the CFO of a company, hypothetically speaking,
gives a certain team a bunch of money and

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:14.170
sends them off to some remote location to
do their work, like to Australia or something.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:20.060
And then they hang out in Australia or whatever.
And then a year later, they say, "What are

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:25.320
your results?" And the team says, "They're
not very good, but we're on the brink of success."

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.980
How is the manager who gave them all that
money supposed to know if A: They are in fact

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.400
on the brink of a success or they're just
on the flat part of the hockey stick, or if

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.450
they've just been goofing off for a year?
Or more likely, if they're just executing

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.450
a bad plan.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.510
And at what kind of milestone should we hold
them accountable to if we can't hold them

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.820
accountable to the gross numbers of customers?
'Cause that's fundamentally not fair. If we're

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.360
focusing on the gross numbers, incidentally,
we might decide we're gonna do a lot of publicity

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.550
and PR and be like, "This thing is gonna be
amazing," to drive customer awareness.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.650
But we all know if you happen to find yourself
on such a team, that that early awareness

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.590
is fundamentally lethal. But it's not fair
to just say, "Well, just let them do whatever

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:04.080
and hope for the best." You guys know exactly
how that turns out. So, what is the solution?

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.150
I think we can answer that question now with
something I call "innovation accounting".

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.150
Here it is.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.991
Instead of focusing on product milestones
and gross numbers, we have three learning

00:39:12.991 --> 00:39:18.150
milestones we can focus on. We have to take
our attention away from the vanity metrics.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:21.950
Vanity metrics are the numbers you put in
a press release to make your competitors feel

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:25.621
bad. Like the total number of pages on the
internet that you've indexed. I happen to

00:39:25.621 --> 00:39:26.621
like that one a lot.

00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:30.120
There was a time when we had a big index,
number of in pages indexed battle. And it's

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:33.260
like, "We have four billion and you only have
two billion." But like, what does that actually

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.800
tell you about the quality of somebody's business?
Absolutely nothing.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.090
They could be four billion really dumb pages.
It could be one guy's website who's just really

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.670
excited about the number four billion. Or,
it could be four billion people who each have

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.670
one crappy website.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.350
If you read "TechCrunch", you're gonna see
a zillion stories about "This company has

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:52.610
sent 400 messages through their platform."
But is that 400 million people who are all

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.270
about to turn out, or one very excited customer?
We don't know.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.490
We used to have a competitor in IMVU that
would report on the gross GDP of the value

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.210
of their whole user to user economy. And my
CEO would sometimes come to me and be like,

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:08.263
"These guys have a four hundred million dollar
GDP. What's our GDP?" I was like, "What does

00:40:08.263 --> 00:40:13.600
that even mean in our context? If two users
exchange some virtual currency, is that part

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.250
of the GDP? I don't know." It's a completely
meaningless number, but it sure made us feel

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.250
bad.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.370
I'm all for vanity metrics and press releases.
Go to town. That's fine for making your competitors

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.370
feel bad.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:26.620
But what happens when we use those numbers
to guide our own business? Is that "when the

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.880
numbers go up, it's always because of what
I was working on"? Everyone thinks I made

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.270
this feature last week and now the numbers
went up. So obviously it's due to me. Of course,

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.880
the people in marketing feel like it's 'cause
their new marketing campaign, etc. What happens

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.760
when the numbers go down?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.510
Anyone ever been in that meeting? Oh, it's
seasonal effects. Did anyone ever hear seasonal

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.980
effects used to describe numbers going up?
Never in my career. It's always like, if it's

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.270
going up, it's features. If it's down, it's
seasonal effects, or worse, those idiots in

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.270
marketing.

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:55.520
And over time, each us lives in our own private
reality where the stuff I do makes numbers

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.730
go up and the stuff that those guys do make
numbers go down. So is it any wonder that

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.790
we think each other are idiots?

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:04.240
Now, expand that organization larger and larger
and larger as people are in ever more permanent

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.970
silos, speaking their own language, living
in their own private reality. Is there any

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:09.570
wonder that they have trouble working together?

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:15.520
Maybe that sounds a little bit familiar. Okay.
Just checking. So instead of that, we're gonna

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.890
use actionable metrics, which are about per
customer behaviors, things that can be measured

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:20.890
at microscale.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:24.520
And the first thing we're gonna do is establish
the baseline. So now we can put the purpose

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.810
of the minimum viable product on a much more
rigorous setting. Somewhere in our business

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.940
plan, there is a model that says, "Hey, if
customers behave in this way, then weâ€™ll

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.700
have zillions of them over time." And we can't
get into all the details on how to build those

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.380
models. Of course, there's a great book coming
out. You can learn all about it.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.940
In the meantime, what we wanna do is just
figure out what are the real numbers for each

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.160
of those inputs at microscale? That's what
the minimum viable product is for. So, if

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.990
there's some number, some spreadsheet somewhere,
that says, "Hey, ten percent of customers

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.420
who come to our website should register for
our product." Then we should have a big banner

00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.000
in our office somewhere that's like, "We must
have ten percent conversion or we die." And

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.880
then, we each have a minimum viable product
as soon as possible to find out what that

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.970
number is today.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:08.820
And most likely, when you do that experiment,
the baseline will be horrible. Like, it'll

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.730
only be one percent and it's supposed to be
ten percent. And like, oh my God. In general

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:16.160
management, that provokes a crisis cause now
we failed and uh-oh. There's this thing called

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.960
the "audacity of zero", which is how much
easier it is to raise money and get people

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.763
excited when you have no results. Or having
zero dollars of revenue in a startup is a

00:42:23.763 --> 00:42:28.230
great time to raise money. Having one dollar
of revenue is a disaster. 'Cause with zero,

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.990
it's like, "Well, why is it zero?" "'Cause
we haven't launched." So, obviously it should

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.900
be zero. Everyone's like, "Oh, that makes
sense."

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.710
God forbid you have one dollar of revenue,
'cause then they'd say, "Why is it only one

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:39.140
dollar? I thought this thing was gonna be
an overnight success and now you're proving

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.750
to me that it isn't." So with zero you can
always be an overnight success. With any other

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.190
number you're screwed.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.990
But we need to change that. We need to say,
"Finding out the truth of where we are right

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:53.070
now is progress. It's a milestone that we
should celebrate." And then we do step two,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.770
which is we tune the engine. We make product
development changes that are not designed

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:01.640
to drive huge gross numbers, but to make those
conversion numbers go from the horrible baseline

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.170
to the ideal in our business plan.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:08.570
And whenever I've done this with teams, I've
only ever seen two cases. Case one, it's supposed

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.760
to be one percent. It's one percent but it's
gotta be ten percent. So, a few iterations

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:17.040
in, it's one percent, three percent, six percent,
six and a half percent, seven and a half percent.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.830
Now, it's not ten percent yet. So the model
isn't exactly working, but you can say, "Are

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.920
we gonna get there?" Yeah, probably. Each
thing that we do seems to drive the number

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.250
up a little bit. We seem to be heading in
the right direction. We're split testing to

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:33.030
make sure that the changes we're making are
in fact driving the change. It's all good.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:37.770
Here's situation number two. It's one percent,
three percent, three and a half percent, 3.75

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:43.840
percent, 3.8 percent, 3.81 percent. Now, the
numbers are going up every time. So it's not

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.950
like the numbers are going down. It's not
like it's zero. But you might ask yourself

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.450
a question four, five, six months into hitting
that asymptote. Are we ever gonna beat ten

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.900
percent? I think it's safe to conclude the
answer is no.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.700
Of course, theoretically, it is possible.
The next iteration will be that magic one

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.230
more feature that gets you to ten percent.
But in reality, that's not the case.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:06.080
When the team gets to the point where hitting
that diminishing returns, everybody knows

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.870
you're not gonna make it and you enter the
land of death march. So instead, I recommend

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:16.210
we do three. We schedule the meeting in advance.
That three months from now, six, whatever

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:20.210
it is, we're gonna have a meeting to decide
whether to pivot or persevere.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:24.840
And by that meeting, we will have the data
about whether our efforts to tune the engine

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.220
are working or hitting diminishing returns.
And so, we have all these concepts in entrepreneurship,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.270
like product market fit, that are very vague.
This system allows us to put those concepts

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:38.840
on a much more quantitative basis. We can't
turn whether to pivot into a formula.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.450
I can't tell you what to do. I still rely
on human judgment, just like science does.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:47.690
But if we make specific predictions, if we
use innovation accounting as our accountability

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:53.940
model, then we can be training our judgment
to get better over time, just like in science.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.560
So, don't do product development astrology.
Do product development science. I left a bunch

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.420
of questions unanswered 'cause we only have
a short time together. Like, how do you know

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.420
specifically when to pivot?

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.840
What's the relationship between our vision,
our strategy and our product? What exactly

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.980
should we measure in each of the engines of
growth? How is it that products grow? How

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.330
do we know if we're on that hockey stick,
or on the long, flat part forever? How do

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.610
we test if we're creating value?

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:21.480
What specific features should be in the MVP?
Can we go faster? The answers to these questions

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.460
and so many more are in the new book coming
out in the fall, called "The Lean Startup".

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:26.740
You can, of course, preorder it at lean.st.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.790
Thank you very, very much for doing so. I'll
just give you my contact information. Please

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.750
be in touch if I can be helpful in any way.
We have a brand new website, which is itself

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.410
a minimum viable product about theleanstartup.com.
Please check it out. We would love your feedback.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:42.490
And you are all officially invited to the
Startup Lessons Learned conference, which

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.360
is gonna be May 23rd in San Francisco, but
we also simulcast. Last year, we were in 50

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360
cities.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.460
So presumably we'll be in New York, too. I
hope if you can make it, you will drop me

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:55.860
a line. And if this proves in any way helpful,
I hope you'll email me and tell me about it.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.740
Thank you all very much.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.740
[applause]

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.800
So we have time for a few questions? OK, let
her rip. If I stumped all of Google, I'm gonna

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.510
be pretty proud of myself. That's going right
on Twitter.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:08.940
[pause]

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.370
Sweet.

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.800
[pause]

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:23.190
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: So, I just wanted
to touch on something that you mentioned is

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.320
reviewed too many times; the pivot.

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.380
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Uh-huh.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.790
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: I have trouble
understanding exactly how much work to put

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:36.850
in for the first pivot. I think the second
and the third might be a little bit more,

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:41.970
OK, maybe not. [laughs] But just starting
off, like how much work should you really

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.490
put in for that first pivot?

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:47.600
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: There's no way to answer that
question in general, honestly.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:54.300
You have to put yourself into a position where
the team will know if it's working or not

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.530
working. And the problem is that most teams
have a plan, which is basically to ship it

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.530
and see what happens.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.520
And the problem with ship it and see what
happens, you can feel like you're being very

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:09.010
agile, but you're guaranteed to succeed at
seeing what happens. And so, you'll therefore

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.950
always feel like it was worth doing and you'll
feel like you're on the right track no matter

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:12.950
what.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.090
The only way to get yourself into a position
where you have to pivot is to make specific,

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:20.590
concrete predictions ahead of time that if
they turn out to be wrong, will actually call

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:22.320
your theory into doubt.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.640
And the issue is that we all know that most
projections for new products are complete

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.560
BS. You have to tell the CFO, or whoever,
that you're gonna have a zillion trillion

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.710
customers in year five. Otherwise you won't
get the money to do your project.

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.460
But we know that we just made those projections
up. So when they don't prove to be correct,

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.670
we're like, "Well, that doesn't prove that
our vision is wrong. It just proves that it

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.560
took longer than we expected." So, yeah, the
hockey stick is still gonna happen, but it's

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.560
taking longer.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.820
If we do innovation accounting and we make
very specific per customer behavior predictions

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.510
-- like one thing we'll often have people
do is sell the magic version of their product

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:54.730
on a landing page somewhere.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:58.680
And it's like, don't even say what the product,
like how it works. Just say the benefit that

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.820
it gives you and see if you can get people
to sign up. If people won't sign up for the

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.430
magic, they're certainly not going to sign
up for your product, 'cause magic is always

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:06.430
better.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.110
And if magic isn't even good enough, if the
conversion rate on magic is too low, then

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.360
you already know that you have a problem.
Not that that means that therefore give up,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.850
go home. It just means there isn't already
enough latent demand for what you're doing.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.910
And so you're gonna be in a different kind
of market then maybe you expected. Does that

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.950
help? So the minimum viable product truly
is the minimum, the least amount required,

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:31.951
to get that first information. It's not, "Oh,
if it doesn't turn out into an overnight success,

00:48:31.951 --> 00:48:32.951
we give up."

00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:36.290
And if you release that pressure to get it
right the first time, like, I feel like a

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:40.100
lot of us feel like we have to do this circus
act to make it seem like we could predict

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.580
the future. Like, one of those brilliant visionary,
the next Steve Jobs. Not even Steve Jobs is

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.490
as good as Steve Jobs. That's a story that
we've all been told.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:51.580
And every company I've worked with internally,
there are these genius heroes who always seem

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.730
to be able to get it right on the first try
and everyone else is trying to emulate. But

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.360
when you meet the hero, you're like, "How
do you do it?" If they're being honest with

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.300
you, they're like, "I actually don't know."

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.450
Or, "Actually that's not how it happened and
it wasn't as easy as everybody thinks. Now

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:10.010
I feel incredible pressure to replicate that
success again." And so, you can imagine the

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:13.840
negotiation that happens with the superstar
over their next project. They don't ever want

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.720
to be in a position where they do something
and it doesn't work, or they'll have to quit

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720
and go to convince some other company they're
a superstar.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.720
I hear that happened recently. Anyway. Is
that helpful?

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.720
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Yeah.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.720
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: OK. Any other questions?

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720
[pause]

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: So most of the
rapid feedback you're talking about seems

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.290
to be very applicable to consumer applications
where the cost of trying something in the

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:37.290
amount of time it takes to try something is
pretty low. I will or will not sign up for

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.770
Twitter or Facebook or whatever the next thing
is.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.910
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Yeah.

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:50.730
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: How does it apply
if it's a bigger thing? If it's an enterprise

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.100
sale or if it's a bigger commitment, do you
just basically take the same process, but

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:59.790
the time scale is longer because the commitment
process is longer for each step?

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:05.240
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Yes. I mean, that's the short
answer. I mean, the long answer is my background's

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.110
in consumer internet. So I talk that way just
naturally about large sample sizes and split

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.450
tests. Just the way that I, I can't help it.
That's my whole career.

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.010
What's funny is that Steve Blank, who I mentioned
earlier, has a great book called "The Four

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.600
Steps to the Epiphany", that I hope you all
read. When he talks, his background is in

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.540
enterprise software. He gets this question
too, all the time. Except when he gets the

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.080
question, people say, "Well, of course, this
will work in enterprise software. But how

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.070
will it work on consumer internet?"

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.910
Because we just assume that the tactics that
have worked in one industry don't work in

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:35.810
another. So the answer is truly, it's the
principles that matter, not the tactics.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.610
And so, the principle of the build-measure-learn
feedback loop is cross-industry. So for example,

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:44.430
in consumer internet, because we're used to
having large numbers of customers, we do all

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:49.930
this analytic stuff as a crutch. It's actually,
it's actually -- it's because we have it worse

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:50.930
than the enterprise people.

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:54.480
When you have a lot of customers, you can't
get to know any of them particularly well.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.610
In fact, you just have, you have to rely on
archetypes and summaries and assumptions.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:02.140
When you have a small number of customers,
it's a huge asset because you can know each

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.390
of them extremely well and the experiments
that you do can have much higher fidelity.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.960
So like, physicists don't get to ask electrons
what they're thinking about doing. They're

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.960
not available for comment.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.911
But when you're studying something that can
actually interact with you, it's a whole different,

00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:18.210
whole different ballgame. Question over here?
Yeah.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:22.490
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: What product should
Google be pivoting on right now?

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.490
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: What? What product should Google
be pivoting on right now? Listen, I would

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.270
never presume to tell Google anything about
that. I mean, look.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.270
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: You were invited.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.270
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: What's that?

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:29.270
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: You were invited.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:32.400
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: I was invited. But look, but
seriously. Like, the outside expert doesn't

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:37.750
know anything. You guys know your business
way better than I do. And you know what products

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.760
need to be pivoted. You know. You don't need
me to tell you.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.160
The better question is, how on Earth are we
gonna get to pivot them? Because we're stuck

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.880
in a management and accountability framework
where pivoting is failure is a problem. So

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:56.390
for example, a certain Google product that
I know especially well because it was competing

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:04.160
with something that I was working on at the
time, I won't get into too much detail.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.130
One of our cofounders at IMVU went to work
on this product for Google. So, you're Google

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:12.160
people. You can talk about this. So they had
a lot of inside information about what we

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.150
were doing available to them. And at first,
we were really nervous because it meant that

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:18.190
we were gonna face competition from Google.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:24.360
Here's what happened. Google spent two years
working on that product. Spent, I can't imagine

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.780
how much money developing it. And when it
finally came out, they launched it with a

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.190
big bang, put the Google brand right on it.
And then when some things didn't go as expected

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:36.620
and it turned out to be an embarrassment,
like, it got pulled and killed.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.920
And the whole time, we were like, "What is
going on over there?" 'Cause we were iterating

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:42.860
and changing constantly over that whole two
year period. By the time they launched the

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.150
product, we felt like they'd launched a product
that did what our product did two years ago.

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:52.050
And by giving it the big launch hype, putting
the Google stamp on it, the inevitable problems,

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:56.220
the same problems we had had when we launched,
but we were able to pivot because we had a

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.940
pathetically small number of customers and
no one had ever heard of us.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:02.420
That's a huge asset. It's actually a relief.
'Cause it means you can screw up. Nobody knows.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:06.780
Nobody cares. Obscurity is a benefit. By putting
the Google name on it, by claiming it was

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.250
the next big thing, Google put that team,
I assume, in a position where there was no

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:14.220
way for them to pivot. It became an embarrassment
to corporate, or somebody, and the thing got

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220
pulled.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.050
Now, [pause] that product could have pivoted.
It was a really good product. It had a lot

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:22.990
of really good things about it. There was
no physical reason why it couldn't pivot.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:27.740
But two million dollars, two years and millions
of dollars in, with all these expectations

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:33.170
and the Google name, I can't imagine the pressure
they were under. I felt bad.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:37.390
So, the right question is, what could Google
have done to build that same product and put

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:42.100
it in a position where it could have pivoted?
I actually think that leadership in today's

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:47.370
economy means creating platforms for experimentation
for your teams.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:50.980
I borrow that phrase from Scott Cooks, founder
of Intuit, who's been a big doctor of Lean

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:51.980
Startup.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:55.400
So if you want to be a general manager in
a big company like Google and you want Google

00:53:55.400 --> 00:54:00.130
to be more entrepreneurial, my point of view
is it's on you, not on your team, on you to

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:02.780
give them a safe sandbox for experimentation.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:07.600
So for a risky new product, do not, I would
never put the Google brand name on it. For

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.710
shame.

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:13.061
And I would never talk to the press about
it at all, if you can avoid it. And I would

00:54:13.061 --> 00:54:17.420
try to have it have as small a number of customers
as humanly possible while still doing that

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.550
innovation accounting.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.740
Then, teams will pivot just fine. Nothing
wrong with Googlers. It's a management problem.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.740
In my humble opinion. Yes.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.620
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: So let me follow
up with that directly.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: OK.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:34.251
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Let's say you write
a new mobile application and you post it to

00:54:34.251 --> 00:54:35.251
the--

00:54:35.251 --> 00:54:36.251
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Hypothetically speaking.

00:54:36.251 --> 00:54:38.700
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Yeah, yeah. The
app store or the market. If you do that at

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.010
Google, with the Google name in a blog post,
you'll get a hundred thousand downloads no

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:43.010
matter what it is.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:44.010
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Yeah.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.160
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: It can be almost
anything. But it's true. And by virtue of

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.230
that, you are now, when people browse to categories,
shopping, personal finance?

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.760
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: You'll be number one.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.370
&gt;&gt;Male Audience member #6: you will be up
there. You will have that visibility and those

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:56.640
will lead to clicks and you will be featured.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:00.910
And you will jump start in a way that you
can't do if you're nobody and you put up an

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.980
app out there. You may very well just be in
the noise and you'll never break out of that

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.240
no matter how great the product is.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.841
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Right.

00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:10.610
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: So, I mean having
done this twice--

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:14.220
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Entrepreneurs never ask hypothetical
questions, by the way. So I understand.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.220
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Yeah. Yeah. So
I can tell you there's real value. I mean,

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.360
I know the successes that I've had are in
large part because of having that name attached

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360
to it.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.140
And that initial jumpfrog, the initial leapfrog
made up for, was market that I couldn't have

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.140
bought.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:34.340
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Yeah, look, you get free marketing,
but so what? Free marketing is worth so much

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.941
less than we think. Like, yes, that accelerated
your process of success, but only because

00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:40.300
you had the right product and it worked for
your customers.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:44.930
So putting rocket fuel into a rocket that
has problems with it is not a good idea, right?

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:49.310
You accelerate too fast. The thing blows up.
Now, sometimes you achieve liftoff because

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:52.680
you actually do have the right product.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.610
But marketing, marketing dollars are not as
hard to come by as they used to be. The really

00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:01.030
great products today have an engine of growth
that allows them to grow organically anyway.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:04.811
So, yes. Google has huge advantages of putting
their brand name on it. It can get you a lot

00:56:04.811 --> 00:56:08.760
of downloads. But also, there's a huge liability
about that because--

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.470
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: Well, that's a
good question then. So why is it not OK for

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.119
Google to fail? Why not take risks and just
fall on your face?

00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:16.119
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Listen.

00:56:16.119 --> 00:56:17.119
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: and admit it quickly
and move on?

00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:20.710
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: If it was me, I would be celebrating
failures and I would make those people heroes.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.510
If it was up to me, but that's the culture
that I live in now.

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:27.830
But see, failure is not what we want to celebrate.
We wanna celebrate successful pivots away

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:31.430
from failure. And that's challenging because
it's easy.

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:36.980
If you're charismatic, you can get resources
for anything and you can ship stuff and get

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.170
people to use it and then you can engage in
a ton of what I call "Success Theater", to

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:45.160
try to make it seem like you're a big success.
And so, those people tend to get the celebrations,

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:49.530
whether they actually add any value or not.
They're like a cancer on most organizations,

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.810
in my opinion.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.950
But what do we do instead? We don't want to
celebrate those people. We don't wanna just

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:58.869
celebrate people who fail because they accomplished
nothing. So we have to have a system for evaluating

00:56:58.869 --> 00:57:02.850
which failures were actually instructive and
then we have to celebrate the learning and

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.530
what the learning turned into in the next
try.

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:09.520
So yeah, if Google corporate was fine with
people failing and having the Google name

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.440
be associated with nasty stuff, that'd be
fine. But I just think that's unrealistic.

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.440
I mean, I wouldn't be that comfortable.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.460
If I was Google, I would be launching those
things under a different brand name altogether.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:22.850
I wouldn't tell anybody that they're made
by Google until they're actually proven to

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:23.850
be viable.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:27.320
How do you think Apple does it. The stuff
that we all consume and wait in line for,

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.540
we're the first people -- the first person
who buys an iPad at the Apple store is the

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.520
first person to have used the iPad? Come on.
That's my humble opinion. Helpful?

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.040
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: I didn't follow
the last line.

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.720
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Then maybe I shouldnâ€™t have
said it.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.720
[laughter]

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.760
Cancel that. I do think giving teams a platform
for experimentation, having clear analytics

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:51.190
for testing whether they're making progress
or not, and celebrating pivots is the answer.

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:52.190
Whatever Apple does, who knows?

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:53.270
&gt;&gt;Thomas Sharon: All right. Last question.

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:54.270
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Make it count.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:59.020
&gt;&gt;Thomas Sharon: Or this was the last question.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:06.280
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Too much pressure? It's a Google-branded
official question. It's going on the internet.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.280
[pause]

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280
&gt;&gt;Thomas Sharon: All right then.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.280
&gt;&gt;Eric Ries: Ok, thank you all very much.
I appreciate it.

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:09.281
[applause]
