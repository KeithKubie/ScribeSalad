00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.044
DANNY (VOICEOVER): A few
months back, we got a really

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:04.254
special bike in the shop.

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.798
It's a 1957
Harley-Davidson Panhead

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:10.760
prototype, made by famous
customizers, S&amp;S Cycles.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.929
This baby hadn't been
started in 20 years,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.766
and getting her up and
running wasn't easy.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.602
If anybody was up to the
task, it's my man, Shannon.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.522
We completely restored and
repainted this beautiful piece

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.149
of history.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.568
And she looks better than
new, if I do say so myself.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.652
DANNY: What's up?

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.404
EARNEST: There's
the man himself.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:30.697
DANNY (VOICEOVER): Earnest is
here today with his son-in-law,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.115
Rex, to pick this bike up.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.742
And he's sure been
through a lot in his life,

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.785
and I'm hoping that
today, we can make things

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.370
a little bit better for him.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.789
DANNY: Rex, you
brought us this bike.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:40.957
Heck yeah.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.375
Why did you bring it to us?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.461
Because we heard
you're the best there is.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.420
That's what I like to hear.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.088
That's what I like to hear.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:50.383
Ernest, let me ask you, man,
when did you buy this bike?

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:51.760
1977.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.678
This bike has history.

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:54.846
And it's beautiful.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.014
It's beautiful.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.182
It's beautiful.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.600
You want to see your bike?
- Yeah!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.059
He can't wait to get his bike.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.644
Come here, come
here, come here.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.772
Just hang out right here.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:05.231
Shannon!

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.733
Come on, man.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.943
Bring out that Panhead.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.404
[engine revving]

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.489
You hear that?

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.782
That's your bike.
- No way.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.330
Aw, man!
[horn beeps]

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.331
Aw, you Did it.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.333
Yeah.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.084
Oh my god.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.086
DANNY (VOICEOVER): We wanted
to keep this historic prototype

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.589
as original as possible,
but she desperately needed

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.132
a tune-up from head to toe.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.092
Shannon worked his magic
and got her running

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.595
again while preserving the
original engine, front-end,

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.138
and seat.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.390
He also painstakingly
fabricated a brand new rear

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.184
fender to match the original.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.187
Then Ryan topped her off with
a beautiful new paint job,

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:47.398
using a candy apple red with
gold leafing, not to mention

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:50.151
the stunning portrait of
Ernest's beloved Betty,

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:54.864
so that he could always take
her memory along for the ride.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.199
EARNEST: Oh, you
guys are awesome!

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.408
DANNY: Look at this.
Look at this.

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.118
Come on, man.
- It's so great.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.079
You brought to
us what I consider

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.706
a historically-significant
motorcycle.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.876
This is what I would call
a mule bike, test bike.

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:11.047
This bike had a lot of
first-off, prototype things

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.423
that S&amp;S did.

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:15.927
Shannon made sure
that the integrity

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:19.222
of the history of this
motorcycle was kept intact.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.057
SHANNON: The sheet metal
is original, Earnest,

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.392
except for the rear fender.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.269
I had to build you
a new rear fender.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.104
Around the light is all steel.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.481
There's no there's
no Bondo fixed up.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.941
That came out beautiful.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.693
And here's the
thing about the seat.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:34.737
There was something about
that seat that said,

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.489
there's history here.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.157
There's importance here.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:41.035
So the bike is brand new,
but the seat tells the story.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.662
Yeah.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.789
George Smith at S&amp;S, they
wanted to buy the bike back.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.041
I said, call this guy, not me.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.544
But they did give me a
brand new S&amp;S carburetor,

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.045
so that's what's on your bike.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:52.964
So that's a brand new S&amp;S carb.

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.173
DANNY: Ryan, this paint.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.092
REX: That paint job
is just awesome.

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:57.051
God.

00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.261
Tell me about this, man.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.637
Ernie, when Rex
brought the bike in,

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.265
it had an old, faded,
candy paint job.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.892
It needed to be freshened up.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.602
And I needed a little class.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:07.645
And that's why I added the gold
leaf pin-striping on there.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.107
And of course, the
picture of Betty.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.108
That her?
- Oh my god.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.402
Yeah.
- Is it correct?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:19.866
All right.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.244
All right.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.746
[kiss]
- Yeah.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.247
Yeah.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.333
Is that what you
had in mind, Ernie?

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.669
DANNY: As you enjoy this
bike, as you ride this bike,

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.464
as you go out and
have fun on this bike.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.423
Bettie.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.008
She'll be with you.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.177
This bike obviously
means a lot to Ernest,

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.721
and I love being able to
take something like this back

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.431
to her former glory.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.476
I know after 20 years he
can't wait to hop on this baby

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.227
and take her for a ride.

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:51.356
I just got to say man, thank you
for bringing us this project.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.065
Gentlemen.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:52.982
Rex.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:53.775
Thank you.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.525
Thank you, my man.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.361
Thank you guys.
