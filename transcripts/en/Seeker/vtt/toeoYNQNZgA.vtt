00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.600
The ocean represents over 70% of the planet,
and understanding how the ocean is changing

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.740
under climate change is critically important
to understanding how we are going to affect

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.450
the future of humankind and the planet itself.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.210
The ocean's absorbed about 90 percent of the
heat that we've added to the earth from global

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210
warming.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.070
We really don't know what's going to happen
in the future, and that's the scariest thing.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.190
The variability of the temperature in the
data we're collecting can tell us about how

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.070
deeper water is mixing in the surf zone.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.470
That's really important to know if we want
to understand how climate change is going

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.120
to affect coastal communities.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.460
Tyler Cyronak is a science advisor for the
Smartfin project, a citizen science initiative

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.789
that is working with surfers to help gather
data on one of the biggest environmental problems

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.010
that we face today - global warming.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.890
Since the modern industrial revolution ocean
temperatures have risen by almost 1 degree

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.890
celsius.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.140
That might not sound like a lot but that’s
led to melting arctic ice, rising sea levels,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.780
decimated fish populations and the destruction
of coral reefs in coastal zones.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.790
We don't really have a great understanding
of how temperatures are changing in coastal

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.890
zones because it's quite difficult to measure
via satellite.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.170
And the data needed to help evaluate this
problem can’t be collected from shore, or

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.049
from deep ocean buoys either.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.110
But that’s where Smartfins come in.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.520
We don't have a tremendous amount of coastal
wave data from right where the waves are actually

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
breaking.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460
So we can start to fill that gap.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.470
The Smartfin is equipped with sensors and
it fits onto a regular surfboard.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.340
Right now the device measures ocean temperature,
motion, and location data; but it’s hoped

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.939
it will eventually collect pH, acidification,
salinity and water quality data as well.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.610
Because the coastal zone is teeming with life,
this data will be vital to understanding how

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.100
rising temperatures are affecting sensitive
ocean habitats.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.579
The really cool thing about Smartfin is that
it's a citizen science project.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.280
It’s working with communities to get a better
understanding of ocean health.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.260
We're not trying to create a Fitbit for the
oceans or for surfers.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.680
We're trying to create a true research and
communication tool.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.540
Plus, the 50 surfer scientists using the smartfin
to collect data are stoked to be helping save

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850
the oceans they love.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.569
And some of the data they’ve already collected
is surprising.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.340
I don't think I was expecting to see so much
variability in the temperature of the surf

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
zone.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.849
Inherently, we knew this already, being surfers.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.510
You're out there and while you're surfing
you can feel warm and cold patches, but to

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.349
see that it's actually varying by three or
four degrees in just a very small amount of

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.590
space is pretty interesting.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.901
What’s more, using the fin is simple.

00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:55.290
Just replace your board’s fin, turn it on
and paddle out.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.051
Then after your surf session, the data is
easily uploaded to the cloud.

00:03:00.051 --> 00:03:04.209
And one thing that its makers want to be clear
about, the Smartfin will not stop you from

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.550
catching the perfect wave.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.050
Just by being in the water all a surfer has
to do is keep the thing charged and go surf;

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.599
and they’ll going to be out in the water
anyway so why not collect a little data while

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.140
they’re at it.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.450
But the project is so much bigger than just
catching waves and collecting data.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.330
Surfers represent a unique angle to talk about
climate change.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.780
We want to tap into that and come together
as a community and discuss why it’s important

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.030
for us to care about the oceans and why climate
change is a big deal.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:54.370
We need to add some hope to that conversation,
and hopefully the surf 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.950
community can do that.
