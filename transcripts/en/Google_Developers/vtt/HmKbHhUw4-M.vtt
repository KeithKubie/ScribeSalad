ROSE ROBINSON: My
name is Rose Robinson.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.830
I work for Anita Borg Institute,
and our community is Systers--

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.320
S-Y-S-T-E-R-S. Systers
is a community for women

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.890
in computing.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.350
It was started in 1987, and
we're 26 year strong this year.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.640
And we have about 4,400
plus women across the world.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.940
So we have a lot of women
who are various computing

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.010
disciplines.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.170
But we're really there
just to support each other,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.940
help each other through
careers, life challenges,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.760
professional decisions,
just much more.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.890
Our students
actually are Systers,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.070
so we reach out to all of
our Systers in the community.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.280
And our main goal is actually
to do some outreach for women.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.790
We want women to be exposed
more in open source.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.830
So we had about six Systers
and students this year

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.120
that started out with
just maybe 15 applicants,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.470
but we actually had six
Systers that we're actually

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.240
in the program.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.190
My actual role was org admin,
and I was also a mentor.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.590
My student was Julia
Proft, and she was actually

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.030
out of Connecticut College.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.220
She was very nervous about
entering into this program

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.460
because she felt that it
was overwhelmed for her,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.140
and she didn't have
the Python skills.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.370
But I have to tell you by the
end of the summer program,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.980
she was very, very
good in Python

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.360
and delivered some awesome work.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.700
She worked on an admin
feature, where she actually

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.060
changed some of
our user interface

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.380
for our request to
join our community.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.880
It's very cumbersome.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.310
So she actually did a
lot of database changes,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.376
a lot of UI design--
fantastic job.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:01.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Google Summer
of Code this year, for me,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.080
was my first time as a mentor.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.010
I was a student last year, and
I was way more nervous this year

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.300
than I was last year.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.229
But my student was amazing.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.570
She was really smart.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.930
And everything was
just perfect with her.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.150
She worked on
creating some scripts

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.510
for reporting about
our mailing list,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.750
because we have more than one.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.130
And all of the moderators
want some statistics,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.740
and so will our
administrator, Rose.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.396
So we worked on that together.

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:33.520
Well, she did all the work.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.600
I was just mentoring,
and it was just perfect.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.060
ROSE ROBINSON: I think I'd love
to see Systers more engaged

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.790
in some of the projects here.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.440
We had a couple of
Systers that were

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.630
accepted into two programs.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.860
And it was our mission to really
get our Systers more exposed

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.530
to more open source projects.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.320
So it was perfectly
fine for us that they

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.380
were exposed and getting
engaged with other open source

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.810
projects.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.820
I think what we will do
next year is actually just

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.720
inform our community of
what other open source

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.780
projects there are.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.770
We found an incredible amount
of just science projects,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.330
humanitarian projects, a
lot of server projects,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.550
which were really cool
because a lot of Systers

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.110
are actually into those
type of technologies.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.160
So I think they would
be very excited to see

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.345
that for next year.

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:29.570
If someone wants to get
involved with Systers,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:37.710
they can visit systers.org--
S-Y-S-T-E-R-S dot O-R-G.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.070
That is actually our front
page of our communities.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.380
We have a lot of sub
communities, as well,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.740
that are culturally driven
as well as technology driven.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.430
So we do have a FOS
community, entrepreneurs.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.350
And that's one way to
actually join our Systers.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.540
And the one engagement that
we have from a community

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.810
standpoint is just
communicating with each other

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.680
and helping each other through
a lot of the technology

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.190
challenges.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.950
So we do have a techtalk
community, and that

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.720
helps with different
projects, things

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.279
that they're getting stuck on,
or need a little bit of help

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.570
on, or a little boost.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.110
I've actually been a Syster
for 13 years now-- since 2000.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.380
And I believe, if my
memory serves me correctly

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.900
that we started GSoC 2007.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.660
And that was started by Robin
Jeffries and Jenn Redman.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.330
So we've been part
of the GSoC community

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.400
and family for a few years now.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000
This is my first year
as organizational admin

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.890
as well as a mentor.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.200
So I've been involved in Python
and a lot of other open source

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.790
projects, particularly
with Mailman as well.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.990
So it was a learning
experience for me, as well,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.440
but also is very gratifying.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is my
second year as part of Systers.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.260
Last year, I was a
student with them.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.080
That's how I met them--
through a Summer of Code.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.010
And this year I was a mentor.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.820
And I think being a student is
way easier than being a mentor

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.020
because you don't have any--
I mean, you just have to work.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.870
And being a mentor, you
have to be a role model.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.010
But that's really
cool at the same time.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.920
So I can't wait for next year.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.760
And we hope to get is some
very good features on next year

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.224
with the students and
just keep growing.

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:43.640
ROSE ROBINSON: I think what I
would love to see next year,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.223
and hopefully we can
make this happen,

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:49.760
is to do some collaboration
with other projects here.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.560
I'd love to see
Systers get involved

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.030
with some of the
science open source,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.470
humanitarian open source
projects is always great.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.550
A lot of educators
in our communities,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.950
so I am so looking
forward to them

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.660
getting involved with some of
the gaming for the students,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.770
because overall, I think we
can take away from all of this,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.050
as well, and learn and
how we can actually

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.450
help the next generation
of Systers as well.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.330
I'm hopeful because
I'm also a mother.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.370
I'm a mother to a
daughter and also a son.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.680
So I want to teach both of
them that it is very perfectly

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.360
OK to see women in our roles.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.100
As a daughter, I want
her to actually pursue

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.190
any type of technology
that she can,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.750
because every technology
will touch every industry,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.810
whatever we're doing.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.170
But as my son, as well, I
want him to be very inviting

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:51.320
and help change that environment
and just make it more open.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.580
I think the next
generation is actually

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.550
going to be very awesome.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.490
I think there's a lot of
change in that right now,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.320
but I think that
next generation's

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.030
going to be really cool to bring
up-- have that open next year.
