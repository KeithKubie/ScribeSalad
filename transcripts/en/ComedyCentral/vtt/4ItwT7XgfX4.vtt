- And out of those 30 people,

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:08.674
4 of them were gangbangers.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.242
Yeah, real gangbangers.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.611
Like the type
of guys that generally

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.013
don't leave their
neighborhood and...

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.548
like, yeah,
and you'll know where they live

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.716
when they shoot you, like,
"4th Street, bitch! Di--"

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.018
Like, you felt it.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:22.188
<i> [dark electronic music]</i>

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:56.723
[cheers and applause]

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.891
- Hello, everybody,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.092
welcome to
"This Is Not Happening."

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.559
I'm your host Ari Shaffir,

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.795
and today, all the stories
are about nostalgia.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.565
[cheers and applause]

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.634
You guys, I'm so excited
to bring this next comic up.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:08.968
I'm super, super excited.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.636
We started together
at the Comedy Store

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.438
like, fucking 15, 16 years ago.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.174
He's been one of my best friends
my entire time here in L.A.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.076
He's got an amazing
podcast called,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.011
"Good Times:
With Steve Simeone."

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.947
Please give it up
for my friend and yours,

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.115
<i> Mr. Steve Simeone.
 Let him hear it!</i>

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.285
[cheers and applause]

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:28.588
- I remember being
about eight years old,

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:31.357
and I'm at my
family dinner table,

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.759
and for the first time
I'm staring at the craziness

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.261
that is my family.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.430
I'm starting to get old enough,
like, "Is this normal?"

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.031
Like, people will laugh,
then they'll get angry.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.766
And my dad will be like,
"Did he say what?"

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.434
And my Dad's laughing, then he
pushes away from the table.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.303
"I got agita, babe,
make the kids shut up!"

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.773
And she was like, "You were just
laughing two seconds ago."

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.274
"Fine, I'm not gonna eat."

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.544
And I'm like, "What's going on
with this house?

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.347
These people are crazy."

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.316
So I'm staring at my family,
and I felt this voice,

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.485
like, this calmness
come over me.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.454
And, uh...
I think the voice was God.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:05.024
I'm not telling anybody
what to believe,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.459
so if you believe in God,
then this was God.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.363
If you believe in energy
and the universe or whatever,

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.998
then energy told me this.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.666
If you believe in nothing,
then fuck it,

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.068
nothing told me this, okay?

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.671
So I'm eight years old
and I'm watching all of this,

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.906
and I just have this feeling,
this voice tells me,

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.675
"Remember this
for when you get sad."

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.745
And I'm like,
"Get sad? I'm eight, bro.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.246
"Friday's pizza day.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.314
We got a field trip on Tuesday.
Ooh-ooh!"

00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:31.317
Life is good when you're a kid.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.686
Right, life is good
when you're a kid.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.689
But then I became a grown-up,
and I was sad all the time.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.825
I was, and then I was like,
"You know what'll solve this?

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.861
I'm gonna move to Los Angeles."

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.663
[laughter]

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.932
Right, I was like, "I have to
prove to the world I'm special,"

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:50.603
so then I moved here and I was,
like, suicidal for a while.

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:52.171
[laughter]

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.906
So, uh...

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.775
I wish that was a joke.

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.010
[laughter]

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.345
So I'd been doing comedy
for a while.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:02.515
I was about ten years into it.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.952
And I had the type of act
that was, like, fun.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.588
Like, people would like it,
but it wasn't really--

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:10.122
it didn't really come
from an honest place.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.557
You ever watch comedy sometimes,

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.526
and you kind of tell
the comedian's lying.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.596
When they're like, "You know,
my girlfriend sure is crazy!"

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:17.864
[laughter]

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.198
And the audience is like,

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.368
"I bet she is!
He's gonna tell us!"

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.704
So that's kind of like--I would,
like, walk out on stage

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.572
like all high energy,
like, "Who's wasted?"

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.441
And the audience would be like,
"We are!"

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:30.810
And I'd be like, "Me too,
look how small my wiener is."

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.113
And they'd be like,
"Oh, my God. This guy's great!"

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:37.250
[laughter]

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.654
I'm so embarrassed now.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.623
[laughter]

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.393
But the thing was that
no matter how well I did,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.495
nobody would remember it.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.730
Like, I would--there were times
I would lit--I would get--

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.565
I remember once getting
a standing ovation,

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:55.134
and then, like, after the show,
I was like,

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:56.802
"People are gonna want
to hang out with me."

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.072
And they were like...they didn't
even remember my name.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.240
They were just like, "Oh,
that one guy was all right."

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.777
And I'm like, "Okay."

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:06.445
So...I guess about,

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:08.814
I don't know,
it was about ten years in,

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:12.518
I started to switch up my style
of comedy a little bit.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:17.290
I started--
'cause I was so sad...

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.358
thinking back to my childhood
made me happy,

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:22.328
'cause I really couldn't see...

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:24.663
I couldn't see too much
happiness in the now.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:28.133
So I had to look at
how happy I was yesterday,

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:29.869
and something cool
started to happen.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.169
I started to...

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.771
I don't know, retrain my brain?

00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:34.673
Like, if you could see something
awesome when you were eight,

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:37.376
if you have those memories,
look for something awesome now.

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:39.378
So I started to tell
those stories on stage

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:40.847
just because
they made me feel good.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.348
But then it started
to make audiences feel good,

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:45.852
and people would relate to it.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.386
It was the craziest thing.

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.720
People I didn't think would,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.456
like, everybody's
got crazy stories.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.458
Like, somebody would be waiting
for me after a show,

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.792
and they'd want
to tell me, like,

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.661
"Dude, one time we had
my brother tied up.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.663
"We're pouring gasoline on
him--soon as my Dad comes in--

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:58.664
it was fucking awesome."

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.799
Like, everybody
had these crazy stories.

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:03.202
Like, I remember, like, once--
like,

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:05.871
I remember, like, kids, like,
17 years old,

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.306
they're like,
"Do you remember this?"

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:08.640
I'm like, "No, I'm old, dude."

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.376
They're like,
"But it was awesome."

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:11.811
I remember being in, like,
Afghanistan, and these guys

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.211
I thought were
the sons of anarchy,

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.413
they were special forces guys.

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:15.480
They were like,
"You were awesome!"

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.816
And they wanted to tell stories.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.518
Once I was in Santa Monica,
I'm not--

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.319
there was this man
that was so old.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.821
He came out of the crowd.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.091
I thought he was like
a time-traveler or an angel.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.694
He was like,
"You were wonderful!"

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:30.229
I thought he was
gonna give me, like,

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.232
a magic power or something.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:37.169
So, anyway,
about five years ago, maybe six,

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.604
there was a hot summer night.

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.606
It was a night just like
tonight in the Comedy Store

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.776
down on Sunset Strip,
and comedy wasn't cool then.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:46.178
We only had about 30 people
in the room,

00:05:46.178 --> 00:05:50.883
and out of those 30 people,
4 of them were gangbangers.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:51.884
Yeah.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.885
Real gangbangers, not, like,

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.287
the fake guys that are, like,

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:57.356
trying to look tough
for girls or sell drugs

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.191
and intimidate people, like, no.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:00.960
The real deal,
like the type of guys

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.029
that generally don't leave their
neighborhood and--like, yeah.

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.299
And you'll know where they live
when they shoot you,

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:08.967
like, "4th Street, bitch! Di--"
Like, you felt it.

00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:11.370
What I'm saying is some people
have to talk about it,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.871
no these guys are about--
you feel it.

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:14.707
When they walked in the room,
they changed the energy.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.575
Like, if you've ever seen
"Breaking Bad,"

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:18.878
the two brothers that came over
the border--imagine--

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.912
remember the guy, and he had
his legs chopped off.

00:06:20.912 --> 00:06:22.548
He's like, "You're not
stopping me, bitch."

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.383
Imagine four of those guys.

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:27.720
Four killers are walking
into the room

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.823
with tattoos on their faces and
their heads, and they're like,

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:33.559
"Let's have a night of laughs
on the Sunset Strip."

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.428
I don't know why they were
there, to be honest.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.062
I think maybe
'cause one guy got out of jail,

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.830
and they were like,
"Larry, what do you want to do?"

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.166
"I don't know
let's have some laughs!"

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.002
Right, so...

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:46.973
So about right there there's
four assassins at a table,

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:50.409
and they are a delightful crowd
for the first hour of the show.

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.910
They're having fun.
They're clapping.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.014
Very respectful,
but they keep on drinking.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.415
And as the drunker they get,

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:58.151
a little more
out of line they get.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:00.586
And I remember the one guy
yells out, he's like,

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.588
"Get off the stage, puto.
You suck!"

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.756
And the manager hears this,
and he goes over hard,

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:06.426
and it's dark in there, okay?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.960
So the manager hears,
"Get off the stage, puto."

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.762
And the manager goes,
"'Excuse me--

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.964
"'can I buy you fellas another
round of drinks?'

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.499
"Holy shit,
I'm not getting stabbed

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.269
for 12 bucks an hour, okay?"

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:20.273
So now, it's like...

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.207
So now these guys
are getting drunker,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:23.809
nobody's doing anything, okay?

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.043
So all--

00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:26.946
I'm about to go on, or whatever,

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.614
it's like me
and two other comics,

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.148
and I remember, I forget
who it was, they were like,

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:31.817
"Dude, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go on?"

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.353
And I'm like,
"I need the $15, okay?"

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:38.290
So...I'm in my--
[laughing]

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.292
Dude, it's tough enough for me
to go on late at night.

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:44.296
All my jokes are about, like,
pizza day and building forts

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.465
and staying awake till midnight,
right?

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.168
So now I--I'm like, what am I
gonna do with these four guys

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:51.336
in the crowd that are booing
people off the stage?

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.505
So I just walk up,
and I'm just like,

00:07:53.505 --> 00:07:55.474
I start to talk about pizza day,

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:57.309
and I'm like,
"Mother effin' pizza day."

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.078
The one dude stands up,
and he goes,

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.146
"Mother effin' pizza day!"

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:02.314
And I'm like, "Awesome!"

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:03.515
I'm like, "This is great."

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:04.716
We're connecting, right?

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:06.418
So now everybody's having fun.

00:08:06.418 --> 00:08:08.420
Like, everybody in the crowd's
starting to have more fun.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.721
And there's something great

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:11.323
that can happen
only in a live audience

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:13.492
where you can sort of create in
the moment, and it was magical,

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.227
and I remember thinking,
you know what,

00:08:15.227 --> 00:08:17.763
you don't need $1 million
to create memories.

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.166
In fact, if you have kids at
home, tonight, on your way home,

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.436
stop off, get ice cream,
hot fudge, whip cream,

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.539
some little sprinkle-y things,
make sundaes.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:30.075
Make real, legit, rich kid
birthday party sundaes.

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.178
Put them in the kitchen,
turn out the light,

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.512
then go wake your kids up.

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:35.347
They'll be like,
"What's happening?

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:37.382
Is the house on fire?"

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:39.018
Go, "I don't know, buddy..."

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.853
[laughter]

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.255
[applause]

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:45.924
"But there's something
in the kitchen for you."

00:08:45.924 --> 00:08:48.293
Walk him into the kitchen,
turn on the light, and be like,

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.028
"We got ice cream, bitches!"

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:53.699
With this the four
gang members stand up.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.036
They start laughing like
it's 1994 and I'm Chris Tucker.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.538
The one dude goes,
"Mother effin' ice cream!"

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:01.706
He starts kicking his foot
like in "Fat Albert"

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:03.109
when Weird Harold's
kicking his foot, like,

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:05.377
[as Weird Harold]
"You're like school

00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:07.713
in the summertime: no class."

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.549
They start laughing
so hard, right?

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:11.750
And I'm like, "This is awesome,"

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.319
but then they keep on laughing.

00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:15.921
And around the same time
it occurs to me,

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:18.156
it occurs to everybody else
in the room

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.760
that that's not a genuine laugh.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.394
That that's, like,
a heckle-laugh.

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:24.497
Like, the next gen--like, it was
around the time when people

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:28.500
started to be like,
"Cool story, bro."

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.135
So now it's palpable.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:32.905
Everybody's like, "Oh,
what's this poor kid gonna do?"

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.940
They're like,
"Ha, ha, very funny. Ice cream.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.109
Yeah, I'm gonna make sundaes
on the way home."

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:40.412
At least that's how I'm hearing
it in my brain, okay?

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.915
So I remember right here
there was a couple,

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.750
and I remember the husband's
dragging the wife's hand.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.018
He's like,
"Let's get out of here."

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.919
She goes,
"We have to pay our check."

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.522
He's like, "Fuck it. We don't
want to be witnesses."

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.123
And they just left.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.658
That happened.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:53.993
So now I'm scared, okay?

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:55.860
The next comedian goes up,
and he goes,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.429
"You got to get out of here."

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:59.598
I'm like, "I know, but I got
to walk by their table,"

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.099
'cause they're in the back
of the room,

00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:02.767
and I'm, like, going
Do I--what do I do?

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.438
Like, if I stare at them
and not act afraid,

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.872
they might think
that's aggressive.

00:10:06.872 --> 00:10:08.874
They might just beat me up
for staring at them.

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.342
But then I'm like,
if I look away,

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:11.443
they might think I'm a bitch

00:10:11.443 --> 00:10:12.611
and beat me up on principle.

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:13.979
So I'm like--right?

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:15.714
So I'm like,
"What am I gonna do?"

00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:17.450
And I'm thinking,
I'm like, you know what?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.518
'You don't start no shit,
it won't be no shit.'

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.620
Just hold your head up,
mind your business.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.657
So I start walking,
and I feel--poom poom!

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.692
As I'm leaving the room,
I feel two dudes get up,

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.460
and I'm like,
"This is not good."

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.362
And my legs are starting
to go weak, okay?

00:10:30.362 --> 00:10:32.130
I'm not making--
I'm like, "I'm gonna die.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.900
"I'm just trying to bring joy
into the world for $15.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.802
"And I'm gonna wind up stabbed
3,000 miles

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.137
away from my family," right?

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:39.638
So I'm like,
"Just get to your car.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.240
Just get to your car."

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.841
My car's blocked in,
and the whole time I'm hearing,

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:44.576
"Hey, bro!
Hey, dude!"

00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:46.145
And now I have nowhere
else to go.

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.147
So I just turn around
and he goes, "Hey, dude."

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.815
And I turn around
and I'm like...

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:52.084
And he goes, "Were you the fool
that was just on stage?"

00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:53.252
And I went, "Yeah."

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.987
And he went "Mother effin'
ice cream!"

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.189
And came over and hugged me,
okay?

00:10:57.189 --> 00:11:00.159
[cheers and applause]

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.831
t gets so much better,

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.700
'cause now he's calling
for his buddies, like,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.201
"Hey, Larry, get over here.
He's cool.

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.737
I told you he'd be cool.
Larry, get over here."

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.272
Now this guy's name
was not Larry,

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:17.843
but I'm not sharing with America
his real name, okay?

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.846
'Cause there could be
repercussions.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.682
Okay, so this guy,
Larry, is menacing,

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.218
but he's got the energy
of a small child,

00:11:26.218 --> 00:11:27.853
'cause he's afraid
to talk to me.

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.221
He's not even making
eye contact.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.923
He's just going,
"Bro, you were so funny.

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.558
"I loved it.
I needed to hear that, bro.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.560
You just made me feel good.
Thank you."

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.462
So now I realize I have
to talk to this guy

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:38.797
like he's one of my nephews.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:42.601
And I'm like, "Hey, buddy.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.236
I like your shoes."

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.371
And he's like, "They're Nikes.
I just got them!"

00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:48.040
I'm like, "They're awesome."

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.943
[laughter]

00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:55.747
So now the first guy
on the scene was like,

00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:57.949
"Larry, tell him
the joke you wrote him."

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:59.884
And I'm like, in my brain--
and he was like,

00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:01.453
"No, he'll think it's stupid."

00:12:01.453 --> 00:12:03.388
And he's like, "No, tell him.
He wrote you a joke."

00:12:03.388 --> 00:12:05.223
And I'm like,
"Oh, that's great."

00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:07.259
And Larry's going,
"No, he's not gonna laugh."

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.927
I'm like, "Trust me, dude.

00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:11.430
I'm gonna laugh regardless
of how funny I think this is."

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.767
Right?

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:17.503
But honestly I'm going,
"What kind of joke

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.238
could this guy write me?"

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.106
Right, like, "Don't you hate it
when you're on a drive-by

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:22.608
"and blood gets
everywhere so you

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.309
"got to take your shirt
and burn it.

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:27.346
You can't have that DNA around.
It's a new shirt, right?"

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:31.150
So...

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.418
So, I remember going,
"Dude, what--what do you--"

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:36.355
He goes, "I think you should do
a joke about balloons."

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:37.823
And I'm just like, "What?"

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.124
He goes, "I think you should do
a joke about balloons."

00:12:39.124 --> 00:12:40.960
And I'm like,
"What do you mean?"

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.627
He goes, "You remember when you
were little, you had a balloon

00:12:42.627 --> 00:12:44.263
"you could play with
for hours?

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.098
"Like, you would hit it once and
then your brother would hit it.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.799
"And he would hit it, then you
would hit and he would hit it,

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:49.467
"but if it hit the ground...
[explosion sound]

00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:51.303
it could explode."

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.638
Okay, so that's when I started
to calm down, right?

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:56.308
And I'm like, "That's a great
joke, and I should use it,"

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:58.110
and I had a sense of peace.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.548
First time the whole night
I'm like, "I'm gonna be okay."

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.349
And it's not like
I heard a voice,

00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:07.786
I just got this feeling that
I do believe was God again.

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.622
'Cause he was like,

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.723
"What do you learn tonight
about judging other people?"

00:13:11.723 --> 00:13:13.458
And I'm like, "What?"

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:15.894
And I felt this thing that,
I don't know, changed my life.

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:17.829
I think as a society,

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:19.964
we're really good
at judging each other

00:13:19.964 --> 00:13:21.133
instead of loving each other,

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.001
and if you look
at the world now,

00:13:23.001 --> 00:13:26.038
never in my life
has it been so segmented.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.672
Everybody's
at each other's throats.

00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:28.807
Like, If you just walk
down the street

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:30.142
and smile, people are like,

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.510
"Look at that prick.
I wish he was dead."

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.145
Everybody's so angry.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.347
Right? Old people
versus young people.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.216
Rich versus poor,
black versus white,

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.517
gay versus straight.

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.318
Everybody's judging,
judging, judging, judging.

00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:42.054
When deep inside,
we're just little kids

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:44.055
that just want to hang out,
love, have some laughs.

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:45.424
And here's the great thing:

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.992
the less you judge
and the more you love,

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.227
you'll stop judging yourself

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.495
and you'll start loving
yourself,

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.495
and you'll be a source of

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:51.863
that happiness for other people.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.899
So that's what I'm here
to tell you.

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.667
Stop judging, start loving,

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:57.869
good night and God bless you.

00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:58.404
[cheers and applause]
