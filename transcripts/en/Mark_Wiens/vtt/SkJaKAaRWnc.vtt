00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.417
- The thickness of that meat
cannot be taken lightly.

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:07.584
That is just, it's almost
breathtakingly beautiful.

00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:15.212
I didn't actually need
teeth to bite through that.

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:17.083
I could've used pure gums.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.666
(upbeat music)

00:00:22.194 --> 00:00:24.120
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.364
with migrationology.com in New York City.

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:30.045
We are out this morning,
it's about 7:30 a.m.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.130
and we are gonna start this
morning with a monumental

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.213
place to eat.

00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:37.967
We're walking over to the subway station,

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.403
gonna head south to Lower Manhattan.

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:43.986
(upbeat music)

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:53.062
(speaks foreign language)

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:55.296
We ended up buying the
Metro Card which is a card

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:58.645
for the subway and then
you put credit on it.

00:00:58.645 --> 00:01:02.659
We are trying to figure
out the station now,

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.826
walking down to the train.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.806
We got off the metro at
2nd Ave and the restaurant

00:01:18.806 --> 00:01:21.290
should just be a short walk from here.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.533
I'm getting excited.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:26.925
The legendary, the historic,
the home of the ultimate

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:31.092
pastrami sandwich in New York
City, Katz's Delicatessen.

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:35.627
Though I have visited New
York City a couple of times,

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:38.566
this is gonna be my first
time to ever eat here.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.399
Hello.
- Here you go.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.897
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:45.732
- [Mark] We gotta keep this,
we gotta keep this, I think.

00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:47.596
What's the difference
between the Reuben pastrami

00:01:47.596 --> 00:01:49.184
and the pastrami sandwich.

00:01:49.184 --> 00:01:51.630
- [Man] It's just the
texture of the sandwich.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.983
We can make the Reuben with the pastrami,

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:58.290
and it comes with Russian
dressing, sauerkraut

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.439
and Swiss cheese.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.388
- It's just after 8 a.m.
right as they have opened

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.646
this morning, this is
the perfect time to come

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.841
because when you come
here later in the day,

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.713
it's normally just absolutely packed out

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:11.369
and you have to wait in line.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.472
Right at the entrance,
they give you tickets.

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:17.289
Then after that, I'm trying
to figure out the system,

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.958
but then you walk to one
of the bar counters here

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.572
and you place in your order.

00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:25.839
They have the menus up at
the top and so I have just

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.422
placed in my order.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.105
- This is Eli.
- And this is Eli.

00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:33.184
- His server.
- My server.

00:02:33.184 --> 00:02:34.681
- Gonna make him very happy.

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.092
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:38.317
- Everything's gonna be fantastic.

00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:40.817
- Thank you, man.
- No problem.

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.607
- Oh yeah.
- This is the corned beef.

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:45.913
- [Mark] Corned beef, okay.

00:02:45.913 --> 00:02:47.326
- [Eli] For my friend, what's your name?

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.493
- Mark.
- Mark.

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.357
This for you and your wife, Mark.

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:58.024
- Oh man, thank you.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.376
Eli has just sliced me a fresh
piece of the corned beef.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:11.672
Oh yeah.

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:17.176
It's tender, you can taste the saltiness

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:18.843
and the light spice.

00:03:22.773 --> 00:03:24.622
So what time does it start
to get really busy here?

00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:26.189
- About 10:30, 11 o'clock.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.823
Eat all of this, don't embarrass me.

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:28.990
- [Mark] Okay.

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:32.374
- Give some to your wife.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:35.124
(mumbles) table.

00:03:37.075 --> 00:03:40.890
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.250
- [Mark] This is the pastrami?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.250
- Yeah, man.

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:47.418
You guys know what you want?

00:03:47.418 --> 00:03:49.668
(laughing)

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.972
- Thank you.
- You and your wife.

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.389
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:59.415
- [Eli] Wait until you taste that.

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:00.959
You're gonna jump for joy.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.984
- It's time for my taste
of the pastrami now.

00:04:03.984 --> 00:04:07.817
You can see that ratio,
that outer crust edge,

00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:12.324
that pink interior with the fat.

00:04:12.324 --> 00:04:14.324
- [Eli] Fat, good stuff.

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:25.040
- That just melts in your mouth.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.957
Oh, Reuben.

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:29.215
That's insane.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:34.903
- You two slugs, get up here.

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:38.239
Gonna be a great day.

00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:50.329
- My joy and excitement right now is

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:52.734
at an unparalleled level.

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:56.380
I got my tray of food and
the main thing that I wanted,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.619
that I have to eat here,
that you have to eat here

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.578
when you come to this
restaurant is the pastrami.

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:04.574
You can either order just
the pastrami sandwich

00:05:04.574 --> 00:05:06.887
or you can order the
Reuben which is a sandwich

00:05:06.887 --> 00:05:08.754
that includes pastrami.

00:05:08.754 --> 00:05:11.104
I went with the Reuben
and it also includes

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.658
some Russian sauce, plus
sauerkraut and I think

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:15.990
there's some cheese on there as well.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.110
And then I also, I could not resist trying

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.129
the corned beef so I had
to a half of corned beef,

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.718
all on rye plus a side of
pickles plus a side of coleslaw.

00:05:26.718 --> 00:05:29.960
These are possibly the most beautifully

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.027
exploding meat sandwiches.

00:05:32.027 --> 00:05:34.490
This is the Reuben with pastrami.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.528
The ratio of meat to
bread is just an absolute

00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:41.210
sensational thing and
there's sauerkraut on here

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.217
and then that sauce and yeah,
and Eli really hooked it up

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:47.407
with the samples already
so I've already tasted

00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:51.157
the pastrami and it is
absolutely ridiculous.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.297
Look at this thing just steaming away.

00:05:56.417 --> 00:05:59.267
The thickness of that meat
cannot be taken lightly.

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:04.153
That is just, it's almost
breathtakingly beautiful.

00:06:04.153 --> 00:06:07.424
I am a big fan of taking big bites,

00:06:07.424 --> 00:06:10.757
but this is the next level of big bites.

00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:30.495
That'll just make you,
that is an eye closer.

00:06:31.362 --> 00:06:34.132
I didn't actually need
teeth to bite through that.

00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:36.280
I could've used pure gums.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.868
It's so tender, it's perfectly salted.

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:42.806
You can taste that peppery
crust on the outside

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:46.134
and then with the Russian
mustard I think is a little bit

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:49.424
sweet plus the cheese
and the sour crispness

00:06:49.424 --> 00:06:51.007
of that sauerkraut.

00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:06.184
What I love is that the juices and the fat

00:07:07.046 --> 00:07:10.806
of the pastrami have
soaked into the bread.

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:14.639
I probably have something
on my chin and lips.

00:07:16.182 --> 00:07:19.556
But when you hold the
bread on your fingers,

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:22.360
it's still dry on the
outside, but that fat

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.596
and that juice has made
like half of the bread

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.480
gooey and just full of juices.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.457
I might add some more mustard.

00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:33.682
There's no way I'm gonna lift the lid

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:37.737
on this sandwich, so I'm
just gonna put it on top.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:40.874
Oh yes, just look at the amount of cheese

00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:43.624
that's hanging out of it as well.

00:07:46.858 --> 00:07:50.568
The mustard is awesome, that
brings it to another level

00:07:50.568 --> 00:07:53.563
of flavor, it's a little
bit sour and you can taste

00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:55.896
that turmericy flavor to it.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.665
Halfway through my first half of sandwich,

00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:01.873
I think this would be an
appropriate time to take

00:08:01.873 --> 00:08:03.274
a bite of the pickle.

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:05.337
There's two different
types of pickles here.

00:08:05.337 --> 00:08:08.176
This one is more of a
green looking cucumber

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:11.026
and this one looks like
it's been brined for longer

00:08:11.026 --> 00:08:13.408
and I think that is the tomatillo.

00:08:13.408 --> 00:08:15.741
Maybe a green tomato pickle.

00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.206
I love pickles too.

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:26.121
It's salty, it's not sweet at all.

00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:28.538
This is just a kosher pickle.

00:08:34.126 --> 00:08:37.567
This one definitely has
more sour taste to it.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:39.578
It's been pickled for longer.

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:41.917
I'm gonna go ahead and move
over to the corned beef.

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:44.661
This one is just the corned
beef, it's a half a sandwich.

00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:49.563
You just have to admire how
many layers of corned beef

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:52.084
are in here, two, four, six, eight,

00:08:52.084 --> 00:08:56.251
at least 10 layers of meat
are filled into this sandwich.

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:13.084
The corned beef is awesome too.

00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:16.061
It's not as tender as the pastrami.

00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:19.730
Because it's corned beef, it
has that saltier flavor to it.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.532
Very good as well, but I
think I gotta give it up

00:09:22.532 --> 00:09:25.265
for that pastrami, it
just needs some mustard,

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.765
some more mustard.

00:09:32.035 --> 00:09:34.485
The meat goes so well
together with that mustard.

00:09:34.485 --> 00:09:36.886
We also got a side of coleslaw.

00:09:36.886 --> 00:09:39.053
Let me taste the coleslaw.

00:09:44.112 --> 00:09:48.279
A little bit sweet and tangy
and very creamy and milky,

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.677
and then the cabbage has a
very crisp texture to it.

00:09:54.858 --> 00:09:56.941
I gotta try this as well.

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:08.710
As soon as you bite that, you have to.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.154
It just explodes with juice
so you have to make sure

00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:13.276
you get all that juice.

00:10:13.276 --> 00:10:16.075
Has a wonderful garlicy taste to it

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:18.075
and then that's amazing.

00:10:19.158 --> 00:10:23.130
It's tart, it's nice and sour, it's salty,

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.713
it's garlicy and it's so juicy.

00:10:27.082 --> 00:10:32.034
The tenderness of that
pastrami cannot be exaggerated.

00:10:32.034 --> 00:10:35.236
You could use every
tender adjective possible

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:38.177
to describe that and you would
not be able to exaggerate

00:10:38.177 --> 00:10:42.796
how tender and how flavorful
and just how beautiful

00:10:42.796 --> 00:10:44.443
that pastrami meat was.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:46.368
That was insanely delicious.

00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:49.377
The corned beef was good but
the pastrami just blew it away.

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:52.282
That was definitely a lot of
meat to eat in the morning

00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:54.700
but I'm really glad that
Ying and I came here

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.605
as soon as they opened
early in the morning

00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:58.987
because it was the perfect time to come.

00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:02.400
No waiting in line and now we get to burn

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.920
all of that beautiful meat
for the rest of the day

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.037
walking around.

00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:08.259
We're just gonna kinda walk around.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:11.045
I think we're in the Lower
East Side area of Manhattan

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:14.581
right now, we're gonna walk
on over towards Chinatown.

00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:17.100
Maybe take a look at Brooklyn Bridge

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.600
and just kind of wander today.

00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.354
(upbeat music)

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.455
We made it successfully to Chinatown.

00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:45.776
I love Chinatown, so much action happening

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:48.734
and so many good restaurants
that we have passed

00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:50.918
but we're gonna keep
on walking all the way

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:52.511
to the bridge, gonna go take a look

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.611
at the Brooklyn Bridge
and then maybe come back

00:11:55.611 --> 00:11:57.360
to Chinatown for lunch.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.943
(upbeat music)

00:12:09.548 --> 00:12:12.345
Ying saw the cherries
and she could not resist.

00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:14.644
We just ordered a pound of cherries.

00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:16.096
That should be (mumbles).

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:17.992
It's 59 cents per pound.

00:12:17.992 --> 00:12:19.575
This is one dollar.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:28.440
(speaks foreign language)

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.857
Is it one dollar?

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.899
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:38.115
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:40.047
(chattering)

00:12:40.047 --> 00:12:41.485
Thank you.

00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:43.354
We made it to the East River,

00:12:43.354 --> 00:12:46.884
have the Manhattan
Bridge over to this side.

00:12:46.884 --> 00:12:49.317
Brooklyn across the river and then

00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:51.567
the famous Brooklyn bridge.

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:15.910
We are walking through Chinatown again.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.097
Chinatown is awesome in New York City.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:21.807
It is really as close
to China as you can get

00:13:21.807 --> 00:13:23.554
without being in China.

00:13:23.554 --> 00:13:26.759
It's amazing, you can get
so many food ingredients,

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:30.842
so much of everything you
could possibly imagine.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:36.979
(speaks foreign language)

00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:46.277
Can we have that spicy
big tray of chicken?

00:13:46.277 --> 00:13:47.156
- [Waitress] With noodles?

00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:48.041
- With noodles, yeah.

00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:49.917
Since we were walking around Chinatown,

00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:53.297
I had to come to this restaurant,
it's called Spicy Village.

00:13:53.297 --> 00:13:56.586
Thank you very much to Monty
for this recommendation.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:58.142
This is an awesome little place.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:00.557
You walk in here, it's
just a small restaurant

00:14:00.557 --> 00:14:03.272
with maybe a half a dozen tables in here.

00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:06.178
They do have a full menu on a paper

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:09.882
but then they have their
main specialty dishes listed

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.004
and pictured on the wall.

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:14.137
The main dish that I had to try here is

00:14:14.137 --> 00:14:17.992
the Big Tray Chicken, I was
just looking up this restaurant

00:14:17.992 --> 00:14:21.050
and someone wrote about it
from The New York Times.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.168
He said he went into the
kitchen and saw how they make it

00:14:23.168 --> 00:14:27.175
and they add a unique mixture
of different ingredients

00:14:27.175 --> 00:14:30.394
into the chicken including
oil and Budweiser

00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.407
and then fry the chicken and then drain it

00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:35.802
and then fry it again and
then it goes into a spicy

00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:39.789
chili filled broth with Szechuan peppers.

00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:42.749
You can smell the cumin in
here and I got it with noodles.

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:44.374
All of the chicken is down here below

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:46.614
and the big pile of noodles,
I think there's even

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:48.346
some potatoes in here.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.706
Oh look at this, this is just pretty.

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:52.496
Let me take my bowl.

00:14:52.496 --> 00:14:55.681
Maybe I should just taste
some of that broth first.

00:14:55.681 --> 00:14:58.181
Let me taste some of the soup.

00:15:04.007 --> 00:15:05.657
That is insane.

00:15:05.657 --> 00:15:09.326
You can really taste the
Szechuan pepper in there.

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:12.620
You can taste the cumin
nice and strong as well.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.287
It's salty, that is outstanding.

00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:19.848
Mix in noodles with the
(speaks foreign language),

00:15:19.848 --> 00:15:21.860
mix in noodles with the soup.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.577
You can actually see
also, you can just see

00:15:23.577 --> 00:15:25.146
how much cumin is in there.

00:15:25.146 --> 00:15:28.929
There's so much cumin and so
many Szechuan peppers in here.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:32.179
There's a fantastic cumin flavor to it.

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:42.280
It'll be easier to eat
from my single bowl.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.363
Some chicken.

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:50.185
Okay chicken time.

00:15:58.153 --> 00:16:01.236
You can tell that the
chicken has been fried

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.089
because it has this skin around it

00:16:03.089 --> 00:16:05.152
like a fried skin around it.

00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:09.387
But then the inside is
so tender, it's juicy,

00:16:09.387 --> 00:16:12.345
it's like filled with that broth.

00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:14.676
That is insanely good.

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:16.129
And then some of the noodles.

00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:18.227
You can see all of the
Szechuan peppers in there,

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.560
the cumin seeds.

00:16:28.396 --> 00:16:31.438
Wow, you can immediately tell
those are handmade noodles.

00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:34.623
They are chewy but yet
they are fresh tasting

00:16:34.623 --> 00:16:37.632
and I love how they're a thick
cut so they're a little bit

00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:42.465
thick but they're gooey
but just perfectly chewy.

00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:44.827
And then again the noodles
are just wrapped up,

00:16:44.827 --> 00:16:49.358
soaked up with that
incredibly flavorful broth.

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:52.909
The Szechuan pepper, the chili
and especially that cumin,

00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:56.576
that cumin is what's
really blowing me away.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:02.290
Finished eating that big tray
chicken, that is sensational.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.022
That was so incredibly good.

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:06.912
What really just took it to the next level

00:17:06.912 --> 00:17:10.514
was that amount of cumin as
well as that Szechuan pepper.

00:17:10.514 --> 00:17:12.789
My mouth is still a little bit numb.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:14.504
I love Szechuan peppers,
it's one of my favorite

00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:16.096
ingredients in the entire world.

00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:19.037
They used it marvelously
in this combination.

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:23.095
That was truly a masterpiece
of a dish within a tray.

00:17:23.095 --> 00:17:27.438
So good, the cumin is just
going up my nose right now.

00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:29.084
It was so good.

00:17:29.084 --> 00:17:31.095
We have decided to head back to the subway

00:17:31.095 --> 00:17:32.914
and we are gonna go back to Midtown,

00:17:32.914 --> 00:17:34.595
maybe do a little bit of shopping.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:37.604
I wanna go to Trader
Joe's and buy some walnuts

00:17:37.604 --> 00:17:39.583
and some other snacks.

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:41.457
Then maybe we'll go back to the hotel

00:17:41.457 --> 00:17:42.976
for a little while and then after that

00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:45.216
maybe walk around Times Square.

00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:47.799
(upbeat music)

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.067
This is Avenue, I was
thinking it's down that way.

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:59.676
We got off the subway at 23rd Street

00:17:59.676 --> 00:18:01.111
and here is Trader Joe's.

00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:02.475
We're gonna go in here for a little while

00:18:02.475 --> 00:18:04.225
and do some shopping.

00:18:05.137 --> 00:18:08.637
(speaks foreign language)

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.828
We were only gonna go into Trader Joe's

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:16.506
and buy a couple of things but ended up

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:18.662
with a whole sack of things.

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:20.290
Ying and I were both excited.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.722
We bought raspberries and
almonds and almond milk

00:18:23.722 --> 00:18:25.722
and bananas and walnuts.

00:18:27.537 --> 00:18:30.808
Yeah, I'm a big fan of Trader
Joe's when I am visiting

00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:32.438
the United States.

00:18:32.438 --> 00:18:35.202
We went back to the hotel
and stayed for about an hour

00:18:35.202 --> 00:18:38.178
and now we are walking
down 7th Avenue on our way

00:18:38.178 --> 00:18:39.511
to Times Square.

00:18:40.382 --> 00:18:43.299
(electronic music)

00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:04.166
This is Times Square.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.245
We made it right into the center
of New York's Times Square.

00:19:13.245 --> 00:19:18.188
This is a huge, just absolutely
packed with people square

00:19:18.188 --> 00:19:21.566
and I just read that it's
one of the world's busiest

00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:24.543
pedestrian walkways in the entire world

00:19:24.543 --> 00:19:27.763
with over 400,000 people
on average per day

00:19:27.763 --> 00:19:32.013
who walk through Times Square
but it's just an insanity

00:19:32.013 --> 00:19:34.742
of lights and billboards.

00:19:34.742 --> 00:19:36.510
- I see your videos all the time.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.868
- Thank you, what's your name?

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:39.991
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:41.388
- Andrea.
- Nice to meet you.

00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:42.265
Where are you from?

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:43.577
- Venezuela.
- Venezuela.

00:19:43.577 --> 00:19:44.410
- Hello!

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.518
- And there's just an insanity of lights

00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:50.118
and flashing billboards and advertisements

00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:52.118
and everything going on.

00:19:56.054 --> 00:19:58.316
Everything you could
possibly want to ever buy

00:19:58.316 --> 00:20:02.410
there's advertising for it
somewhere within Times Square.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.327
(electronic music)

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:21.169
Not too far away from
Times Square is a place

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:24.721
I have been waiting to eat for a long time

00:20:24.721 --> 00:20:27.905
and we have just arrived
at the corner of 6th Avenue

00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:29.238
and 53rd Street.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.377
Halal Guys.

00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:35.885
They are one of the most
well known street food trucks

00:20:35.885 --> 00:20:39.471
or street food establishments
in all of New York.

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:43.027
Famous for serving Halal
food and since we happened

00:20:43.027 --> 00:20:45.182
to be in this area, I
thought this would make

00:20:45.182 --> 00:20:46.504
a perfect dinner.

00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:48.090
I know exactly what I'm gonna order.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.666
I'm gonna go for the chicken rice plate,

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.361
extra white sauce and extra hot sauce.

00:20:53.361 --> 00:20:56.405
I can actually smell, actually
this entire plaza area

00:20:56.405 --> 00:21:00.484
which is just surrounded
by gigantic buildings

00:21:00.484 --> 00:21:03.817
is filled with the aroma of the chicken.

00:21:09.649 --> 00:21:12.751
The Halal Guys were
established back in 1990

00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:14.779
and they were a pioneer in the street food

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:17.212
in New York City as well as Halal food.

00:21:17.212 --> 00:21:20.451
You can see how they are
preparing food for the masses

00:21:20.451 --> 00:21:22.777
right now, they're cooking chicken,

00:21:22.777 --> 00:21:25.124
just heaps of chicken and that aroma

00:21:25.124 --> 00:21:28.322
is enough to make your
mouth water immediately.

00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:29.672
- Chicken and beef.

00:21:29.672 --> 00:21:30.544
(mumbles)

00:21:30.544 --> 00:21:33.544
- Yes?
- Chicken and rice, one plate.

00:21:40.525 --> 00:21:42.692
(mumbles)

00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:52.847
But I don't wanna lean back too far

00:21:52.847 --> 00:21:55.595
because this is a fountain
and there are some drips

00:21:55.595 --> 00:21:58.252
coming down and there's water
below where I'm sitting.

00:21:58.252 --> 00:22:00.299
So don't lean back too far.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.466
The unveiling of The Halal
Guys' chicken over rice.

00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:12.235
Oh yes, you can smell
that, it smells incredible.

00:22:12.235 --> 00:22:14.282
What else came in here?

00:22:14.282 --> 00:22:17.030
This is the white sauce,
the famous white sauce

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.030
that includes soy beans
and egg yolk and vinegar

00:22:21.928 --> 00:22:24.763
and water, salt, lots of good stuff.

00:22:24.763 --> 00:22:27.763
And then extra hot sauce, all right.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.746
That's actually, that's pretty heavy.

00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:36.079
That's a good sized portion.

00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:40.273
Oh yeah, here it is.

00:22:40.273 --> 00:22:43.631
Chicken over rice, the rice
is very orange in color

00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:44.575
on the bottom.

00:22:44.575 --> 00:22:48.976
There's some iceberg lettuce
and then pieces of bread.

00:22:48.976 --> 00:22:51.371
Okay the security just came over

00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:53.367
and said we can't sit on a fountain.

00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:56.700
So I gotta take my Halal Guys elsewhere.

00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:03.899
(speaks foreign language)

00:23:09.509 --> 00:23:11.385
We'll try the flower planter this time

00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:13.454
instead of the fountain.

00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:15.787
Let's do this one more time.

00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:25.004
Correct procedure is to
take the packets of sauce

00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:28.418
and just drench this entire
plate with all of that sauce.

00:23:28.418 --> 00:23:30.604
But I'm gonna go ahead
and just taste a piece

00:23:30.604 --> 00:23:33.126
of the chicken before
drenching it in sauce

00:23:33.126 --> 00:23:35.043
with some of that rice.

00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:47.139
It's not overly spicy or spiceous.

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:52.514
It's kind of just like fried chicken

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:55.506
like griddle fried chicken
but very tender chicken

00:23:55.506 --> 00:23:57.923
and over fluffy, orange rice.

00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:02.947
I think a lot of the
flavor is in that sauce.

00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:03.780
Oh yeah.

00:24:05.253 --> 00:24:07.670
And from what everybody says,

00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:11.944
you can not have enough white sauce.

00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:14.494
They had hot sauce.

00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:18.933
I'll go with just one packet
of the white sauce for now

00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:20.850
and then the red sauce.

00:24:23.642 --> 00:24:24.809
The hot sauce.

00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:32.720
Then stir this all up with the chicken.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.720
Oh that beautiful swirl.

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:40.302
All right, I think that is perfect.

00:24:40.302 --> 00:24:42.635
I am not waiting any longer.

00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:55.128
It is all about the
combinations of those sauces.

00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:58.307
Because the chicken and the rice,

00:24:58.307 --> 00:25:02.702
tasting it on its own,
it really is quite plain.

00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:05.608
But when you add that
sauce, that just adds

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:07.608
the world of difference.

00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:12.465
That is the secret of
The Halal Guys for sure.

00:25:12.465 --> 00:25:15.213
It kind of tastes yogurty.

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:17.646
But then reading the
ingredients, it says soy bean

00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:21.813
and then also egg yolk and
vinegar, and water and salt.

00:25:22.862 --> 00:25:26.870
It has a little bit of a
sour yogurty taste to it.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.420
It's creamy and that
hot sauce is fantastic.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.448
It is definitely a little bit spicy.

00:25:33.448 --> 00:25:37.892
Some good heat to it and
just fantastic flavor.

00:25:37.892 --> 00:25:41.795
Wow, that is like
surprisingly awesomely good

00:25:41.795 --> 00:25:44.712
once you mix both of the sauces in.

00:25:46.938 --> 00:25:50.773
Yeah this hot sauce is incredibly good.

00:25:50.773 --> 00:25:54.940
I wanna get some of the chicken
with only the hot sauce.

00:26:02.339 --> 00:26:06.235
Let me see what's all in this hot sauce.

00:26:06.235 --> 00:26:09.985
There is water, spices,
vinegar, salt, lemon,

00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:14.808
yeah those are mostly the ingredients.

00:26:17.329 --> 00:26:18.162
Oh yeah.

00:26:27.234 --> 00:26:29.281
That hot sauce is amazing.

00:26:29.281 --> 00:26:33.198
It does have a kick to
it, it is nice and spicy

00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:39.499
and then it has a really
sharp lemony kind of acidic

00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:42.863
slightly bitter taste to it.

00:26:42.863 --> 00:26:45.068
That is a wonderful hot sauce.

00:26:45.068 --> 00:26:47.023
That was a lot of hot sauce in that bite.

00:26:47.023 --> 00:26:48.440
That was amazing.

00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:52.465
And then I think I will just add on.

00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:56.632
This hot sauce is remarkably
spicy, it's fantastic.

00:27:02.627 --> 00:27:04.471
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:07.498
You want every piece of
chicken and every morsel

00:27:07.498 --> 00:27:09.896
of rice, every grain of
rice to just be coated

00:27:09.896 --> 00:27:12.313
in hot sauce and white sauce.

00:27:14.218 --> 00:27:17.468
Don't let anything not get sauce on it.

00:27:23.478 --> 00:27:25.246
What I love so much about New York City

00:27:25.246 --> 00:27:29.413
is the diversity which
leads to just the full world

00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:32.997
of possibilities when it comes to food.

00:27:32.997 --> 00:27:36.896
So for breakfast we had
that insanely good pastrami,

00:27:36.896 --> 00:27:41.605
for lunch we had that
unbelievably good hot pot

00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:44.265
of chicken and noodles
and Szechuan pepper.

00:27:44.265 --> 00:27:48.397
Then for dinner, that New
York Middle Eastern inspired

00:27:48.397 --> 00:27:51.475
chicken over rice from The Halal Guys.

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:54.086
That was an awesome day of eating.

00:27:54.086 --> 00:27:56.355

Good night from New York City.

00:28:05.058 --> 00:28:07.475
Thank you again for watching.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.987
Oh hello Ying.

00:28:10.884 --> 00:28:13.368
Welcome to Times Square.

00:28:13.368 --> 00:28:15.118
- Times for shopping.

00:28:16.463 --> 00:28:17.467
Say something.

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:19.228
- Is there a tear?

00:28:19.228 --> 00:28:21.838
Is there a tear in my eye?
- Yeah.

00:28:21.838 --> 00:28:24.338
- The hot sauce was that good.
