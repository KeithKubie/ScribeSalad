1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.130
Start recording
should be.
Yeah.

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.840
<v 2>Okay.
How do I even begin this one?
The engine has been a very,</v>

4
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.680
a fascinating thing for me in the,
you know,
many years that I've been on it,

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.890
but one of the most fascinating things about it as the ability to get in touch

6
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.400
with people that if you were younger,
you know,

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.200
like a long time ago,

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
there was no chance I would be able to sit down with you and do a conversation.

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
You would just be some,
you know,
author whose books I admired.

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.330
But now because of this crazy thing is podcast here we are sitting down,

11
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.630
Graham Hancock has joined us and if you don't know who Graham Hancock is,

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.890
Graham Hancock is probably,
uh,

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
the one guy who's influenced my view of history more than anybody ever.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.740
It's from this book,
fingerprints of the Gods and fingerprints of the gods is a,

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.880
what is it sold like 5 million copies or something crazy like

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.970
<v 0>forgot about that.
Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.880
<v 2>Yeah.
It's an amazing book that basically challenges our view of history.</v>

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.750
And,
um,

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.750
you have spent an enormous chunk of your life uncovering all these different

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.640
structures and all these different monuments and all these different things that

21
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:22.140
you attribute to a lost era of humanity.
And I want to,

22
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:26.580
my favorite terms that you use is that we're a species with hypnosis,

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.080
or excuse me,
with Amnesia.
With Amnesia.
Yeah.
And that please tell me where,

24
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:33.740
how did all this get cracking?
How did this get started for you?
Wow.
Well,

25
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.790
<v 0>it's,
everything that's happened in my life has happened kind of by a series of</v>

26
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:39.920
accidents.
I,
I never,

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.250
I never planned out anything except I kind of,

28
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.570
I kind of knew when I was young that I had one gift,

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.540
which was,
uh,
some ability to write.

30
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.580
And the other thing that bugged me was,
it's when all through my childhood,

31
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.450
I always felt I was on the edge of things,
not in the middle of things.

32
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.200
Other people were in the middle.
I was on the edge.
I just always felt that way.

33
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190
And,
uh,
when I got through university,

34
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.350
I kind of drifted towards,
towards writing current affairs,

35
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:14.450
journalism.
Um,

36
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.100
and it was while following journalistic stories.
I,

37
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.210
my last journalistic role was as the east African correspondent for the

38
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:25.220
economist.
Quite a,
quite a serious newspaper.

39
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:29.900
And I was based in Nairobi in Kenya and I was covering wars and famines and

40
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.790
politics and all of that stuff.
And on my beat was Ethiopia.

41
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.860
And I used to go to Ethiopia quite regularly.
It was in the news a lot.
And,
uh,

42
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.840
on one journey to Ethiopia,

43
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.650
I flew into a city that the time was in the middle of a war zone in a DC three

44
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.210
that kind of dive down out of the sky to avoid the machine gun nests in the

45
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:56.750
surrounding hills and landed in the airport.

46
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.160
And this was an ancient city called [inaudible].
And it had,
um,

47
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.400
incredible history.
It had obelisks.
It had a polished,

48
00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:07.570
supposedly of the Queen of Sheba had an ancient cathedral,

49
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.690
the most ancient Christian cathedral in Africa,

50
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.790
dating back to the 300 after Christ.

51
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.660
And in the grounds of that cathedral in a chapel outside the chapel.

52
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.190
I meet a monk and,
uh,
he tells me in the conversation,

53
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.700
we have the,
he's got the Ark of the Covenant in that Chapel.

54
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.770
This was,
I had heard that the Ark of the covenant was important to Ethiopia,

55
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:37.090
but now I'm sitting in front of a monk with cataracts in his eyes and he's

56
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.280
telling me behind him in that chapel,
but I can't go,

57
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.480
there is the Ark of the covenant.
And I said,
you know,
can I go,
can I,

58
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.420
can I see it?
And he said,
no,
no.
Nobody can see it.

59
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.510
Even the former emperors were never allowed to see the ark of the covenant.

60
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.651
You know,

61
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.470
the Raiders of the lost ark movie had come out only like a couple of years

62
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:56.890
before this.
This was in the early eighties.
And,
um,

63
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.020
so I left that place impressed by the,
this man,
but not really believing it.

64
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.370
And then I started to look into it and I discovered that actually Ethiopia is

65
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.610
the only country in the world which has a living veneration,

66
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.770
almost worship of the Ark of the covenant.

67
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.170
A Ethiopia has ancient Christianity,
but it also has ancient Judaism.

68
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.170
There's a Jewish community in Ethiopia called the fellowship.

69
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.350
They call themselves the better Israel.
How did they get there?

70
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.310
They practice a very ancient form of Judaism.
They don't have rabbis,

71
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.600
they have priests.
They perform sacrifice,
other Judaic people's do not.
Um,

72
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.080
it's like an old testament world frozen in the highlands of Ethiopia.

73
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.180
So I started to get interesting,
this is,

74
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.630
this is weird and this is exciting and what can I find out about this?

75
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:45.580
Then I went to the academics and they said,
ah,
it's all rubbish.
Those ETL bins,

76
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.370
they just made it up to make themselves look big.

77
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.430
Okay,
but then why is it the case that in every single church in Ethiopia,

78
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.020
more than 20,000 churches,

79
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:58.870
there's a replica of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of holies.

80
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.650
What does it look like?
Well,
mostly it's a box and sometimes actually they,

81
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.320
they reduced the replica to simply two tablets,

82
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.320
which are supposed to represent the tablets of stone inside the Ark of the

83
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:10.960
covenant.
But the Ark of the covenant is not a Christian object.

84
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.840
It's a pretty Christian object.
What's it doing in all these churches are,
why is,

85
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:14.890
where does this all come from?

86
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.250
Why do we have the black Jews of Ethiopia practicing?

87
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.750
They're very ancient form of Judaism.

88
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:24.400
So I really started to dig and I kind of as a first time I realized that,

89
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:27.310
uh,
you don't want to listen to academics all the time.

90
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.250
Professor x and doctor y may be very,

91
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:33.700
very impressive people with their credentials,
but they have prejudices.

92
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.250
They have a fixed view of the past,

93
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:38.200
which they're going to stick to come what may,

94
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.360
and as I started to investigate this,

95
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:45.000
this is what drew me out of current affairs and into ancient mysteries.
I,

96
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.540
I found that here was a real investigation,
a story that had never been told,

97
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.750
uh,
could this remote country in the Horn of Africa,

98
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.390
really half the Ark of the covenant.
And if so,
how could it have got there?

99
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.980
And I spent several years of my life trying to

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.810
<v 3>answer those questions.
And by that time,</v>

101
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.650
by the time I got to the end of that investigation that I had left current

102
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.680
affairs behind and hooked,
I was hooked on the past.

103
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.550
<v 4>What did you ever wonder if you were going crazy?</v>

104
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:14.330
Like here I am really investigating of some people in Ethiopia actually have

105
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.020
some crazy thing from a book.
No,

106
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.590
it makes no sense and really thought it was real.
I,

107
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.050
it wasn't that I thought it was real.

108
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.800
<v 3>I was,
I was either thought no,</v>

109
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.740
I didn't think that I was impressed by the Ethiopians themselves.

110
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.770
And I was impressed by the purity of their belief and the passion with which

111
00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.990
they held it.
And the fact that here,
after thousands of years,

112
00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:38.710
this object disappeared from the Bible,
um,
at the time,

113
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:41.830
well roundabout 650 years before Christ,

114
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.290
it's not mentioned again in the Bible.
After that,
it vanishes.
Um,
and,

115
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:49.870
and yet here is,
it's worship in,
in 20th century.

116
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.290
Ethiopia today is,
how do we explain this?
And it was.

117
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.030
And as I dug deeper,
I began to realize that,
uh,

118
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.850
actually there was a real possibility they did have the Ark of the covenant and

119
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:04.960
that it is connected to the mystery of the Ethiopian Jews.
Um,
and,

120
00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:08.530
and that the story they themselves tell about it,
which connects it.

121
00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:10.960
It's a drawer,
very romantic and lovely story.

122
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.600
They say in brief that the Queen of Sheba,

123
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.950
famous queen of Sheba was an Ethiopian queen and that she,

124
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.730
when she traveled to Jerusalem to meet Solomon,
which is described in the Bible,

125
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.740
big,
big episode in the Bible.
Um,
she didn't only exchange wisdom with him,

126
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.830
she also exchanged bodily fluids and she became pregnant,
uh,

127
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.320
with King Solomon son,
who was to be called Menelik,
which,

128
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.760
which actually means the son of the wise man and a pregnant.

129
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:44.530
She left Jerusalem,
returned to Ethiopia,
gave birth to her son,

130
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.530
Menelik there at the age of 20 or 21,

131
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:51.760
he wanted to visit his famous father in Jerusalem.
He traveled north,

132
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.340
went to Jerusalem,
spent a year there,

133
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.850
and at the end of the year contrived to steal the Ark of the covenant from

134
00:07:57.851 --> 00:08:01.150
Jerusalem and take it off to Ethiopia.
And there it's been ever since.

135
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:04.240
That's the Ethiopian story,
I believe behind that legend,

136
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:07.090
there's a true history of how it really got there.
And that's what I,

137
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.171
that's in the end,

138
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.800
what I ended up writing my first book of historical mysteries above,

139
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:13.000
which was the sign of the seal

140
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.600
<v 4>and wasn't the speculation about the Ark of the covenant,</v>

141
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:19.080
that it was some sort of a technological device that was actually radioactive.

142
00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:19.450
Yes,
yes.

143
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.650
<v 3>I got into that speculation myself at some length because as I started to</v>

144
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.730
investigate this subject,

145
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:28.030
not only was the Ethiopian side of it fascinating and mysterious,

146
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.510
but the object itself is quite extraordinary.
I mean,

147
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.900
it dominates the Bible at the beginning of the story from the time they're in

148
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:36.730
Sinai,
the exodus there,

149
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:40.360
there's a tremendous role for the Ark of the Covenant and they follow it through

150
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.200
the Wilderness and it's marched around the city of Jericho.

151
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:47.900
It knocks down the walls of Jericho.
Um,
it's hugely important.

152
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.580
The temple of Solomon is built with only one function and that's to serve,

153
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.590
and this is a quote as an house of rest for the Ark of the covenant of the Lord.

154
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 0>That's the only reason that the temple of Solomon is built is like at a certain</v>

155
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.120
point,
it's got to be placed out of the public view.

156
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.040
It's always a dangerous object as they're carrying it.

157
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.190
It strikes people dead.
If somebody touches it by chance.

158
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.740
Boulder fire comes out of it.
Actually.
I mean,

159
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.570
Spielberg and the Indiana Jones movie,

160
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.810
the way they portrayed the arc was spot on.

161
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.380
How it's described in the old testament as an absolutely devastating deadly

162
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:27.020
instrument.
So it's the,
the Israelites use it,
didn't battle it.

163
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.310
There's a accounts of it flying into the air,

164
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.150
rushing towards the enemies of Israel,
emitting a moaning sound.

165
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.870
They all fall down dead.
Then there's a,
a later account,

166
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:39.480
whether the Philistines capture the Ark of the covenant,

167
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.580
they take it off to the city of Ashdod.

168
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.810
Then they make the huge mistake of opening it and they treated like a tourist

169
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:49.530
object.
People walk by,
the Bible says 50,000 died.

170
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.070
And how did they die?
Cancerous tumors.
That's what's,

171
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.110
that's what's actually described in the,
in the Bible.

172
00:09:55.111 --> 00:10:00.111
So the covenant is supposed to contain within it once laughed at the 10 can

173
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.540
attempt mum.
That's correct.
That's what's supposed to be inside of it.

174
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.280
And also isn't there a written upon by the finger of God himself,
if you,
if you,

175
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.530
if you take the old testament and that's,
and that and that.

176
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.350
They're the kind of power source of the Ark of the covenant.
Now,

177
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:15.480
what that power is,
uh,

178
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.540
I did get into some speculation on this.

179
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.600
It seems obvious to me that that at one level the Ark of the covenant is an out

180
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:28.260
of place technology.
It's a,
it's a strange technology which is,
which is,
um,

181
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.310
which is presented itself in a surprising context where you don't expect to find

182
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.520
it.
And there it is.
So I started to look into the background of this.

183
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:41.370
Where did this come from?
And where it comes from is Egypt.

184
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.730
Moses is intimately connected with the Ark of the covenant.

185
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.700
Moses is raised in the household of the Pharaoh in Egypt.

186
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:50.330
He's groomed to be a future farrow,
uh,

187
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.840
and then the falling outcomes and he leaves with the children of Israel and

188
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:59.040
builds the Ark of the covenant in the site in the Sinai.
Uh,
now,

189
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:03.930
if he was raised and groomed as a future pharaoh than he would have been a

190
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:08.460
magician,
he would have been versed in the high magic of ancient Egypt.

191
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.110
And those guys could do virtually anything they set their minds to.
I mean,

192
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.450
anybody who can build the Great Pyramid of Egypt,

193
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.040
if it was built when we're told him was built,
um,
it's an extraordinary,
yeah.

194
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.030
<v 4>Even if it was before then,</v>

195
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.480
whenever people don't understand what you're talking about here,
you,
your,

196
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.750
your premise or a big part of it is that there is somewhere around,

197
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.060
what is it,
10,000 years ago,
somewhere around then,

198
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.800
towards the end of the last ice age,

199
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.570
humanity was probably mostly wiped out or wiped out in a big way.

200
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:43.130
And we had to rebuild from there.

201
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.680
<v 0>And we,
and I believe that we lost,
uh,
uh,
a civilization at that time,</v>

202
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.240
the entire civilization,
which is not being recorded by history,
uh,

203
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.990
and that it underwater

204
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.380
<v 3>with the rising sea levels.
And what led me to this,
well,</v>

205
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.690
the reason I became interested in pursuing that line of inquiry was the Ark of

206
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.340
the covenant because it seemed to me,

207
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.090
it seemed to me like a piece of technology that was out of its place in history,

208
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.500
in the way that it was described.

209
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.540
I'm not wishing to put down the spiritual aspects because they are there.
Uh,

210
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.370
but there were definite technological aspects to this device.

211
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.120
And then I had to ask myself,
well,
where could that knowledge have come from?

212
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.500
And through Egypt,

213
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.580
we then start to find that Egypt itself looks back to an older time.

214
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.480
The ancient Egyptians didn't regard themselves as the beginning of their story.

215
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.090
They regarded themselves as quite a late point in their story.

216
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.520
And they look back to the time of the gods,

217
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:37.660
which they called Zep Tepi the first time when there was a golden age and they

218
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:40.120
speak and there are texts,
the Ed for building texts,

219
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:44.260
which speak of the guards living on an island,
a gigantic flood coming.

220
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.850
Most of the gods are killed.
Odd thing to happen to gods.
And then they,
uh,

221
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.190
come and settle in Egypt.
The survivors come and settle in Egypt.
And

222
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:57.020
<v 4>so Egypt is the product of an even far earlier civilization,
but,</v>

223
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.110
but the history of Egypt goes back way,

224
00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:03.620
way further than people think it does.
That's my view.
That's my view.

225
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.270
I support that view.

226
00:13:05.271 --> 00:13:10.160
And I was astonished when you had Robert Schoch in John Anthony West when they

227
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:14.630
brought their findings about the erosion on the,
the,
the temple of the Sphinx.

228
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.250
Yes.
They brought these findings to these academics and just the,

229
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.790
the tone of their voice,
the way they were approaching the information,

230
00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:26.870
the mocking attitude that they had of it.
Well,
where is this civilization?

231
00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:29.750
You speak up because they're talking about a civilization that was possibly,

232
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.900
what,
10,000 BC or something like that running around.

233
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.800
I would put the finger right about 10,500 BC when people,
if you don't know the,

234
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:39.410
the,
the,
the story behind it.

235
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:43.280
There's water erosion on the edge of the,
uh,
the,

236
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.670
the temple of the Sphinx has done that could only be attributed to thousands of

237
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.500
years of rainfall.

238
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.840
That's the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was breakthrough

239
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.860
<v 3>work that John Anthony West and Robert Schoch did that.
The initial observation,</v>

240
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.820
um,
w came through John,
um,
who is,
uh,

241
00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.850
an at astonishingly knowledgeable man about ancient Egypt.

242
00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:04.100
He's not a official Egyptologist,

243
00:14:04.101 --> 00:14:06.470
but he spent his whole life working in ancient Egypt.

244
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.870
And through his research and his background,
he came to,

245
00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:13.190
he came to realize that the erosion patterns on the Sphinx are really odd.

246
00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:15.120
And he then went to shock,
uh,

247
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.670
Robert Schoch at the University of Boston who is a geologist and an open minded

248
00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:20.840
one.
And he said,

249
00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:24.080
would you come to Egypt with me and give me your geological opinion on this

250
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:24.501
monument?

251
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:28.640
So shock went there and it was immediately clear to him that this monument had

252
00:14:28.641 --> 00:14:32.390
been subjected to thousands of years of heavy rainfall at some point in its

253
00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:33.030
history.

254
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.340
And that's where the mystery begins because the study of ancient climates is

255
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:40.220
quite well advanced.
And we know that 5,000 years ago,

256
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.980
four and a half thousand years ago when the Sphinx is supposed to have been

257
00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:47.030
built,
Egypt was as Moen dry as it is today,

258
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.680
and you have to go back some thousands of years before that at two,

259
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.681
about 9,000 years ago to get the very heavy rainfall that would have caused the

260
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.730
erosion of those things.

261
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.690
But that only means that the Sphinx was standing there 9,000 years ago to be

262
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.530
rained on.
Uh,
it may be much older than that.

263
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.110
A shock is cautious and he will not,

264
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.810
he will not push the date back beyond what the hard evidence suggests he's

265
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.940
willing to is what he does,
except that the Sphinx may well have stood there,
uh,

266
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.200
before the heavy rains began.
But how long before is a,

267
00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:25.130
is a matter that he cannot be certain on.
And that's where,
uh,

268
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:30.160
Robert Boulevard and I were able to take the matter on a little further with the

269
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.070
astronomy of the Giza plateau.

270
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.810
And you find there's this just this stunning thing that happens in the sky.

271
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.690
I mean,
this is one of,
one of the great things.

272
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:43.460
I have some problems with technology,

273
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.520
but I have to say one of the great things about computer technology is the way

274
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:50.840
that it can speed up access to information in an incredibly efficient way.

275
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.240
And there are computer programs now,

276
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.010
which we'll show you exactly how the stars were positioned at any time in the

277
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.980
last 30,000 years over.
At any point on the earth's surface,

278
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:04.280
you can literally wind back the ancient skies and see them.

279
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:08.600
And this guy's do change because the earth is the viewing platform from which we

280
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:12.240
observe the stars.
There's a wobble on the axis of the earth course.

281
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.120
That's right.
And the wobble takes 20 to 26,000 years to complete a cycle.

282
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.190
So it's a cyclical process.

283
00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.820
Eventually the stars will all return to starting point and begin the cycle
again.

284
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.050
And because of that,

285
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:28.520
we can say that the Sphinx was gazing at his own celestial counterpart.

286
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:32.930
The constellation of Leo at dawn on the Spring Equinox in 10,000 BC,

287
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.290
while 90 degrees away due south Orion was lying on the Meridian in exactly the

288
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:42.500
pattern of the pyramids on the ground.
Who doesn't?

289
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.520
John Anthony West go even deeper.
He believes it's like 30,000 BC.

290
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.380
John John thinks it might be pushed back another processional cycle.
You see the,

291
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:56.330
we,
we take it back to two 12 and a half thousand years ago.
Uh,

292
00:16:56.331 --> 00:17:00.560
but you would have the same alignments another 26,000 years earlier.

293
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.700
So 38,000 years ago you would have the same alignments as you had 12 and a half

294
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:05.380
thousand years.

295
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.380
Doesn't he base it on actual hieroglyphs to depict the images of the Pharaohs

296
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:12.830
and absolutely.
Right.
There's the,
and again,

297
00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.350
this is the area where the Egyptologists,

298
00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:19.700
the academic Egyptologists are incredibly annoying because they will not listen

299
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:22.790
to what the ancient Egyptians themselves had to say.
It's as though they,

300
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:26.570
the academics know more about ancient Egyptian history than the ancient

301
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:30.530
Egyptians did themselves.
And the ancient Egyptians were really very clear.

302
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.690
They pushed their history back,
well plus 30,000 years defensive.

303
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:39.130
Why don't that,
why,
why won't they buy?
Why are they so again,

304
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.950
I wondered that myself.
Uh,
when I first got into this,

305
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:45.110
I initially couldn't understand it,
but I think,

306
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:49.010
I think it's a problem with science in general.
Uh,
I think that,
uh,

307
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.190
was it a late discovery?

308
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.010
<v 2>Did they have an established timeline?
They race government.</v>

309
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:57.550
<v 3>There's the timeline.
The timeline was set literally in stone,
uh,</v>

310
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.370
over the last sort of last 50,
50 years of the 20th century.

311
00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:04.610
I mean really Biden,
by the beginning of the 20th century,

312
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.000
a timeline had been worked out and by the 1950s,

313
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.680
it was very much set.

314
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.500
<v 2>So they are just not willing to consider any previous day that would anything.</v>

315
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.890
That was the whole timeline out.

316
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.600
And because they've been teaching it for so long,

317
00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:19.780
they're reluctant to open up to new ideas.
I would say so.

318
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.640
<v 3>But also,
but also they themselves,</v>

319
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.340
I'm not suggesting any dishonesty on their part.

320
00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:27.580
They themselves absolutely believe their version of the past

321
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.960
<v 2>and in all fairness,
you know Robert Shocks,
depiction of the erosion,</v>

322
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.200
there have been dissenters and I've read some,
some different people's pavers,

323
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:37.740
but they seem very logical and I looked at it myself,

324
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.410
I know what water erosion looks like.
Obviously I'm not a geologist,

325
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:44.160
but when I look at it and you say that that's wind and sand and then they showed

326
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.250
extreme examples of wind in Santa Rosa,
it's,
well it doesn't look the same.

327
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.850
There's,
it looks like there's crevices.
It's been created by water.

328
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:51.840
It's really obvious.

329
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.940
<v 3>It really does.
Yeah.
And,
and,
and,</v>

330
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:58.210
and then there's so much else that adds to that.
I mean there's,

331
00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:00.890
this thinks is not alone there.
There are other,

332
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:02.810
whether it's structures out there on the Giza plateau,

333
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.581
<v 2>all of them,</v>

334
00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:07.750
the ones under deep and they find ones that are underground that are these old

335
00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:12.550
style construction ones that were built much like this.
The temple,
the Sphinx,

336
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.140
but not like the later stuff.

337
00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:17.050
Then it looks like two different areas of construction

338
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.960
<v 3>does it looks like two phases of construction.
One very ancient,
one more recent,</v>

339
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.480
and they've got muddled up in the academics mind

340
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.830
<v 2>watching doctor shock.</v>

341
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.070
Try to talk to the Egyptologists about that was,

342
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.290
it was a fascinating thing because the guy got super defensive and he was like,

343
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:37.530
where,
where is this civilization you're speaking of this 10,000 Polo?

344
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.243
It was like this,

345
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.770
<v 3>Marx was Marc Alania who's an egyptologist at the Oriental Institute in Chicago</v>

346
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.230
and one of the lead West archeologists working in Giza,
you know,
and his remark,

347
00:19:49.231 --> 00:19:51.480
which we quite often was,
you know,
um,

348
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.240
show me the pot shirt where whereas the pot shirt from this,

349
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:56.010
from this last civilization,
well,

350
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.100
the argument was at that time that the Sphinx cannot possibly be of that age

351
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.600
because there's nothing else in the world of that age.

352
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:05.670
How could it just be this one unique thing,

353
00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.440
which is 12 and a half thousand years old or maybe older,
uh,

354
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.920
this amazing the monument.
How can that be alone?

355
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.690
Then she'll show me the pictures of the rest of that civilization.
Well,

356
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.250
some years later,

357
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.510
those poachers have started to turn up and they've turned up in Turkey,
uh,

358
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:24.410
in the form of a gold back.

359
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.450
Tapi a gigantic megalithic circle,
uh,

360
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:30.540
which dates back to precisely 12,000 years ago

361
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.220
<v 2>and even has carvings of animals that don't exist anywhere near Turkey on the,</v>

362
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:38.640
on this thing.
And they're trying to attribute it to hunter gatherers,

363
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.770
which is hilarious.
Yeah,

364
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.790
<v 3>it was really hilarious.
Um,
the,
these,</v>

365
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.820
these were people who had an organized and systematic a civilization,

366
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.410
<v 4>and it was somehow or another intentionally covered up.
Alright.
They buried it,</v>

367
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.430
buried these gigantic,
like 12 foot tall,

368
00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.670
beautiful stone carvings were like lizards on them and stuff.

369
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.271
<v 3>By the way,</v>

370
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:05.170
that the ancient Egyptians themselves decommissioned some of their temples when

371
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.500
they knew their system was going down.
They knew it was going down.

372
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.660
The Romans were the end of it for Egypt.

373
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.650
The Egyptians thrived through the Greek period.

374
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.360
When the Greeks arrived in Egypt.

375
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.130
What happened was the Egyptians colonize the Greek mind and the Greeks became

376
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:24.700
Egyptians.
But when the Romans took over,
it was a different story.

377
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.770
That's my people.
They fat everywhere.
Still.
We're still,
yeah.
When the Romans,

378
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.990
uh,
made this alliance with Christianity and the,
the,
the,
the,

379
00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:36.640
the Christian Church pulled on the Jackboot of Rome.

380
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.790
It was Christians who really wanted to take Egypt apart.

381
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.120
They wanted to destroy everything and the Egyptian priests themselves rather

382
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:45.700
than let their temples fall into their hands in that way,

383
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.450
they went around and destroyed certain things in the temples and they did so

384
00:21:49.451 --> 00:21:50.890
quite,
quite deliberately to,

385
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:54.610
to remove that power from the others who are going to come and take it in.

386
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.533
[inaudible]

387
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.340
<v 4>I've only been to a couple places.
I've been to a Chichi needs.
Uh,</v>

388
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.210
I've never been to Egypt,
but I've been to a,
at the,
um,

389
00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.980
one of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston had an Egyptian exhibit.

390
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:12.370
They had all this amazing old shit and the is so hard to wrap your head or even

391
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:18.710
the established timeline of 2,500 BC when you're looking at these structures,

392
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.450
it's so hard to wrap your head around.

393
00:22:20.451 --> 00:22:24.050
Like when you're looking at a beautiful gold and covered sarcophagus that you

394
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:28.880
know,
had King Tut and side of it.
It's like,
what,
what was that like?

395
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:34.130
You know what kind of a weird alternative way to live that these guys figure out

396
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.340
where they lose ends of years ago,

397
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:42.110
figured out how to build these almost perfect geometric structures of 2 million,

398
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:46.610
300,000 stones where if you fuck up just a little bit here or there,

399
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.040
by the time you get to the top it's done.
And they're like,
well,

400
00:22:49.041 --> 00:22:51.750
they did screw up a few of them.
There's a few of them.
The lopsided.
Yeah,
yeah,

401
00:22:51.751 --> 00:22:55.940
yeah.
But they got them right to who knows who the hell was doing a screw up.

402
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.070
Ones that could have been imitated

403
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.630
<v 3>ones were done later.
Bye.
By by,
um,</v>

404
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.330
the copiers skills based basically is,

405
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.400
that's the mystery of Egypt is that that a,
and John West makes this point,

406
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.570
but that a,
it's perfect at the beginning and it slowly declines.

407
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.830
This is not what we expect.
We expect to see civilizations slowly rise.

408
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.420
We don't expect to see them perfect,

409
00:23:17.421 --> 00:23:20.690
fully formed at the beginning and then take 3000 years to end.
Right.

410
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.610
<v 4>Well,
even when you pushed back the established timeline and you know,
we,</v>

411
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:28.190
we can't even wrap our head around a thousand years.
I mean,

412
00:23:28.191 --> 00:23:30.440
a thousand years is very difficult to wrap your head around.

413
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.480
Why do you think it's so difficult for them to embrace the pretty obvious

414
00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:40.130
possibility that things get wiped out?
I mean,
there's craters all over the moon.

415
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.300
We know there's all sorts of spots all over,
you know,

416
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:46.340
you'll go drive by the giant crater in Nevada.
It's a mile wide

417
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.770
<v 5>boom,
something hits,
everybody gets fucked.</v>

418
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.580
That easily could have happened over and over again throughout history.

419
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.960
And just that seems to me to be way more likely than we made it all the way from

420
00:23:56.961 --> 00:24:00.560
caveman to here without a hiccup,
with a single hiccup.
That's crazy.

421
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.590
<v 3>And this leads,
you know,
this,
this,</v>

422
00:24:02.591 --> 00:24:07.330
this leads to certainly led me to conclude that that um,

423
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.720
academic history,
um,
is part of,
uh,

424
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.400
this sounds a bit paranoid,

425
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:16.750
but part of an overall system of kind of mind control that that operates.

426
00:24:16.751 --> 00:24:20.440
There are certain things that we're allowed to think and certain parameters that

427
00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:24.520
we are allowed to think within in our society.
And,
and when it comes to the past,

428
00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:28.270
those parameters are set by academics and they'd get so territorial and so

429
00:24:28.271 --> 00:24:32.860
defensive when you tried to break out of that,
uh,
and,
and suggest other policy.

430
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:36.730
I thought naively when I got into this at first that,
uh,

431
00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:41.200
those who were specialists in this field would welcome some new ideas.
Um,

432
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.850
they might throw them out in the end,

433
00:24:42.851 --> 00:24:45.550
but they would want to see whether there was any merit to the ideas.

434
00:24:45.551 --> 00:24:48.660
And so initially I was really shocked that the attitude is,
oh,

435
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.960
this idea doesn't agree with us.

436
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.380
We are going to destroy this idea in any way we can add.

437
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.740
Not only that we're going to destroy the individuals associated with this idea.

438
00:24:56.741 --> 00:24:58.390
We will attack the man and the idea

439
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.310
<v 5>ad hominem attack.
Exactly,
exactly.
And a very dirty tricks kind of way.</v>

440
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:02.880
It's only later

441
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.481
<v 3>Toronto actually,</v>

442
00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:07.380
that I came to realize that academics all treat each other this way as well.

443
00:25:07.381 --> 00:25:10.200
They're all there.
They're all very Terrett,
very territorial.

444
00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.280
They are all ego driven.

445
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:15.870
They have their power base in a particular view and they defend that view to

446
00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:16.600
the,
to the

447
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.260
<v 5>death.
Now when you say the doctor shock is a very conservative,</v>

448
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.120
you're not joking around about that.

449
00:25:22.121 --> 00:25:25.150
And I always wonder when I hear some of the things that he says about other

450
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:27.040
ancient structures,
I always wonder,
wow,

451
00:25:27.041 --> 00:25:29.170
I wonder if he took too much heat from the Sphinx.

452
00:25:29.171 --> 00:25:30.880
And now he like backs off on stuff.

453
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.420
He's very Bosnian pyramid and even the Japanese structure,

454
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:35.320
did you say went there?

455
00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:39.940
I went there with shock and he's crazy and shock would not,
that's crazy.

456
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.290
He shoved.
Wouldn't a shock,
a shock

457
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.500
<v 3>would not accept that it was a manmade structure bed.</v>

458
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.940
But I have to say that at that point,
um,

459
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.520
you want a Goonie is a very difficult dive.
It's a very difficult time.

460
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:52.660
The seas are wild.

461
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.350
There's a huge current flows right in front of the monument and you have to be

462
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.010
an accomplished diver to do any work.
Uh,

463
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.040
shock was on his second open water dive at this point and a on those initial

464
00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:08.200
dives that we did on,
on a Goonie,
um,

465
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.570
he was largely fighting for his life.

466
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.050
<v 5>Do
you guys have balls?</v>

467
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.250
I love it.
It's very,
you know,
but my wife's Santo,
who,

468
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.340
who's a photographer and I sound right here with us,
have done,
yeah,
man.

469
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:28.180
<v 3>Um,
uh,
more than 200 plus dives on the Yana Goonie monument.</v>

470
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.650
We went through the process of learning to dive and really getting the skills to

471
00:26:32.651 --> 00:26:34.300
be able to handle that kind of current,

472
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:38.080
which is literally gonna rip your mask off your face and take your regulator out

473
00:26:38.081 --> 00:26:43.030
of your mouth.
Um,
it's like swimming in a river against the current actually.

474
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.070
So what I would say is that I think shock was a little premature with that

475
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:49.110
conclusion and I think,
uh,
he,
he's,

476
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:52.110
I have huge respect for rubbish shock and I have huge respect for his openness

477
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.090
of mind at his geological acumen,

478
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.600
but there's not enough time was spent on the monument to reach that decision.

479
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.390
And it's not just one monument.
It's a whole complex of monuments.

480
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:05.100
And further north settles it for me off a Aki nowhere,

481
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.460
which is about four or 500 miles north of Yana Goonie.

482
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.470
There is a majestic stone circle,
110 feet beneath the water,
which again,

483
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:17.870
something I've dived on extensively,
which shock has not seen a,

484
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.010
which is there's just no way on earth that that monument could have been their

485
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.580
photos of this online.
Yes,
we do.
We have photos on my website I look for,
um,
okay.

486
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:29.010
You go on to www grab,

487
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.030
I'm sure if I just Google it and go to Graham hancock.com okay.

488
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.050
And then go to gallery

489
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.550
and then go to underwater.
We have underwater on the gallery.

490
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.320
<v 1>Okay.
Under water.
Yes.</v>

491
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.050
<v 3>And in the underwater section you're going to see a stone circle from where</v>

492
00:27:51.051 --> 00:27:54.140
there with uh,
with somebody above it holding a video camera.

493
00:27:54.141 --> 00:27:57.470
That's me holding the video camera.
Yeah.
And down on the,

494
00:27:57.471 --> 00:28:01.400
down below you is a stone circle and there's probably some more shots of it.

495
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.200
I'm going to just come around and see what you're looking at there.

496
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.130
I was looking at this right here.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
That's the stone circle.

497
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.170
This is the central upright and these are the surrounding uprights.
Yeah.

498
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:15.500
That's somebody made that get out of this thing.
This thing is 12 feet high.

499
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.690
Wow.
And it's 110 feet beneath the seat.
Yeah.
So cool.

500
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.610
Wow.
That's incredible.
That's amazing.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

501
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:26.450
Um,

502
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:31.450
and 110 feet beneath the sea tells us that it was made at least 13,000 years ago

503
00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.010
because that's the last time that 110 foot level was above sea level.

504
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.940
<v 2>Well that makes sense with Robert Schoch about these ruins,
the Japanese ruins,</v>

505
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:43.500
cause there's one of them that really freaked me out.

506
00:28:43.501 --> 00:28:46.830
I watched a documentary on it where they showed this,
these two monolith.

507
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.730
We talked earlier,

508
00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:51.300
I described them as pizza boxes with the giant stone pizza boxes.

509
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.330
There were so perfectly cut in laying right next to each other.

510
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.970
I would just think you would look at that and you'd have to throw everything

511
00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:59.810
else away.
You look at that and you're like,
that's not a natural phenomenon.

512
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.550
Somebody,
there's right angles everywhere that sends off.

513
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.260
<v 3>Well it does.
I mean the beauty and the perfection of the thing is,</v>

514
00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:08.160
is is part of it,
but,
but part of it,

515
00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:11.070
which needs to be needs to be taken into account.

516
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.100
I can understand why some geologists feel that it must be natural.

517
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.800
And this is this.

518
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.080
This is the reason that the stone is a sedimentary stone is laid down in layers

519
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.350
and some of the layers are soft and some of them are hard.

520
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.940
And their argument is that the sea battering against these less selectively

521
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:34.290
remove the soft layers and left the hard layers producing this step defect.

522
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.680
The problem with that is that if that happened,

523
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.010
then you would expect to see the very large amount of rubble,

524
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.600
which was created by removing all these layers.

525
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.190
You'd expect to see it lying in a disorganized mass down at the bottom of the

526
00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:51.550
monument.
Uh,
which the tea,
the from top to bottom,

527
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:53.320
the monuments about 70 feet high.

528
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:56.060
So 70 feet down and all of it's under water because the,
that you,

529
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.260
it's the bottom is about 110 feet below the sea.

530
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.370
So you would expect to find that rubble lying at the base of the monument.

531
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.870
Actually what you do find is a beautiful path cutout of solid rock at the base

532
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:12.430
of the monument and all the rubble cleared to the side pushed away,
uh,

533
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.780
forming a bank,
which is no way on earth that could have been done by nature.

534
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.110
It had to be done by man.
That's what peer,
that's what people do.
They clear away,

535
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:23.950
rubble,
tidy it up and leave a nice looking site.
And that's what,
that's what is,

536
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.700
that's what is there.
So it's little details like that plus the,

537
00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.970
the fact that there isn't just one monument,
there's actually about five,
uh,

538
00:30:31.971 --> 00:30:35.470
along a good four miles of the coast,
uh,

539
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.140
makes it impossible for me to accept that it's a natural phenomenon.

540
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.690
<v 4>And I guess the question comes up when you,</v>

541
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.780
when you talk about ancient monuments are ancient civilizations for 14,000 plus

542
00:30:45.781 --> 00:30:49.500
years ago,
how much really would be left?
It's a long time.

543
00:30:49.501 --> 00:30:53.190
The sole long we are,
we are for it.
To put it in perspective.

544
00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:56.970
The House that we're in and 14,000 years will absolutely not be here.
Now.

545
00:30:56.971 --> 00:31:00.510
If we leave,
it's going to be completely gone.
There'll be almost no evidence.

546
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.730
The earth will devour these computers.

547
00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:06.440
It will devour the leather and the table and the chairs to rueful cave in and

548
00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:10.950
we'll all go into dirt,
dirt.
We'll fill it over.
Lava will come.
Earthquakes,

549
00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:12.840
we'll shift things.
It'd be gone.

550
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.360
<v 3>Will be forgotten,
forgotten,
forgotten.
It would be very,</v>

551
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.100
very easy for that to happen.
Then consider the effect of ice.
Uh,

552
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.460
consider it.
Consider the fact that,
uh,
during the last ice age,

553
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:29.790
North America and northern Europe were covered with these gigantic ice caps.

554
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.740
There.
You're talking ice,
which is two to three miles deep.

555
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.560
<v 4>Your website's getting crushed right now.
Generally get on your website.</v>

556
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.880
All these,
sorry about that.
Interrupt your getting smashed.

557
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.030
So could use.
Yeah,
there's a lot of people on that sucker.

558
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.450
<v 3>Glad to hear it.
Um,
you know,
so,
so I'm sorry,
I lost my thread.</v>

559
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.220
<v 4>I'm so sorry.
We're talking about North America.</v>

560
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.690
<v 3>So the ice forms on the continental land mass of the u s end of Europe,</v>

561
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.500
it builds up to a depth of two miles and it's in motion.

562
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.400
Consider what's happening to anything underneath that under two miles of ice.

563
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.240
It's being ground to a powder to a fine powder.
It's like,
uh,

564
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.260
it's like just wiping out,
literally wiping out the park.

565
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.700
<v 4>So that's why it was such a big deal to find that ice man because he had fallen</v>

566
00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:21.930
into a crevice and sort of the glacier had passed over him and never touched
him.

567
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.530
Wait,
what ice man,
what's this guy?
Let's

568
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.670
<v 3>see.
In,
in Italy,</v>

569
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.170
he's about five and a half thousand years old and he fell into a glazier in the

570
00:32:30.171 --> 00:32:34.850
obs and he came out of it again in the late 20th century.
Uh,

571
00:32:34.851 --> 00:32:37.880
and uh,
there's an interesting story actually.
It's fascinating.

572
00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:41.660
It looks like he was murdered.
Uh,
they found an Arrow embedded in his body.

573
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:45.590
He and he was looked like he'd been ambushed and shot up there

574
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.290
<v 2>and he died there and frozen was covered with snow immediately and then he was</v>

575
00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:53.430
preserved than some hikers found his body.
It's amazing story,
man.

576
00:32:53.431 --> 00:32:57.390
But what's incredible is that if this,
if Graham's view of history is true,

577
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.460
then this guy 5,000 years ago was really like some dude who survived some

578
00:33:02.461 --> 00:33:05.080
horrible cataclysmic event,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

579
00:33:05.081 --> 00:33:10.050
the civilization moved for people,
relearn things,
relearned hunting,

580
00:33:10.051 --> 00:33:11.040
re-learned,
you know,

581
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.030
making skins and turning them into fabric or turning them into clothes.

582
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:20.130
What's your,
what,
what's your theory of where it all started?

583
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.520
Where,
where did we come from?
Why,
where did humans originate?
Okay.
Okay.

584
00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:28.830
<v 3>Well,
I think that,
um,
I'm,
I'm not against the,
uh,</v>

585
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.240
academic reconstruction of the human family tree.
I think they've done some,

586
00:33:33.241 --> 00:33:36.480
I think they've done some quite good work.
So,
uh,
tell us your question.

587
00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:38.670
I'll have to go back to,
uh,

588
00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:42.270
go back quite far to the last common ancestor with the chimpanzee,

589
00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:46.710
which is about 6 million years ago.
And then from then,
um,

590
00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.630
you get a gradual emergence of a creature who begins to look more and more

591
00:33:51.631 --> 00:33:54.270
human.
And by two and a half million years ago,

592
00:33:54.271 --> 00:33:56.280
that creature is making stone tools.

593
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.850
The first sign of real intelligent activity,

594
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.170
I'm going to turn the air conditioning,
but the,
but the stone tools,
um,

595
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.920
are very limited and once the creature has invented them,

596
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:11.520
it doesn't change for the next million years.

597
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.490
The stone tools stay exactly the same.

598
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.210
So we know that they're passing down cultural information and we also know that

599
00:34:18.211 --> 00:34:22.350
they're extremely rigid in their thought patterns and they're stuck in that.

600
00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.770
Then a new type of stone tool is introduced and that one sticks for another

601
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.870
million years as well.
Um,
and during this time,

602
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.550
our ancestors of looking more and more like us.
And finally,

603
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.911
uh,

604
00:34:35.911 --> 00:34:40.911
the earliest surviving fully anatomically modern human skeleton comes from

605
00:34:42.091 --> 00:34:43.710
Ethiopia.
As a matter of fact,

606
00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:48.740
and it's 195,000 years old as just short of 200,000 years old.

607
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.310
Before that,
we,
the,
the,
the creatures were closely related to us,

608
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:56.430
but they didn't look quite like us.
And their brains were not quite like ours,

609
00:34:56.431 --> 00:35:00.330
but by 195,000 years ago,
anatomically modern humans have evolved,

610
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.540
but their behavior has not evolved.
Their behavior is stuck,
uh,
in,

611
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:09.750
in that archaic period.
And they're still using the same limited,

612
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.900
unimaginative stone tools that were being used a million years before.

613
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.030
And then it's a really extraordinary thing happens and it's within the last

614
00:35:18.031 --> 00:35:19.470
50,000 years,

615
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.450
is that you just get this incredible surge forward in,
in human behavior.

616
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.720
Uh,
the dawn of spiritual beliefs,
the,
they're very,

617
00:35:27.721 --> 00:35:31.440
very clear because they started burying food and water with the debt that

618
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.520
anybody who does that,

619
00:35:32.521 --> 00:35:35.700
they definitely believed that some aspect of the individual continues after

620
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:40.260
death and they created the great cave art,
the amazing,
amazing painting,

621
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:41.400
stunning works of art.

622
00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.890
All of the symbolic behavior seem to just switch on kind of overnight somewhere

623
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.430
after 50,000 years ago.
And I,
so I would,

624
00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.310
I would start the clock about there where,
where,

625
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:56.520
where suddenly you've got these incredibly intelligent,
artistic,

626
00:35:56.521 --> 00:36:00.360
creative creatures on the planet who are asked and they are doing this stuff.

627
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:02.870
And I,
and I believe that some of them,
uh,

628
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.270
stayed in the hunter gatherer mode all the way through,

629
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.670
all the way through history.
Uh,
the,
and,
and those were the,

630
00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:12.810
the cave artists and they have what's called the Upper Paleolithic.

631
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.430
And I think some of them moved in another direction and formed a civilization.

632
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.170
And just as today on,
in,
in our 21st century world,
uh,

633
00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:27.150
we have highly advanced technological civilizations coexisting with hunter

634
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.270
gatherers.
You do still have traditional hunter gatherers in the Amazon,

635
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:34.920
in Botswana,
for example.
Uh,
I believe it was the same in the world then.
Uh,

636
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.940
and I think that the,

637
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:40.710
the what I think of as the lost civilization was largely Ameritime civilization,

638
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.300
living along coastlines,
living on the best land during the ice age,
cause inland.

639
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:49.270
It was horrid.
It was cold.
That was the ice meant.
There was no rain.
Right,
right.

640
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.490
It's totally desert.
Um,
very,
very difficult to live.
But on the coasts,

641
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.720
things were much better.

642
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.430
And it was precisely the coasts that we're inundated when mysteriously and

643
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:04.320
suddenly the ice age ended and all that ice started to melt down and went back

644
00:37:04.321 --> 00:37:06.720
into the ocean and the sea levels rose.

645
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.700
<v 4>And you think that,
I mean,
I read,
I've read all your books.</v>

646
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:15.410
I read a supernatural as well,
just one of my more favorite or more,
uh,

647
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:20.000
what I found more fascinating because if you really stepped down on some serious

648
00:37:20.001 --> 00:37:23.300
limbs on that one,
man did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

649
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:28.040
you come from the journey from being a journalist who was covering this thing in

650
00:37:28.041 --> 00:37:30.380
Ethiopia to supernatural,

651
00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:35.381
which insinuates that humanity has probably learned a good deal of what we are

652
00:37:36.831 --> 00:37:38.640
and what we've become because of psychedelic drugs.

653
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:42.130
<v 3>I believe that's absolutely the case.
And,
and I think that,
uh,</v>

654
00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.960
with the current a demonization of psychedelic drugs in our society,

655
00:37:46.961 --> 00:37:48.340
it's a huge mistake.

656
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.360
<v 4>How much resistance have you felt from that book?</v>

657
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:55.240
<v 3>Well,
I've had an enormous amount of resistance to it.
Um,
because,
uh,
we have had,</v>

658
00:37:55.241 --> 00:37:59.770
um,
a mind programming exercise called the war on drugs for the last 40 years,

659
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:04.330
which has been designed to create an internal enemy in our societies and

660
00:38:04.331 --> 00:38:06.040
convince people that there are these evil,

661
00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.980
wicked groups who are doing these terrible sinful things,

662
00:38:08.981 --> 00:38:10.960
smoking these drugs and doing,
doing this and that.

663
00:38:10.961 --> 00:38:14.590
And it's very dark image has been created around it and people get very upset

664
00:38:14.591 --> 00:38:17.890
irrationally about this,
uh,
about this whole issue.

665
00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.780
And actually what's been forgotten in,
uh,
in all of this and from,
for me,

666
00:38:22.781 --> 00:38:26.830
it's become,
I regard it as an extremely important issue,
uh,

667
00:38:26.831 --> 00:38:29.550
is that when the state,
um,

668
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.780
sends us to prison for essentially exploring our own,

669
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.390
uh,
this is a grotesque abuse of human rights.
It's a,
it's a fundamental wrong.

670
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.370
If I as an adult have not sovereign over my own consciousness,

671
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:47.380
then I'm absolutely not sovereign over anything.

672
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.430
I can't claim any kind of freedom at all.
And,
and,

673
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.340
and what has happened over the last 40 or 50 years under the disguise of the war

674
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:59.341
on drugs is that that we have been persuaded to hand over the keys of our

675
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:03.040
consciousness to the state,
the most precious,
the most intimate,

676
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.110
the most sapient part of ourselves.

677
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.140
The state now has the keys and furthermore,

678
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.840
they've persuaded us that that's in our interests.

679
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.700
This is a very dangerous situation.

680
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:14.310
<v 2>Have you ever,
there was a,</v>

681
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:19.380
an article that was recently published a about people and creativity and that,

682
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:21.810
you know,
everyone says they love creative ideas,

683
00:39:21.811 --> 00:39:25.140
but the truth is amongst non creative people,
creative ideas,

684
00:39:25.141 --> 00:39:28.290
make them confrontational,
makes them upset and make them defensive.

685
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.300
When when you start talking about experiences like psychedelic experiences,

686
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.890
one of the things that always freaks me out is the people's inability to even

687
00:39:37.891 --> 00:39:42.390
consider that there's a difference between a psychedelic experience on drugs and

688
00:39:42.391 --> 00:39:43.860
a drug that's going to ruin your life.

689
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.120
They're not even interested in considering that possibility.

690
00:39:48.121 --> 00:39:51.200
There's two different,
it's like the same thing.
It's like someone resisting

691
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.590
<v 3>definitely.
And that again,
that's the result.
Lesser of this.</v>

692
00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:57.990
Remember that the programming funded with our money,
our taxpayers money.

693
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.360
There has been 40 years of programming,

694
00:40:00.361 --> 00:40:04.710
more than 40 years on this subject to make us all develop a kind of a version of

695
00:40:04.711 --> 00:40:09.270
a fear or hatred,
the horror of of,
of,
of drugs.

696
00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:12.930
And this is,
it's just fundamentally wrong in so in so many ways,

697
00:40:12.931 --> 00:40:17.931
look quite a number of illegal drugs are actually really bad and really

698
00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:21.270
dangerous and they will totally fuck you up in all kinds of,

699
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.410
in all kinds of ways.

700
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:27.890
But I believe that the sovereignty of the adult over his or her own body and his

701
00:40:30.091 --> 00:40:32.140
or her own mind trumps everything else should.

702
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.610
And we must have the right to make our mistakes.
You know,

703
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.540
we already have laws in our society for punishing bad behavior.

704
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.370
If somebody on drugs goes out and gets in somebody else's face and causes them

705
00:40:44.371 --> 00:40:45.204
trouble,

706
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.750
we already have laws to deal that we don't need new laws that control our

707
00:40:48.751 --> 00:40:52.650
consciousness and rigidly place it in a prison and actually placed us in prison.

708
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.070
So we explored that courtroom.

709
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.820
<v 2>You just said that we already have laws to keep it from doing bad things.</v>

710
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.480
It's so important.
We don't.
Yeah,
it seems so logical.
It's like so clear.

711
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.920
If you can drink and not do anything bad,
go drink.
Exactly.

712
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.610
If he's going to smoke pot and not doing anything bad to your fellow human,

713
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.210
<v 3>go smoke pot.
If that's what you want to do.
If that's your adult decision,</v>

714
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.940
that's your choice.
That what does liberty mean if it,

715
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.330
if it doesn't mean that the people in the right get into this ridiculous,

716
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:23.000
just obey the law.
Why is it such a hard time?
What are you a Druggie?

717
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.530
You new drugs get through this life.

718
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.190
<v 2>We say this is such an illogical argument cause imagine if we were on an island,</v>

719
00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:31.440
we're the only people on the planet and there was only four of us.

720
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.010
There's only four of us.
One of us wanted to

721
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.270
<v 3>smoke pot and we said,
no,
we gotta lock this guy and put in a fucking cage.</v>

722
00:41:37.271 --> 00:41:40.290
He's crazy and we decided to use it to that debt.

723
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.590
Then you really see the dicey how silly it is.
Like you,

724
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.710
you would just lock this guy.
But again,
you can't smoke pot.

725
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:46.640
We made a law against it.

726
00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.450
Like what that for is just as ridiculous as 4 million,

727
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.500
400 million or what?
It's just as ridiculous an extraordinary thing.
And,

728
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:58.760
and you have to consider what it's led to in our society in all kinds of ways.

729
00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:03.500
It's led to the creation of huge armed bureaucracies who have the right to break

730
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:07.730
into our homes,
smashed down our doors,
humiliate us in every possible way,

731
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.230
ruin our lives with,
with,
with criminal records and all.

732
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:16.280
Because what we're,
we're,
we're smoking some natural natural herb,
which we,
which,

733
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.550
which affects our own consciousness in some way.
So again,

734
00:42:19.551 --> 00:42:24.551
I say if we get into the faces of others to state may have a role to play and it

735
00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:29.030
does and it already has elaborate rules for dealing with that.

736
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.850
But for the state to have transgressed,

737
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:36.860
the consciousness of free sovereign adults is a grotesque abuse of human rights

738
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.320
and it doesn't work.
This is the other thing.

739
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.830
If the state could turn around and say,
the war on drugs has worked,

740
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.040
we have reduced the consumption of this,
that it's not true.

741
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:49.410
They haven't reduced the consumption of any drugs.
The consumption of the El,

742
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:52.130
all illegal drugs has gone up,
up and up and up and up and up.

743
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.250
Let's take another drug.
Tobacco,

744
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.950
you never got sent to jail for smoking tobacco.

745
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.250
You never got your life for Real Indo your front door broken down.

746
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.380
But some years ago people cottoned on to the notion that tobacco actually maybe

747
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:09.360
making yes,
pretty unwell.
If we're smoking a lot of tobacco,
uh,

748
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.760
seems to be a connection with lung cancer.
And this was,
uh,

749
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.240
this information was put forward.

750
00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.440
Look what's happened with tobacco in the last 20 years.
Millions,

751
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.580
millions and millions of adults all over the world presented with that

752
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.500
information,
have taken a personal sovereign decision to stop smoking cigarettes.

753
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.190
I took that decision when I was 38 years old.
I used to,
I'm 61 now.

754
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.930
I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a,
I was a journalist,
you know,

755
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.980
cigarette hanging out of their mouth type writer.
I was a heavy smoker,

756
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.340
but I took the decision,
I came to the collusion.
This is not good for my body.

757
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.310
You know,
Steven King said that it was a,

758
00:43:45.311 --> 00:43:49.790
as a neurotransmitter and enhancer that he suffered when he stopped smoking.

759
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:54.670
So many writers,
but when you are right,
why did you smoke so much as a writer?
Uh,

760
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.310
it helps.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it does.
It definitely did.
It definitely did help,
uh,

761
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.820
as as does marijuana.
Um,
but uh,
but uh,

762
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.860
the fact is that there is,

763
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.140
the point that I want to make is that is that if the state was really interested

764
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:12.260
in helping us,
this is how the war on drugs is presented,

765
00:44:12.261 --> 00:44:15.860
were concerned about your health.
So we're going to send you to prison.
You know,

766
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.200
we're concerned about the harm this drug is doing to you,

767
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.760
so we're going to send you to prison.

768
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.840
What's more harmful to harm the drug is doing,
are being sent to prison.

769
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:26.030
It seems to be pretty obvious that the being sent to prison is a much more

770
00:44:26.031 --> 00:44:28.820
harmful thing.
That's a,
that that's being done.

771
00:44:28.821 --> 00:44:33.540
If the state was really concerned about harm,

772
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.190
then the solution is not to criminalize people for taking drugs.

773
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.680
The solution is to present them with very good information,

774
00:44:40.681 --> 00:44:43.590
which they believe part of the problem is that the state has become,

775
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:48.270
to be regarded as so corrupt that any message emanating from the state about

776
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:52.980
drugs is not believed anymore completely.
Disbelieved.
Um,
so,
so,
you know,

777
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.000
once again,
we come to this issue of adult sovereignty,
uh,

778
00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.540
over over consciousness and our right also to make mistakes with our own body.

779
00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:01.900
If we do that,
that's what we,

780
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.920
I believe we are here on this earth to learn and to grow and to develop.

781
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:09.060
And we have to have adult responsibility to do that always astonishes me in

782
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.070
America where you have the Republican Party,

783
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.860
which is strongly in favor of individual freedoms,

784
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:18.500
that is often republicans who are the ones who are most anti-drugs.
Uh,

785
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.760
I feel the drugs is a republican issue.

786
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.120
I think that any true Republican should absolutely champion the right of every

787
00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:30.870
adult individual if they choose to do so,
to explore their own consciousness,
uh,

788
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.440
with any drugs they choose.
There.
There's no real parties anymore.

789
00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.000
It's just a mixed mash.

790
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.220
I mean Obama is just as much of a Republican has any republican that's ever been

791
00:45:40.221 --> 00:45:44.190
in office.
I've seen this,
I've seen this happening.
It's weird assimilation.
Yeah,

792
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.960
it is so sure.
Fuck no matter what.

793
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:51.480
And there's the same purchasing Lee because really our society is being run by a

794
00:45:51.481 --> 00:45:52.141
gigantic,

795
00:45:52.141 --> 00:45:56.700
faceless bureaucracies now and those are much more dangerous than anything else

796
00:45:56.701 --> 00:45:58.800
cause they don't even have a figurehead.
They just continue,

797
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:02.510
they roll on and they run and they run people's lives.
But the,
the,

798
00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.730
the aspect of society where powers that be,

799
00:46:05.731 --> 00:46:10.410
are trying to control people's mental,
um,
uh,
territory.

800
00:46:10.411 --> 00:46:13.130
This is not a new thing has been going on for very,

801
00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.610
very long time and newest incarnation.
We had witch burnings where exactly.

802
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.660
Exactly.
I would say that that in our societies today,

803
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.070
drug users play the same role as which is played in Europe in the 16th century.

804
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.320
That's fundamentally what's going on there.

805
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:32.190
An internal enemy which the society can be mobilized to hate because that's what

806
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:32.851
the state does.

807
00:46:32.851 --> 00:46:36.960
It makes people hate and fear and suspect other people because then they want to

808
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:41.040
rely on the state for their defense and their protection.
It's a game.

809
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:43.500
It's a mind game and it's been going on for a very long time.

810
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:47.970
And it happens that the current victims are drug users.
Um,
and,

811
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:48.870
and uh,
you know,

812
00:46:48.871 --> 00:46:52.500
the word that it's interesting to the language itself has been deployed in this

813
00:46:52.501 --> 00:46:57.501
war so that you very rarely find the word drug separated from the word abuse

814
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:58.561
that you'd ever find,

815
00:46:58.561 --> 00:47:02.190
that the notion of a responsible use of drugs you find only the notion of

816
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.420
abusive drugs.
Um,
and,

817
00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:08.370
and so it's become impossible almost to speak about drugs without incorporating

818
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:11.300
this,
this notion that there's some abuse is taking place.
Yeah.

819
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.850
And the idea that you can actually benefit from them is an alien thought,

820
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:19.860
completely alien,
very,
very much hated by,
by our society.
And yet,
you know,

821
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:21.150
the research is coming through.

822
00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:25.350
We've had the research in the last year with Psilocybin,
uh,
easing

823
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.340
anxiety of terminal cancer patients Mtma with,

824
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.680
<v 0>um,
with post traumatic stress disorder for fantastically successful as well.</v>

825
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.020
<v 4>And cancer.
Apparently,</v>

826
00:47:36.021 --> 00:47:39.040
if you've seen that where they're saying no super doses of MDM may,
may,

827
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.450
may treat cancer.

828
00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.160
<v 0>Oh,
joy and love that you'd feel just kills all the bad stuff.
I know.</v>

829
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:50.110
I mean these,
you know,
these,
these,
um,
I believe that,
well,

830
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:53.260
Aldous Huxley called the psychedelics gratuitous.
Grace's.

831
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:56.800
There's something that nature nature just gave us for free kind of grace to,

832
00:47:56.801 --> 00:48:01.450
to allow us to experience a something else.

833
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.580
Um,
and um,

834
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.840
<v 4>didn't Huxley coined the Term Psychedelic?</v>

835
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:08.440
He's the one who came up quite possibly.
Yeah,
it was.
Yeah.
Actually.
And um,

836
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.750
I can't remember the other person.
I Ah,
shit man.
Yeah,
I think that they were,

837
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.070
they had different,
they were trying to come up with a word.

838
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:16.990
They had another word that they were going to use for it,

839
00:48:16.991 --> 00:48:18.760
but it sounded too unsigned

840
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.720
<v 0>typically.
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
You're right.
Yeah,
definitely.</v>

841
00:48:21.721 --> 00:48:24.990
So I can dogs the perfect word.
They nailed it.
They nailed it.
They nailed it.

842
00:48:24.991 --> 00:48:25.710
Yeah.

843
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:26.543
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

844
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:31.600
What do you subscribe to Mckenna's ideas about the stoned ape theory.

845
00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:32.341
You know,

846
00:48:32.341 --> 00:48:36.330
that theory that human beings may have actually evolved from the lower primates

847
00:48:36.331 --> 00:48:38.070
because of the fact that we ate mushrooms.

848
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.870
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
I came to that idea.
Uh,
I,</v>

849
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:45.190
I'd like to say Terence Mckenna,

850
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.740
one of the great minds,
France,
fascinating.
What a wonderful man,
amazing person.

851
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:55.490
What a wonderful man and incredible loss that we lost.
Terrence.

852
00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.250
He,
he,
he was a remarkable individual and I never met him unfortunately.

853
00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.320
Um,
but he,
uh,
I love listening to his voice.
I love his voice.

854
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.320
I have a whole section on my iPod is all turns.
We can have lectures.

855
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:13.710
Sometimes we go down to Brazil sometimes to drink IOWASCA and,

856
00:49:13.801 --> 00:49:16.210
and sometimes in the late in,

857
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:19.870
and I'll ask a session as you're beginning to return to this reality.

858
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:22.100
It's nice to play a bit of music or a little bit of voice and,

859
00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:25.420
and sometimes we play Terence Mckenna and I,
I,

860
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:29.620
and I just remember one line was about how psychedelics dissolve boundaries.

861
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.670
And he says,
you know,
they'll dissolve boundaries between you and your cat,

862
00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.680
even between you and your washing machine.

863
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.770
And I have had wonderful ideas and he,
he very intuitively,
very far,

864
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:45.720
far ahead of his time,
uh,
grasped the notion that this,
um,

865
00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:50.590
sudden advancement of humanity,
uh,
had to do with psychedelics.
It,
it,

866
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.330
what it did was it broke our rigid behavior patterns that we were stuck in and

867
00:49:55.331 --> 00:49:58.360
unable to change and it opened us up to new possibilities.

868
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:01.780
And you'll see this remarkable event taking place after 50,000 years ago,

869
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.080
definitely to do with psychedelics.
Now,
you know,
since that time,

870
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:06.100
there's a parallel track,

871
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:09.400
which is the academic work on cave art and Psychedelics,

872
00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:13.030
which is professor David Lewis Williams of the University of Witwatersrand in

873
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:13.864
South Africa.

874
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.700
And he has absolutely taken it beyond intuition and totally proved without any

875
00:50:18.701 --> 00:50:23.701
doubt whatsoever that all of the cave art was inspired by visionary experiences

876
00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:27.260
on psychedelics.
There's just no doubt about that.
All prove that you prove it.

877
00:50:27.261 --> 00:50:28.010
By the nature of the

878
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.060
<v 3>art itself,
it contains,
it's rich with what are called entoptic phenomenon.</v>

879
00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:37.160
Certain patterns,
zigzags grids,
um,
hexagons,

880
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:41.360
um,
uh,
honeycomb patterns into nested curved lines.

881
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.120
The caves are covered in all of these go around too.
You know,

882
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:46.700
the Rock Canyons in Utah,
you'll see the same thing.

883
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:50.180
Rock art all over the world is really,
is influenced by visionary experiences.

884
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.160
And then classically,

885
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.290
the absolute defining characteristic is the appearance of beings or entities in

886
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.124
the art.

887
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:02.450
And those entities are typically half human and half animal.

888
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.471
They are,

889
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:07.880
it's called a 30 anthrop for us from the Greek theory on which means wild beast

890
00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:10.310
and anthropos which means man.
Um,

891
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.170
and this is one of the definitive uh,

892
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:18.430
aspects of deep visionary experience is encountering a entities who communicate

893
00:51:19.581 --> 00:51:24.350
with you and who are often often encountered in this half man,

894
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:28.940
half human forms.
So it's interesting that work done in the 1960s with,

895
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:31.180
for example,
masculine.
Um,

896
00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.450
they found that the volunteers were drawing the stuff they saw and one of the

897
00:51:35.451 --> 00:51:39.620
volunteers drew a man in a business suit with the head of a Fox.

898
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.610
Wow.
That was an entity that had come and spoken to him in the,

899
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.720
in the translate steak,

900
00:51:44.721 --> 00:51:49.400
no different from the man with the head of a lion and the body of a human being

901
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:53.300
that you find in Holland stage startle cave in Germany from 32,000 years ago.

902
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.460
<v 2>So what do you think is going on there?</v>

903
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:58.850
Do you think that you're dealing with entities that don't really have a form

904
00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:01.760
that we can understand so they present themselves and some cartoonish

905
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:04.310
combination of things that we're really aware of?

906
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.200
<v 3>Yeah.
Uh,
I think that,
I think,
and I'm going out on a limb here,</v>

907
00:52:08.201 --> 00:52:09.210
but I think that we're dealing,

908
00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:13.630
I don't believe consciousness is generated by the brain.
I,

909
00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.510
I believe the brain is more of a receiver of consciousness.

910
00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:19.770
I think that's really important distinction.
Um,

911
00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:24.280
the mainstream model of consciousness that we have in our society today

912
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:29.140
definitely sees it as produced by the brain.
The same way a factory makes cars.

913
00:52:29.141 --> 00:52:33.040
So,
so if you smash up the factory,
uh,

914
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:37.570
the car stopped being made,
the Ergo,
if you,
if the person dies,

915
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:41.140
the brain dies.
Consciousness is just blinks out,
gone,
finished.

916
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.600
That's the mainstream view.
But the view,

917
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:47.500
the other view that the brain is a transceiver or receiver of consciousness that

918
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:48.490
is manifesting,

919
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.970
it's the junction box that's manifesting consciousness on the physical realm.
Uh,

920
00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:57.670
that raises whole different possibilities.
Then when you destroy the receiver,

921
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.330
the signal is still there just as if you destroy a TV set,

922
00:53:01.331 --> 00:53:05.710
the TV signal is still there.
Um,
and,
and,
uh,
you get,

923
00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.140
you get into all kinds of possibilities from that.

924
00:53:08.141 --> 00:53:12.490
So the suggestion that I derive from that is that consciousness is fundamentally

925
00:53:12.491 --> 00:53:15.820
nonphysical,
but that for certain reasons,

926
00:53:15.821 --> 00:53:18.130
and they may be very deep and very mysterious,

927
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:23.320
consciousness has created realms in which it is possible to manifest physically

928
00:53:23.321 --> 00:53:24.700
because in a physical realm,

929
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:29.550
you all kinds of consequences to your actions that you would not have in a

930
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:30.600
nonphysical state.

931
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:35.870
A physical realm may be a very useful place to spend time if you're an ancient

932
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:41.550
soul who wishes to learn and grow and develop further.
Uh,
and that's,

933
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.500
that's how I've come to see it.
I think we're,
I think we,

934
00:53:43.501 --> 00:53:46.170
and that's how all ancient spiritual traditions see that we,

935
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:51.120
that we incarnate in these bodies in order to have the experience of life on

936
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:54.240
earth,
but we don't die when we die,
when these bodies died.

937
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:57.300
These bodies are like a suit of clothes that we're wearing for this incarnation.

938
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:59.840
<v 2>I've always subscribed to the idea that creativity,</v>

939
00:53:59.841 --> 00:54:03.340
when I'm at my best and most creative and when I'm performing doing standup

940
00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.090
comedy at my best and most creative,

941
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:09.410
I feel much more like a passenger than I do a driver.
Yes.

942
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.380
I feel like when I'm writing,
when I write my best stuff,

943
00:54:12.381 --> 00:54:15.280
I have no idea where it's coming from.
I'm not even really there apps,

944
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:18.560
I'm just moving my fingers and it's coming to me and it's not even me doing it.

945
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.230
And it sounds ridiculous and you could say that well,

946
00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:24.770
it's because really the ego gets in the way of creativity because you're always

947
00:54:24.771 --> 00:54:27.080
worrying about yourself.
And if you could just put the ego aside,

948
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.400
then your mind can work better.
And I see that argument,
but I don't really,

949
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:34.440
it feels like it comes to me in these great bursts of,

950
00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.270
of ideas that I never considered before and I'm like,
well wait,
where's that?

951
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:39.440
Is that,
it may be.

952
00:54:39.441 --> 00:54:43.430
That's really something that I'm figuring out a way to down from tune in.

953
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.270
<v 3>Yeah,
you're cheating.</v>

954
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:47.840
You're shooting into it and you're becoming a channel four for the material,

955
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:52.010
for your own material,
your,
your,
your,
your consciousness is,
is running the show,

956
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.480
but your consciousness is not limited to this realm and,

957
00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.280
and it's drawing down material from elsewhere.

958
00:54:58.281 --> 00:55:00.710
I've had the same experience with my,
with my writing.

959
00:55:00.711 --> 00:55:04.430
The more that I intellectualize the process and that's particularly true since

960
00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:08.430
I've turned to fiction,
the more that I intellectualize the process,
the,
the,

961
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:11.210
the harder the writing becomes and the sooner,

962
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:15.890
the sooner I let let off that intellectual control and just let it flow the

963
00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:16.500
better.
Again,

964
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.270
<v 2>it's so strange how it comes in waves though.
It's almost like you,</v>

965
00:55:19.271 --> 00:55:23.880
you can't keep tuned into the spiritual realm for any long period of time.

966
00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.030
I shake it off.
I know after like a few hours of writing,

967
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:29.970
my writing just starts to turn to shit and I'm like,
oh,
I guess it's off now.

968
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:34.630
It's back to me.
I was me writing and the right thing to do at that point is,

969
00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:38.610
is actually to say the laptop,
the laptop,
go,
go,
go and have a break.

970
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.590
You can save your work and try again tomorrow.
It's universal.
You know,

971
00:55:43.591 --> 00:55:45.180
there's a Steven Pressfield's book,

972
00:55:45.181 --> 00:55:48.900
the war of art that deals with the concept of the muse and it's a fantastic
book.

973
00:55:48.901 --> 00:55:52.380
And I used to buy stacks of them and give them to people.
I gave you one right?

974
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:56.030
<v 3>Amending that.
I'm a big fan of Pressfield.
I didn't know he'd written that.</v>

975
00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:59.680
<v 2>It's a brilliant book.
You know,
I think I have a copy of it.
I will give you one.</v>

976
00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.520
Um,
and it's,
um,
the brilliant thing about it is it's really no nonsense,

977
00:56:03.521 --> 00:56:06.940
but it's all about,
it's a no nonsense doing,
put the work in,

978
00:56:06.941 --> 00:56:09.430
force yourself to do it.
Don't make excuses,
put the work in.

979
00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.800
But then it's also about the muse.

980
00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.300
It's also about the idea that you are just sitting there and putting yourself in

981
00:56:16.301 --> 00:56:19.240
a position to tune into it.
You just have to show up.
You show up,

982
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:22.990
you move your fingers,
you the let the muse come to you.
And that the muse is,

983
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.980
yeah.
Well,

984
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.780
<v 0>let me tell you,
I mean,
I have been,
uh,
a nonfiction writer all my life.</v>

985
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:34.000
Um,
I started out,
as I mentioned in journalism,
I moved into ancient mysteries,

986
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:34.930
but it was always nonfiction.

987
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:37.240
You look at book like fingerprints of the Gods or underworld,

988
00:56:37.241 --> 00:56:39.880
the book about our art diving adventures,

989
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:44.800
and you'll find that there's 2000 footnotes,
you know,
um,
the very,
that they are,

990
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.630
I hope they're readable,
but they're also,
you know,
detailed research documents.

991
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.240
Um,
and that was the kind of,

992
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.470
that was the kind of writer I was until I encountered Iowasca.

993
00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:01.060
Uh,
and when I encountered Iowasca,
I had,

994
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.830
I started working with [inaudible] in 2003.
And the reason I started working,

995
00:57:05.831 --> 00:57:08.880
I had to had one psychedelic experience,
uh,

996
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:13.630
in 1974 with LSD.
And after that,
it was an amazing experience,

997
00:57:13.631 --> 00:57:14.110
by the way.

998
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:18.190
I had an app most incredible night at the Windsor Free Festival in England.

999
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.980
I spent the whole night wandering around.
They had,

1000
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.660
I kind of traveled back in time.
It was like being in a sort of medieval in camp.

1001
00:57:24.661 --> 00:57:29.170
It's just incredible.
But when I came out of that experience,
I thought to myself,

1002
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.150
hmm,
I was 20 I guess I was 24.
Then I thought if that went the other way,

1003
00:57:34.151 --> 00:57:36.880
that was a really powerful experience.
If that went the other way,

1004
00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:41.560
I'm not sure how I would handle it.
I thought it might really fuck me up.
And I,

1005
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.020
and I got a bit scared and I,
and I,

1006
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:46.910
and I'd heard stories of others who tad scary experiences.
And I thought,
I'm not,

1007
00:57:46.911 --> 00:57:49.000
I'm not to do that again.
And I didn't,
I didn't,

1008
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:53.800
I didn't take any psychedelics from the age of 24 until,
let's see,

1009
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:56.710
2003 when I was 53 years old.

1010
00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:01.170
And the reason that I started taking psychedelics again was because,
um,

1011
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:04.540
initially it was my research project.
I was writing supernatural.

1012
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:08.140
It was clear that the cave art had been influenced by psychedelics.

1013
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.470
Here was something I could experience for myself.
I've always felt as a writer,

1014
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.950
and I shouldn't be writing something if I'm not in it myself,

1015
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.420
I have to experience it,

1016
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:19.930
which is why when you were writing underworlds you learned how to dive diving

1017
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.410
and,
and,
and,
and ended up doing huge numbers of knives all,
all,

1018
00:58:23.411 --> 00:58:24.101
all around the world.

1019
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:28.390
It's the way that I work and therefore it was logical for me to investigate

1020
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:31.720
psychedelics once I started to write supernatural and I wanted to investigate

1021
00:58:31.721 --> 00:58:35.170
them in a shamonic setting.
Um,
I looked around the research,
the subject,

1022
00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:38.650
and it became clear that the Amazon was the place to go and Iowasca with

1023
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:41.590
thousands of years of indigenous use in the Amazon was a very,

1024
00:58:41.591 --> 00:58:46.120
very interesting substance indeed to,
uh,
to,
to investigate.
So,

1025
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:50.530
you know,
I went down there and,
um,
started to drink Ayahuasca.

1026
00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:55.720
IOWASCA worked changes on me in quite a number of ways.

1027
00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.750
It's made me more thoughtful and reflective person in some ways about my

1028
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.850
behavior and the impact of my behavior on others.

1029
00:59:03.851 --> 00:59:05.590
I'm still got a long way to go on that.

1030
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.480
They say in the Amazon that [inaudible] is a school,
uh,
don't expect,

1031
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.970
uh,
you know,
instant enlightenment.

1032
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.530
Actually all enlightenment is hard work and the hard work with Iowasca is

1033
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:21.070
integrating the revelations that it gives you.
Cause it will,

1034
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:25.640
of the things that I was good does is she does show you where you've been cruel

1035
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:29.270
and hurtful and unkind to others and she shows it you from the other person's

1036
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:34.040
point of view.
Um,
it's a lesson that you learn and,
and,

1037
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:37.880
but then integrating that into your own behavior in daily life is actually

1038
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:42.090
really difficult.
Lifetime of bad habits are very hard to change.
Uh,

1039
00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.250
and work has to be done in order to do that.
Uh,

1040
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.230
so I'll ask a house helped me to begin on that path.

1041
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:52.400
I do not claim to have reached any form of perfection very far from it.

1042
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:54.890
I'm a very imperfect,
frail human being,

1043
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:59.060
but I have at least been set on the path that I believe is a more positive one.

1044
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.250
But then something else I wanna ask.
It gave me,

1045
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.530
and it happened because I asked for it.

1046
01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.800
I had reached a point where I felt that I didn't want to go on with the

1047
01:00:09.051 --> 01:00:11.870
investigation of the lost civilization subject anymore.

1048
01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:15.320
Not because I had lost interest in it or because I turned against it,

1049
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.850
but because I felt that I'd taken it as far as I personally could after Santa

1050
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:24.230
and I had done six years of scuba diving all around the world and literally put

1051
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:28.100
our lives on the line and had and had revealed a great deal of stuff under water

1052
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:30.920
that people didn't know about.
I felt,
actually,

1053
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.850
I don't know where I take this next.
I,
there are a lot of young,

1054
01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:39.250
energetic people out there.
I would like them to take it on now for where,
where,

1055
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.730
where I took it from and I wanted,

1056
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:44.120
I wanted to look for a change of direction and I wanted to challenge myself as a

1057
01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:47.750
writer and I'd always wanted to write an awful,

1058
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.170
so down in Brazil,
uh,

1059
01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:55.520
over a series of five Iowasca sessions.
I,
I asked,

1060
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:58.310
I will ask her,
can I write a novel and if so,

1061
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.650
what would I be writing about?

1062
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.560
And something amazing happened in those five sessions.

1063
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:07.910
I was given the entire story of the novel that I ended up writing,

1064
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:12.350
which is a novel called entangled and the whole story,
the characters,

1065
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.660
their dilemmas,
the time travel aspect of it,

1066
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.770
<v 2>the story just frantically writing it all down or would you try to remember?</v>

1067
01:01:17.771 --> 01:01:21.460
It was very,
I wasn't even trying to remember it.
It was just very,
very clear,

1068
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:26.180
<v 0>was very clear that I was to write a story and that would involve two young</v>

1069
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:29.720
women,
one in the Stone Age,
one in the modern times,

1070
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:31.040
and that they would be entangled,

1071
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:34.250
that they would be connected through consciousness,
um,

1072
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.580
and that they would be involved in a,
in a battle of good against evil.

1073
01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:39.890
And certain scenes came through very,

1074
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:42.380
very clear to me and step vividly in my mind.

1075
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:43.940
So as soon as we'd finished in Brazil,

1076
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.980
I went back to England and started writing.

1077
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.920
<v 2>So when you ask Iowasca can you do it and what would it be about?</v>

1078
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:56.200
Do you think that this,
that Iowasca wants you to do this because with,

1079
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.520
if you do something like that,
you have to,

1080
01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.560
I always think of any work that I put out,

1081
01:01:59.561 --> 01:02:02.260
whether it's even writing a blog or putting something,

1082
01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:03.640
a funny thing up on Twitter,

1083
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.830
you send out this signal and then the signals going to effect who knows how many

1084
01:02:08.831 --> 01:02:10.390
people in a positive way,

1085
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:14.260
especially something that they really enjoy reading like a book and people can

1086
01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:14.860
say like,

1087
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.280
why would I want if you want you to write a book because some books are fucking

1088
01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:20.220
awesome.
That's why,
and that

1089
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 4>that feeling of getting really hooked into a book and really just loving it.</v>

1090
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.700
I haven't read a good novel in a while.

1091
01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:30.540
The strain was the last one that I really liked for a while,
but then hated,

1092
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.440
you know,
I love the beginning of it.
That's that vampire one,
the bunny,

1093
01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.210
the Gwen [inaudible] del Toro Book.
Anyway,

1094
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:41.510
my point is you that feeling there's all a lot of positive energy associated

1095
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:44.480
with something that's really entertaining and gripping.

1096
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.270
<v 0>Yeah,
definitely.
There's time.</v>

1097
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:50.070
He was a highly effective way of a way it way of communicating.

1098
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:55.080
I don't know whether a Iowasca did this for me,

1099
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:58.620
but you,
they often say there's a song that I forget the song,
you know,

1100
01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.450
the rolling stones,
you don't always get what you want.
You get what you need,

1101
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:07.740
you know,
I ask,
uh,
does does that she tends to give you what you need,

1102
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:08.970
not always what you asked for.

1103
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.470
I have set intense at the beginning of sessions and I found myself going in a

1104
01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:16.440
totally different direction,
but these five sessions were different.
It was very,

1105
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:21.000
very clear.
Here is a story,
go home and write it.
It was very,

1106
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.730
I felt compelled to do it.

1107
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:27.690
<v 6>So,
so if they affected you in that way,
they created this huge effect on,</v>

1108
01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:30.560
you think about what would happen if it was legally available.

1109
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:32.370
If people where they excel,

1110
01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:37.490
then you see how the war on drugs is actually suppressing a human evolution.

1111
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:41.220
Yeah.
If this is I,
it seems like you're saying that,
um,

1112
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:43.020
throughout time I,

1113
01:03:43.021 --> 01:03:46.800
the psychedelics had been widened or do you think they objections were taking

1114
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:49.670
psychedelics?
Definitely,
definitely.
What psychedelics do,
we take

1115
01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.990
<v 0>particularly the blue water lily and in fair,
sorry,
Leah,
um,</v>

1116
01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.640
which is a potent psychedelic and William amber done at the State University of

1117
01:03:58.641 --> 01:04:03.290
California has,
um,
uh,
published a detailed research on,

1118
01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.020
on the blue water lily and on it's psychedelic properties.

1119
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.080
And it was certainly used a,

1120
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:12.110
they were journeyers they though when the ancient Egyptians explored the mystery

1121
01:04:12.111 --> 01:04:15.110
of life after death,
they were not,
uh,
you know,

1122
01:04:15.111 --> 01:04:17.870
sitting in some scribal room just making this stuff up.

1123
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:21.380
They were investigating,
they were exploring,

1124
01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:25.310
they were separating that consciousness from the body and they were entering

1125
01:04:25.311 --> 01:04:29.090
other realms and they were coming back and giving a detailed report about what

1126
01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:30.290
they encountered there.

1127
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:34.220
<v 4>The first I'd ever heard of any of that was from John Anthony West work and the</v>

1128
01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:36.000
work on the temple of man.
Yeah.

1129
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.080
Which is really fascinating that there's a temple in each area of the temple

1130
01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:43.940
signifies like a part of a human being.

1131
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:48.630
And there's a whole area about the pineal gland and the,
the,

1132
01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:50.300
the Egyptians were,
you know,

1133
01:04:50.301 --> 01:04:53.270
they called it the seed of the soul and that they believed that,
you know,

1134
01:04:53.271 --> 01:04:57.050
the pineal gland was your connection to,
to the afterlife.
Yeah.

1135
01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.890
<v 0>Hey,
hey,
they were right.
Yeah.
You know,
this is,
cause this is the,</v>

1136
01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:05.300
this is the mystery that a DMT,
which is the active ingredient of Iowasca,

1137
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.660
uh,
is generated by the pineal gland.

1138
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:09.623
<v 4>They believe that,</v>

1139
01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.340
<v 0>yeah,
totally.
It was Rick Strassman's hunch.
But,
but,
uh,</v>

1140
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:18.100
something in our bodies and the pineal gland is the most likely suspect.

1141
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:18.730
That's a big,

1142
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:23.500
is sticking point with generating DMT because the presence of DMT in the human

1143
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:26.380
body is not in dispute.
What it's coming from is in dispute,

1144
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:29.760
but it's presence in the body is not in dispute.
Just sounds cool.

1145
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.200
It really comes from the pineal gland,
kind of sounds kind of cool.

1146
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:37.180
It comes from the third eye,
particularly since the pineal gland is a,
is,
is,

1147
01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:39.760
um,
uh,
what was originally a sense organ.

1148
01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.470
And so the suggestion would be that it's still a sense organ to kind of sixth

1149
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.610
sense.
Uh,
which,
uh,
the lens that it uses is DMT.

1150
01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:52.180
And when people don't realize is that in reptiles and certain reptiles that

1151
01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:55.690
actually has a retina in a lens and it's light sensitive,

1152
01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.520
there's a fucking eyeball.
It's light sensitive.
Yes.
In reptiles,
in humans.

1153
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:04.360
It's not,
it's deep.
It's deeper into the brain.
Um,
but,

1154
01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.010
but a very mysterious,
very mysterious organ.
And,
uh,
I would still say I,

1155
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:10.270
you're right,
it's not proven.

1156
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:12.700
I would still say the most likely candidate for the,

1157
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:17.510
for the generation of DMT Strassman is working on figuring that out right now.

1158
01:06:17.511 --> 01:06:20.890
And they're working on more detailed studies to try to excellent.
Exactly.

1159
01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:24.010
Pinpoint the location.
Excellent.
It's where it's created.
This is,

1160
01:06:24.011 --> 01:06:27.100
I'm glad that that's happening.
I mean,
the,
the,
you know,
the point that,

1161
01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:30.370
that you were making just now.
I think that,

1162
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.360
I think that by cutting these,
um,

1163
01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:37.840
ancient plant allies out of our life,
uh,
and,

1164
01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:42.010
and by demonizing them and creating this atmosphere of fear and hatred around

1165
01:06:42.011 --> 01:06:45.160
them,
this is a suicidal path that our society is taking.

1166
01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:49.180
And we only need to look at the past in order to realize that that is true.

1167
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.010
There is a danger in the human species that we get locked into a particular

1168
01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:58.180
frame and right now we are locked into the technology frame.

1169
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:02.230
Of course we're advancing technology very,
very,
very fast,

1170
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.000
but that doesn't mean we aren't locked.

1171
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.260
We're locked into one frame and we are not thinking outside of that frame and,

1172
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.500
and we can see the consequences of being locked into that frame,

1173
01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:14.570
which is our world is in chaos.
Our world is in,
in a,

1174
01:07:14.571 --> 01:07:18.220
in a state of hatred and fear and suspicion right now there's,

1175
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:23.221
there's all this horrible stuff going on and we are literally on the edge of

1176
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:24.670
destroying ourselves.

1177
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:29.110
And there's never been a time in the human story when we've more needed to break

1178
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:32.650
out of our rigid patterns of behavior and start thinking about things from a

1179
01:07:32.651 --> 01:07:36.550
different point of view.
And Nature has provided us with the means to do so.

1180
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.120
And those means are our plant allies,
right?
Yeah.

1181
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.960
It's a fascinating concept and the concept that human beings are working against

1182
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:51.490
themselves and they're working to keep things fucked up and make them more.

1183
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.820
And that the only way to sustain a society as complex and large and visa as the

1184
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:00.190
one we currently live in,
the only ways to do it,
the way we're doing it.

1185
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.000
And that if all of a sudden psychedelic drugs were introduced in the materialism

1186
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.980
was,
you know,
sort of,
uh,

1187
01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:10.120
pushed in the back burner and spiritualism was something that people,
you know,

1188
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:12.460
started really understanding and appreciating their connection more.

1189
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.130
Who the fuck's gonna go to work?
Yeah.
It was,

1190
01:08:14.170 --> 01:08:16.850
was going to be chilling all the chickens we need sort of chicken mcnuggets
yeah,

1191
01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:19.250
Nick's would become very different,

1192
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:24.550
but the fact is that our existing economic model is falling apart at the seams

1193
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:25.310
anyway.

1194
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.230
And people are living in misery and doubt and chaos and confusion because it's

1195
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.970
just not working.
It's not working,
is it?
The whole thing is not working.

1196
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:36.260
Any society that can stand back while the Amazon jungle is burnt down at the

1197
01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:40.820
sort of countryside rate every year.
Uh,
this is an insane society.

1198
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:43.760
We obviously live in a demented society.
Completely insane.

1199
01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:47.170
<v 2>A lot of people aren't even aware of how crazy that looks.
If you watch it.</v>

1200
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.890
And you know,
you see documentaries on online of the mass amounts of forests,

1201
01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:54.000
they're chopping down.
It's a bizarre,

1202
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:58.260
<v 0>that's why,
that's why it's interesting.
But this particular agent I'll ask her,</v>

1203
01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.480
comes from the Amazon,
you know,
I can't help,
I can't help feeling in the Amazon.

1204
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:06.340
They strongly believed that an intelligent entity lies behind the Iowasca of

1205
01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.760
mine.
She,
she,
they always speak of her as she,
most of the cultures do,

1206
01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:16.090
um,
is using the vine as an access point to humanity.
Um,
and,

1207
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.450
and um,
oh,
I just lost my thread.
How did I get to that?
Well,

1208
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.490
we're talking about Amazon.
Yeah.
Yes,
exactly.
Exactly.
That,

1209
01:09:24.491 --> 01:09:29.210
that at the very time when our western technological culture is,

1210
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:33.860
uh,
is responsible for mass destruction in the Amazon,
which it is.
And by the way,

1211
01:09:33.861 --> 01:09:37.430
it's a problem that could be easily solved.
We don't need to destroy the Amazon.

1212
01:09:37.431 --> 01:09:41.900
We really don't need those soya bean farms in the Amazon to feed cattle so that

1213
01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:46.190
people can eat hamburgers.
Ma,
we much more need the rainforest,
you know,

1214
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:50.480
so at the very time that the Amazon is under threat from the western way of
life,

1215
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:54.380
which has infected almost every culture on the planet at that very time,

1216
01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:59.270
the Amazon is sending out it's emissary in the form of the vine of souls who is

1217
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:04.271
kind of extending her coiled sinuous self all around the world and reaching into

1218
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:09.830
human consciousness everywhere because Iowasca is being drunk all around the

1219
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:10.540
world.
Yeah,

1220
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.540
<v 6>I know.
I know.
I have.
I've met someone on Facebook who takes it regularly.</v>

1221
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:19.660
There's a cop,
it's a cop and you're going to jail.
That's not,

1222
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.070
that's no cop.
He knits like,
what do they call it?

1223
01:10:23.071 --> 01:10:26.180
The should bobo or if there's a name should be,

1224
01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:31.290
he knits these patterns like he like he showed there like they net the exact

1225
01:10:31.591 --> 01:10:33.150
things you were saying that are on the cave walls,

1226
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.810
like the honeycomb patterns and stuff.

1227
01:10:34.811 --> 01:10:37.410
So they like create these beautiful quilts.

1228
01:10:37.411 --> 01:10:42.120
Is it quilted damage that are just incredible depictions of the what apparently

1229
01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:44.870
the Ioi do geometric aspect of it.

1230
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:47.860
<v 2>Do you ever think of how much you play a part of that?</v>

1231
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.810
Does that ever focus in on your mind?

1232
01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:53.680
I mean your instincts obviously were to produce this book and to talk about it

1233
01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:56.620
very openly and honestly and to do interviews like this and you'll have

1234
01:10:56.621 --> 01:10:59.500
discussions like this where you talk about it and you know this right now is

1235
01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:00.910
going to reach half a million people.

1236
01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.150
They're going to consider what you're saying and they're going to look into it

1237
01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:05.350
and they're going to let go.
Whoa.

1238
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:08.860
Do you really think that there's some fucking vine you can take from the jungle

1239
01:11:08.861 --> 01:11:10.630
that allows you to communicate with the spirit world?

1240
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.980
I feel when you find out that the responsibility in this area,
let's

1241
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.610
<v 0>explain to people what it does for,
for,
for noobs,
for Google,</v>

1242
01:11:16.611 --> 01:11:20.560
are not aware of what I lost is the first thing I'd like to say is that,
uh,

1243
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:24.210
that Iowasca and as a matter of fact,
all psychedelics are very serious business.

1244
01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:25.720
Um,
I,

1245
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:29.130
I personally do not believe that psychedelics are appropriate for recreational

1246
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:32.490
activity.
I think if somebody chooses to do that,
that's their body.

1247
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.650
That's their choice.
But I don't think it's the right thing to do.

1248
01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.990
We need to treat these amazing substances with respect.
Um,

1249
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.800
and it's anybody who's worked with psychedelics will know absolutely.

1250
01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:48.030
The set and setting in which the psychedelic is consumed is as important as the

1251
01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:50.760
psychedelic itself.
Absolutely.
What you've prepared,

1252
01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:55.020
what you are looking for from the experience and the company in which you take

1253
01:11:55.021 --> 01:11:57.810
it.
And the reason for which you take it are definitely going to color and affect

1254
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.870
the experience.
And um,
I think it's a,

1255
01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:05.430
I think it's a mistake to use these powerful agents of,
of consciousness work,

1256
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:10.770
um,
for recreation.
There are other great things for recreation and,
and,

1257
01:12:10.771 --> 01:12:15.510
and another great central subjects sort of substances.
But,
but,

1258
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.920
uh,
the psychedelics are not for that purpose.
And,
and,

1259
01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:22.921
and if somebody wants to have a really bad trip and have and have truly horrific

1260
01:12:23.041 --> 01:12:24.420
experiences with psychedelics,

1261
01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:26.910
take it in the wrong set and setting and you can be pretty sure that's going to

1262
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:29.410
happen to you sooner or later.
So I was,

1263
01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.430
the first thing I would say to people with,
with all psychedelics is be careful.

1264
01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:36.630
This is this respect,
respect,
respect,
deep respect for this.
This is a,

1265
01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:40.970
this is a very serious thing you're engaging on.
Therefore,
um,
find,
uh,

1266
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.130
uh,
fi find a space that can be protected.

1267
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.650
Find somebody who knows what they're doing,

1268
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:51.360
who can sit with you and who can oversee the CW and bring a ceremony to the,

1269
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:55.920
to the table.
Let's not just a sit down disrespectfully,

1270
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.770
disrespectfully and consume the substance.
Let's,
uh,

1271
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:02.280
let's bring a ceremonial aspect to it.
And I would say with Iowasca,

1272
01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:06.120
I know that quite a number of people now have started to get the ingredients on

1273
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.120
the Internet and brew up their Ios Guy.
I honestly think that's a mistake.

1274
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.350
There are people who are enormously experienced working with Iowasca.

1275
01:13:13.351 --> 01:13:16.130
They are the Shamans from the Amazon.
More and more Western.

1276
01:13:16.131 --> 01:13:18.100
Those are being trained by those Shamaz.

1277
01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.500
Those Westerners are returning to western countries and are creating a new form

1278
01:13:22.501 --> 01:13:26.640
of shamanism relevant to the urban and industrial context of the,
of the West.

1279
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.940
If you really want to work with IOWASCA,

1280
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:31.260
seek out somebody like that better still if you can,

1281
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:33.840
if you can get the funds together,
go down to Brazil.

1282
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.600
I've got down to Peru and work with the masters,
but,

1283
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:41.400
but you find the masters if you want to do that.
Um,
well it's all word of mouth.

1284
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:43.620
There's a,
there is a huge network.
I'm,

1285
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:48.240
I'm often reminded of sort of underground sects at the end of the Roman empire,

1286
01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:51.200
like the Gnostics,
you know,
being persecuted by the,
by,

1287
01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:54.360
by mainstream Christianity where everything was done by word of mouth.

1288
01:13:54.361 --> 01:13:58.260
It's like that with Iowasca now.
Um,
generally speaking,

1289
01:13:58.261 --> 01:13:59.970
if you feel drawn to the vine,

1290
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.660
do some serious research on the subject and you will find your way to the,

1291
01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:06.060
to the right people.
There are some charlatans working in this field,

1292
01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:09.810
there are in all fields,
but there are also some very good people.
And,

1293
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:11.830
and do some serious research first

1294
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.200
<v 5>and look into the subject and find the right person,</v>

1295
01:14:14.201 --> 01:14:15.970
somebody who is deeply experienced,

1296
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.690
who understands the vine and work with them and you can be sure you're going to

1297
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:21.700
have a much more worthwhile experience.

1298
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.800
Whatever series of events led you to go there and take those substances and have

1299
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:29.500
these visionary experiences and then relay them.

1300
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:33.190
Do you ever feel as if you were compelled that you are brought to it?

1301
01:14:33.191 --> 01:14:38.180
Like this is like a,
you,
you have a purpose.
Do you feel that way?
Um,
I,
I,

1302
01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:42.910
if so,
it's like the rest of the course of my life.
A series of accidents.

1303
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:47.500
Like I flew into that city in northern Ethiopia in 1983 and found myself in

1304
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:49.860
front of a monk who said he had the Ark of the covenant behind him.

1305
01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:53.500
It turned the direction in my life.
And okay.
I decided that after,

1306
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.270
after I published underworld,

1307
01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:58.750
which was my last book on the lost civilization issues.
Um,

1308
01:14:58.810 --> 01:15:02.650
I had always been interested in human origins and that's why I decided to write

1309
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:05.650
supernatural.
But when I got into the subject,

1310
01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.860
I found that the story didn't get interesting until 50,000 years ago.

1311
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.770
And it got interesting because of psychedelics.
And then,

1312
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:14.470
so it wasn't an accident that led me to that then,
or obvious.

1313
01:15:14.471 --> 01:15:18.040
The next research conclusion was I had to go take some psychedelics and to do so

1314
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:21.720
in a shamonic setting and learn about it.
So I,

1315
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.660
it was a series of accidental decisions,
kind of led me,
led me to that process.

1316
01:15:25.661 --> 01:15:28.660
So I,
I guess I don't feel cold or chosen,
but I,
but,

1317
01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:31.770
but I found myself in the hot seat.
Do you feel obligated them?

1318
01:15:31.771 --> 01:15:34.900
Because you know so much about it?
Because I feel obligated.
I feel,

1319
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:39.010
and I feel a responsibility,
uh,
which is,
which is to,
um,

1320
01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.380
is to share with others that these,
um,

1321
01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.000
these agents can be transformational and that and that they can be incredibly

1322
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:46.890
helpful.
Um,

1323
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:50.230
but that they are also extremely powerful and that they must be treated with

1324
01:15:50.231 --> 01:15:53.290
respect.
And Xero is real.
And here's,
here's the thing,

1325
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.450
everyone is running around looking for magic.

1326
01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:58.420
Everyone is running around looking for a religious experience.

1327
01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:02.620
And you can have that.
You really can,
it is a real thing.

1328
01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:05.620
It doesn't care whether you believe in it or don't believe in it.

1329
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.270
It's not dogmatic.
It is a legit thing.
Oh yeah.
And if you take it,

1330
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:15.271
you'll have an experience that you cannot believe is real and available.

1331
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.510
You cannot believe that it's so easy that you drink this substance and all of a

1332
01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:23.890
sudden you,
you literally enter into some different dimension.
Yeah,
that's right.

1333
01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:27.250
It's,
it's,
it,
it is real.
And that's why the,

1334
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:30.100
it's really not a matter for intellectual speculation.

1335
01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:33.850
It's a direct experience that it can have.

1336
01:16:33.851 --> 01:16:36.850
And then what you make of the experiences is really what matters.
It's all,

1337
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.420
it's like you're the people who ridicule it.
You'll like my,
you know,
when,

1338
01:16:40.421 --> 01:16:42.160
when people mock mushrooms like,
Hey,

1339
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.630
I've even talked to Michio Kaku who's this amazing physicist and it's really

1340
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:47.321
brilliant guy.

1341
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:49.900
And I was on the OB and Anthony Show and I asked him if you're done mushrooms

1342
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.920
and he,
you know,
said like,
I was like,
I was a fool.

1343
01:16:53.921 --> 01:16:56.650
He was acting like I was a fool.
Like it was a silly person.
No,

1344
01:16:56.651 --> 01:16:59.460
I need my mind to be intact and all this stuff so I can work on,

1345
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:02.710
since he's never done mushrooms,
how could he know what it does to his mind?

1346
01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:07.450
This is,
this is prejudice at work.
I'm like,
my God man,
this what if it was real,

1347
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:10.050
if it was real,
would you trust me?
Would you,
if,

1348
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.540
<v 2>if it,</v>

1349
01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.400
if I told you that there was some real thing and you take it and you're going to

1350
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:18.401
be in communication with some insanely wise entity from some parallel or

1351
01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:24.130
constantly surrounding you dimension.
What'd you just try when you just try it?

1352
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.570
And

1353
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:28.820
<v 6>he convinced that's the problem that we're talking about years because,
ah,</v>

1354
01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:34.240
Michio Kaku,
he is a genius.
Super juvies conditioned.

1355
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:39.360
And so now imagine if a genius came in contact with something because right now

1356
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:41.640
this spirit,
whatever you want to call it,

1357
01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:46.230
it's right now the majority of a lot of the people it's contacting or like 16

1358
01:17:46.231 --> 01:17:50.350
year olds in trailers.
Who or why they were like playing Xbox.
Yeah.

1359
01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.400
It's like I am trying to communicate.
Yeah.
High level information.

1360
01:17:53.401 --> 01:17:55.700
Why are you sending me he a kid?

1361
01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:59.580
<v 0>To be fair,
I have to,
I have to say that,
that um,
that uh,</v>

1362
01:17:59.581 --> 01:18:01.500
I'm not sure that's the case with Iowasca.
No,

1363
01:18:01.501 --> 01:18:04.390
I think that mushroom quite a whole number of reasons for sure.

1364
01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:06.970
Mushrooms for sure.
But,
but it's not the case with Ios.
Yeah.

1365
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:10.180
It's too difficult for it.
Yeah.
I WASC is really a mission.

1366
01:18:10.181 --> 01:18:14.920
I mean you have to brace yourself.
Uh,
I was uh,
is hard work.
Uh,

1367
01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:17.620
I will ask a,
we'll make you vomit.
It will give you diarrhea.

1368
01:18:17.621 --> 01:18:20.380
They call it the purge in the Amazon and it is a,

1369
01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.430
an enormously effective PEGA DIV agent.
Take my word for it.
Yeah.

1370
01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:26.640
<v 2>We still have explained to the noobs to people who really have no idea what</v>

1371
01:18:26.641 --> 01:18:29.760
we're talking about.
Um,
with,
with Iowasca is,

1372
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.910
is an orally active version of DMT.

1373
01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:36.580
And that these amazing people from was how,

1374
01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:38.190
how far does it date back?

1375
01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:42.180
How many thousands of years archaeological evidence for the use of Iowasca going

1376
01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:44.220
back more than 4,000 years in the Amazon.

1377
01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.100
And so somehow or another 4,000 years ago,

1378
01:18:47.101 --> 01:18:50.580
out of hundreds of thousands of different plants,
right.
They figured out,

1379
01:18:50.581 --> 01:18:55.581
I combined the vine of one with the leaves of another and sophisticated piece of

1380
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:59.410
chemistry.
But they're doing explain to people what it is.
Yeah.

1381
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:03.460
<v 0>So the ask,
it consists of three ingredients.
One of them is water,</v>

1382
01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.510
the medium in which it's brewed.
And the other two are a leaf.

1383
01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:12.130
That leaf is from a plant called psychiatry of the Redis is the botanical name,

1384
01:19:12.131 --> 01:19:13.750
the college Chacruna in the Amazon.

1385
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:18.280
And that leaf contains a pharmacologically pure dimethyltryptamine,

1386
01:19:18.281 --> 01:19:21.940
a contains DMT,
which should your own body makes.
What's your own buddy?
Max.

1387
01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.930
And uh,
with that,
uh,
with the empty,

1388
01:19:25.931 --> 01:19:29.050
you have a problem because DMT is not orally active.

1389
01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.130
And the reason that DMT is not orally active is that we have an enzyme in our

1390
01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:38.131
stomachs called mano a amine oxidase and monoamine oxidase switches off DMT on

1391
01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:40.564
contact.

1392
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:45.840
What they did in the Amazon jungle was that they found out of,
actually there's,

1393
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:46.511
you're right,

1394
01:19:46.511 --> 01:19:51.490
there's 150,000 different species of plants and trees in the Amazon they found

1395
01:19:51.491 --> 01:19:56.491
the one other that contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is that's what the

1396
01:19:57.161 --> 01:20:00.910
vine contains.
The vine actually does not contain the psychedelic ingredient.

1397
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:04.950
It contains the ingredient that allows the psychedelic to become orally active.

1398
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.980
<v 2>So do you think they just ate the two of them at the same time once and</v>

1399
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.440
<v 5>had some crazy experience and when will you write this down?</v>

1400
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.730
<v 0>It's about this.
They all say the same thing.</v>

1401
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:15.730
The spirits taught our ancestors to do this.

1402
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:19.580
<v 5>When these guys are getting blasted Iowasca for decades upon decades though,</v>

1403
01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:22.520
do you think they could really recall exactly how they learned all this?

1404
01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.750
They didn't lay into that lifetimes because it was already old knowledge to
them.

1405
01:20:26.751 --> 01:20:28.970
They're speaking of their,
of their ancestors.

1406
01:20:28.971 --> 01:20:31.310
And they literally say that the plant's spoke to them.
Right.

1407
01:20:31.311 --> 01:20:34.910
They told us about how to do it and reached out to them and said,

1408
01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:37.400
put this together when it had to be during the,

1409
01:20:37.401 --> 01:20:42.401
well it had to be at least as recent as they figured out how to harness fire to

1410
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.820
cook it.
Yeah.
You need,
she need a metal.
Correct.
Like need a pile.
No,
no.

1411
01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:51.500
What kind of pot do you cook it and you can use ceramic ceramic so it could

1412
01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:54.770
predate metal.
Yeah,
definitely predates,
definitely predates metal.
Yeah,

1413
01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.310
no doubt about that.
It's an amazing thing that they've combined.

1414
01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:02.450
Do you think that it's not orally active because it's in so many different

1415
01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:05.900
plants that if it was that people would just be eating and getting higher DMT

1416
01:21:05.901 --> 01:21:06.690
all the time.

1417
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:10.170
<v 0>Nature is our friend in these matters.
Nature looks after us and,
and uh,</v>

1418
01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.770
that may be the case,
uh,
that it's not so widely distributed.

1419
01:21:13.771 --> 01:21:18.420
The mystery is that it is present in quite a lot actually.
Um,
and,
and,

1420
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:22.110
uh,
that mixed with an,
with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor,

1421
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:26.130
you end up with an orally active substance and does that,

1422
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.720
would that work if you wanted to?

1423
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.380
And I of course a hundred percent agree with you that you should,
um,

1424
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.700
go to a sham and if you're going to do this experience,

1425
01:21:34.701 --> 01:21:39.701
but if you did have that leaf that you are talking about and just a classic Mao

1426
01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:42.510
inhibitor or whatever it was and you took that and eight the leaf,

1427
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:45.870
would you then have the experience very dangerous though?
Yeah.
It's kind of does.

1428
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:49.740
You should do,
you would have,
but there are a,
what they call Iowasca analogs,

1429
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:53.790
which,
which,
uh,
and,
and even farmer Wasco is being spoken of now,

1430
01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:58.590
which does precisely that,
which uses a pharmacological AI,
uh,

1431
01:21:58.591 --> 01:22:02.400
you know,
with DMT.
Um,
uh,
I think,
uh,

1432
01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:06.960
I think personally we don't need to go there because nature has provided us with

1433
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:11.100
this beautiful and incredible,
uh,
possibility in the,

1434
01:22:11.101 --> 01:22:15.990
in the Iowasca brew in these,
in these two different plants.
Interestingly,
um,

1435
01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.820
it's,
uh,

1436
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:22.740
not impossible to drink IOWASCA legally in the United States.

1437
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:25.860
Um,
because the battle is already being fought here.

1438
01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.130
The there in Brazil,
um,

1439
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:34.160
the IOWASCA shamanism has come out of the jungle and into the cities and it's

1440
01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:38.320
taken form,
uh,
of,
uh,

1441
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.370
several what'd you would call syncretic churches,

1442
01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:45.720
which are mixing elements of Christianity with elements of traditional
shamanism.

1443
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:49.800
So the best known are the Santo Daime,
me and the uni,
our division of tile,

1444
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.940
um,
which both use Iowasca as their sacrament.

1445
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.860
I've sat down with the Juniata vegetal group in Brazil and drink IOWASCA.

1446
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:02.850
They were the most charming,
thorough,
professional,

1447
01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.070
hardworking people I could ever have hoped to meet.

1448
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.820
They bring their children to the sessions,

1449
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:09.160
they start their children on Iowasca at the age of 14.

1450
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:12.190
They have a completely different view of psychedelics to the view that we have.

1451
01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:12.650
They,

1452
01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:16.210
they believe that it's really helpful and important experience for humanity to

1453
01:23:16.211 --> 01:23:17.000
have this.

1454
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.950
And fortunately the government of Brazil agrees with them and it doesn't

1455
01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:22.450
persecute them for,
for doing this.

1456
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:27.451
So they have formed a established churches and those churches have members in

1457
01:23:28.151 --> 01:23:30.670
the United States.
And I think it started in New Mexico.

1458
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.850
The matter was taken up to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court said,
yes,

1459
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:36.970
if you're a member of the unit or division Todd,
you can drink iowasca legally.

1460
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.840
Now that actually for somebody who wants to work with Iowasca is something that

1461
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.490
I would recommend.
I personally don't,

1462
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:45.760
I'm not drawn to establish churches of any kind.

1463
01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:49.930
I believe that spirituality doesn't require a church,
um,

1464
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.090
and a hierarchy.
But the fact is that the uni,
our veggies,

1465
01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:57.610
the veggies tile and the Santo Daime me both know what they're doing with

1466
01:23:57.611 --> 01:23:58.390
Iowasca.

1467
01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:02.290
They absolutely know what they're doing and they are present in the United

1468
01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:04.460
States and they're drinking.
I am ask illegally in the United States.

1469
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.890
<v 4>Strassman told me,</v>

1470
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.370
Strassman told me he met with them in New Mexico and he said they are all

1471
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:13.510
wearing outfits and they're drinking IOWASCA and singing songs about Jesus.

1472
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.460
And he's like,
they're on these really,

1473
01:24:15.461 --> 01:24:18.910
really strong IOWASCA trips and they're singing songs about Jesus.

1474
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:22.300
And he was like,
what the fuck are you people doing down here?

1475
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:27.540
It's such a strange hybrid of things.
Very strange.

1476
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:30.260
A Trojan horse for Ios Hybrid.

1477
01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:34.220
<v 0>Um,
but,
but,
um,
I mean interestingly enough,
if we,</v>

1478
01:24:34.221 --> 01:24:39.221
if we separate Christ off from the monstrous bureaucracy called the church,

1479
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.210
uh,
you do find an interesting spiritual teacher,
uh,
at,
at,
at,

1480
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:48.320
at work and I suspect through Iowasca they're getting closer to the true to the

1481
01:24:48.321 --> 01:24:52.460
true spiritual teachings and,
and um,
and more important,
um,

1482
01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:55.400
ios gay's not mediated by a priesthood.

1483
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:59.840
Iowasca is your own direct experience of the spirit realm.
That's,
that's,

1484
01:24:59.841 --> 01:25:03.560
that's really important.
Whereas whereas in most mainstream religions,

1485
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:05.780
the priesthood is telling you what to think.

1486
01:25:05.781 --> 01:25:10.130
They are the intermediary between us and the divine.
In the case of Iowasca,

1487
01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.780
the brew is the intermediary and it plugs us straight into the divine.

1488
01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.040
<v 4>It sounds like a bad ass church to join the love</v>

1489
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:21.150
<v 6>sitting in college and reading the New Testament.</v>

1490
01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.970
That was one of my favorite things is getting really,

1491
01:25:23.971 --> 01:25:28.971
really are tripping and then reading the gospels because it is a very,

1492
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.240
very psychedelic text.
The,
the book of John,
it's,

1493
01:25:34.241 --> 01:25:38.640
it's almost as if when you're tr,
it's hard not to read when you're sober,

1494
01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.100
but when you're tripping in the beginning was the word.

1495
01:25:41.101 --> 01:25:45.210
And the word was made a flash or it's just is what is that?

1496
01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.730
Then you start thinking someone wrote this,
like this wasn't,
you know,

1497
01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:52.620
someone really meant this when they wrote it and then you're on.
And they mean,

1498
01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:55.770
yeah,
a long time and it's very,
very trippy.

1499
01:25:55.771 --> 01:25:59.820
So I can totally understand how being on Iowa Osca from what you described,

1500
01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:04.070
the experience as and mixing that with Christ symbols be pretty amazing.

1501
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.890
<v 4>Along the line of with Mckenna thought of,
do you ever,</v>

1502
01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.000
you're familiar with John Marco Legros work and the whole idea,

1503
01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:14.780
<v 0>the Dead Sea Scrolls in the cross?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Very much so.
And,
and other,</v>

1504
01:26:14.781 --> 01:26:19.310
again,
this has been,
this is another thing that has been erased from history.

1505
01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.270
Uh,
but the fact of the matter is that if you go into early Christianity,

1506
01:26:23.271 --> 01:26:26.660
what you find is a mushroom called no doubt about it whatsoever.

1507
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.730
No doubt about it.
There are even,
um,

1508
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:34.750
there are even depictions of the tree in the garden of Eden and those depictions

1509
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:39.040
show a mushroom they show that they show is specifically an Amanita muscarinic

1510
01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.450
mushroom,
not a assignment.
And I'm an eighth of a scary,

1511
01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:46.370
also hallucinogenic mushroom.
Um,
so you know,
when,

1512
01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:50.420
uh,
the uh,
entity called,
uh,
you know,

1513
01:26:50.421 --> 01:26:54.750
Yahweh or Jehovah or whatever,
he calls himself,
you know,

1514
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:57.020
drove out of an eve out of the garden of Eden.

1515
01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:59.480
He was driving them out of the garden of Eden because they'd done a mushroom

1516
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:00.314
trip.

1517
01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.990
<v 4>That makes sense.
And then the apple,
the apple is apple.</v>

1518
01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.770
The even the word for apple also means red.
And that the mushroom,

1519
01:27:07.771 --> 01:27:11.530
the Ana Mendieta miscarry was a red mushroom.
And that this is what the eight,

1520
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.460
I mean,
it makes sense.
The food of the Gods,
you know,
and the forbidden fruit.

1521
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:18.620
<v 0>It makes total sense.
And actually I don't believe that we can understand,
um,
any,</v>

1522
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:22.250
uh,
spirituality without,
uh,

1523
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.690
dealing with altered states of consciousness.
This is,
um,
this is again,

1524
01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:28.640
something that's been lost in the modern world.

1525
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:31.280
You don't find in most of the mainstream religions,

1526
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:36.020
much altered state of consciousness going on.
But if you go back to the origins,

1527
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:39.590
you find altered states of consciousness are,
are deeply involved.

1528
01:27:39.591 --> 01:27:41.540
And I'm not saying that those auto states of consciousness,

1529
01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.490
we're always caused by psychedelics.

1530
01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:46.400
There's other ways to get into deeply altered states of consciousness,

1531
01:27:46.401 --> 01:27:50.380
including starving yourself,
fasting,
austerities,

1532
01:27:50.381 --> 01:27:51.740
certain kinds of rhythmic dancing,

1533
01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.470
but definitely altered states of consciousness where involved.

1534
01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:58.700
So in the case of Christianity,
it's Saint Paul on the Damascus road,
you know,

1535
01:27:58.701 --> 01:28:00.980
he has this blinding revelation,

1536
01:28:00.981 --> 01:28:04.790
which completely turns his life around in a totally different direction.

1537
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:06.081
Benny Shannon,

1538
01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:09.110
who's the professor of psychology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem,

1539
01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:14.111
has made a very powerful case that Moses in front of the burning Bush is really

1540
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:16.700
a psychedelic experience that's being described there.

1541
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:17.750
And you're sitting in front of his,

1542
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:22.790
the Bush and it's kind of moving and glowing and a voice is coming out of it and

1543
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:26.600
speaking to you.
Uh,
it's very psychedelic experience.

1544
01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:31.220
And he even further argues that that Moses may have been drinking and Iowasca

1545
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:33.610
analogs,
Syrian Rue and memos or hostility.

1546
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.220
I think these are two products which contain the same ingredients as are found

1547
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:40.930
in the Amazon.
But you know,
the DMT and the MRI,

1548
01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:44.810
which grow in the Middle East.
So that's a,
you know,
that's,
that's possible

1549
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:45.280
<v 4>to,</v>

1550
01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.280
I've even heard Scott scholars connect the acacia tree or the Acacia Bush with

1551
01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:54.800
a,
a pot potential,
uh,
uh,
uh,
source of,
uh,

1552
01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:58.950
a psychedelic experience because apparently it's rich in dimethyltryptamine some

1553
01:28:58.951 --> 01:29:02.070
academies burning Bush,
you know,
somehow or another

1554
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.620
<v 5>like this was,
you know,
they,</v>

1555
01:29:03.621 --> 01:29:07.620
they had synthesize DMT from this and burned it and then he has his experience.

1556
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:10.870
So they're calling it a burning Bush.
Well,
sort of.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1557
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.080
If this Bush that is common to that area actually has DMT in it.

1558
01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.010
Yeah.
It's amazing with the whole thing.
Idea comes different.
So,

1559
01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:24.540
and so you begin to realize that,
that when you scratch the mainstream religions,

1560
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:28.680
you get down to base ground before the money man in the bureaucrats stepped in

1561
01:29:28.681 --> 01:29:31.830
and took it over.
You find visionary experiences are at the heart of it.

1562
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:34.410
They're at the essence of it.
And,
and Ben later on,

1563
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.000
those visionary experiences become band and illegal and nobody's ever allowed to

1564
01:29:39.001 --> 01:29:40.530
have them again.
No.

1565
01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:43.200
When I want to go back to something you said earlier that you said you have

1566
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:47.650
problems with technology.
Um,
and I think sort of,
uh,
uh,

1567
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:51.360
you know,
a lot of people subscribe to the idea that technology sort of,

1568
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:53.430
even though it brings people together and connects people,

1569
01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:55.110
it sort of pushing people apart too.

1570
01:29:55.111 --> 01:29:59.040
And it's making people become sort of desensitized to a lot of things and,
and,

1571
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:02.160
and they alienated themselves and sit at home and play video games.

1572
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:07.161
And do you ever consider the possibility that technology is a life form in and

1573
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:08.334
of itself?

1574
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:11.910
Do you ever consider the possibility that we are somehow or another locked in

1575
01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:16.911
some symbiotic relationship to we are the worker bees creating this new life

1576
01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:20.430
form technology,
artificial intelligence,

1577
01:30:20.431 --> 01:30:24.150
which we're absolutely working on creating will eventually be the next stage.

1578
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:28.080
Something that's not hindered by the monkey flesh that really cannot evolve as

1579
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:31.860
quickly as the technology camp.
I see no reason why that should not be the case.

1580
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:32.401
Um,

1581
01:30:32.401 --> 01:30:36.450
I think that since I personally believe that that consciousness is not generated

1582
01:30:36.451 --> 01:30:41.340
by the brain but is an independent entity which chooses to immerse itself in

1583
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:42.174
physical form,

1584
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.630
I don't see why that entity shouldn't chose to most itself in mechanical form

1585
01:30:45.631 --> 01:30:48.630
either in any highly organized system.
Uh,

1586
01:30:48.631 --> 01:30:51.270
I don't see why consciousness should not manifest through that system.

1587
01:30:51.390 --> 01:30:54.780
Why are we thinking that it only is going to work in a collection of bacteria

1588
01:30:54.781 --> 01:30:58.980
and cells?
Yeah.
This bag of bacteria is the only one that works.

1589
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:03.840
Covered a symbiotic relationship between who knows how many different types of

1590
01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:05.100
things in your body.
Yeah.

1591
01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:08.750
He Kolai and all these different things on your skin and you know,
and,

1592
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:12.390
and viruses that you carried for your entire life.
Yeah.

1593
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:15.690
<v 6>Did you make,
have you seen the,
um,
it's on the Internet.</v>

1594
01:31:15.691 --> 01:31:18.600
It's a video where they took the two artificial intelligence machines and let

1595
01:31:18.601 --> 01:31:21.630
them have a conversation.
Yes.
They started lying to each other.
They start lying.

1596
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:26.040
I haven't seen that.
Yeah.
It's hilarious.
It's amazing.

1597
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:29.760
But within a minute they're at talking about God.
Within a minute,

1598
01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:32.000
things are talking about God.
And that was the,

1599
01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:34.830
that was the first time I realized that,
oh,
you know,

1600
01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:40.110
I bet that our idea of this robot that the people make is more like terminator.

1601
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:44.600
You know what I mean?
There's like the kind of like emotionless death machines.

1602
01:31:44.601 --> 01:31:47.250
Yes,
exactly.
But maybe if something super intelligent,

1603
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:51.420
the first thing these machines are going to start considering is their source.

1604
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:51.870
And I think,
oh,

1605
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:55.400
the humans made us and they're going to think who made the humans and where did

1606
01:31:55.401 --> 01:31:56.490
these ideas come from?

1607
01:31:56.491 --> 01:32:00.190
But they're going to process the ideas we're kicking around here it a mega

1608
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.510
<v 4>speed and that's going to produce the new religion or that's going to produce</v>

1609
01:32:04.511 --> 01:32:09.100
the next big whatever Jesus is going to be a robot.
The next thing you can be a,

1610
01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:11.170
a machine say,
I just don't have any,

1611
01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:16.000
<v 0>a problem at all with the notion of consciousness.
I'm incarnating in a machine.</v>

1612
01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:19.510
I that that seems to be perfectly,
perfectly reasonable.
Um,

1613
01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:23.260
and besides there's many machine like functions of the human body.

1614
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.080
I mean Shane's too.

1615
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:26.170
<v 4>Yeah,
we are machines.</v>

1616
01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:30.130
There's a video we've talked about before about watching traffic go back and

1617
01:32:30.131 --> 01:32:32.630
forth on a high speed camera,
slow motion,

1618
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:34.630
rather it's our sped up brother throughout the day.

1619
01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:38.080
And then it looks just like cells and blood cells going down an artery

1620
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:41.490
<v 0>def.
Definitely.
And do you know it's very interesting.
I mean you get to the,</v>

1621
01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:46.810
you get to the issue of the,
um,
the origins of life.
Um,
and,

1622
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:49.340
and of course you touching on deep religious issues.
Who were we?

1623
01:32:49.341 --> 01:32:52.830
Were we created in,
in some way?
Um,

1624
01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.760
I think that the universe,
the,
the,

1625
01:32:55.761 --> 01:32:59.850
the conclusion I'm coming to is that the,
the universe,
um,

1626
01:32:59.910 --> 01:33:04.590
manifests organization and life wherever it can,
as a,
as,
as,

1627
01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:06.040
as a,
uh,

1628
01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:11.290
as a medium in which consciousness can immerse itself.
And that,
that,

1629
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.510
that this may take many different forms and shapes with the key that was driving

1630
01:33:15.511 --> 01:33:18.720
it is consciousness and the need for consciousness to manifest on the physical

1631
01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.960
plane.
I mean at,
I'll make a trivial example,

1632
01:33:21.961 --> 01:33:23.940
but I think all of us have had this experience,
you know,

1633
01:33:23.941 --> 01:33:26.350
with our computers were um,

1634
01:33:26.610 --> 01:33:30.150
somehow there's some kind of interaction between you and your computer in some

1635
01:33:30.151 --> 01:33:33.330
ways it seems that,
uh,
I remember once I had,
it was,

1636
01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.590
it was the most curious thing.

1637
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:40.070
I had just got a new computer and my old computer had increasingly annoyed me

1638
01:33:41.731 --> 01:33:45.300
because when I was saving,
when I'd finished the document on Microsoft word,

1639
01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.710
it told me that I'd made new changes,
which I needed to say,
which I hadn't done.

1640
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:52.020
It kept saying,
do you want to save the changes that you've just made?

1641
01:33:52.021 --> 01:33:53.810
And I hadn't done that and I,

1642
01:33:53.811 --> 01:33:56.490
and finally with other glitches on the machine and got so annoying,

1643
01:33:56.491 --> 01:34:00.810
I decided to get myself another computer and that computer was working fine and

1644
01:34:00.811 --> 01:34:03.810
I was sitting in front of it one day and I was thinking how awful it would be if

1645
01:34:03.811 --> 01:34:08.010
it started manifesting that same fault and instantly the same fault came up on

1646
01:34:08.011 --> 01:34:09.450
my computer.
It did that

1647
01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:13.550
<v 4>I couldn't help feeling this as shitty Microsoft coding yet actually.</v>

1648
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.000
But it was reacting to it.
Nevertheless,
the way it reacted to my thought was odd.

1649
01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:24.400
<v 0>And,
and um,
you know,
I animals,
most people,
most,</v>

1650
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:26.580
most people would argue perhaps humans have a soul,

1651
01:34:26.581 --> 01:34:29.150
but animals don't have assault.
I think we're all soul.

1652
01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.910
I think soul consciousness is the essence of everything.

1653
01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:34.670
And I think it manifests in,
in all forms,

1654
01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:40.010
just incredibly lucky that we have manifested in human bodies because we've got

1655
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:45.130
this body with its equipment is an incredible opportunity for learning and

1656
01:34:45.261 --> 01:34:46.670
growing and developing.

1657
01:34:46.671 --> 01:34:49.880
And we've got much better opportunity to learn and grow and develop then a fruit

1658
01:34:49.881 --> 01:34:51.110
fly or a cockroach.
Does.

1659
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:55.970
<v 4>Do you ever looked in any rubric Sheldrake's work or remarkable man,</v>

1660
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.070
fascinating work.
The idea that everything has

1661
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:02.000
<v 2>some sort of a memory to it.
Yes.
Yeah.
And perhaps even a consciousness to it.</v>

1662
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.460
Yeah.
More.
Yeah,

1663
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:07.050
<v 0>that's right.
That's right.
And he's,
um,</v>

1664
01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:12.020
he's doing really good science on a really metaphysical subjects right now.

1665
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:14.520
One of the few people who's,
who's,
who's doing that.
So He's,

1666
01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:17.760
he's looked at phenomena like the sense of being stared at.

1667
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:20.940
People know when they're being stared at even when they can't see the person

1668
01:35:20.941 --> 01:35:25.530
who's staring at them and the phenomenon of animals knowing when their master is

1669
01:35:25.531 --> 01:35:29.680
going to come home.
Even when the master himself doesn't quite know yet.
They,

1670
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:34.530
he's studying that in a very scientific way and he's producing statistically

1671
01:35:34.531 --> 01:35:37.350
significant results which show that these phenomena definitely do it.

1672
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.040
<v 2>Boyd and people fight at him to the nail.</v>

1673
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:44.230
I've read some of the critiques of his work is so,
so angry.
Yeah.

1674
01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.440
Oh people get so frustrated.
Angry.
Cause again it's a,
it's kind of throwing

1675
01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.760
<v 0>the existing paradigm upside down,</v>

1676
01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:53.490
thrown in the air and saying that that we're all connected by these

1677
01:35:53.491 --> 01:35:54.450
morphogenetic fields

1678
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:57.390
<v 2>and it's not showing a perfect connection either.
It's showing a measurable one,</v>

1679
01:35:57.391 --> 01:35:58.780
it's showing something,
there's something there,

1680
01:35:58.930 --> 01:36:01.840
there's something there and it's probably increasing and evolving.

1681
01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:05.800
Just like our ability to communicate was grunts and noises and then eventually

1682
01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:10.150
evolved into the written word and you know,
and now cd's and mp3s,
it's,

1683
01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:13.870
it's all evolving and our ability to sense when people are staring at us is

1684
01:36:13.871 --> 01:36:15.310
probably something that's evolving.

1685
01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:18.850
There's probably energy that comes off of you when you look at me and I just,

1686
01:36:18.851 --> 01:36:22.090
I can,
I can sense it when I'm looking away.
Yeah,
makes sense.
I mean,

1687
01:36:22.091 --> 01:36:25.420
it totally makes sense.
Yeah.
It's so strange.

1688
01:36:25.421 --> 01:36:28.480
It's so strange that these are all things that people struggle to consider.

1689
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.910
And then if you do talk about them and you're a serious guy,

1690
01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:34.450
but if you talk about them,
you run into Cooksville.
Now all of a sudden you're,

1691
01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:38.710
I mean,
you went so deep into Cooksville that you wrote a book about March did,

1692
01:36:38.711 --> 01:36:42.010
and this is,
this is where you really take a chance.

1693
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:45.790
Lost a lot of my readers there.
Did you?
Yes.
Really?

1694
01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.880
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
but,
but,
you know,
it seemed to me,</v>

1695
01:36:48.881 --> 01:36:52.120
it seemed to be an interesting subject that was worthy of exploration at that

1696
01:36:52.121 --> 01:36:55.380
book was called the Mars mystery.
It was written with Robert Bovard junk,

1697
01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.330
John Grigsby

1698
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:58.880
<v 2>and this is the one I bought it,
but I did not read this one.</v>

1699
01:36:58.881 --> 01:37:01.820
Does this have a lot to do with side Donia and the face on Mars and all that

1700
01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:03.110
stuff you'd

1701
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.630
<v 0>think?
Um,
but we try to set those in context.
Uh,</v>

1702
01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.340
I do think down is extremely interesting.
Um,
what,

1703
01:37:11.341 --> 01:37:14.970
I mean,
my part of that book was mainly about cosmic cataclysms.

1704
01:37:14.971 --> 01:37:17.230
It's clear that the planet,
Planet Mars,
uh,

1705
01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:21.000
has been subjected to the most horrific disaster.
Uh,

1706
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:23.760
and that there is some scientific evidence with suggest.

1707
01:37:23.761 --> 01:37:27.210
This may have been pretty recent,
like the last 20,000 years.
I mean,
wow.

1708
01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.430
Half of the planet is like a mile higher than the other half.
So if you measure,

1709
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.040
you take,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1710
01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:39.290
a little ball and you cut the line round its equator and then you peel off the

1711
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:45.450
outer layer of the lower half and then you leave the upper half as it as it was.

1712
01:37:45.451 --> 01:37:49.460
There's a cliff of mile high runs all the way around Mars.
And,
uh,

1713
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:53.850
as something dramatic and disastrous happened to that planet,

1714
01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:58.470
there was definitely water that planet flowing water and something took it away.

1715
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:02.640
Um,
very,
very horrible.
Cosmic catechism occurred,

1716
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:07.440
sort of struck by a gigantic asteroid or comet most likely.
Um,

1717
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.470
and uh,
we have these odd ruins or what look like ruins,
uh,

1718
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:16.470
which NASA behaves very oddly about,
uh,
on the planet Mars.

1719
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:18.480
And I just think it's an extremely interesting mystery.

1720
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.260
And I decided to try to put my mind to work on this mystery and CFA could add

1721
01:38:22.261 --> 01:38:26.010
anything to the debate.
I thought it's interesting until,
ah,

1722
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:30.630
what do you mean behaved badly?
Sorry,
sorry.
Wait,
which NASA behave?
So yes.
Well,

1723
01:38:30.631 --> 01:38:35.610
because because um,
uh,
NASA is,
um,

1724
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:39.420
has consistently ridiculed the notion that there might be,
um,

1725
01:38:39.450 --> 01:38:43.710
there might be intelligently created artifacts on Mars and that seems to be a

1726
01:38:43.711 --> 01:38:46.400
most unscientific proposition.
Um,
we have all,

1727
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:49.980
we have our photographs and on the basis of those photographs,

1728
01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:53.670
it's not good to assume that they are monuments or that they are not monuments.

1729
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:55.740
We need to keep an open mind tech take there.

1730
01:38:55.741 --> 01:38:58.830
We were talking earlier about the Yana Goonie underwater monument.

1731
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:02.670
I mean you can actually bring two geologists to that monument.

1732
01:39:02.671 --> 01:39:05.520
You can put them in front of it for half an hour and they'll come away with

1733
01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:08.030
completely different opinions about what it is.
So,

1734
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:12.150
so how can we form really useful opinions on the basis of photography alone?

1735
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.290
You know who fucks this up?
Hoagland?
Well,
guy goes too deep.

1736
01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.330
He gets too crazy.
Richard Hoagland,

1737
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:23.340
he's one of the guys who's invested a huge chunk of his life to proving that

1738
01:39:23.341 --> 01:39:23.601
side.

1739
01:39:23.601 --> 01:39:28.601
Donia is an artificially created complex and he makes these giant leaps in these

1740
01:39:28.831 --> 01:39:33.831
weird connections where he measures like random distances between points and now

1741
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:38.280
and shows that they have a direct correlation between distances that can be

1742
01:39:38.281 --> 01:39:41.790
measured on in Egypt and the Giza plateau or will you measure the,

1743
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:44.130
you try to follow where he's going.
You're like,
God,

1744
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:46.200
this is just riddled with confirmation bias.

1745
01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:50.370
It's riddled with this idea that you know,
you're trying to find this connection.

1746
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.690
You know it's,
yeah,
there's some stuff there that looks unusual.
The face,

1747
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.980
you want to have a face kind of looks like a mountain to me.

1748
01:39:55.981 --> 01:39:59.150
But what's odd is the shape of it.
It's,
it's,
it is odd that it's,

1749
01:39:59.151 --> 01:40:02.790
it's kind of symmetrical but beg to differ.
I think that,

1750
01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:06.060
I think that Richard Hoagland,
his work's important and I think he's,
um,

1751
01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:10.890
I think he's shown great courage in,
uh,
putting his neck on the line.
Uh,

1752
01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.020
whether he's right or whether he's wrong,
this is a subject that's worthy of,
um,

1753
01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.220
of exploration.
I certainly agree with that,

1754
01:40:17.221 --> 01:40:21.020
but I don't agree with how he approaches things sometimes.
You know,
you know,

1755
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:24.060
sometimes what happens is you get this polarization when you get,

1756
01:40:24.061 --> 01:40:27.720
when you get extreme academic positions,
no,
we will not listen to this.

1757
01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.050
We will not believe this.
We could do not accept any of this.
It's total rubbish.

1758
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:34.930
It tends to make you more extreme on the other side as well.
You get,
you,

1759
01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:39.690
you get crazy from the resistance and,
and,
and,
and you need to,

1760
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:42.660
you know,
you need to keep on,
you need to keep on pushing.

1761
01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:45.900
So he needs someone behind them,
giving them a back rub.
And settled down.

1762
01:40:45.901 --> 01:40:48.870
Richard was like crazy.
I,
I,

1763
01:40:48.871 --> 01:40:53.470
I'd like to say [inaudible] in my opinion.

1764
01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.740
Richard is a good man and a good researcher.
I think he's,
I think he's done.

1765
01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.030
I think he's done important work on Mars.
And um,
and those who,

1766
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:06.190
those who,
who put Richard Down maybe eating their words in 10 or 20 years time,

1767
01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.120
<v 4>that's me.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
My words,
that's not my community and I'm sorry,</v>

1768
01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:13.560
I'm a professional shirt darker.
I can't help it.
There's something to be booked.

1769
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:15.460
Find out,
especially the guy believes,
you know,

1770
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:16.990
there's a face on Mars and all that.
You know,

1771
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:19.180
there's some of the things that I think are very compelling.

1772
01:41:19.181 --> 01:41:21.480
Five sided pyramids or some other structures that,

1773
01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:24.550
not saying he's right or he's wrong.
I'm saying the question needed

1774
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:28.060
<v 0>to be asked and then it needed to be asked forcefully because it's up against</v>

1775
01:41:28.061 --> 01:41:31.060
resistance and it needed to be asked in a way that would engage the public

1776
01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:31.750
imagination.

1777
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:35.680
<v 4>And when you say what you said earlier,
it doesn't seem unreasonable at all.</v>

1778
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:40.420
If you say that half of Mars is like literally destroyed a mile lower,

1779
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.140
well obviously something kind of Klinsmann captain and then the absolute proof,

1780
01:41:44.141 --> 01:41:46.630
they've already found that there's water on Mars and there has been flowing

1781
01:41:46.631 --> 01:41:50.740
rivers.
There's all sorts of evidence of that.
Why not structures?
Shit.

1782
01:41:50.741 --> 01:41:51.850
If their structures here,

1783
01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:56.340
how amazing would it be if just 50 60,000 years ago there was a goddamn

1784
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.560
civilization right up there on Mars for real.

1785
01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:03.120
And then we were existing at the same time they were existing and then we had

1786
01:42:03.121 --> 01:42:06.220
parallel development.
Could be some interaction.
This is,
this is,

1787
01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.270
this is an interesting

1788
01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:11.300
<v 0>question.
Is a question worth asking?
It's a question and,
and,
and I'm,</v>

1789
01:42:11.301 --> 01:42:15.240
I'm glad that somebody was prepared to devote,
you know,
half of his life to,

1790
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:18.830
to exploring and investigating.
Even if he's wrong.
I'm glad that he was,

1791
01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:23.070
<v 4>it's not even that he's wrong,
it's just he goes crazy art bell on Ya.
You know,</v>

1792
01:42:23.071 --> 01:42:27.380
where he absolutely knows and this is unproven and you know,
you're like,
oh,

1793
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:31.260
I can say it's the,
it's the polarization effect.
It's totally makes sense.
I mean,

1794
01:42:31.261 --> 01:42:36.261
I would imagine it's got to be incredibly difficult to be taken seriously with

1795
01:42:36.361 --> 01:42:37.200
any of this stuff.

1796
01:42:37.201 --> 01:42:41.520
And you have shown incredible bravery and putting forth all this stuff.

1797
01:42:41.521 --> 01:42:44.220
Cause I mean a lot of shit.
I'm sure you have

1798
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:47.430
<v 0>man.
A lot.
I mean,
the worst was the worst was um,</v>

1799
01:42:47.490 --> 01:42:49.620
really being set up by the BBC.

1800
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:52.480
<v 4>I signed that.
I was going to bring that up if it came up.</v>

1801
01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:54.640
I mean that in a way it's an,
I suppose it's,
yeah,

1802
01:42:54.690 --> 01:42:58.590
<v 0>kind of oblique honor that a BBC horizon,</v>

1803
01:42:58.591 --> 01:43:01.830
which is their flagship science program,
uh,

1804
01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:06.540
chose to spend three quarters of $1 million destroying my reputation.
Um,

1805
01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:10.530
but that's what,
that's what happened now six weeks before I heard from them,

1806
01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.790
I got a call from a friend in television and he said,

1807
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:16.103
Graham,

1808
01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:20.340
you're going to get a call from horizon and they're going to ask you to appear

1809
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:25.680
in interview on a show about you.
And here's my advice.
Say,
no,

1810
01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:27.480
they're going to stitch you up.

1811
01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:32.340
The whole thing is intended from the beginning as an operation to destroy you.

1812
01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.440
What's the motivation?
And you will not get a fair hearing.
And he said,

1813
01:43:37.441 --> 01:43:40.650
the best thing you can do is just not do that show.
So when they rang me up,

1814
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:41.640
I immediately said yes,

1815
01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.120
<v 4>yes.
[inaudible] was their motivation for this Troy?
Well,</v>

1816
01:43:45.121 --> 01:43:46.270
the motivation was clear.
Yeah.

1817
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:48.660
<v 0>And I learned about this afterwards,
which was a,</v>

1818
01:43:48.661 --> 01:43:53.060
a group of academics from various in Britain had written to the BBC.

1819
01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:57.470
And so this man Hancock is leading our students to question our archeology and

1820
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:01.580
he's totally irresponsible and he's just writing popular books for the public,

1821
01:44:01.581 --> 01:44:03.050
but he's having such an impact.

1822
01:44:03.110 --> 01:44:06.080
He needs to be stopped and we need a program about him,

1823
01:44:06.081 --> 01:44:10.080
which really shows how full of shit he is basically about or done.
So,

1824
01:44:10.081 --> 01:44:13.370
and that was the agenda of the program from the beginning was not to give a fair

1825
01:44:13.371 --> 01:44:17.480
hearing to the ideas that I'd explored,
but to,
uh,

1826
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:20.150
demonstrate that I was full of Shit.
And,
uh,

1827
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:24.650
it was very difficult to get any kind of fairness in that situation,

1828
01:44:24.651 --> 01:44:28.670
especially when in the cutting room,
ah,
dirty tricks were played.

1829
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:30.240
And that's why I,

1830
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:34.150
Robert Navarro was also on that program with me and he and I took,
uh,

1831
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:38.200
the BBC to the Broadcasting Standards Commission.
Uh,

1832
01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:42.680
and it was the first time in 35 years of broadcasting of horizon that they were

1833
01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:46.040
found at fault.
They were found to have produced an unfair program.

1834
01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.050
We listed 10 points of unfairness.

1835
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.410
Only one of them was accepted as unfair by the broadcasting commission.

1836
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.244
Nevertheless,

1837
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.910
it was the first time in the history of that program that they were actually

1838
01:44:56.090 --> 01:45:00.480
found to have been deliberately unfair to mega rich and they would blow,

1839
01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:03.650
they were obliged to re edit the program and produce a second version of it,

1840
01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:06.260
which was fairer in quite a number of ways.

1841
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:09.980
I actually think that the other nine points we raised where were right as well,

1842
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.620
but the 10th one was the one that we really caught them out towards John and,

1843
01:45:13.630 --> 01:45:16.880
well,
this was to do with the Orion correlation and the fact that they had,

1844
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:20.990
they had,
um,
uh,
not presented our side of the story.

1845
01:45:20.991 --> 01:45:24.140
They'd simply presented the academic side of the story and they had not allowed

1846
01:45:24.141 --> 01:45:26.420
us to answer this was a,
this was unfair,

1847
01:45:26.421 --> 01:45:30.400
so that an impression was created that we had no answer to this objection.

1848
01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:34.000
<v 5>I saw the documentary or whatever you want to call it.
It was horrible.</v>

1849
01:45:34.001 --> 01:45:37.390
It was a real attack piece.
But then I also read your response to it,

1850
01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:40.840
which really kind of covered every single area that they,

1851
01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.280
and then you read your response,
you go,
oh wow.
Yeah.

1852
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:48.280
I mean it's really amazing that they were able to put together that,

1853
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:52.690
that sort of a,
a biased bullshit piece on you.
But my response,
you know,

1854
01:45:52.691 --> 01:45:55.300
was read by a tiny fraction of the people who actually,

1855
01:45:55.301 --> 01:46:00.060
who actually saw the show and that show actually did have a devastating effect

1856
01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.050
on stilled today's this day.

1857
01:46:02.051 --> 01:46:05.140
Some somebody put it on my message board when I said that you were going to be

1858
01:46:05.141 --> 01:46:07.600
on the podcast when it was being discussed.
Somebody put it on the message board,

1859
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.920
but luckily someone else had your,

1860
01:46:09.921 --> 01:46:13.100
your response to it and then it was better that it was,
was it Jay?

1861
01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.440
John West actually pointed out of them

1862
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:17.290
<v 0>time cause he wrote a letter at the BBC two BBC would crow,
you know,</v>

1863
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.810
they were trying to say,
oh well only one of the 10 points was unfair.

1864
01:46:20.811 --> 01:46:24.830
So that's not,
that's not too bad.
And,
and the point John Westworld made was no,

1865
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.640
<v 5>that's the only point that you were able to really get caught out on.</v>

1866
01:46:28.641 --> 01:46:31.400
It's like they caught our Capone out on tax evasion,

1867
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.760
but he doesn't mean he was innocent of all the other things he was accused of.

1868
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.510
John Anthony West gets stuck on the outside because he doesn't have a degree.

1869
01:46:38.511 --> 01:46:40.520
Right.
Is that what's going on with him?
He's not an easy,

1870
01:46:40.521 --> 01:46:43.370
he's not a professionally qualified egyptologist,

1871
01:46:43.371 --> 01:46:46.070
but he's the best egyptologist I know.
It's brilliant.

1872
01:46:46.090 --> 01:46:50.460
There's magical Egypt DVD series,
rentable.
Wonderful.
John's a great man.

1873
01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:54.900
I watched that DVD series Noblesse than 20 times over and over at my wife was

1874
01:46:54.901 --> 01:46:56.610
getting,
she was yelling at me.
She's like,

1875
01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:01.200
I can't believe you're watching magical Egypt again.
And then she was like,

1876
01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:04.350
you're crazy.
You're a crazy person.
I'm like,
this is fascinating.

1877
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:06.430
Do you know what they knew?
You know how much they knew.
This is incredible.

1878
01:47:06.431 --> 01:47:07.180
Look at a John.
Yeah.

1879
01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:11.500
<v 3>John West has done fantastic work on Egypt and anybody who's traveling to Egypt</v>

1880
01:47:12.190 --> 01:47:16.820
get hold of John West's travelers key to ancient Egypt,
which is by far by,

1881
01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:18.460
by a planetary distance,

1882
01:47:18.461 --> 01:47:21.460
the best guide book that's ever been written on Egypt because that will plunge

1883
01:47:21.461 --> 01:47:23.680
you into the mystery of Egypt in a way that no other books

1884
01:47:23.690 --> 01:47:27.510
<v 5>it does.
Yeah.
His work is incredible.
Three car,</v>

1885
01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:30.133
<v 3>you</v>

1886
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:34.790
<v 6>go and do Ios,
get ceremonies in the Amazon.</v>

1887
01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.190
<v 3>Hmm.
And</v>

1888
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:38.670
<v 6>deep sea diving and dangerous.</v>

1889
01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:44.560
He's a real Indiana Jones man.
This is Indiana Jones.

1890
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:48.500
They were real close like you're,
you're a prime candidate for,

1891
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.100
for somebody who's probably going to get sucked into some kind of vortex thing.

1892
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:55.490
Yeah.
You might just manage sometimes that might just have,

1893
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.590
<v 5>it is an incredible a resume.
When you think about it,
the fact that you,</v>

1894
01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:02.950
the description of those dives,
man about the current,
yeah.

1895
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:04.440
<v 6>The BBC thing.</v>

1896
01:48:04.441 --> 01:48:07.950
The reason I bring that up is because it's not as though you're just studying

1897
01:48:07.951 --> 01:48:12.420
foggy pictures or you're just looking at it or reading information and then

1898
01:48:12.630 --> 01:48:15.750
coming up with some idea.
You're down under the water.

1899
01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.630
Looking at this stuff firsthand.
I've walked the walk,

1900
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.820
<v 3>I've walked the walk.
I've put my,</v>

1901
01:48:20.821 --> 01:48:25.821
I put my life on the line and I've made an honest and sincere attempt to provide

1902
01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:31.290
some balance to the grotesquely imbalanced picture of our history that is

1903
01:48:31.291 --> 01:48:33.540
presented by mainstream archeology.
This is,

1904
01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:38.460
this is what I fundamentally see my role as being,
you know,

1905
01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:41.490
I'm per portrayed as that by the BBC is this person,
you know,

1906
01:48:41.491 --> 01:48:45.360
who's selling these wild theories to the public through,
I don't know,

1907
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.670
some kind of Glib magic,

1908
01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.930
but actually what I see myself as is somebody who's saying,
hang on,

1909
01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.710
there might have been another way.
Things could have been different.

1910
01:48:55.711 --> 01:48:59.550
The way that we're being told things where there's enough problems with that to

1911
01:48:59.551 --> 01:49:02.610
raise some questions and I'm going to look at those questions and I'm going to

1912
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:05.880
document them and examine them and let's see what they come to.

1913
01:49:05.881 --> 01:49:09.510
I do not insist that there was a lost civilization.

1914
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:13.410
I think it's highly probable.
I think it has been missed by the mainstream.

1915
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.110
And so what I tried to do was provide balance to a very biased picture,
uh,

1916
01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:20.600
rather than try to completely overthrow the picture.

1917
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:23.820
I'm simply trying to balance it and that's never been seen.
And I,
I feel,

1918
01:49:23.821 --> 01:49:28.620
I feel in that area I was treated very unfairly.

1919
01:49:28.890 --> 01:49:30.180
But Hey,
uh,

1920
01:49:30.181 --> 01:49:33.540
the BBC horizon experience was a really good learning experience for me.

1921
01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:36.780
I needed my ego taking down a peg or two

1922
01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:42.470
<v 5>and that,
the psychedelic experience in and of itself,
right.
In and of itself.</v>

1923
01:49:42.471 --> 01:49:44.950
Yeah.
If you know.
So I was,
I was,
I was ready for,

1924
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.550
I'll ask you to kick me up the ass.

1925
01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:51.540
<v 2>Well,
um,
thank you very much for joining us,
man.
I can't thank you enough.</v>

1926
01:49:51.541 --> 01:49:54.960
This was such a huge treat for me is,
like I said,
your,
your book,

1927
01:49:55.290 --> 01:49:58.200
the fingerprints of the gods really just changed the way I looked at everything

1928
01:49:58.201 --> 01:49:59.820
changed the way I looked at human history,

1929
01:49:59.821 --> 01:50:03.030
changed the way I looked at the academic study of human history.

1930
01:50:03.031 --> 01:50:05.520
And what people are willing to,
you know,

1931
01:50:05.730 --> 01:50:09.390
to believe and not believe and how much they're willing to throw everything that

1932
01:50:09.391 --> 01:50:12.810
they've learned aside or push it aside or everything that they're teaching.

1933
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:17.400
And it's a,
it's a,
it's amazing.
It's amazing work for people that are skeptical.

1934
01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:21.450
You need to just look at some of the photographs.
Look at some of the bell back.

1935
01:50:21.451 --> 01:50:22.080
Is that what it's called

1936
01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:25.170
<v 0>now?
That could love it.
Yeah.
10,000 ton megaliths</v>

1937
01:50:25.290 --> 01:50:29.070
<v 2>you just need to see them.
They're in.
It doesn't even,
how tall are they?</v>

1938
01:50:29.071 --> 01:50:30.990
They're like insanely tall.
10 feet tall.

1939
01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.400
<v 0>Oh No.
Much more than that.</v>

1940
01:50:32.401 --> 01:50:35.470
That the huge megalith in Baalbek is going to be a hundred feet long.

1941
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:40.180
A hundred feet long.
One stone,
one stone.
And where was it?
Cut Fries.

1942
01:50:40.181 --> 01:50:43.510
More than a thousand tons.
Not Far.
Not Far.

1943
01:50:43.590 --> 01:50:47.950
That was quarried quite locally,
but a thousand tons,
you know,
come on.

1944
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:51.330
<v 2>And what is the explanation?
They academic explanation for that.</v>

1945
01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:55.960
<v 0>They say that that temple was built by the Romans as the temple of Jupiter and</v>

1946
01:50:55.970 --> 01:51:00.450
that the Romans moved does big stamps.
I would say that what happened was that,

1947
01:51:00.451 --> 01:51:00.850
uh,

1948
01:51:00.850 --> 01:51:05.850
a much older culture created that big stone structure and the on top of it,

1949
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:07.740
the Romans built the temple of Jupiter.

1950
01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:11.400
<v 2>So 10,000 plus years ago,
something happened.</v>

1951
01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:15.100
<v 0>I believe so what?
I think it was the end of something.
Uh,</v>

1952
01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:18.360
what 12 and a half thousand years ago was the end,
not the beginning.
That was,

1953
01:51:18.361 --> 01:51:19.260
that was a,

1954
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:23.580
that was the time when the meltdown of the ice age was at one of his most

1955
01:51:23.581 --> 01:51:28.230
extreme periods.
The actual meltdown of the ash took 10,000 years to unfold.

1956
01:51:28.231 --> 01:51:29.760
But within that 10,000 years,

1957
01:51:29.761 --> 01:51:33.870
there were three or four episodes of gigantic flooding where you had 30 foot

1958
01:51:33.871 --> 01:51:37.680
rise of sea levels very rapidly,
virtually overnight.
Um,

1959
01:51:37.710 --> 01:51:41.580
you consider what a 30 foot sea level rise would do to our civilization today

1960
01:51:41.581 --> 01:51:44.070
would wipe out every coastal city.
I mean,
look,

1961
01:51:44.071 --> 01:51:46.590
America is still reeling from Hurricane Katrina.

1962
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:51.870
Imagine what would happen if every coastal city went under 30 feet of water.
Um,

1963
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:55.650
it would is enough to destroy any civilization.
So it was a climate change thing.

1964
01:51:55.650 --> 01:51:59.460
You think it was suddenly a climate change,
but,
but,
but you know,
the,

1965
01:51:59.550 --> 01:52:04.550
the cataclysmic explanation of m ice caps is to do with the pole shifts and to

1966
01:52:06.391 --> 01:52:10.170
do with,
uh,
with the mechanism called Earth crust displacement,

1967
01:52:10.171 --> 01:52:13.460
which was first proposed by Charles Hapgood.

1968
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:16.740
And they go into this at some length in fingerprints of the gods.

1969
01:52:16.741 --> 01:52:19.500
The notion that that the outer crust of the earth,

1970
01:52:19.501 --> 01:52:23.430
rather like the sort of skin of an orange could move around the fruit,

1971
01:52:23.490 --> 01:52:27.280
the inner core of the earth,
that the court,
the crust could move.
Uh,

1972
01:52:27.281 --> 01:52:29.670
and therefore in hap goods theory,
uh,

1973
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:34.260
ice forms on areas of the crust that are close to one or other pole.

1974
01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:38.730
That makes sense.
The polls are cold,
but when the crust shifts,

1975
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:43.860
it moves that cold area into a warm area,
moves it closer to the equator,

1976
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:49.040
makes all the ice,
and meanwhile new eye starts to foam form on the new pole.

1977
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.840
Um,
so that theory explains the meltdown of the Ice Age,

1978
01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:55.790
not as a result of climate change,

1979
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:58.610
but as a result of cataclysmic earth movements.

1980
01:52:58.970 --> 01:53:03.830
And then explains also ancient maps of Iceland.
And Greenland does.
It does.

1981
01:53:03.831 --> 01:53:07.100
I think the maps are a very important question,

1982
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:11.930
which I do not see any academic providing a good answer to.
There are maps.
Um,

1983
01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:17.170
almost always these maps turn out to be copies of earlier maps.

1984
01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.640
Uh,
the period is map is a famous example.

1985
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:23.450
He tells he was a Turkish admiral and he tells us actually in hand write his own

1986
01:53:23.451 --> 01:53:27.920
handwriting on the fragment of the map that has survived that he based his was a

1987
01:53:27.921 --> 01:53:28.490
world map.

1988
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:31.940
We've only got one corner of it that he based it on more than a hundred source

1989
01:53:31.941 --> 01:53:34.250
maps,
none of which have survived.

1990
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:37.820
This was the case with the Raunchiest Phineas map and some of the Marketo maps

1991
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:40.820
as well that they were drawing on ancient maps,
which no longer,

1992
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:41.990
which didn't come down to us.

1993
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:47.350
So these maps were drawn within relatively recent history within the last

1994
01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:51.060
thousand years,
but they were copying much older maps,
many thousand years,

1995
01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:52.100
1000 years older.

1996
01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:56.570
And so it's very interesting when we find anomalies on these maps.
For example,

1997
01:53:56.990 --> 01:54:01.880
um,
our culture,
uh,
discovered Antarctica in 18,
18,

1998
01:54:02.410 --> 01:54:06.500
um,
before that maps that were being drawn around 1800,

1999
01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:09.440
they showed an empty hole where Antarctica is.

2000
01:54:09.441 --> 01:54:12.050
But if you go back to the 15 hundreds of the 14 hundreds,

2001
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:14.930
when they were copying these older maps,
they haven't come down to us.

2002
01:54:14.931 --> 01:54:17.380
You find Antarctica on every single one of them.

2003
01:54:17.690 --> 01:54:20.780
That's incredible on every single one of them.
And,
and,
uh,

2004
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:24.790
it's kind of a bit bigger than it is now and it comes close to an almost touches

2005
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.860
South America just as it did during the last ice age.

2006
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:30.620
You'll find off the coast of Ireland,

2007
01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:34.880
a little circular island with the legend on,

2008
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:36.500
it's called High Brazil.

2009
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.420
That island is about 120 miles west of the West Irish coast.

2010
01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:45.680
Um,
if you look at sea level rise,

2011
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:50.770
you find that 12,000 years ago and earlier an island of exactly that size and

2012
01:54:52.251 --> 01:54:55.400
exactly that shape existed in exactly that spot.

2013
01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:59.060
And it was covered by rising sea levels 12,000 years ago.

2014
01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.500
And it shows up on this math like a ghost.
Um,
and that has to mean to,

2015
01:55:03.501 --> 01:55:08.210
to has to mean that somebody was around 12,000 years ago who had at least

2016
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:12.950
developed sufficient technology to explore the world and map it accurately.

2017
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:16.110
And a flood killed all that and a flood destroyed a door.

2018
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:19.520
You're convinced of the flood.
Uh,
like I say,
I'm not,

2019
01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.420
I'm not here with a belief system.
Um,
I'm [inaudible],

2020
01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:27.230
I'm here with anomalies and problems in the mainstream,
in the mainstream model.

2021
01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.930
And,
and what the evidence suggests to me very,

2022
01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:34.070
very strongly is that those cataclysmic earth changes at the end of the ice age.

2023
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:38.120
And even regardless whether a pole Schefter or crustal displacement was
involved,

2024
01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.750
nobody can dispute that.
The meltdown of the ice age was a cataclysmic event.

2025
01:55:41.970 --> 01:55:43.200
Will,
I'm sorry,
sorry.

2026
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:47.340
Evolved huge amounts of volcanic activity and it involved these tremendous

2027
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:48.540
releases of water.

2028
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:52.680
So the ice would actually accumulate in glassy lakes for thousands of years.

2029
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:54.360
It would melt slowly,
slowly melt.

2030
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:59.070
And then suddenly this is the mainstream model.
Suddenly the,

2031
01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:00.090
um,

2032
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:05.090
the banks of the ice dam that held back that water would burst and the whole

2033
01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:09.810
mass of 4,000 years of meltwater would pour down into the world ocean in one

2034
01:56:09.811 --> 01:56:11.400
moment.
And,
and,
and,

2035
01:56:11.401 --> 01:56:15.240
and the water descending from the top of the ice cap would reach speeds of 600

2036
01:56:15.241 --> 01:56:18.540
miles an hour and there were a wave height of close to a thousand feet.

2037
01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:22.380
It then tears across the landscape that lies below the ice cap.

2038
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:25.840
And you see this still the scab lands of New Jersey,
the,
the,

2039
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:27.300
the finger lakes of New York state.

2040
01:56:27.570 --> 01:56:32.570
These are the results of those massive outburst floods that then tear,

2041
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:37.020
tear across the land and then pour into the water and wash up,
go see level.

2042
01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:41.160
Whoa.
Holy Shit.

2043
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:45.420
Could you imagine a thousand foot high wave just tearing across the entire

2044
01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:49.950
continent?
It happened.
It definitely has.
It definitely happened.

2045
01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:51.200
Mainstream sciences,

2046
01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.930
not in disagreement on how excited were you about the discovery of Atlantis?

2047
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:59.880
Do you buy into that 100%?
Atlantis for me,
um,
is one of,

2048
01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:03.330
uh,
thousands of traditions,
uh,
about,
uh,

2049
01:57:03.630 --> 01:57:07.000
hi episode of Human Civilization in remote antiquity,
uh,

2050
01:57:07.050 --> 01:57:10.620
destroyed when that civilization angered the gods.
That is a,

2051
01:57:10.621 --> 01:57:15.120
that is a universal story.
It's told everywhere.
Um,

2052
01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:16.710
and the Atlantis,

2053
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:20.900
the Atlantis story is better understood as part of that worldwide,
uh,

2054
01:57:20.970 --> 01:57:25.050
tradition rather than viewed in isolation.
Um,

2055
01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.400
it's very interesting.

2056
01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:29.880
The Atlantis story comes to us from the Greek philosopher Plato.

2057
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:34.680
He is the earliest source of the Atlantis Myth if it's a myth.

2058
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.030
And uh,

2059
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:40.410
he sets out information about Atlantis in two of his dialogues that Timmy has

2060
01:57:40.411 --> 01:57:41.270
and the Critias.

2061
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:45.300
And what he says is that this information came to him through an elder figure

2062
01:57:45.301 --> 01:57:47.670
who's called long like Greek lawmaker,

2063
01:57:47.671 --> 01:57:50.320
who existed about a hundred years before the time of Plato,

2064
01:57:50.321 --> 01:57:51.750
but was in Plato's family.

2065
01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:56.670
And the information had been passed down to Plato so long had received the

2066
01:57:56.671 --> 01:58:00.210
information from priests in Egypt.
They'd told him about Atlantis.

2067
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:03.960
This is how Plato tells a story.
And when Plato tells the story,

2068
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:09.140
he actually puts a date on the submergence of Atlantis and that date is 9,000

2069
01:58:10.081 --> 01:58:14.700
years before the time of soul on that means 9,600 BC,

2070
01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:17.190
that means 11 and a half thousand years ago.

2071
01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:21.180
And we're right there in that window when the ice age is melting down and,

2072
01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:25.920
and hell is being unleashed on earth.
And uh,
if Plato made it all up,

2073
01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:29.010
I'm really,
I really need to understand how he got the date right.

2074
01:58:30.630 --> 01:58:31.470
It's amazing.

2075
01:58:32.250 --> 01:58:36.000
What a beautiful way of putting it that we are a species with amnesia.

2076
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:39.830
And it's really almost,
I mean,
when you,
when you stop and think about it,

2077
01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:41.770
how does one keep records

2078
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:43.120
<v 2>over 12,</v>

2079
01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:48.040
15,000 years with giant cataclysmic events where people are for many generations

2080
01:58:48.041 --> 01:58:52.120
scratching and scrounging,
just trying to stay alive like animals,
very difficult.

2081
01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:52.580
No

2082
01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:57.170
<v 0>monumental architecture may be one way of doing it.
Um,
the,
you know,</v>

2083
01:58:57.171 --> 01:59:01.010
the notion that the pyramids and the Sphinx were laid out on the ground to

2084
01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:06.250
muddle in ancient sky and thus define a date using four constellations,

2085
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:10.820
which where Leo Aquarius drug go on a Ryan using those four constellations to

2086
01:59:10.821 --> 01:59:15.020
define a date,
it seems like a kind of exotic idea,
but uh,

2087
01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:18.560
we have that right here in the United States in the Hoover dam.
Um,

2088
01:59:18.590 --> 01:59:22.670
there is a star map built into the architecture of the Hoover dam and that star

2089
01:59:22.671 --> 01:59:25.610
map freezes the sky above the Hoover dam.

2090
01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:28.560
At the moment the Hoover dam was completed.
Uh,

2091
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:32.720
and the purpose of putting that star map there by the man who originated it was

2092
01:59:32.721 --> 01:59:35.030
precisely this.
They said in 10,000 years time,

2093
01:59:35.031 --> 01:59:39.440
if our civilization is lost and our language is lost and nobody can read our

2094
01:59:39.441 --> 01:59:43.820
documents,
uh,
when they come across the structure by looking at the star map,

2095
01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:47.360
they will be able to know when it was created.
Yeah.
Dang.

2096
01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.970
<v 2>How crazy is that?
And it's all based on the procession of the Equinox</v>

2097
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:54.000
<v 0>based on the precession,</v>

2098
01:59:54.001 --> 01:59:58.530
which gives you this universal beautifully mathematical cycle.

2099
01:59:58.650 --> 02:00:00.570
<v 2>And we got to think that if people think like that today,</v>

2100
02:00:00.571 --> 02:00:04.230
they must have thought like that back down if the civilization had in some

2101
02:00:04.590 --> 02:00:06.840
totally different and alien way than our own.
I mean,

2102
02:00:06.841 --> 02:00:11.220
so alien that their writing was images,
you know,
Egypt.

2103
02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:15.540
That's one of the things I really got out of John Anthony West DVD series was he

2104
02:00:15.810 --> 02:00:20.810
really kind of gets you to understand how different their culture and society

2105
02:00:22.021 --> 02:00:26.340
was than ours.
The way they,
just,
the way they read things,
they read things,

2106
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:31.470
you know,
it was all like shell,
Nike,
Reebok.
I mean they saw things in images.

2107
02:00:31.471 --> 02:00:34.240
That was their language.
Their language was images.

2108
02:00:34.530 --> 02:00:39.390
Such a bizarre and different way to even think about existence.

2109
02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:39.930
Yeah.

2110
02:00:39.930 --> 02:00:41.960
<v 0>Very different than,
and,
and,
uh,</v>

2111
02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:47.110
the important thing for me to remember about the ancient Egyptians is this,

2112
02:00:47.191 --> 02:00:50.520
this was a culture that devoted his best minds,
you know,

2113
02:00:50.521 --> 02:00:53.430
for 3000 years to considering the mystery of life.

2114
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:55.110
What this is about and the mystery of death.

2115
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:59.200
<v 2>We lost so much in that burning of the library of Alexandria,
right?
Like,</v>

2116
02:00:59.201 --> 02:00:59.921
goodness knows what.

2117
02:00:59.921 --> 02:01:04.210
We lost those with the whole heritage of the human rights went down and not so

2118
02:01:04.211 --> 02:01:06.730
incredible.
We're left with this framework,
these,

2119
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.850
these stone things to try to deconstruct the past.
And,
and even people,

2120
02:01:11.851 --> 02:01:14.620
I mean,
they have a certain amount of information and they say,
we're done.

2121
02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:16.410
We're done.
We figured it out.
We've figured it out.
Yeah.

2122
02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:19.990
Just the idea that they can put a date to it and what haven't they dated the

2123
02:01:19.991 --> 02:01:23.830
pyramids just sort of based on carbon and things were left behind.

2124
02:01:23.831 --> 02:01:28.530
That doesn't necessarily mean that people did in new vein into the Pyramids at

2125
02:01:28.531 --> 02:01:31.750
2,500 BC.
Like do they know the exact date?

2126
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:36.710
<v 0>There's not,
there's not much to go on.
Um,
it's,
you can't compensate stone,</v>

2127
02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:40.760
but you can carbon date organic material and in the mortar between the stones,

2128
02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:45.320
there's some organic material and the carbon dating on that is really puzzling.

2129
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:50.450
Um,
it doesn't make the pyramid 12,000 years old,
but it makes,

2130
02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:55.780
it makes it a thousand years older than it's supposed to be at the top and 400

2131
02:01:59.091 --> 02:02:03.510
years older than it's supposed to be at the bottom.
Go figure that out.
Huh?

2132
02:02:04.190 --> 02:02:08.090
You think they build from the bottom up,
not the other way down.
Um,

2133
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.180
and this says nothing about the core structure of the pyramid.

2134
02:02:11.181 --> 02:02:14.780
It only says about the outer facade.
How does that,
I don't think we can,

2135
02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.160
I don't think we can take the pyramid away entirely from the ancient Egyptians.

2136
02:02:19.190 --> 02:02:23.930
The edge of the Egyptians were massively involved in the pyramid project.

2137
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.530
Um,
but I think the pyramid project is one of those two phase projects.
And the,

2138
02:02:28.531 --> 02:02:31.340
the view I put forward is that,
uh,

2139
02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:34.730
is that the original site was laid out,
uh,

2140
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.680
around 10,500 BC,
uh,
by the survivors of a lost civilization.

2141
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.290
The subterranean aspects of the great pyramid,

2142
02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:46.880
the specifically the subterranean chamber was created at that time,
uh,

2143
02:02:46.881 --> 02:02:51.740
the gigantic megalithic structures,
uh,
the valley temple,
the mortuary,

2144
02:02:51.870 --> 02:02:55.730
so called mortuary temples that stand beside the pyramids would pretty seem so

2145
02:02:55.731 --> 02:02:58.700
different in terms of their architecture,
which have in some cases,

2146
02:02:58.701 --> 02:03:02.780
blocks of stone weighing 200 tons and many blocks of stone weighing 100 tons,

2147
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:08.120
um,
in,
in,
in them that this was the first phase.
And that,
uh,
and that,

2148
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:12.740
that then I would suggest what happened was that those survivors of a lost

2149
02:03:12.741 --> 02:03:14.690
civilization,
um,

2150
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:18.720
established something like a monastery at Giza.
Uh,

2151
02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:23.780
and then they then started to recruit from the local population so that within a

2152
02:03:23.781 --> 02:03:27.680
generation or two,
uh,
they were all Egyptians anyway,

2153
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:32.600
but they were trained in a system of knowledge and that they kept that system of

2154
02:03:32.601 --> 02:03:36.110
knowledge close and tight and passed it down for thousands of years.

2155
02:03:36.111 --> 02:03:39.350
The idea of knowledge being transmitted for 4,000 years is actually not too

2156
02:03:39.351 --> 02:03:41.660
difficult to take.
It's already happened.
We've had that,

2157
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:44.030
we have that with some of our existing religions,

2158
02:03:44.031 --> 02:03:45.920
which go back close to 40,000 years.

2159
02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.400
There's no reason why it shouldn't have happened.
And then at a certain point,

2160
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:54.430
this monastic institution switched Egyptian civilization on with all the high

2161
02:03:54.921 --> 02:03:56.180
knowledge that they had preserved.

2162
02:03:56.181 --> 02:03:58.190
And that's why it's so perfect at the beginning.

2163
02:03:58.330 --> 02:04:01.630
<v 5>And no one else was able to do that at that time.
Anywhere else in the world.</v>

2164
02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:04.390
Not In the way the Egyptians did.
It was quite unique,

2165
02:04:04.450 --> 02:04:08.290
just as magical series of events and yeah.

2166
02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.540
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean the great pyramid is a magical thing.
Magical.
Yeah.</v>

2167
02:04:12.541 --> 02:04:15.080
I managed to climb climate five times.

2168
02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:19.850
I've been into every known chamber and,
and Passageway in the grid.

2169
02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.610
<v 5>Tell me about the king's chamber because that is the freakiest thing of all.</v>

2170
02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:24.750
And for people who don't know,

2171
02:04:24.751 --> 02:04:28.260
they've proven that some of the stones in the king's chamber from a core,

2172
02:04:28.410 --> 02:04:31.200
how many hundred miles away at close to 700 miles.

2173
02:04:31.201 --> 02:04:35.790
So these are like 500 tons.
These giant stones.

2174
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.950
How were they,
how

2175
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.090
<v 0>much do they weigh?</v>

2176
02:04:39.090 --> 02:04:44.090
The heaviest stones in the pyramid way about 70 times seven,

2177
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.230
seven tons.
Those are what you're talking about.

2178
02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:49.320
The weight of 35 large family cars,

2179
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:53.430
roughly.
If a large family car weighs two tons,

2180
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:56.960
that's 35 of them in the equivalent of the heavier blocks in the

2181
02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:59.830
<v 2>right.
Yeah.
There's between like two tons and like that</v>

2182
02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:04.710
<v 6>s two tons of 70 Johns.
Is that what it is?
You can,
there's trucks be,</v>

2183
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:05.583
yeah,

2184
02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.770
<v 0>yeah.
We can do it.
We can,
we can do it.
But it's hard.
And,</v>

2185
02:05:08.771 --> 02:05:11.290
and to do it again and again and again and again and again.

2186
02:05:11.291 --> 02:05:14.650
And to do it with incredible precision and to align the whole structure that

2187
02:05:14.651 --> 02:05:18.870
you're building within three 60th of a single degree of true north.

2188
02:05:18.970 --> 02:05:22.180
<v 6>That's really to know from that quarry to the Pyramids.</v>

2189
02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:26.320
There wasn't a paved road,
there wasn't a highway,
there wasn't gas stations.

2190
02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:31.990
<v 2>These 50 ton blocks of solid granite.
What are they doing?
They put him on boats.</v>

2191
02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:33.820
I mean,
how are they getting these things?
500

2192
02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:36.070
<v 6>you say 700 miles,
not just shipping them.</v>

2193
02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.970
<v 0>They would definitely shipping them.
Uh,
down the Nile.
That's what they want.</v>

2194
02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:44.130
<v 2>It's hard to even wrap your head around the fact that people were communicating</v>

2195
02:05:44.131 --> 02:05:46.440
from 700 miles away that long ago,

2196
02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:51.840
but they were doing it moving giant stones into place for some crazy asshole

2197
02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:52.860
that wanted a huge,

2198
02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:56.260
<v 6>that's the people working at the quarry.</v>

2199
02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:00.940
This crazy bitch wants a 50 ton rock.
I believe we got to chop this thing up.

2200
02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:06.620
The person who tried to talk him out of it at
glisten,

2201
02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:10.210
listen that I have a hut.
It's made out of wood.
It's awesome.

2202
02:06:10.211 --> 02:06:13.270
You don't need to do this.
The interesting thing is,
you know,

2203
02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:18.350
<v 0>the Egyptians it to devote that kind of architecture edgy today daily lives,</v>

2204
02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:20.480
but to,
to their,
their houses were quite simple.

2205
02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:23.390
They devoted it to their sacred architecture and they,

2206
02:06:23.391 --> 02:06:27.770
they were perfect in everything and everything.
They did.
I come,

2207
02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:32.150
I come out of all of this just with a sense of the mystery,

2208
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:35.950
the majesty and the,
all of our last past and,

2209
02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:39.650
and the fact that we do need to know who we are and where we came from.

2210
02:06:39.651 --> 02:06:42.170
We do need to recover.
Our memories were part of the,

2211
02:06:42.171 --> 02:06:45.410
part of the reason we're so fucked up is because we just have got no idea what

2212
02:06:45.411 --> 02:06:45.910
the fuck

2213
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:47.950
<v 2>we've woken up in the middle of history.
Yeah.</v>

2214
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:50.530
Duncan and I were talking about this before.

2215
02:06:50.531 --> 02:06:53.020
If there was a time machine with what time would you like to go back?

2216
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.420
And we went back and forth from caveman days.

2217
02:06:55.421 --> 02:06:59.140
I'd have to see some caveman to Egypt.
I think I'd like to see Egypt.

2218
02:06:59.141 --> 02:07:02.710
I would love to see Egypt in its prime to see what the fuck was going on there.

2219
02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:03.933
You know how,
what,

2220
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:08.410
what was that like when it was in full bloom and the pyramids had just been

2221
02:07:08.411 --> 02:07:10.680
created and just this,

2222
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:15.490
this strange civilization as super advanced civilization had just,

2223
02:07:15.970 --> 02:07:19.510
just risen far and beyond anything else on the planet.

2224
02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:24.280
Let's build a time machine right now.
And with that note,

2225
02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:28.090
thank you very much sir.
It's been an amazing conversation.
A huge honor.

2226
02:07:28.091 --> 02:07:30.190
And please fall Graeme on Twitter.

2227
02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:35.340
It's a double underscore after Graham g r a h a m double Hancock and you got to

2228
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:39.610
do the double on the score because if you go to single on the store or some

2229
02:07:39.611 --> 02:07:41.890
asshole has your name,
do you know Twitter?

2230
02:07:41.891 --> 02:07:44.470
We'll give you Graham Hancock if someone has that.

2231
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.980
There is another grant Panco cause he had guy.
Yeah.

2232
02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:48.850
Oh you should ask him hook you up.
It is.

2233
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.470
And the website is grabbed Graham hancock.com and I have my youtube channel.

2234
02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:55.680
That's all you have a youtube channel.
And what is that through?

2235
02:07:55.681 --> 02:07:56.970
Is links through the website.
Um,

2236
02:07:57.250 --> 02:08:00.130
