00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.960
I want you to think about
the prefix sums problem.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
Suppose I give you
an array like this one.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.937
The prefix sum at some position like,
say, this one,

00:00:09.937 --> 00:00:14.663
is the sum of all elements from the
beginning of the array to that position.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:16.611
So, in this example,

00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:22.669
the prefix sum at this point is 3
plus 4 minus 2 minus 1, or just 4.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.140
What about the prefix sum at a different
position like, say, this one?

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.170
The prefix sum at this point is 6.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.210
And you could get that, of course,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.160
by taking the prefix sum at this point,
adding 7, subtracting 5.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.900
So just to recap,
the prefix sum at position i is

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.822
simply the sum from
a sub 1 up to a sub i.
