00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.520
I'm excited about this role in part
because Radcliffe feels like home to me

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.420
as a scholar who has devoted her career
to interdisciplinary study, I fully and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.070
enthusiastically embrace Radcliffe's
mission, which is to bring scholars

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.630
together across disciplinary boundaries,
across professional areas. I can remember

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.860
my own experience there: when, I'm a historian, I'm a constitutional scholar,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.960
I'm working on a project though that
requires me, as a matter of my own

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.989
methodology, to essentially tell stories
and one of the most rewarding parts of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.070
the community that I found at Radcliffe
was learning about storytelling from the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.670
perspective of, say, a novelist or a poet
or someone who was directing a play. It's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.040
that kind of cross fertilization that I
think is uniquely available at Radcliffe

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.409
and I'm really excited to not only be a
part of that community but to have the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.440
privilege of leading Radcliffe.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.240
I had the privilege of being among the
first African-American students to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.120
attend desegregated schools in my
district. I was able to observe, to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.250
experience what you might call the
promise and the peril of our nation's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.049
experiment with school desegregation.
Very important, life-changing for me and

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.380
it's that experience of understanding
that there were lawyers, there were

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.330
judges who really stood up for me and so
many other students, and change their

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.590
lives and created pathways of
opportunity where there had been none.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.659
Some of the people that I think about
who inspire me, people like Charles

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.310
Hamilton Houston, one of the great
graduates of Harvard Law School; Thurgood

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.380
Marshall, Constance Baker Motley; these are
people who sacrificed, but also are

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.480
models for how to use one's intellect
in the service of others.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.760
Law is foundational to every other
discipline in some way, to our public

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.430
policy, to the way that we live, and
that's true of law in schools or law in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.380
relation to the healthcare system or the
criminal justice system. I have been for

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.930
a very long time interested in the
relationship between law and society, and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.660
matters of equality and opportunity and
I do hope that that perspective as well

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.670
will inform Radcliffe in any number of
ways, from the scholars that we bring on

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.770
to campus, to the conversations that we
have, to our commitments to the broader

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.640
community. In every challenging time,
there's great opportunity and I think

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.460
that Radcliffe has a great opportunity
in this moment to continue its role as a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.930
convener, bringing people together to
talk about issues of the day whether

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.350
it's leadership, climate change, or social
change, the social determinants of health,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.810
citizenship, there are any number of
matters that I think Radcliffe can do a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.310
great job of bringing people together
and really trying to build some

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.340
consensus.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.800
I am driven by the example of
my own parents who grew up in the deep

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.700
south under Jim Crow and who imparted to
me the values of hard work, the pursuit

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.430
of education, but at the same time it
wasn't enough for them if I, their own

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.490
daughter, achieved a measure of success.
They taught me to give back, to serve, and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.870
that value of serving the community is
very much a part of who I am

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.460
and it speaks to why I'm interested in and 
excited about the role as the new

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.400
leader of Radcliffe.
