[MUSIC]

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:07.215
RETO MEIER: Good afternoon
everyone.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:12.180
And welcome to this week's
episode of "The App Clinic."

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.030
This week we are looking
at sleep monitoring

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.180
and recording apps.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.380
My regular colleague, Andy
Lewis, has been hard at work

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.840
testing these out.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.850
And unfortunately, that means
he's currently sleeping.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.580
So we're going to hopefully get
some of his input on some

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.290
of these apps a little later in
the program if he's able to

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.630
arouse himself from sleep and
give us some of his insight.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.070
Now, that's just how important
we take our jobs here at "The

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.770
App Clinic." We're willing to
sleep during the day on a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.960
Friday just so that we can
give these apps the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.160
appropriate attention
that they deserve.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.870
So we're going to look
at three apps today.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.450
They are Sleep as
Android, Circle

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.700
Alarm, and Sleep Recorder.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.540
And they all basically are
designed to do the same thing.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.770
So they're designed to help you
get a good night's sleep.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.025
Now, certainly, the first and
last of these two which we're

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.440
going to look at are designed
specifically as sort of your

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.790
own private sleep study.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.720
You get the device.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.680
You put it on your bed.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.900
And it measures vibrations using
the sensors to see how

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.390
good a night's sleep you're
getting-- whether you're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880
twisting and turning, moving
around, or whether you're just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.990
lying there in a
comatose bliss.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.070
The middle app--

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.490
Circle Alarm-- is a little
bit different.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.500
It's actually an alarm
clock, essentially.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.110
Which we looked at these
little while back.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.870
It was still the third highest
rated app in the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.790
category this week.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.710
So we are going to
take a look.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.750
But it is a little bit different
from the other two.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.440
We're going to spend a little
bit more time on those apps.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.840
So--

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.900
getting started--

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.160
what do we really want from
these sorts of apps?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.980
Well, what it really comes down
to is we're looking for

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.685
something which is really
easy to use.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.770
It's always fun to have
moving things.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.160
Now, it's says Device Profile
Wishlist at the top.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.530
It's not.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.110
It's actually the sleep
monitoring wishlist.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.270
That's my lack of preparation
getting in the way there.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.470
But really, what I want is
something which I can start up

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.940
and it doesn't take
a lot of effort.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.790
Now, I think you can get a lot
of the requirements for an app

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.440
like this, which is basically
a tracking app.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.725
In this instance, it's
tracking your sleep.

00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:29.100
But a lot of the same learnings
and sort of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.340
optimizations are going to be
very similar to what we looked

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.330
at a few weeks ago when we
were looking at fitness

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.545
tracking apps.

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:37.030
So like those apps-- like
Endomondo, RunKeeper, or

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.000
runtastic--

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.380
you want something that's
relatively easy to get going

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.830
which doesn't take a lot of
attention but then has rich

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.010
analytics once you've used it.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.840
So that you're able to sort of
get started, record things

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.550
really easily, and then spend
your time analyzing the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.240
results at your leisure.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.840
So the first app that we're
going to take a look at today

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.240
is Sleep as Android.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.975
And you can see here they've
got a feature graphic.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.170
They have a feature graphic
here, which is

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.530
along the right lines.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.560
It's a little noisy.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.950
And what they've done here
is they've done sort

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.070
of a classic mistake.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.320
And they've used the feature
graphic as a place to put all

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.950
of their screenshots.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.990
Now, there is a place
for screenshots

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.920
on the landing page.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.710
So you don't need to put them
into your feature graphic.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.360
Now, the big reason for not
doing that is that when this

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.640
gets shrunk down into a tiny
size on a phone for one of our

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.140
smaller feature slots,
it's going to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.520
become basically a mess.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.900
You're not going to be able
to see these screenshots.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.830
You're not going to be able to
make out any of this detail.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.180
So it becomes messy and not
something which we're likely

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.340
to feature.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.780
And similarly, if you're just
sort of browsing here, all of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.770
the information that you've
got there on the feature

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.360
graphic-- the name,
the screenshots--

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.240
are all available elsewhere.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.550
So I think you almost want to
focus just on what they've got

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.890
here and maybe try and
make that more

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.830
of the feature graphic.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.070
You really want to give people
a vibe-- a feel for the app--

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.620
rather than trying to cram all
of your advertising material

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.310
all in one place.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.150
Similarly, they've done
a reasonably good job

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.390
with their icon here.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.486
It's distinctive.

00:04:10.486 --> 00:04:11.940
It has a distinctive
silhouette.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.140
It's, again, perhaps not
quite stylized enough.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.649
It does tend to lose some of
its impact when you get the

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.610
smaller icon.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.730
But it's definitely along
the right lines--

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.380
so definitely good work and
maybe a little bit more work

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.920
to be done here.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.810
So moving on, once you get the
app going-- and I'm going to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.290
do that on my phone as well--

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.230
but you can see here straight
away that they've got sort of

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.130
the right idea.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.880
It's got a modern-looking UI.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.450
It's kind of hollowish.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.580
It's not quite hollow.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.450
It's not quite an action bar.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.770
And that's one of the things
which I really want to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.480
highlight for these guys-- is
you can see in particular on

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.340
the pseudo action bar that
they've got along the bottom,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.000
the alignment isn't
quite right.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.080
So they've got the overflow
icon that looks right.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.650
But it's not quite in
the right place.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.740
And so you really want to think
about if you're going to

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.530
use some of the common UI
paradigms within the platform,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.350
it's really important to use
them in a way that's

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.740
consistent with other apps using
the same controls-- the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.780
same paradigms.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.550
Where it really gets confusing
is if it's something that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.210
looks kind of like something
that you're expecting but

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.320
doesn't quite work
in the same way.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.560
It produces slightly different
results or is laid out

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.640
slightly differently.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.970
That just causes confusion.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.240
So you're almost better off
doing something completely

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.820
unique if you want to do any
sort of significant variance

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.010
on one of the existing
UI pieces.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.870
Similarly, we've got the little
icon on the bottom

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.070
right, which is kind of cute.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.150
But it actually just adds
visual clutter.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.760
And you can actually see it says
"Home" there, which is

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.170
actually, I think, a description
of where you are

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.920
within the app.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.490
Either way, it's kind
of confusing.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.460
Because is it clickable?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.950
Is it not?

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.370
Is it a navigation prompt?

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.770
Or is it just decoration?

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.620
You really want to try and keep
your screen as clean and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.540
clear as possible.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.320
Now, I'm not going to go into
too much detail on the UI

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.300
because that's kind of Android
design and actions territory.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.150
And I don't want to step
on their toes too much.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.760
But if we switch to
the giant phone--

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.130
if we're really lucky, the giant
phone will be working--

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.950
excellent--

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.110
so you can see, they've
got this

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.910
distinctive UI on the screen.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.980
It's got this bright green--
almost sort of similar sort of

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.460
coloring to HTC Sense's UI from
at least a couple years

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.310
ago when I last looked at it.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.200
You've got sort of the
pseudo action bar

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.510
here along the bottom.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.980
And they've sort of put the time
in that as well, which

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.740
make sense.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.680
But it's also kind of redundant
because I have the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.550
time on the top of my phone
up here as well.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.750
So it's kind of like
I'd rather see the

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.030
overflow menu here--

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.440
down along the bottom here where
it should be-- where it

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.080
kind of belongs on Android.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.280
Otherwise, it just makes
it a bit confusing.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.450
Otherwise, what we've got
here along the bottom is

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.940
effectively your tab.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.245
So each of these--

00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:57.260
and again, this is a little bit
confusing because we've

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.150
combined the concepts of an
action with the concepts of

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.830
navigation.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.920
So things like hitting the moon
button effectively puts

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.250
you to sleep.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.660
So that's an action--
fair enough.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.480
But hitting the bar brings up
the activity for being able to

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.170
monitor your previous sleeps.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.130
And so it's gets a little
bit confusing.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.200
Because what's an action?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.905
What's a navigation?

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.930
It should be a little easier,
particularly for users.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.060
You want to make sure users know
what to expect whenever

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.430
they're pressing something
on your UI--

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.550
so making that a little
more predictable--

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.570
perhaps using something
similar to Android.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.490
And in particular in this
layout, they've used something

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.780
that looks like in action bar,
but it almost feels like

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.920
they're trying to cheat.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.430
So one of the big pieces of
feedback we often have is that

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.930
you're not supposed to have
tabs along the bottom.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.040
And I'm sure the explanation
here is,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.050
well, they're not tabs--

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.260
right?

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.010
It's an action bar.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.080
You're allowed to have an action
bar along the bottom.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.540
And it's true.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.460
You are.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.440
But only as sort of the second
half of a split action bar.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.550
And we don't have anything
along the top here.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.300
So I'd much rather like to see
this flipped around so that

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.310
the action bar sits
on the top.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.720
You've got navigation
on the left.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.920
You've got actions on the right.
and it's a lot clearer

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.130
as to exactly how it all
is supposed to work.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.130
So here, again, we go through.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.720
You hit plus.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.250
It lets you set an alarm as to
when you want to wake up.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.500
Or you can just have a
nap, which is nice.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.430
So I'm not going to go into too
much detail on the UI in

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.320
the interest of time.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.010
But kind of the key is here when
you press the Go button.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.659
And it's going to start
recording my sleep.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.700
And it's going to use a variety
of senses in order to

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.049
do that and give me an
indication of how good a

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:44.000
night's sleep I have,
which is nice.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.440
That's basically the
whole purpose.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.310
But what I think is kind of,
again, confusing here is that

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.800
we have an overflow icon, which
I'm covering slightly.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.420
So you've got this overflow
icon and sort of

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.410
unpredictable behavior.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.090
So if I click this, it's going
to bring up sort of this

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:06.000
contextual menu bar, which is
not really what I'm expecting.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.690
It's kind of a dialogue where
I'm expecting a pop-up

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.940
overflow menu.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.840
The things which we've
got here to set

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.570
are all fair enough.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.920
It's just, again, the
way that it behaved.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.720
And if we leave this screen long
enough, it'll all turn

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.160
off and go dark, which
again is nice.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.910
So you can see here--
dimming screen--

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.340
touch-- or back to return.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.000
And so this is good because
it means that the

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.900
phone can stay on.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.100
And if it wants to use senses,
it's going to have to stay

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.250
active while I'm asleep.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.470
So it's really important
here that it does

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.880
this, which is nice.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.760
We hit Back and it automatically
records

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.150
everything, which is good.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.265
So otherwise, it works well.

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:45.760
It does what it's
intended to do.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.170
But I think really the key for
this app is all about tweaking

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.740
the UI-- making the navigation
and the actions a little bit

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.890
easier-- a little bit
more obvious.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.700
Otherwise, great information
around statistics--

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.820
well displayed, as well.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.610
I really like the use of graphs
and tables to try and

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.885
make this information as easily
consumed as possible.

00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:06.030
Now, I didn't get a chance to
check to see if they have a

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.070
tablet app.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.000
I'm hoping that they do.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.660
Because again, this is a great
example where you're going to

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.420
use the phone to do the
actual recording.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.110
But it'd be great to be able to
sit down on your couch-- at

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.030
your table--

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.050
with the tablet app and really
dig deep into the statistics

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.600
and the analysis on
a bigger screen.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.530
So, hopefully, the developer's
watching.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.990
And they can let us know.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.515
Or possibly some of the other
viewers can let us

00:10:29.515 --> 00:10:32.090
know just as easily.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.640
Let's move on.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.760
Let's have a look
at Circle Alarm.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.630
So, Circle Alarm is kind
of a simpler concept.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.890
This is basically just an alarm
clock which is going to

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.830
let you set alarms in as an
intuitive and simple and fast

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.460
method as possible.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.960
And it's actually surprising--
or unsurprisingly enough--

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.870
quite similar to the redesign
of the Android Clock in the

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.420
latest Jelly Bean release.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.400
Now, we can see here that
they've done a great job with

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400
their feature graphic--

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.020
big--

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.890
bold--

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.840
gives you a stylized indication
of what the app is.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.180
Their feature graphic mirrors
what they've got here for

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.610
their icon, which again, is
beautiful, distinctive

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.430
silhouette.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.910
So straight away, the app looks
really nice when you

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.740
land on it on Google Play--

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.470
gives you that professional
feeling.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.290
So they've done a really
good job there.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.380
If we actually move on to the
app itself, you can see that

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.800
they've maintained that sort
of professional field

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.290
throughout.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.240
They've got the hollow
styling.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.800
Everything works the
way it should do.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.940
And in fact, if we go
to the giant phone--

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.860
I'll pop it up-- you can see
that, again, it's this sort of

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.722
minimalist simplistic approach
to UI design.

00:11:41.722 --> 00:11:43.150
We've got an action here.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:48.190
If we hit plus, it adds a new
alarm, which then if we click

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.300
into it, you kind of get to the
key-- the magic part of

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.860
the app-- which is being able
to set an alarm just by

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.350
dragging these circles around.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.090
Which these days, now that the
Google built-in clock works

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.970
along the same lines with
these sorts of circular

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.140
affordances to be able to set
time, it's something that's

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.540
quite familiar and
quite intuitive.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.920
So I think they've done a
pretty good job here.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.600
Again, I'm not going to go into
too much depth because

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.620
it's a fairly straightforward
app in terms of what it's

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.260
trying to do.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.420
It doesn't have quite the same
depth as the other apps that

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.030
we're looking at.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.380
But they've executed in
a really nice way.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.710
They've put all of the
information front and center.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.530
As soon as you sort of touch
anything, you get immediate

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.990
feedback as to what
it's doing.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.340
When the alarm is set--

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.170
how often--

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.820
what ringtone you want to use
is all put in one place,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.520
making it a really simple,
easy-to-get-started app.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.570
And I think that's something
which the other two apps which

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.900
we're looking at today
can sort of take

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.740
something away from.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.100
They have a much more
complicated set of

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.330
functionality.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.360
But that doesn't mean that the
use has to be equally as

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.940
complicated.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.220
In fact, the best apps offer a
lot of functionality but don't

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.830
make you feel like you have
to learn it first.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.610
And that's one of the big pieces
of feedback we saw from

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.370
the community as well
as our own review

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.730
of Tasker last week--

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.190
fantastic app--

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.110
passionate users who
really, really love

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.240
what's going on there.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.620
But the learning curve of trying
to figure out how to

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.500
use it is putting people off.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.100
And I think that really
resonated with a lot of people

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.750
who watched the show last week
in Android Design and Action,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.440
which looked at one
of the redesigns.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.750
Really resonated-- this idea of
trying to make it simpler--

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.270
trying to make it easier.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.270
And I think that's what
a lot of people want--

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.720
is these apps that they love to
use-- the services, which

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.780
they find hugely useful--

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.720
but they want to have it be easy
to use-- to be sort of

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.870
more of a magical experience
where you're not learning a

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.500
piece of software.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.090
You're just taking advantage
of a service.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.530
So I'm rushing through today's
show because I want to try to

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.430
keep it a little more succinct
than perhaps we sometimes do.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.920
So let's have a look
at the next app.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.445
So this Sleep Recorder.

00:13:56.165 --> 00:13:58.670
And you can see here, no feature
graphic, which is a

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.940
real shame.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.100
Without a feature graphic,
you can't be featured.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.870
You don't have a chance of
being in the pure Android

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.980
collection, either.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.120
And really, the biggest thing
here is that you're going to

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.040
be limiting your downloads.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.380
So the lack of a feature graphic
on a landing page

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.860
actually has a significant
impact on the number of people

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.690
who are likely to download it.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.100
And it's not only that,
but the quality

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.390
of the feature graphic.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:24.500
So if getting lots of downloads
is something that's

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.670
important to you, it's important
to have that feature

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.760
graphic and for it to be good.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.170
Now, this is an app
which spends a

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.120
lot of time on design.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.530
They've used a skeuomorphic
design, which

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.650
you'll see in a moment.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.440
So, clearly, look and feel is
something that's important.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.280
So it's really an opportunity
here to take that same

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.150
attention to detail which you
have within your app and put

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.240
it here front and center,
which is basically your

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.180
advertising to the world--
your first point of

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.560
impression.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.220
You know, we always
say that first

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.420
impressions are really important.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.380
And that's exactly what you're
talking about on a landing

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.840
page in Google Play-- is
trying to make a first

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.830
impression which is going
to make people

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.250
want to use your app.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.610
In terms of the icon,
you can see it's OK.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.150
It's kind of the rounded, square
image, which we're

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.770
trying to move away from.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.000
So, again, this may be an
opportunity to think about how

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.700
to make this into something
which is a little more

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.890
distinctive--

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.840
more of a silhouette rather than
sort of an image painted

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.490
on a rounded, square canvas.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.310
If we look at the app itself,
you can see that they've gone

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.970
for a very skeuomorphic
design.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.010
It looks a lot like a tape
recorder, basically, with sort

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.760
of a record, playback, and fast
forward affordances in

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.290
the middle.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:41.120
You've got this analog
indication of your sleep

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.980
patterns, effectively.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.400
So it looks kind of like an
EKG mixed with a tape

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.430
recorder-- sort of a lie
detector vibe, almost.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.880
I guess that's what it puts
me in the mind of

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.800
when I look at it.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.510
It kind of looks like a lie
detector for my sleep.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.400
So you definitely feel
judged, which isn't

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.170
necessarily a bad thing.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.100
So it is a recorder.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.530
It looks like a recorder.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.230
So it's definitely on the
right track there.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.850
They have taken a skeuomorphic
design approach, which is

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.320
quite in contrast to the first
app that we looked at, which

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.590
was much more of a clean
hollow-based theme.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.010
And, you know, really,
I'm not making a

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.990
judgment call on this.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.940
I think that both are
valid options.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.370
Really what I'm trying to judge
here is whether or not

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.600
their design choices are making
it easier for me as a

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.400
user to get started
and use that app.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.970
And to be honest, with this app,
I struggled a little bit.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.616
So if I switch to the
giant phone--

00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:36.450
here we go.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.760
Whoa, Sleep Recorder
has stopped.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.350
So that's not a good sign.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.560
I'm not going to record
it right now.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.680
But I will hopefully be
able to go back and

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.810
record that for you.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.790
So, again, Rate Us-- select
Sleep Recorder--

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.910
soliciting five star reviews
and ratings--

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.050
not great--

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.870
kind of obnoxious.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.490
I understand that you
want people to rate

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.250
and review your app.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.590
And there are certainly ways
to do that, But this is the

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.910
second or third time that
I've launched the app.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.350
It feels like this is maybe
not the right time,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.230
particularly because when I'm
going to be launching this the

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.770
first few times, it's likely to
be when I'm getting ready

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.380
for bed in order to
record my sleep.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.140
I don't want to be interrupted
with anything which isn't sort

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.154
of key to that.

00:17:14.154 --> 00:17:15.810
And so this is perhaps something
which you would

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.869
display later while you're sort
of viewing the analysis

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.980
rather than at the point in time
where you really don't

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.020
have any time to spare.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.400
So I'm going to say No Thanks.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.960
And you can see, everything's
moving around.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.730
So we've got this beautiful
skeuomorphic design.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.490
And we've got needles
bouncing around.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:36.220
We've got rotary dials
which I can turn.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.070
And what I like about it
is that it's simple.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.100
There's no overflow button.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.120
There's a very limited number
of things you can do.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.210
And everything that I press
has an immediate reaction.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.720
Now, where I'm a little bit less
thrilled is that it's not

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.720
obvious what any of the things
that I'm touching do.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.580
So I can turn this.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.500
And it's going to change
my Delay from 1 to 30.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.680
But I don't know what
that Delay is for or

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.700
what the units are.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.380
So I'm a little bit at a loss.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.260
Like, I can change it.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.930
But I don't know what it does.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.660
And again, I can dial
this around.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.740
And it changes the color
on the dial.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.980
But I really don't know
what I'm doing.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.980
So it's kind of a cool effect.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.370
But in terms of feedback,
it's underplayed.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.630
It's a little too simplistic.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.530
It's perhaps relying on me
understanding what the analog

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.200
equivalence of this design are
in order to be able to

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:27.820
understand it.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.790
So here I would try and make it
a little bit more obvious

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.930
to users who are going to open
it for the first time to

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.660
understand what are these
things doing-- how am I

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.530
supposed to use them?

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.000
So one thing which I
am familiar with

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.080
is the Record button.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.250
So I hit Record because
that's what you do.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:47.420
In fact, if I was going to take
my tape recorder analogy

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.520
to its maximum, I'd hit Record
and Play at the same time.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.910
But in any case, I hit Record.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.310
And it pops up with a modal
dialog-- of all things--

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.210
telling me that I'm
holding it wrong.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.320
If I want to start, I
don't press Record.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.350
I press the button in
the middle, which is

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.250
a little bit confusing.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.310
Because, well, clearly
this is a tip.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.350
Why not make it so that the
Record button is the way that

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.000
you start it?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.020
And I'm sure that there
is a reason for it.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.820
And in fact, what I have
determined is that I think

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.450
basically these buttons
along the bottom

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.620
are navigation tabs.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.640
So hitting Record is how I
go into recording mode.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.130
And hitting Play is how I go
into the Playback tab.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.830
So it's basically tabs as
indicated by the depression of

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.690
the buttons.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.690
So I go from Playback
to Record.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.340
And then clearly, I'm
already in Record.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.600
So if I hit Record again, that's
why I get the dialogue.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.100
So the fact that there is a
dialogue tells me that enough

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.510
users are doing this that
perhaps this particular

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.330
paradigm isn't working
for you.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.240
And that's, I think, one of the
risks when you're using

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.690
something skeuomorphic--

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.050
is that you really want
to be careful.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.140
Because the Record button
means start recording.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.090
That's how it works on the
analog device which you are

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.680
creating a design around.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.380
So as soon as you create a
design that looks the same as

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.300
a real-world object but actually
the behavior is

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.640
different, then it gets
really confusing.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.795
So that's something
you want to avoid.

00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:13.270
And in this instance, I think
fundamentally hitting Record

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.300
should start the recording.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.210
So maybe rework the way those
tabs have been implemented to

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.440
make it a little bit more
obvious, particularly because

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.600
the analogy between fast
forward and favorites--

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.860
I like the alliteration--

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.030
that's cool--

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.900
but it's not necessarily
obvious.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.280
So it's a design which really
means that you have to click

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.050
everything on the screen before
you know what anything

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.780
on the screen does.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.720
And so that's just increasing
that learning curve.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.640
It means that before I can
decide whether or not I want

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.370
to use this particular app--

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.910
of which there are several
other apps

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.200
which do the same thing--

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.570
I need to learn the
whole thing first.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.690
So something which works much
more like the fitness tracking

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.350
apps that we looked at a couple
of weeks ago-- like

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.000
Endomondo--

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.840
you start it up--

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.980
big button-- big Play
button right in the

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.720
middle of the screen.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.340
I hit that.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.700
And it starts recording.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.280
I don't have to have learned
anything else.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.490
I don't need to record
anything.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.460
It's just going to start
doing exactly what I

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.340
expect it to do.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.240
And then I can figure out how
the rest of it works further

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:10.830
down the track.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.150
And so that's kind of the
approach that you want to take

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.870
for anything like this,
particularly these sleep apps

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.640
which are going to, like I said,
they're going to be used

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.480
when you're ready for bed.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.280
You don't want to have to spend
a lot of time learning

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.140
how the app works right before
you use something like this to

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.060
monitor your sleep.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:31.290
So if we go back to the
recording tab, and hit Record,

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.950
again, another modal dialog.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.250
Modal dialogs are possibly going
to be one of the next

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.040
topics I look at
on Table Flip.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.800
They drive me crazy.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.280
Modal dialogs really don't
belong in any operating system

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.010
since somewhere in the
mid to early 90s.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.800
If you want to display
information to users, there's

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.300
a bunch of ways that
you can do that.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.480
And there's really very, very
few options-- so, very few

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.230
times-- when you need to pop
up something which blocks

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.880
their progress in the app.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.260
It's really something which
should only be done by system

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.230
dialogs, essentially, to say,
hey, you can no longer

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.200
interact with anything else.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.810
Because of this reason, I'm
going to display this alert.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.620
So for this--

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.320
providing a tip-- it's a good
tip-- you definitely need to

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.000
make sure that your device is
connected to power before you

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.470
use it, but there's probably
better ways to present that

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.290
information than
a modal dialog.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.640
So I hit OK, eventually.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.580
And so now I can see that the
Delay was a countdown time in

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.590
seconds before it started
recording.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.570
So I guess the idea there
is you hit Record.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.410
And then you can put it next
to your bed or expect that

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.310
you're going to read for another
20 minutes or whatever

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.870
else, well, maybe you just know
that you fidget for the

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.070
first 15 minutes of sleep.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.160
And you really don't
want to record

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.210
anything until after that.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.900
So that's what that toggle is.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.730
Now, what's not 100% clear now
is whether or not it's

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.920
actually started recording.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.600
Now, from my experiments
earlier on, it wasn't.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.750
I thought that at this point,
the countdown had finished.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.310
It was recording.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.910
But then there was nothing
in my history.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.290
So I think--

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.638
no, I think it was recording.

00:23:05.638 --> 00:23:08.420
But, see-- now the countdown
is like a minute.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.250
So, again, the theme around this
app is basically this--

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.340
is that it's hard for
me to understand

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.840
what it's doing quickly.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.690
And most users aren't going to
take the time to sit down and

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.450
really learn your app front
to back before they decide

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.930
whether or not they
want to use it.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.265
They're going to have downloaded
this plus three or

00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:26.620
four of your competitors.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.400
And they're going to run through
them really quickly to

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.500
see which one looks the nicest
and provides the functionality

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.360
that they want.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.950
So you really want to try and
reduce that learning curve as

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.400
much as you can.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.100
So--

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.020
oh, it's saying again if
I want to switch tabs--

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.760
and it's telling me that I have
to stop the recording

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.120
before I can listen to other
recordings, which makes me

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.940
think that what this is actually
recording while I'm

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.080
sleeping is not movements so
much as actually the noise

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.010
while I'm in bed, which is
an interesting take.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.670
So I guess we've got apps
which look at things a

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.880
different way-- one which is
using sensors to determine

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.940
your sleep and the other
which is using audio.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.230
Or perhaps they're
both using audio.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.290
I should probably have checked
that more closely.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.630
And really, it doesn't
matter--

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.570
either way. whether you're
recording sort of movement or

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.990
whether you're recording
audio, it's the same

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.850
principles applied to
all of the apps.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.230
It's just which sensor hardware
you happen to be

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.630
using in order to
record things.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.070
And I think a great app would
actually use all of the

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.010
senses-- everything that you've
got on the device-- to

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.070
sense everything that
is changing

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.650
while you are sleeping.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.200
So I think I can stop
the recording.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.920
I can go back here.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.000
And again, this is kind
of confusing.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.610
Because there is no recording
even though I thought that I

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.930
had been recording.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.050
And again, there's a couple
of UI tweaks here.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:48.600
We've kind of got this iPhoney
style buttons navigation at

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.870
the top, which is, again,
a little bit

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:51.780
counter to what we expect.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.520
And particularly here, it's a
little disconcerting because

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.000
you've got this pure
skeuomorphic design on the

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.370
bottom and then sort of an
iPhone design at the top.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.160
Again, it's just a confusing
thing for users.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.310
So I think as useful as the app
is, the biggest thing--

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.960
the best thing-- that they can
do here is kind of think about

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.870
how that onboarding--

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.930
that onramping is for users.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.870
How are you going to get them
to really understand how to

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.820
use the app and see how
beautiful and simple it is

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.880
without having to spend a lot
of time learning the things

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.800
which are hidden?

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.550
So one of the things that you're
going to need to learn

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.360
if you want to build
an app like this--

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.955
certainly, the first app
is around sensors.

00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:34.820
So, motion sensors is something
which we have a

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.860
developer guide for on
developer.android.com.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.720
You're also going to want to
look at how to use the

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.460
microphone for apps like the
last app that we looked at to

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.000
be able to take in that
input and then do

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.500
the analysis on that.

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.560
So all of that information
is available on

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.160
developer.android.com.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.250
For sensors--

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.330
in fact, for all sensors--

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:59.110
both mics and motion
and lights and

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.200
all kinds of things--

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.270
I think all of which would be
really useful to create a

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.560
great app like this.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.120
[? Anchor ?]

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.230
Tim and Tony did a great
presentation on the

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.000
Sense-itive side of Android
at Google I/O last year.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.670
So you should definitely
check that out.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.190
And they've done some really
clever things with all the

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.770
different sensors to be able
to create really inventive

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.960
ways to monitor things--

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.530
things like--

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.190
I think Tony actually put
together a heart rate monitor

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.540
based on audio input.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.750
So it's kind of crazy.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.170
But these are the sorts of
things that you can use.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.680
And I would really love to see
apps like these taking that to

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.300
the next step so that you're
recording everything--

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.320
turning all of the sensors on
for something like sleep

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.790
analysis to determine
am I moving?

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.950
Are there noises?

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.200
Are there light changes?

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.900
All of these things
are able to be

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.480
determined with your phone.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.160
In fact, you can even record
changes in barometric pressure

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.530
on some of the newer devices.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.530
So then you can create a really
rich idea of exactly

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.460
what is happening to your
environment while you're

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.820
sleeping and create a really
rich analysis for sort of your

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:07.250
at-home sleep recording
purposes.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.480
So before we sign off, let's
have a quick look at our

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.320
prescriptions for each
of the apps.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.830
And you'll see that there's a
lot of similarities in what

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.310
I'm asking for here.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.180
So for the first app-- for
Sleep as Android--

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.410
think about a more standard
action bar, simpler

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.270
navigation, standardized
settings.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.850
And just make the whole
thing easy to

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.140
understand and get started.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.720
For Sleep Recorder, I think,
again, you kind of need a

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.320
little bit of a UI overhaul.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.840
It doesn't need to be completely
redesigned.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.030
I'm not saying that you
shouldn't be using a

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.050
skeuomorphic design.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.990
I think that adds a
certain simplicity

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.310
that works quite well.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.260
But I found it really hard to
understand how to get going.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.300
And I think that's something
that could really benefit and

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.280
help increase your user
engagement, particularly

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.380
things around the
modal dialogs.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.510
As soon as you find that you
need to tell your users that

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.980
they're doing something wrong,
that's usually a pretty clear

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.150
indication that perhaps you
haven't created it in a way

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.840
that they find intuitive.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.550
And overall, just make the
whole thing easier to

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.670
understand.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.080
In terms of the Circle Alarm,
I haven't given any specific

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.640
advice there.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.800
I think you've done a
really great job.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.260
It looks really nice-- provides
simple functionality

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.600
that works really well.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.180
So, nice work on that.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.350
So that is all for today--

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.210
the quick solo version of "The
App Clinic." Don't forget to

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.110
tune into Roman, Nick, and Adam
for Android Design in

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.760
Action on Tuesday.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.290
Hopefully they'll be setting
their design skills loose on

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.730
some of the apps that we looked
at today after a really

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.680
popular session last week where
they looked at redesign

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.300
for Tasker.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.940
Couple of announcements for the
Android developer Team.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.030
We have embraced the new
communities on Google+.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.030
So there is an Android
development and an Android

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.030
design community both available
from the Android

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.630
Developers + page on Google+.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.620
These communities are
really for you guys.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.260
We've created them as a place
that's kind of supposedly

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.520
semi-official.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.630
You can create your own
communities and be part of

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.190
that, which is awesome.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.280
In this community, we're going
to do some light moderation

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.130
just to try and keep the spam
down-- try and make sure that

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.350
it's a friendly environment for
everyone to be a part of.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.030
But it's really your
community.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.500
And it is whatever you
guys make of it.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.110
So, participate.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.610
Take part.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.900
Let us know how you would
like to see it shaped.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.940
And we'll see what we
can do to help move

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.780
things in that direction.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.840
We also have a developer survey
currently ongoing at

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.740
bit.ly/androiddevsurvey.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.470
So if you're an Android
Developer, designer, product

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.670
manager, distribution
engineer--

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:38.830
basically, if you have any
impact at all-- if you're in

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.845
any way associated with building
Android apps-- we

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.210
would love to hear from you--

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.540
get some of your feedback
on the things

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.590
that we've been doing--

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.520
some of the assumptions that we
have-- so that we can help

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.960
build better tools-- better
products-- for you guys to

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.200
have a successful Android
experience.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.290
Now, next week there will
be no app Clinic.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.520
We are all going off
to an offsite in

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.270
Carmel late on Friday.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.300
So we are going to be preparing
for that rather than

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.770
preparing for the show.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.080
We will be back with, I think,
at least one more episode

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.000
before Christmas for those of
you who haven't disappeared on

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.080
your own Christmas vacations.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.850
And we're not 100% sure what
we're going to do.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.890
So hit up the Trello board.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.965
And basically vote for
the apps that you'd

00:30:16.965 --> 00:30:17.720
like us to look at.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.980
I think the two top trending
categories right now are, I

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.250
think, book readers and what
was the other one?

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.310
Dan?

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.960
I can't remember.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.525
DAN: I think it was remote
control apps.

00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:31.400
RETO MEIER: Remote control
apps-- that's right.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.320
So book readers and remote
control-- they're the two top

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.470
categories at the moment.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.230
We're going to go with whichever
one has sort of the

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.280
most votes for the top apps
in this category.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.670
So if you have a strong opinion,
do you jump in there.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.090
And if you have an app
in that category,

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.470
definitely go to Trello.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.460
Self-nominate your app.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.740
We love to do self-nominations
and then work with the

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.370
developers who we talk to on
the App Clinic to help you

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.560
guys build your app and
make it even better.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.200
And the top ones we're going
to put into our own pure

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.030
Android collection.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.480
Now, we have three nominees
for apps to

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.830
appear in pure Android.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.840
We're going through the details
now-- making sure that

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.700
we're happy with them and hoping
to launch that, again,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.560
before Christmas.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.450
So we'll hopefully have
more information about

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.320
that for you soon.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.090
So, until then, enjoy the
lead-up to the holiday period.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.430
Happy building more apps.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.910
And thank you very much
for watching.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.870
I'm Reto Meier.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.540
And this has been "The
App Clinic."
