00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009
 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.040
yeah well first thing they say is that

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050
yeah well first thing they say is that
 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.330
yeah well first thing they say is that
when people said talk about string

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340
when people said talk about string
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.230
when people said talk about string
theory they're actually talking about a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240
theory they're actually talking about a
 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.589
theory they're actually talking about a
very complex set of ideas that lots of

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599
very complex set of ideas that lots of
 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.880
very complex set of ideas that lots of
people you know very large my people

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890
people you know very large my people
 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.140
people you know very large my people
have worked on and done a lot of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150
have worked on and done a lot of
 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.279
have worked on and done a lot of
different things with the the probably

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289
different things with the the probably
 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.569
different things with the the probably
what it's best known for and what got

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579
what it's best known for and what got
 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.710
what it's best known for and what got
people all excited about it in the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720
people all excited about it in the
 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.509
people all excited about it in the
physics community is there's kind of a

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519
physics community is there's kind of a
 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.759
physics community is there's kind of a
conjecture that instead of at the most

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769
conjecture that instead of at the most
 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.560
conjecture that instead of at the most
fundamental level you can understand

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570
fundamental level you can understand
 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.560
fundamental level you can understand
matter and the universe in in terms not

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570
matter and the universe in in terms not
 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.770
matter and the universe in in terms not
of point particles which is the way our

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780
of point particles which is the way our
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.270
of point particles which is the way our
best theory is currently you kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280
best theory is currently you kind of
 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.490
best theory is currently you kind of
understand things but in terms of kind

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500
understand things but in terms of kind
 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.310
understand things but in terms of kind
of vibrate if you like vibrating have

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320
of vibrate if you like vibrating have
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.010
of vibrate if you like vibrating have
loops of some elementary objects your

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020
loops of some elementary objects your
 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.450
loops of some elementary objects your
elementary object instead of being a

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460
elementary object instead of being a
 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.010
elementary object instead of being a
point like thing is something you should

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020
point like thing is something you should
 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.810
point like thing is something you should
think of more as being a one-dimensional

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820
think of more as being a one-dimensional
 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.420
think of more as being a one-dimensional
loop or kind of string which is kind of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430
loop or kind of string which is kind of
 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.170
loop or kind of string which is kind of
moving around so it has a lot more it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180
moving around so it has a lot more it
 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.880
moving around so it has a lot more it
can do a lot more complicated things

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890
can do a lot more complicated things
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.700
can do a lot more complicated things
than a point is this kind of loop of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710
than a point is this kind of loop of
 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.710
than a point is this kind of loop of
elementary matter or whatever it is and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720
elementary matter or whatever it is and
 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.940
elementary matter or whatever it is and
so it gives you a very different kind of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950
so it gives you a very different kind of
 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.520
so it gives you a very different kind of
class of theories than the ones that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530
class of theories than the ones that
 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.339
class of theories than the ones that
we've been so successful with before and

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:20.349
we've been so successful with before and
 

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:23.999
we've been so successful with before and
the they can J so during the sixties

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009
the they can J so during the sixties
 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.100
the they can J so during the sixties
that this idea was initially developed

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110
that this idea was initially developed
 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.330
that this idea was initially developed
and initially people tried to do one

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340
and initially people tried to do one
 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.889
and initially people tried to do one
thing with these class of theories

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899
thing with these class of theories
 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.199
thing with these class of theories
something which didn't work out that

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209
something which didn't work out that
 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:34.710
something which didn't work out that
well and then starting in the late 70s

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720
well and then starting in the late 70s
 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.229
well and then starting in the late 70s
and 80s people then came up with a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:37.239
and 80s people then came up with a
 

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.729
and 80s people then came up with a
conjecture that maybe you really could

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:38.739
conjecture that maybe you really could
 

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:41.550
conjecture that maybe you really could
unify all of physics and solve some of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560
unify all of physics and solve some of
 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.320
unify all of physics and solve some of
the open problems in physics by

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330
the open problems in physics by
 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.690
the open problems in physics by
replacing our standard theories maybe we

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700
replacing our standard theories maybe we
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.210
replacing our standard theories maybe we
call the standard model with some kind

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220
call the standard model with some kind
 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.059
call the standard model with some kind
of string theory and that's so so since

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069
of string theory and that's so so since
 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.249
of string theory and that's so so since
this idea became very popular in 1984

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
this idea became very popular in 1984
 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.620
this idea became very popular in 1984
and so it's been now 25 years people

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
and so it's been now 25 years people
 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.790
and so it's been now 25 years people
have been working very hard on that and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800
have been working very hard on that and
 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.699
have been working very hard on that and
and and I think just the initial thing

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709
and and I think just the initial thing
 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.529
and and I think just the initial thing
I've got people are very excited at

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539
I've got people are very excited at
 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.969
I've got people are very excited at
least I would claim you know really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979
least I would claim you know really
 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.290
least I would claim you know really
hasn't worked out and really can't work

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300
hasn't worked out and really can't work
 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.749
hasn't worked out and really can't work
out and that's kind of been a lot of the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759
out and that's kind of been a lot of the
 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.210
out and that's kind of been a lot of the
reason controversy has been an argument

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220
reason controversy has been an argument
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.250
reason controversy has been an argument
over this issue of you know whether this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260
over this issue of you know whether this
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.619
over this issue of you know whether this
some very speculative idea about whether

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629
some very speculative idea about whether
 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.660
some very speculative idea about whether
you can use these strings to develop

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670
you can use these strings to develop
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550
you can use these strings to develop
having to get a unified theory about

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
having to get a unified theory about
 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.740
having to get a unified theory about
whether that really has is that is that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750
whether that really has is that is that
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.210
whether that really has is that is that
an idea that's failed or is there still

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220
an idea that's failed or is there still
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.619
an idea that's failed or is there still
some hope for it I think that's really

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629
some hope for it I think that's really
 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:29.880
some hope for it I think that's really
the what's the controversial part of it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.850
well the main thing to understand about

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860
well the main thing to understand about
 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.290
well the main thing to understand about
the current state of physics is that we

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300
the current state of physics is that we
 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.630
the current state of physics is that we
have we're in some sense kind of victim

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
have we're in some sense kind of victim
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280
have we're in some sense kind of victim
of our own success we have an incredibly

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
of our own success we have an incredibly
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.110
of our own success we have an incredibly
successful theory called a standard

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
successful theory called a standard
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.080
successful theory called a standard
model and it it really explains

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090
model and it it really explains
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.330
model and it it really explains
everything that we can observe about and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
everything that we can observe about and
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.650
everything that we can observe about and
in terms of a fairly small number of

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
in terms of a fairly small number of
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.510
in terms of a fairly small number of
elementary particles and some basic

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520
elementary particles and some basic
 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.090
elementary particles and some basic
forces between them and it's a it's a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100
forces between them and it's a it's a
 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.110
forces between them and it's a it's a
quite beautiful theory and um it really

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
quite beautiful theory and um it really
 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.640
quite beautiful theory and um it really
is just kind of absurdly successful

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
is just kind of absurdly successful
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.770
is just kind of absurdly successful
every experiment anybody knows how to do

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780
every experiment anybody knows how to do
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.699
every experiment anybody knows how to do
that in principle can be that this

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709
that in principle can be that this
 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.100
that in principle can be that this
theory has something to say about it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
theory has something to say about it
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.750
theory has something to say about it
works it works out perfectly you know to

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760
works it works out perfectly you know to
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.540
works it works out perfectly you know to
whatever experimental in whatever detail

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550
whatever experimental in whatever detail
 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.650
whatever experimental in whatever detail
you can do an experiment to whatever

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
you can do an experiment to whatever
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.180
you can do an experiment to whatever
precision that comes out exactly as

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190
precision that comes out exactly as
 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.910
precision that comes out exactly as
predicted by this model so we have kind

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
predicted by this model so we have kind
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.740
predicted by this model so we have kind
of a semi unified theory this we have

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750
of a semi unified theory this we have
 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.780
of a semi unified theory this we have
this quite nice beautiful structure

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790
this quite nice beautiful structure
 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.330
this quite nice beautiful structure
which explains everything we can see but

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340
which explains everything we can see but
 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.880
which explains everything we can see but
if so it still leaves open several

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890
if so it still leaves open several
 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.550
if so it still leaves open several
questions and some of the questions are

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560
questions and some of the questions are
 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.460
questions and some of the questions are
just kind of why you know we have all

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470
just kind of why you know we have all
 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.449
just kind of why you know we have all
these different particles they all have

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459
these different particles they all have
 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.949
these different particles they all have
different masses why do they all have

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959
different masses why do they all have
 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.539
different masses why do they all have
different masses we don't understand why

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549
different masses we don't understand why
 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.479
different masses we don't understand why
the electron has a certain mass quartz

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
the electron has a certain mass quartz
 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.759
the electron has a certain mass quartz
of other masses so so they're just kind

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
of other masses so so they're just kind
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.830
of other masses so so they're just kind
of things which the theory just doesn't

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
of things which the theory just doesn't
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.080
of things which the theory just doesn't
address it just doesn't answer these

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090
address it just doesn't answer these
 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.130
address it just doesn't answer these
questions and they're questions that

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140
questions and they're questions that
 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.390
questions and they're questions that
which has physicists we think there

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400
which has physicists we think there
 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.430
which has physicists we think there
should be answers to but then there's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440
should be answers to but then there's
 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.740
should be answers to but then there's
also one kind of remaining force which

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
also one kind of remaining force which
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.600
also one kind of remaining force which
isn't part of the standard model which

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610
isn't part of the standard model which
 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.039
isn't part of the standard model which
is the four which is the gravitational

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049
is the four which is the gravitational
 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.020
is the four which is the gravitational
force and the the gravitational force is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
force and the the gravitational force is
 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.940
force and the the gravitational force is
much much weaker than these other forces

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950
much much weaker than these other forces
 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.330
much much weaker than these other forces
and it has somewhat different nature so

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340
and it has somewhat different nature so
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.190
and it has somewhat different nature so
it the problem with it is that we don't

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200
it the problem with it is that we don't
 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.229
it the problem with it is that we don't
um these other forces we have something

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239
um these other forces we have something
 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.660
um these other forces we have something
which is a quantum theory it really it's

which is a quantum theory it really it's
 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.370
which is a quantum theory it really it's
it's quantum mechanics it it really

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380
it's quantum mechanics it it really
 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.009
it's quantum mechanics it it really
works down to the microscopic level and

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019
works down to the microscopic level and
 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.200
works down to the microscopic level and
in terms of this very fundamental idea

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210
in terms of this very fundamental idea
 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.210
in terms of this very fundamental idea
about that reality called quantum

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220
about that reality called quantum

about that reality called quantum
mechanics the theory of gravity that we

mechanics the theory of gravity that we
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.890
mechanics the theory of gravity that we
still use is Einstein's theory of

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900
still use is Einstein's theory of
 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.659
still use is Einstein's theory of
general relativity and it's what we call

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669
general relativity and it's what we call
 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.250
general relativity and it's what we call
a classical theory it's not a quantum

a classical theory it's not a quantum
 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.159
a classical theory it's not a quantum
mechanical theory and the you can make

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169
mechanical theory and the you can make
 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.690
mechanical theory and the you can make
an estimate the problem is you can make

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700
an estimate the problem is you can make
 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.980
an estimate the problem is you can make
an estimate within this theory of how

an estimate within this theory of how
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.020
an estimate within this theory of how
big quantum mechanical effects would be

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030
big quantum mechanical effects would be
 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.330
big quantum mechanical effects would be
and that estimate tells you that they're

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340
and that estimate tells you that they're
 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.620
and that estimate tells you that they're
just so absurdly small you

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630
just so absurdly small you
 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.320
just so absurdly small you

never hope to see them so there's kind
of a problem of principle we had this

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440
of a problem of principle we had this
 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.470
of a problem of principle we had this

theory which is not a proper quantum
 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.080
theory which is not a proper quantum
mechanical theory and we know that

mechanical theory and we know that
 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.340
mechanical theory and we know that
there's things which it can't quite

there's things which it can't quite
 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.040
there's things which it can't quite
properly explain but there there's

they're far too small for us to study
them and to try to see them so anyways

we're not completely happy with this set
up we have a force which doesn't quite

fit with the others and which for
logical reasons is that we would like to

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600
logical reasons is that we would like to
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.490
logical reasons is that we would like to
unify it with these others and

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500
unify it with these others and
 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.260
unify it with these others and
understand it as a quantum mechanical

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270
understand it as a quantum mechanical
 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.900
understand it as a quantum mechanical
theory and we've never been successful

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910
theory and we've never been successful
 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.700
theory and we've never been successful
and able to do that and and this is what

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710
and able to do that and and this is what
 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.140
and able to do that and and this is what
string theory was it was kind of a

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150
string theory was it was kind of a
 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.520
string theory was it was kind of a
promise of a way of how to do that and

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530
promise of a way of how to do that and
 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.540
promise of a way of how to do that and
that's kind of that that's why people

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550
that's kind of that that's why people
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.040
that's kind of that that's why people
got so excited

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050
 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.059
it's kind that's kind of famous phrase

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069
it's kind that's kind of famous phrase
 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:33.320
it's kind that's kind of famous phrase
among physicists it goes back to a

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330
among physicists it goes back to a
 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.999
among physicists it goes back to a
there's a well-known theorist called

there's a well-known theorist called
 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.149
there's a well-known theorist called
Wolfgang Pauli in the 50s stories that

Wolfgang Pauli in the 50s stories that
 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.619
Wolfgang Pauli in the 50s stories that
toward the end of his life someone I

toward the end of his life someone I
 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.550
toward the end of his life someone I
guess he was well known for being very

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560
guess he was well known for being very
 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.439
guess he was well known for being very
kind of hyper critical of things that

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449
kind of hyper critical of things that
 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.269
kind of hyper critical of things that
were going on and would get up the

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279
were going on and would get up the
 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.800
were going on and would get up the
middle of a seminar and start saying you

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
middle of a seminar and start saying you
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.779
middle of a seminar and start saying you
know it's wrong it's completely wrong

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789
know it's wrong it's completely wrong
 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.029
know it's wrong it's completely wrong
and late in his life someone asked him

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039
and late in his life someone asked him
 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.029
and late in his life someone asked him
about some work some some speculative

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039
about some work some some speculative
 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.279
about some work some some speculative
idea of someone and given Lee shook his

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289
idea of someone and given Lee shook his
 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.540
idea of someone and given Lee shook his
head and said well that one's not even

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550
head and said well that one's not even
 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.640
head and said well that one's not even
wrong and and so the it's a well-known

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650
wrong and and so the it's a well-known
 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.040
wrong and and so the it's a well-known
phrase among physicists and it kind of

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050
phrase among physicists and it kind of
 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.059
phrase among physicists and it kind of
carries I think to two meanings I mean

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069
carries I think to two meanings I mean
 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.730
carries I think to two meanings I mean
one of them is just kind of a more or

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
one of them is just kind of a more or
 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.070
one of them is just kind of a more or
somewhat of a term of abuse well that's

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080
somewhat of a term of abuse well that's
 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.600
somewhat of a term of abuse well that's
so bad it's not even wrong but but

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610
so bad it's not even wrong but but
 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.890
so bad it's not even wrong but but
there's a more interesting it is also

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
there's a more interesting it is also
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.439
there's a more interesting it is also
more kind of technical meaning that a

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449
 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.700
very often used to you have aspect you

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710
very often used to you have aspect you
 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.760
very often used to you have aspect you
have a speculative idea and if it's if

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770
have a speculative idea and if it's if
 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.939
have a speculative idea and if it's if
it's a lot a very good idea or it turns

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949
it's a lot a very good idea or it turns
 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.740
it's a lot a very good idea or it turns
out you actually can even you end up not

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750
out you actually can even you end up not
 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.999
out you actually can even you end up not
being able to do very much with it you

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:35.009
being able to do very much with it you
 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.240
being able to do very much with it you
end up not being able to to predict

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250
end up not being able to to predict
 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.209
end up not being able to to predict
anything with it or - it's just not

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219
anything with it or - it's just not
 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.369
anything with it or - it's just not
useful so there's also a notion of not

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:43.379
useful so there's also a notion of not
 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:44.719
useful so there's also a notion of not
being not even wrong in the sense that

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729
being not even wrong in the sense that
 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.510
being not even wrong in the sense that
it's not an idea which can be fully

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
it's not an idea which can be fully
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.860
it's not an idea which can be fully
developed or it can turn into something

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870
developed or it can turn into something
 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.300
developed or it can turn into something
which is powerful enough to actually

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310
which is powerful enough to actually
 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.939
which is powerful enough to actually
predict something and be wrong so this

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949
predict something and be wrong so this
 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:53.839
predict something and be wrong so this
it's a tie

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849
it's a tie
 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.219
it's a tie
one problem of string theory is that

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229
one problem of string theory is that
 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.209
one problem of string theory is that
it's kind of a theory which that can

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219
it's kind of a theory which that can
 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:00.290
it's kind of a theory which that can
explain what the problems are but the

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300
explain what the problems are but the
 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.610
explain what the problems are but the
problems are such that you can't ever

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620
problems are such that you can't ever
 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.850
problems are such that you can't ever
even pin it down and say this is exactly

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860
even pin it down and say this is exactly
 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.110
even pin it down and say this is exactly
what it predicts and let's go out and

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120
what it predicts and let's go out and
 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.119
what it predicts and let's go out and
test it so it's not even capable of

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129
test it so it's not even capable of
 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:10.159
test it so it's not even capable of
being wrong being wrong or being

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169
being wrong being wrong or being
 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.200
being wrong being wrong or being
falsified or being shown to be wrong so

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210
falsified or being shown to be wrong so
 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.209
falsified or being shown to be wrong so
that's the more relevant meaning here

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219
that's the more relevant meaning here
 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:18.450
that's the more relevant meaning here
really

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460
 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.340
I said I mean it's string theory is

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350
I said I mean it's string theory is
 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.909
I said I mean it's string theory is
actually a very complicated story so

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919
actually a very complicated story so
 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.860
actually a very complicated story so
they're there you know if you start out

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870
they're there you know if you start out
 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.020
they're there you know if you start out
with this hypothesis that maybe your

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030
with this hypothesis that maybe your
 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.059

these strings there's a lot of different

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810
these strings there's a lot of different
 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.180
these strings there's a lot of different
things you can try and do that you can

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190
things you can try and do that you can
 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.710
things you can try and do that you can
do you have a whole different class of

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720
do you have a whole different class of
 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.540
do you have a whole different class of
theories you can play with and so I

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550
theories you can play with and so I
 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.460
theories you can play with and so I
think a lot of if you look at what most

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470
think a lot of if you look at what most
 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.379

people who are still doing strengths you
 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.620
people who are still doing strengths you

all kind of doing other things with
 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.650
all kind of doing other things with

they've kind of given up on the unified
 

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.830
they've kind of given up on the unified
theory idea but they're they're often

doing other things so there's a there's
 

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.360
doing other things so there's a there's
a very active pursuit of string theory

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.370
a very active pursuit of string theory
 

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.909
a very active pursuit of string theory
in you know with other applications that

also turn out to be very interesting in

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:24.220
also turn out to be very interesting in
 

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.249
also turn out to be very interesting in
in mathematics there's a very one of the

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:26.259
in mathematics there's a very one of the
 

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:27.390
in mathematics there's a very one of the
things that I'm most interested in is

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400
things that I'm most interested in is
 

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.279
things that I'm most interested in is
the intersection between mathematics and

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:29.289
the intersection between mathematics and
 

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:32.399
the intersection between mathematics and
physics and the way the two fields kind

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:32.409
physics and the way the two fields kind
 

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.690
physics and the way the two fields kind
of affect each other and ideas from

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.700
of affect each other and ideas from
 

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.610
of affect each other and ideas from
physics lead to very interesting things

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:35.620
physics lead to very interesting things
 

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.529
physics lead to very interesting things
in mathematics ideas in mathematics get

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:37.539
in mathematics ideas in mathematics get
 

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.540
in mathematics ideas in mathematics get
used and they give us new physics and

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.550
used and they give us new physics and
 

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.219
used and they give us new physics and
string theory has been very very

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:41.229
string theory has been very very
 

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.079
string theory has been very very
fruitful in terms of raising questions

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:43.089
fruitful in terms of raising questions
 

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:45.030
fruitful in terms of raising questions
which have a have led to very

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040
which have a have led to very
 

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.410
which have a have led to very
interesting mathematics so there's a

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:46.420
interesting mathematics so there's a
 

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.420
interesting mathematics so there's a
very active field of research come in

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
very active field of research come in
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.750
very active field of research come in
between math and physics in string

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760
between math and physics in string
 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.430
between math and physics in string
theory but but it but it doesn't seem to

theory but but it but it doesn't seem to
 

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.360
theory but but it but it doesn't seem to
be relevant to this question of

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.370
be relevant to this question of
 

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.010
be relevant to this question of
unification

00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.020
 

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.770
I certainly shouldn't my criticism of

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:01.780
I certainly shouldn't my criticism of
 

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.050
I certainly shouldn't my criticism of
string theory is not that well you know

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.060
string theory is not that well you know
 

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.580
string theory is not that well you know
if you guys are just realize that you

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.590
if you guys are just realize that you
 

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.830
if you guys are just realize that you
should be doing such-and-such that would

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:07.840
should be doing such-and-such that would
 

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.090
should be doing such-and-such that would
that would solve a lot of problems that

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.100
that would solve a lot of problems that
 

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.070
that would solve a lot of problems that
I don't actually I don't think that I

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.080
I don't actually I don't think that I
 

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.840
I don't actually I don't think that I
have some my own ideas which I'm very

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:12.850
have some my own ideas which I'm very
 

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.370
have some my own ideas which I'm very
excited about which I which I'm pursuing

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:14.380
excited about which I which I'm pursuing
 

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.710
excited about which I which I'm pursuing
which are also new ideas about how to

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720
which are also new ideas about how to
 

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.080
which are also new ideas about how to
use mathematics to do things in physics

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.090
use mathematics to do things in physics
 

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.550
use mathematics to do things in physics
which don't have anything to do with

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560
which don't have anything to do with
 

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.490
which don't have anything to do with
string theory and and which kind of at

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:23.500
string theory and and which kind of at
 

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.930
string theory and and which kind of at
least lead me to see there you know

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:24.940

there's a lot of areas a lot of things
 

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.630
there's a lot of areas a lot of things
we don't understand

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640
we don't understand
 

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.940
we don't understand
which are closer to our the standard

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:29.950
which are closer to our the standard
 

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.130
which are closer to our the standard

there's a lot of kind of mathematical

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:33.700
there's a lot of kind of mathematical
 

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.800
there's a lot of kind of mathematical
mathematical structure behind the

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:36.810
mathematical structure behind the
 

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.000
mathematical structure behind the
standard model which is still kind of

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.010
standard model which is still kind of
 

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.320
standard model which is still kind of
mysterious and which is not well

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.330
mysterious and which is not well
 

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.450
mysterious and which is not well
understood and I think pursuing that is

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:42.460
understood and I think pursuing that is
 

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.210
understood and I think pursuing that is
more likely to get us somewhere then the

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.220
more likely to get us somewhere then the
 

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.040
more likely to get us somewhere then the

so so so the state of the standard model
 

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.340
so so so the state of the standard model
is that it is quite beautiful theory but

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.350
is that it is quite beautiful theory but

is that it is quite beautiful theory but
you um to make the whole thing work you

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:52.770
you um to make the whole thing work you
 

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.870
you um to make the whole thing work you
need a you you need to make sure that a

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140
certain kind of a physical phenomenon
 

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.350
certain kind of a physical phenomenon
has to happen basically and one way of

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360
has to happen basically and one way of
 

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.000
has to happen basically and one way of
saying it is that the theory has certain

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.010
saying it is that the theory has certain
 

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:06.590
saying it is that the theory has certain
symmetries and and the the lowest tenet

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600
symmetries and and the the lowest tenet
 

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.060
symmetries and and the the lowest tenet
the lowest energy theory the lowest

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.070
the lowest energy theory the lowest

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600
energy state the vacuum of the theory
 

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.980
energy state the vacuum of the theory
has to have non-trivial properties under

has to have non-trivial properties under
 

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.690
has to have non-trivial properties under
one of these symmetries it can't

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700
one of these symmetries it can't
 

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.300
one of these symmetries it can't
normally you say a vacuum state is just

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.310
normally you say a vacuum state is just
 

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.590
normally you say a vacuum state is just
kind of complete and interesting if you

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600
kind of complete and interesting if you
 

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.660
kind of complete and interesting if you
you rotate it around move it around the

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:20.670
you rotate it around move it around the
 

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.890
you rotate it around move it around the
vacuum state it can't nothing can happen

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:21.900
vacuum state it can't nothing can happen
 

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.980
vacuum state it can't nothing can happen
it's just a vacuum state but um but the

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:24.990
it's just a vacuum state but um but the
 

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.590
it's just a vacuum state but um but the
vacuum actually has to have interesting

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600
vacuum actually has to have interesting
 

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.300
vacuum actually has to have interesting
properties under these kind of

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:29.310
properties under these kind of
 

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.740
properties under these kind of
mathematical symmetry transformations

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:30.750
mathematical symmetry transformations
 

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.460
mathematical symmetry transformations
and the so so we know that that has to

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:34.470
and the so so we know that that has to
 

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.840
and the so so we know that that has to
be true in order to make the theory work

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:35.850
be true in order to make the theory work
 

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.670
be true in order to make the theory work
and there are there many ways you can

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680
and there are there many ways you can
 

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.440
and there are there many ways you can
imagine making that happen and and one

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.450
imagine making that happen and and one
 

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.180
imagine making that happen and and one
way is called the Higgs the Higgs

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:44.190
way is called the Higgs the Higgs
 

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.680
way is called the Higgs the Higgs
mechanism and so the Higgs mechanism

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:45.690
mechanism and so the Higgs mechanism
 

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.610
mechanism and so the Higgs mechanism
involves a postulating existence of some

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620
involves a postulating existence of some
 

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.250
involves a postulating existence of some
some new fields a new kind of matter

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260
some new fields a new kind of matter
 

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.100
some new fields a new kind of matter
which is this this Higgs part this this

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.110
which is this this Higgs part this this
 

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.410
which is this this Higgs part this this
Higgs field and and and then giving this

00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.420
Higgs field and and and then giving this
 

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.600
Higgs field and and and then giving this
you did the dynamics for the making the

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.610
you did the dynamics for the making the
 

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.010
you did the dynamics for the making the
properties of the Higgs field such that

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:04.020
properties of the Higgs field such that
 

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.140
properties of the Higgs field such that
the fact that the in the vacuum state

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.150
the fact that the in the vacuum state
 

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.910
the fact that the in the vacuum state
the Higgs field will have this non

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920
the Higgs field will have this non
 

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.450
the Higgs field will have this non
trivial property so you you can do that

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:11.460
trivial property so you you can do that
 

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.690
trivial property so you you can do that
in some sense the Higgs field is kind of

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:13.700
in some sense the Higgs field is kind of
 

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.150
in some sense the Higgs field is kind of
the simplest way of getting what you

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160
the simplest way of getting what you
 

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:22.430
the simplest way of getting what you
want but when you do it you also you you

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440
want but when you do it you also you you
 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.260
want but when you do it you also you you
you you end up losing the ability to

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:24.270
you you end up losing the ability to
 

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.090
you you end up losing the ability to
predict all sorts of things because then

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100
predict all sorts of things because then
 

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.150
predict all sorts of things because then
if some then there the question of why

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160
if some then there the question of why
 

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.020
if some then there the question of why
why did why does a particle have a

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:30.030
why did why does a particle have a
 

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.360
why did why does a particle have a
certain mass just becomes well because

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.370
certain mass just becomes well because
 

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.790
certain mass just becomes well because
that's how strong its how strongly it

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800
that's how strong its how strongly it
 

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.840
that's how strong its how strongly it
interacts with the Higgs field so you

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:37.850
interacts with the Higgs field so you
 

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.010
interacts with the Higgs field so you
it's a simplest way of making something

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:40.020
it's a simplest way of making something
 

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.610
it's a simplest way of making something
happen you know has to happen but it

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:42.620
happen you know has to happen but it
 

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.740
happen you know has to happen but it
it's a way which has a lot of things you

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:45.750
it's a way which has a lot of things you
 

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.690
it's a way which has a lot of things you
don't really like it's not very

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700
don't really like it's not very
 

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.580
don't really like it's not very
satisfactory way of doing it because it

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.590
satisfactory way of doing it because it
 

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.860
satisfactory way of doing it because it
kind of of necessity then leaves open a

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:51.870
kind of of necessity then leaves open a
 

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.660
kind of of necessity then leaves open a
whole range of question and questions

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:53.670
whole range of question and questions
 

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.800
whole range of question and questions
which you would hope to have answers to

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:54.810
which you would hope to have answers to
 

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.889
which you would hope to have answers to
but you just from you

00:13:56.889 --> 00:13:56.899
but you just from you
 

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.710
but you just from you
can't answer that way so one thing which

00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720
can't answer that way so one thing which
 

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.910
can't answer that way so one thing which
we hope to learn from the LHC is is this

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920
we hope to learn from the LHC is is this
 

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.079
we hope to learn from the LHC is is this
Higgs mechanism or this Higgs field

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:05.089
Higgs mechanism or this Higgs field
 

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:09.639
Higgs mechanism or this Higgs field
really there in which case that that'll

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:09.649
really there in which case that that'll
 

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:10.629
really there in which case that that'll
that'll be actually somewhat of a

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639
that'll be actually somewhat of a
 

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.980
that'll be actually somewhat of a
disappointment because it'll mean that

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:11.990
disappointment because it'll mean that
 

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.079
disappointment because it'll mean that
okay this theory kind of continues to

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:14.089
okay this theory kind of continues to
 

00:14:14.089 --> 00:14:16.480
okay this theory kind of continues to
work and we don't we still don't know

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.490
work and we don't we still don't know
 

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.249
work and we don't we still don't know
how to answer some these questions or I

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:18.259
how to answer some these questions or I
 

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:19.689
how to answer some these questions or I
think that the much more exciting

00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:19.699
think that the much more exciting
 

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:21.329
think that the much more exciting
possibility is going to be that there's

00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:21.339
possibility is going to be that there's
 

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:23.499
possibility is going to be that there's
some somewhat something else causing

00:14:23.499 --> 00:14:23.509
some somewhat something else causing
 

00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:26.650
some somewhat something else causing
this phenomenon of the of the vacuum

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:26.660
this phenomenon of the of the vacuum
 

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.559
this phenomenon of the of the vacuum
behaving this way and and there's

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:29.569
behaving this way and and there's
 

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:31.509
behaving this way and and there's
something else would be you know give us

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519
something else would be you know give us
 

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:33.579
something else would be you know give us
some what would be so it would be

00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:33.589
some what would be so it would be
 

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:34.329
some what would be so it would be
something which would be more

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:34.339
something which would be more
 

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:36.639
something which would be more
interesting and will allow answers to

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:36.649
interesting and will allow answers to
 

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:39.970
interesting and will allow answers to
these questions so instead so this hole

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:39.980
these questions so instead so this hole
 

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.410
these questions so instead so this hole
is this name of the Higgs field and

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.420
is this name of the Higgs field and
 

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.850
is this name of the Higgs field and
finding the Higgs particle that's kind

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:42.860
finding the Higgs particle that's kind
 

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.759
finding the Higgs particle that's kind
of a it's an oversimplified way of

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:45.769
of a it's an oversimplified way of
 

00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.259
of a it's an oversimplified way of
saying what we're really hoping which is

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:47.269
saying what we're really hoping which is
 

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:48.730
saying what we're really hoping which is
we're really hoping to understand what

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:48.740
we're really hoping to understand what
 

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.710
we're really hoping to understand what
is causing the vacuum to behave this way

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720
is causing the vacuum to behave this way
 

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.759
is causing the vacuum to behave this way
and and we have good reason there's kind

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:54.769
and and we have good reason there's kind
 

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.109
and and we have good reason there's kind
of a number in the theory which kind of

00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:56.119
of a number in the theory which kind of
 

00:14:56.119 --> 00:14:58.869
of a number in the theory which kind of
says how big this phenomenon going on in

00:14:58.869 --> 00:14:58.879
says how big this phenomenon going on in
 

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:02.169
says how big this phenomenon going on in
the vacuum is and and what the size of

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:02.179
the vacuum is and and what the size of
 

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.389
the vacuum is and and what the size of
it is and the size is exactly the size

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399
it is and the size is exactly the size
 

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:06.040
it is and the size is exactly the size
that this this accelerator should

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.050
that this this accelerator should
 

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.889
that this this accelerator should
finally be able to probe so there it's

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:08.899
finally be able to probe so there it's
 

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:10.569
finally be able to probe so there it's
not um there's a very good reason to

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:10.579
not um there's a very good reason to
 

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:12.100
not um there's a very good reason to
believe that this is the right machine

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.110
believe that this is the right machine
 

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.720
believe that this is the right machine
to kind of start answering some of these

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:13.730
to kind of start answering some of these
 

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.049
to kind of start answering some of these
questions

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:18.059
 

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:22.079
the real problem is that the ways that

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:22.089
the real problem is that the ways that
 

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.519
the real problem is that the ways that
we in it that there are various ways a

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:23.529
we in it that there are various ways a
 

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.139
we in it that there are various ways a
lot of people study a lot of other

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:25.149
lot of people study a lot of other
 

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.179
lot of people study a lot of other
alternatives to the Higgs field which M

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:27.189
alternatives to the Higgs field which M
 

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:29.309
alternatives to the Higgs field which M
the problem is that they're all fairly

00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319
the problem is that they're all fairly
 

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:30.749
the problem is that they're all fairly
complicated and none of them they all

00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759
complicated and none of them they all
 

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:33.539
complicated and none of them they all
have as bad or even worse problem is in

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:33.549
have as bad or even worse problem is in
 

00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:35.369
have as bad or even worse problem is in
the Higgs field so David they've all so

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:35.379
the Higgs field so David they've all so
 

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:36.749
the Higgs field so David they've all so
none of them are convincing we don't

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759
none of them are convincing we don't
 

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:38.340
none of them are convincing we don't
have a convincing alternative to it

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.350
have a convincing alternative to it
 

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.549
have a convincing alternative to it
and and I don't either I guess I mean

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:41.559
and and I don't either I guess I mean
 

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:43.650
and and I don't either I guess I mean
the one about all I can say about that

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:43.660
the one about all I can say about that
 

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.579
the one about all I can say about that
is that the there I'm very interested in

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:47.589
is that the there I'm very interested in
 

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:50.429
is that the there I'm very interested in
some of the kind of mathematical parts

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:50.439
some of the kind of mathematical parts
 

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:51.509
some of the kind of mathematical parts
of the theory that we don't understand

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519
of the theory that we don't understand
 

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:52.590
of the theory that we don't understand
and some of the kind of deep

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600
and some of the kind of deep
 

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.999
and some of the kind of deep
mathematical structure that we don't

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:54.009
mathematical structure that we don't
 

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:55.699
mathematical structure that we don't
understand and are in these theories and

understand and are in these theories and
 

00:15:55.709 --> 00:15:57.989
understand and are in these theories and
part of what we don't understand in

part of what we don't understand in
 

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.169
part of what we don't understand in
these theories actually is you know is

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:01.179
these theories actually is you know is
 

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:03.449
these theories actually is you know is
related to this problem of the vacuum of

00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:03.459
related to this problem of the vacuum of
 

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:07.609
related to this problem of the vacuum of
this behavior of the vacuum so I mean in

00:16:07.609 --> 00:16:07.619
this behavior of the vacuum so I mean in
 

00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:10.769
this behavior of the vacuum so I mean in
in my ideal world the the the it would

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:10.779
in my ideal world the the the it would
 

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:13.289
in my ideal world the the the it would
turn out that there's there's there

00:16:13.289 --> 00:16:13.299
turn out that there's there's there
 

00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:14.789
turn out that there's there's there
something that we there's something

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:14.799
something that we there's something
 

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:15.599
something that we there's something
still to be learned about the

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:15.609
still to be learned about the
 

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:16.949
still to be learned about the
mathematical structure of these theories

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959
mathematical structure of these theories
 

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.439
mathematical structure of these theories
which it would would in the end you know

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:19.449
which it would would in the end you know
 

00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:21.809
which it would would in the end you know
explain this this Higgs this Higgs

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:21.819
explain this this Higgs this Higgs
 

00:16:21.819 --> 00:16:23.009
explain this this Higgs this Higgs
phenomenon is this problem with the

00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:23.019
phenomenon is this problem with the
 

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:25.109
phenomenon is this problem with the
vacuum but but I mean I I wish I knew

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:25.119
vacuum but but I mean I I wish I knew
 

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:26.789
vacuum but but I mean I I wish I knew
how to do that but I certainly don't

00:16:26.789 --> 00:16:26.799
how to do that but I certainly don't
 

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:28.919
how to do that but I certainly don't
have a and has a very vague reason to

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:28.929
have a and has a very vague reason to
 

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:30.989
have a and has a very vague reason to
believe it there that's an interesting

00:16:30.989 --> 00:16:30.999
believe it there that's an interesting
 

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:32.280
believe it there that's an interesting
thing to look at but but I certainly

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.290
thing to look at but but I certainly
 

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.449
thing to look at but but I certainly
don't have an answer to it and I think

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459
don't have an answer to it and I think
 

00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:37.739
don't have an answer to it and I think
if I had to assign probabilities to it

00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:37.749
if I had to assign probabilities to it
 

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:39.900
if I had to assign probabilities to it
what I would guess is that the I'd say

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.910
what I would guess is that the I'd say
 

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.210
what I would guess is that the I'd say
there's about a 50% chance the LHC will

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:42.220
there's about a 50% chance the LHC will
 

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.369
there's about a 50% chance the LHC will
actually see an actual Higgs particle

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:44.379
actually see an actual Higgs particle
 

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.970
actually see an actual Higgs particle
and there will be there is some kind of

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:47.980
and there will be there is some kind of
 

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.039
and there will be there is some kind of
Higgs field and that this is going to be

00:16:50.039 --> 00:16:50.049
Higgs field and that this is going to be
 

00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:51.900
Higgs field and that this is going to be
kind of depressing for us because it

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:51.910
kind of depressing for us because it
 

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.960
kind of depressing for us because it
means well whatever there is this field

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:54.970
means well whatever there is this field
 

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.970
means well whatever there is this field
there's it's it's working like this and

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:56.980
there's it's it's working like this and
 

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.549
there's it's it's working like this and
the answer these questions we would like

00:16:59.549 --> 00:16:59.559
the answer these questions we would like
 

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:02.159
the answer these questions we would like
answers to are you'd have to go to even

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:02.169
answers to are you'd have to go to even
 

00:17:02.169 --> 00:17:04.199
answers to are you'd have to go to even
higher energies or smaller distances to

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:04.209
higher energies or smaller distances to
 

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:07.169
higher energies or smaller distances to
understand them and or there's there's I

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:07.179
understand them and or there's there's I
 

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:08.639
understand them and or there's there's I
think there's a 50% probability will

00:17:08.639 --> 00:17:08.649
think there's a 50% probability will
 

00:17:08.649 --> 00:17:10.620
think there's a 50% probability will
find that we won't see a Higgs particle

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:10.630
find that we won't see a Higgs particle
 

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.980
find that we won't see a Higgs particle
or at least on a Higgs particle the kind

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:12.990
or at least on a Higgs particle the kind
 

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.870
or at least on a Higgs particle the kind
that that you see in the simplest model

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880
that that you see in the simplest model
 

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.860
that that you see in the simplest model
and then that would and that will

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:16.870
and then that would and that will
 

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.059
and then that would and that will
actually give us clues as to what's

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:18.069
actually give us clues as to what's
 

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.559
actually give us clues as to what's
really going on and that will be a much

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:19.569
really going on and that will be a much
 

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.019
really going on and that will be a much
more exciting this time but I don't know

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:22.029
more exciting this time but I don't know
 

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:28.549
more exciting this time but I don't know
which is going to happen

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559
 

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:31.639
there's no reason the UM the general

00:17:31.639 --> 00:17:31.649
there's no reason the UM the general
 

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:32.810
there's no reason the UM the general
problem with particle physics is that

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820
problem with particle physics is that
 

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.320
problem with particle physics is that
these questions we're asking are at you

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.330
these questions we're asking are at you
 

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.430
these questions we're asking are at you
know they're having at such high energy

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440
know they're having at such high energy
 

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.680
know they're having at such high energy
scales or such short distances that it's

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:39.690
scales or such short distances that it's
 

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.320
scales or such short distances that it's
um it's very hard to see how to do

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.330
um it's very hard to see how to do
 

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.730
um it's very hard to see how to do
anything very practical with this I mean

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:43.740
anything very practical with this I mean
 

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.820
anything very practical with this I mean
anything like these particles we're

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:46.830
anything like these particles we're
 

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.350
anything like these particles we're
talking about you know how often have

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360
talking about you know how often have
 

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.690
talking about you know how often have
have lifetimes which are you know 10 to

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700
have lifetimes which are you know 10 to
 

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.730
have lifetimes which are you know 10 to
the minus 20 seconds or I mean they're

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740
the minus 20 seconds or I mean they're
 

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.919
the minus 20 seconds or I mean they're
they're they're they're just if you

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:54.929
they're they're they're just if you
 

00:17:54.929 --> 00:17:56.149
they're they're they're just if you
produce a Higgs particle it's gonna be

00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159
produce a Higgs particle it's gonna be
 

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.279
produce a Higgs particle it's gonna be
so short-lived it's incredibly difficult

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:58.289
so short-lived it's incredibly difficult
 

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.289
so short-lived it's incredibly difficult
to even see any evidence of the thing

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299
to even see any evidence of the thing
 

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:01.430
to even see any evidence of the thing
it's not something you can be able to go

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440
it's not something you can be able to go
 

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.529
it's not something you can be able to go
out and use these Higgs particles to

00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539
out and use these Higgs particles to
 

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:05.299
out and use these Higgs particles to
carry around and do something with them

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:05.309
carry around and do something with them
 

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:07.249
carry around and do something with them
on the other hand I mean you don't

00:18:07.249 --> 00:18:07.259
on the other hand I mean you don't
 

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:08.480
on the other hand I mean you don't
really know what you're gonna find it if

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.490
really know what you're gonna find it if
 

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.889
really know what you're gonna find it if
you do find especially if you find

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:09.899
you do find especially if you find
 

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:12.139
you do find especially if you find
something but I guess I I could say it

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:12.149
something but I guess I I could say it
 

00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:14.539
something but I guess I I could say it
this way if you do just find this Higgs

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:14.549
this way if you do just find this Higgs
 

00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:17.090
this way if you do just find this Higgs
particle in just the SIG's field it's

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100
particle in just the SIG's field it's
 

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.470
particle in just the SIG's field it's
very hard to did to me to do anything

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480
very hard to did to me to do anything
 

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.389
very hard to did to me to do anything
really practical with that if you if you

00:18:20.389 --> 00:18:20.399
really practical with that if you if you
 

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.409
really practical with that if you if you
find some completely new understanding

00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419
find some completely new understanding
 

00:18:21.419 --> 00:18:24.499
find some completely new understanding
of this theory then who knows I mean you

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:24.509
of this theory then who knows I mean you
 

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:25.789
of this theory then who knows I mean you
can conjecture a come up with all sorts

00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799
can conjecture a come up with all sorts
 

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.350
can conjecture a come up with all sorts
of models you can come up with models in

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360
of models you can come up with models in
 

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.389
of models you can come up with models in
which there's kind of new heavy

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:29.399
which there's kind of new heavy
 

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.639
which there's kind of new heavy
long-lived particles which you could

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:31.649
long-lived particles which you could
 

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:33.879
long-lived particles which you could
then imagine doing things with but um I

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:33.889
then imagine doing things with but um I
 

00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:36.200
then imagine doing things with but um I
think it is probably pretty a good bet

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.210
think it is probably pretty a good bet
 

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.419
think it is probably pretty a good bet
that with it with in the near future

00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:38.429
that with it with in the near future
 

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:40.159
that with it with in the near future
this is not really a big be practical

00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:40.169
this is not really a big be practical
 

00:18:40.169 --> 00:18:42.560
this is not really a big be practical
this is really a matter of just trying

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.570
this is really a matter of just trying
 

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.730
this is really a matter of just trying
to understand the world better or not

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.740
to understand the world better or not
 

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.710
to understand the world better or not
not not something it's not in a way but

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720
not not something it's not in a way but
 

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.749
not not something it's not in a way but
not in a way that's particularly gonna

00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:47.759
not in a way that's particularly gonna
 

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:50.029
not in a way that's particularly gonna
be useful for for doing anything too

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039
be useful for for doing anything too
 

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.409
be useful for for doing anything too
practical it's gonna affect people

00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419
practical it's gonna affect people
 

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:56.080

anytime soon

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.090
 

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.279
I mean some of some of that is because

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:00.289
I mean some of some of that is because
 

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:04.180
I mean some of some of that is because
people one of the alternatives to this

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:04.190
people one of the alternatives to this
 

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:08.259
people one of the alternatives to this
is this Higgs mechanism is it and people

00:19:08.259 --> 00:19:08.269
is this Higgs mechanism is it and people
 

00:19:08.269 --> 00:19:09.609
is this Higgs mechanism is it and people
started studying so that says some

00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:09.619
started studying so that says some
 

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:12.009
started studying so that says some
models in which well to go back a little

00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:12.019
models in which well to go back a little
 

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:13.570
models in which well to go back a little
bit I mean one thing about string theory

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:13.580
bit I mean one thing about string theory
 

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.719
bit I mean one thing about string theory
is string theory to make string theory

00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:16.729
is string theory to make string theory
 

00:19:16.729 --> 00:19:18.070
is string theory to make string theory
work you have to have extra dimensions

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080
work you have to have extra dimensions
 

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.690
work you have to have extra dimensions
you have to have more than the three

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:19.700
you have to have more than the three
 

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.849
you have to have more than the three
space and one-time dimensions and that

00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:21.859
space and one-time dimensions and that
 

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:23.320
space and one-time dimensions and that
then that's kind of in some sense the

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.330
then that's kind of in some sense the
 

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.659
then that's kind of in some sense the
main problem was that with string theory

00:19:25.659 --> 00:19:25.669
main problem was that with string theory
 

00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:29.950
main problem was that with string theory
that you have to you have to have like

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960
that you have to you have to have like
 

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.529
that you have to you have to have like
five least five extra dimensions I start

00:19:32.529 --> 00:19:32.539
five least five extra dimensions I start
 

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:37.930
five least five extra dimensions I start
sorry six extra dimensions and the the

what's happening these six extra

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080
what's happening these six extra
 

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.289
what's happening these six extra

initially the hope was that there was a

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:46.489
initially the hope was that there was a
 

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:48.339
initially the hope was that there was a
fairly small number of consistent ways

00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:48.349
fairly small number of consistent ways
 

00:19:48.349 --> 00:19:49.959
fairly small number of consistent ways
of dealing these extra dimensions and

00:19:49.959 --> 00:19:49.969
of dealing these extra dimensions and
 

00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:51.969
of dealing these extra dimensions and
that would you know it make this a

00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:51.979
that would you know it make this a
 

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:53.409
that would you know it make this a
predictive theory but it's turned out

00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:53.419
predictive theory but it's turned out
 

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.749
predictive theory but it's turned out
there's just too much you can do and you

00:19:55.749 --> 00:19:55.759
there's just too much you can do and you
 

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:57.129
there's just too much you can do and you
can kind of get anything you want by

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:57.139
can kind of get anything you want by
 

00:19:57.139 --> 00:19:58.719
can kind of get anything you want by
having these extra dimensions do

00:19:58.719 --> 00:19:58.729
having these extra dimensions do
 

00:19:58.729 --> 00:20:01.389
having these extra dimensions do
different things and so what one thing

00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:01.399
different things and so what one thing
 

00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:02.789
different things and so what one thing
as part of this one thing that people

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799
as part of this one thing that people
 

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:06.669
as part of this one thing that people
studied was models in which that these

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679
studied was models in which that these
 

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:09.549
studied was models in which that these
extra mentions are actually of exactly

extra mentions are actually of exactly
 

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:12.039
extra mentions are actually of exactly
the right size that the LHC should start

the right size that the LHC should start

the right size that the LHC should start
seeing evidence of these extra

holes because it because of these extra
 

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.950

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.180

never really been a reason to believe

never really been a reason to believe
that these extra dimensions would we'd

that these extra dimensions would we'd

that these extra dimensions would we'd
see no evidence of them at our best

sudden all these extra benches would

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:32.389
sudden all these extra benches would
 

00:20:32.389 --> 00:20:34.719
sudden all these extra benches would
appear there's just there's absolutely

no reason for that to be to happen it's

00:20:37.749 --> 00:20:37.759
no reason for that to be to happen it's
 

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.430
no reason for that to be to happen it's
you can make speculative models which it

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440
you can make speculative models which it
 

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.379
you can make speculative models which it
happens but but there first of all then

00:20:41.379 --> 00:20:41.389
happens but but there first of all then

anyway so that there's there's really
 

00:20:42.349 --> 00:20:44.019
anyway so that there's there's really
kind no mode no good motivation for

kind no mode no good motivation for
 

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:46.570
kind no mode no good motivation for
these models and for them to happen and

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:46.580
these models and for them to happen and
 

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.430
these models and for them to happen and
no evidence for them and then even if

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440
no evidence for them and then even if
 

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.289
no evidence for them and then even if
they were to exist than they did happen

00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:50.299
they were to exist than they did happen
 

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:52.659

any such black holes would kind of

00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:52.669
any such black holes would kind of
 

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:55.719
any such black holes would kind of
immediately it'd become completely

00:20:55.719 --> 00:20:55.729
immediately it'd become completely
 

00:20:55.729 --> 00:20:56.739
immediately it'd become completely
unstable and when it would just

00:20:56.739 --> 00:20:56.749
unstable and when it would just
 

00:20:56.749 --> 00:20:58.359
unstable and when it would just
immediately decay into something else so

00:20:58.359 --> 00:20:58.369
immediately decay into something else so
 

00:20:58.369 --> 00:20:58.869
immediately decay into something else so
you wouldn't

00:20:58.869 --> 00:20:58.879
you wouldn't
 

00:20:58.879 --> 00:21:01.389
you wouldn't
you're not gonna produce a dangerous

you're not gonna produce a dangerous
black hole that way but but but but the

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559
black hole that way but but but but the
 

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.139
black hole that way but but but but the
first kind of I think what caused all

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:05.149
first kind of I think what caused all
 

00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:07.899
first kind of I think what caused all
this trouble is that people kind of

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:07.909
this trouble is that people kind of
 

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:09.460
this trouble is that people kind of
wanted to

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.470
wanted to
 

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.750
wanted to
to promote these extra dimensional

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760
to promote these extra dimensional
 

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.070
to promote these extra dimensional
models even though there was no good

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080
models even though there was no good
 

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.500
models even though there was no good
motivation for them and so they promoted

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.510
motivation for them and so they promoted
 

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.390
motivation for them and so they promoted
them by saying well in principle you

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400
them by saying well in principle you
 

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.340
them by saying well in principle you
know since we don't know what happens at

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.350
know since we don't know what happens at
 

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.480
know since we don't know what happens at
higher energies they'll you see maybe

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:19.490
higher energies they'll you see maybe
 

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.399
higher energies they'll you see maybe
I've identities extra mentions will show

00:21:21.399 --> 00:21:21.409
I've identities extra mentions will show
 

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:23.409
I've identities extra mentions will show
up but there's no good reason for that

00:21:23.409 --> 00:21:23.419
up but there's no good reason for that
 

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:25.180
up but there's no good reason for that
so but once people started promoting the

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:25.190
so but once people started promoting the
 

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.289
so but once people started promoting the
idea of these extra dimensions might

00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:26.299
idea of these extra dimensions might
 

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:28.270
idea of these extra dimensions might
show up then people that well if they

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.280
show up then people that well if they
 

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.440
show up then people that well if they
show up then maybe they'll be black

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:29.450
show up then maybe they'll be black
 

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.659
show up then maybe they'll be black
holes and it was kind of speculation on

00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:31.669
holes and it was kind of speculation on
 

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:33.220
holes and it was kind of speculation on
top of speculation I have a speculation

there's an area of mathematics which is
 

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.019
there's an area of mathematics which is
known as representation theory and from

physicists often call symmetries so so

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:06.370
physicists often call symmetries so so
 

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.710
physicists often call symmetries so so
for instance one of the basic facts

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720
for instance one of the basic facts
 

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.909
for instance one of the basic facts
about the laws of nature is that they're

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919
about the laws of nature is that they're
 

00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:12.990
about the laws of nature is that they're
there they're symmetric laws of nature

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000
there they're symmetric laws of nature
 

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.230
there they're symmetric laws of nature
are the same at you know if you move if

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240
are the same at you know if you move if
 

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.820
are the same at you know if you move if
you move in any direction or you move in

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:17.830
you move in any direction or you move in
 

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.680
you move in any direction or you move in
time back and forth the laws of physics

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:19.690
time back and forth the laws of physics
 

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.260
time back and forth the laws of physics
don't change if you rotate things around

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:22.270
don't change if you rotate things around
 

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.180
don't change if you rotate things around
and three dimensions laws of physics

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:24.190
and three dimensions laws of physics
 

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.789
and three dimensions laws of physics
don't change and so so these so-called

00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799
don't change and so so these so-called
 

00:22:26.799 --> 00:22:30.720
don't change and so so these so-called
symmetries and and these these

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:30.730
symmetries and and these these
 

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.620
symmetries and and these these
symmetries have very important physical

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:33.630
symmetries have very important physical
 

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.639
symmetries have very important physical
implications so friends the fact that

00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:35.649
implications so friends the fact that
 

00:22:35.649 --> 00:22:38.039
implications so friends the fact that
the laws of physics don't change as if

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:38.049
the laws of physics don't change as if
 

00:22:38.049 --> 00:22:41.789
the laws of physics don't change as if
you change your if you move in time has

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799
you change your if you move in time has
 

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:43.500
you change your if you move in time has
the physical implication that there's

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:43.510
the physical implication that there's
 

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.000
the physical implication that there's
this thing called energy and energy is

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.010
this thing called energy and energy is
 

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.340
this thing called energy and energy is
conserved and the same thing that and

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:47.350
conserved and the same thing that and
 

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.260
conserved and the same thing that and
that the fact that laws of physics don't

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:49.270
that the fact that laws of physics don't
 

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.360
that the fact that laws of physics don't
change if you move back and forth in

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.370
change if you move back and forth in
 

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.430

different directions in space implies

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440
different directions in space implies
 

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.830
different directions in space implies
that there's a something called momentum

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840
that there's a something called momentum
 

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.960
that there's a something called momentum
and momentum is conserved it doesn't

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:57.970
and momentum is conserved it doesn't
 

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.630
and momentum is conserved it doesn't
change in as you move as you evolve in

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640
change in as you move as you evolve in
 

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.519
change in as you move as you evolve in
time and so so these very very

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:02.529
time and so so these very very
 

00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:04.409
time and so so these very very
fundamental facts about physics are kind

00:23:04.409 --> 00:23:04.419
fundamental facts about physics are kind
 

00:23:04.419 --> 00:23:06.570
fundamental facts about physics are kind
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:06.580
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of
 

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.610
of deeply grounded in the symmetries of
of nature and so to a mathematician this

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:11.620
of nature and so to a mathematician this
 

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.820
of nature and so to a mathematician this
this this question is is a question well

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:14.830
this this question is is a question well
 

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.440
this this question is is a question well
what we call about groups and

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:16.450
what we call about groups and
 

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.539
what we call about groups and
representations of these groups so if

00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:18.549
representations of these groups so if
 

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:20.730
representations of these groups so if
you go into any math department and look

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:20.740
you go into any math department and look
 

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.990
you go into any math department and look
at what they're doing you'll see that

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000
at what they're doing you'll see that
 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.310
at what they're doing you'll see that
you know that a lot of a lot of people

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320
you know that a lot of a lot of people
 

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.110
you know that a lot of a lot of people
and different kinds of mathematics are

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120
and different kinds of mathematics are
 

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.659
and different kinds of mathematics are
studying different structures which are

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:27.669
studying different structures which are
 

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:29.460
studying different structures which are
also called groups and they're often

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.470
also called groups and they're often
 

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.960
also called groups and they're often
studying what are called representations

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:30.970
studying what are called representations
 

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.000
studying what are called representations
of these groups so even people studying

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.010
of these groups so even people studying
 

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.860
of these groups so even people studying
num number theory kind of abstract

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:34.870
num number theory kind of abstract
 

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.840
num number theory kind of abstract
things about about prime numbers or

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:36.850
things about about prime numbers or
 

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.350
things about about prime numbers or
something

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360
something
 

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.690
something
they're also studying groups and sort of

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:39.700
they're also studying groups and sort of
 

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.980
they're also studying groups and sort of
representation of these groups so

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:40.990
representation of these groups so
 

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.169
representation of these groups so
there's kind of a to the extent that

00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:43.179
there's kind of a to the extent that
 

00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:46.980
there's kind of a to the extent that
mathematics has a kind of unifying theme

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:46.990
mathematics has a kind of unifying theme
 

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.419
mathematics has a kind of unifying theme
and a unifying principle which shows up

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:48.429
and a unifying principle which shows up
 

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:50.279
and a unifying principle which shows up
in different areas of mathematics it's

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:50.289
in different areas of mathematics it's
 

00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:53.700
in different areas of mathematics it's
about this redness these representations

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:53.710
about this redness these representations
 

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.930
about this redness these representations
a representation theory and the most

it is that if you look at quantum

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:02.529
it is that if you look at quantum

quantum mechanics initially looks like a
 

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:08.730
quantum mechanics initially looks like a
very odd structure it doesn't it's not

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:08.740
very odd structure it doesn't it's not

look like you know like what the way

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:15.880
look like you know like what the way
 

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.010
look like you know like what the way
we're used to thinking about physics

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.020
we're used to thinking about physics
 

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.600
we're used to thinking about physics
based on our everyday experience

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:18.610
based on our everyday experience
 

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.220
based on our everyday experience
but if you look at the mathematical

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.230
but if you look at the mathematical
 

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.480
but if you look at the mathematical
structure and the basic structures of

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:21.490
structure and the basic structures of
 

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.970
structure and the basic structures of
quantum mechanics they're exactly the

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:23.980
quantum mechanics they're exactly the
 

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.529
quantum mechanics they're exactly the
structures that show up in this theory

structures that show up in this theory
 

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:28.289
structures that show up in this theory
in this theory of representations so

00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:28.299
in this theory of representations so
 

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:31.649
in this theory of representations so
there's a kind of a deep relation

00:24:31.649 --> 00:24:31.659
there's a kind of a deep relation
 

00:24:31.659 --> 00:24:33.120
there's a kind of a deep relation
between math and physics which is what

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.130
between math and physics which is what
 

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.519
between math and physics which is what
is surrounding this whole notion of

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:35.529
is surrounding this whole notion of
 

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:36.930
is surrounding this whole notion of
symmetries and representations of

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:36.940
symmetries and representations of
 

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.419
symmetries and representations of
symmetries so so that so that's one

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:39.429
symmetries so so that so that's one
 

00:24:39.429 --> 00:24:40.380

about how to think about representations

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:52.510
about how to think about representations
 

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.480
about how to think about representations
and how to construct them and how to

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:54.490
and how to construct them and how to

think there's still a lot to be learned
 

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.450
think there's still a lot to be learned
in that way and very specifically the

in that way and very specifically the
 

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.029
in that way and very specifically the
so-called standard model has this group

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039
so-called standard model has this group
 

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.260
so-called standard model has this group
of symmetries which is called a gauge

of symmetries which is called a gauge
 

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.960

conjecture or understanding of the
 

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.389
conjecture or understanding of the
representations of this group is that

representations of this group is that
 

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:41.010
representations of this group is that
there's is that that should not be an

there's is that that should not be an
 

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.840
there's is that that should not be an
interesting question there should only

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:42.850
interesting question there should only
 

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.279
interesting question there should only
be a trivial representation of this

be a trivial representation of this
 

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:47.460
be a trivial representation of this
group but anyway my gestures that

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:47.470
group but anyway my gestures that
 

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.930
group but anyway my gestures that
there's there's actually a much more

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:48.940
there's there's actually a much more
 

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.149
there's there's actually a much more
interesting question there and uh and

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159
interesting question there and uh and
 

00:25:51.159 --> 00:25:53.399
interesting question there and uh and
pursuing that you can pursuing this

00:25:53.399 --> 00:25:53.409
pursuing that you can pursuing this
 

00:25:53.409 --> 00:25:55.789
pursuing that you can pursuing this
question of how do you deal with the

00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799
question of how do you deal with the
 

00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:57.720
question of how do you deal with the
would they get the gauge symmetry of

would they get the gauge symmetry of
this theory and in terms of using ideas

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:00.549
this theory and in terms of using ideas
 

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:02.389
this theory and in terms of using ideas
from representation theory that are um

00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399
from representation theory that are um
 

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:04.649
from representation theory that are um
that are more well known in mathematics

00:26:04.649 --> 00:26:04.659
that are more well known in mathematics
 

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:05.730
that are more well known in mathematics
that haven't been used in physics before

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:05.740
that haven't been used in physics before
 

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.529
that haven't been used in physics before
that you can actually get somewhere so

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:07.539
that you can actually get somewhere so
 

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:09.870
that you can actually get somewhere so
that's maybe a bit too technical but

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880
that's maybe a bit too technical but
 

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:16.130
that's maybe a bit too technical but
that's about as good as I can do with

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140
 

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.930
hard to say there's some I'm gonna prove

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940
hard to say there's some I'm gonna prove
 

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.710
hard to say there's some I'm gonna prove
no there's a lot of mean the problem

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720
no there's a lot of mean the problem

with yeah elegance is actually an
 

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.450
with yeah elegance is actually an
interesting question maybe to say what

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460
interesting question maybe to say what
 

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.920

it what is it what is elegance and what
 

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.720
it what is it what is elegance and what
is it what is beauty I guess so one

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:32.730
is it what is beauty I guess so one
 

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.620
is it what is beauty I guess so one
thing the one thing that's come up even

within this this the string theory um

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:35.550
within this this the string theory um
 

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.460
within this this the string theory um
issue is this question or you know is

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:37.470
issue is this question or you know is
 

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.320
issue is this question or you know is
this a beautiful idea or a beautiful

theory so so my colleague Brian Greene

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460
theory so so my colleague Brian Greene
 

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.910
theory so so my colleague Brian Greene
has written a very very good book about

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:43.920
has written a very very good book about
 

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.860
has written a very very good book about
this called the elegant universe and so

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:45.870
this called the elegant universe and so
 

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.370
this called the elegant universe and so
he's um and so and we didn't within

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380
he's um and so and we didn't within
 

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.590
he's um and so and we didn't within
within physics this is our I mean we're

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600
within physics this is our I mean we're
 

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.180
within physics this is our I mean we're
we're often very struck by some of these

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.190
we're often very struck by some of these
 

00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.370
we're often very struck by some of these
basic ideas are we would like to our

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:01.380
basic ideas are we would like to our
 

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.290
basic ideas are we would like to our
very striking and that we act in a way

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:03.300
very striking and that we act in a way
 

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.700
very striking and that we act in a way
which we like to describe as being

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:04.710
which we like to describe as being
 

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.610
which we like to describe as being
elegant or beautiful but um the problem

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620
elegant or beautiful but um the problem
 

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.020
elegant or beautiful but um the problem
with with those that terminology

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.030
with with those that terminology
 

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.640
with with those that terminology
especially the terminology of beauty is

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.650
especially the terminology of beauty is
 

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.500
especially the terminology of beauty is
that beauty means a lot of different

that beauty means a lot of different
 

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.000
that beauty means a lot of different
things to a lot of different people a

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.010
things to a lot of different people a
 

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.260
things to a lot of different people a
lot of different ways in which things

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:15.270
lot of different ways in which things
 

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.560
lot of different ways in which things
can be beautiful but this really has a

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:18.570
can be beautiful but this really has a
 

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.110
can be beautiful but this really has a
very specific meaning and and which is

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120
very specific meaning and and which is
 

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.970
very specific meaning and and which is
more along the lines of elegans which is

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980
more along the lines of elegans which is
 

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.910
more along the lines of elegans which is
that we say that an idea is beautiful or

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:25.920
that we say that an idea is beautiful or
 

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.660
that we say that an idea is beautiful or
elegant in mathematics or physics if you

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:29.670
elegant in mathematics or physics if you
 

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.540
elegant in mathematics or physics if you
know a very simple principle a very

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:32.550
know a very simple principle a very
 

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.570
know a very simple principle a very
simple idea or a simple set of ideas

simple idea or a simple set of ideas
 

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.830
simple idea or a simple set of ideas
turns out to be very powerful and and

evolves so the I mean that's actually

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:17.670
evolves so the I mean that's actually
 

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.620
evolves so the I mean that's actually
the so in classical physics that's

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:21.630
the so in classical physics that's
 

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.750
the so in classical physics that's
actually there that that's a theorem

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760
actually there that that's a theorem
 

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.990
actually there that that's a theorem
called annoy others theorem after a

so so so they're there it's a little bit

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:31.220
so so so they're there it's a little bit
 

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.659
so so so they're there it's a little bit
of a slight lead on trivial theorem and

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:33.669
of a slight lead on trivial theorem and
 

00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:36.310
of a slight lead on trivial theorem and
that's certainly a a beautiful theorem

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320
that's certainly a a beautiful theorem
 

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.890
that's certainly a a beautiful theorem
what what fascinates me more is that in

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:38.900
what what fascinates me more is that in
 

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.260
what what fascinates me more is that in
quantum mechanics

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.270
quantum mechanics
 

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.400

norther standard isn't even a theorem

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:42.410
norther standard isn't even a theorem
 

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.470
norther standard isn't even a theorem
it's just kind of it's just implicit in

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480
it's just kind of it's just implicit in
 

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.680
it's just kind of it's just implicit in
the definition just the way you set

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:47.690
the definition just the way you set
 

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.810
the definition just the way you set
things up it just is automatically true

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:49.820
things up it just is automatically true
 

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.909
things up it just is automatically true
so it's a yeah anyway there there's the

00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919
so it's a yeah anyway there there's the
 

00:28:54.919 --> 00:28:56.950
so it's a yeah anyway there there's the
theorem and a proof in classical physics

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960
theorem and a proof in classical physics
 

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.530
theorem and a proof in classical physics
and then you you start to think about

00:28:59.530 --> 00:28:59.540
and then you you start to think about
 

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.419
and then you you start to think about
quantum mechanics and you think about it

00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:01.429
quantum mechanics and you think about it
 

00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:03.760
quantum mechanics and you think about it
and then it's just kind of automatically

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:03.770
and then it's just kind of automatically
 

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.260
and then it's just kind of automatically
true there's not even a theorem anymore

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:05.270
true there's not even a theorem anymore
 

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:11.220
true there's not even a theorem anymore
and it's a that's just beautiful

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:11.230
 

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.590
well I think I mean any kind of thing

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600
well I think I mean any kind of thing
 

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.260
well I think I mean any kind of thing
that human beings do there's certain

that human beings do there's certain
politics to it and certain academic

but um but mathematics is actually a
 

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.780
but um but mathematics is actually a
relatively healthy field these days I

mean people are you know are are making

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.170
mean people are you know are are making
 

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.630
mean people are you know are are making
making good progress in a lot of

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640
making good progress in a lot of
 

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.450
making good progress in a lot of
different different ways and it's it's

also so so anyway I've kind of lived

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.070
also so so anyway I've kind of lived
 

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.430
also so so anyway I've kind of lived
part of my professional life and

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440
part of my professional life and
 

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.980
part of my professional life and
mathematics and part in physics and and

mathematics and part in physics and and
 

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.350
mathematics and part in physics and and
and one thing to say about mathematics

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360
and one thing to say about mathematics
 

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.960
and one thing to say about mathematics
is it's uh I think it can have its

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:45.970
is it's uh I think it can have its
 

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.960
is it's uh I think it can have its
problems but but it actually hasn't seen

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:48.970
problems but but it actually hasn't seen
 

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:53.310
problems but but it actually hasn't seen
a it hasn't seen a lot of the problems

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320
a it hasn't seen a lot of the problems
 

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.930
a it hasn't seen a lot of the problems
of other sciences and politically partly

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:54.940
of other sciences and politically partly
 

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.560
of other sciences and politically partly
probably also the wonderful thing about

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:58.570
probably also the wonderful thing about
 

00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:59.940
probably also the wonderful thing about
mathematics assistance so much of it

00:29:59.940 --> 00:29:59.950
mathematics assistance so much of it
 

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.170
mathematics assistance so much of it
what people are doing is completely

what people are doing is completely
 

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.320
what people are doing is completely
useless nobody nobody kind of in the

outside world really cares very much you
don't really have you don't have kind of

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:07.690
don't really have you don't have kind of
 

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.260
don't really have you don't have kind of
a right and left and people getting in

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:10.270
a right and left and people getting in

you know kind of ideology coming in

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.740
you know kind of ideology coming in
 

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.900
you know kind of ideology coming in
because there isn't any

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:12.910
because there isn't any
 

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.940

it just doesn't actually connect up to

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:14.950
it just doesn't actually connect up to
 

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.740
it just doesn't actually connect up to
the kinds of things that people who work

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:16.750
the kinds of things that people who work
 

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.060
the kinds of things that people who work
you know worry about ideologically

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:18.070
you know worry about ideologically
 

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:20.520
you know worry about ideologically
worried about so in most of mathematics

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:20.530
worried about so in most of mathematics
 

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.590
worried about so in most of mathematics
it doesn't doesn't tell you I think one

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600
it doesn't doesn't tell you I think one
 

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.270
it doesn't doesn't tell you I think one
way or another about global warming or

way or another about global warming or
about you know health care or about any

about you know health care or about any

other number of things you might care
about so so what's the mathematics is

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:30.460
about so so what's the mathematics is
 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.910
about so so what's the mathematics is
immune to a lot of exterior

real world politics because of that and

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:36.160
real world politics because of that and
 

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.790
real world politics because of that and
the academic Pollak so the manera but um

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:38.800
the academic Pollak so the manera but um
 

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.730

world where if two people disagree about
something if people are studying some

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080
something if people are studying some
 

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.270
something if people are studying some
mathematical object then there's there

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.280
mathematical object then there's there

supposed to be a proof and they disagree
about whether this proof works or not

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:00.870
about whether this proof works or not
 

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.900
about whether this proof works or not
they will you know go into a room sit

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:03.910
they will you know go into a room sit
 

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.750
they will you know go into a room sit
down and talk about it and fairly

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760
down and talk about it and fairly
 

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.920
down and talk about it and fairly
quickly or at the end of the day one of

them will admit they're wrong and he
says you know that's the problem the

all the time and so the people um there

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.110
all the time and so the people um there
 

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.680
all the time and so the people um there
is this notion of logic and proof and

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:19.690
is this notion of logic and proof and

of physics I want to talk about physics

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:35.430
of physics I want to talk about physics
 

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.640
of physics I want to talk about physics
and I talk about them and the problems

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:37.650
and I talk about them and the problems
 

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.710
and I talk about them and the problems
of those subjects it's really a problems

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720
of those subjects it's really a problems
 

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.460
of those subjects it's really a problems
of a very small you know one discipline

of a very small you know one discipline
 

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.800
of a very small you know one discipline

physicists people are kind of happily
going on and doing their science and

going on and doing their science and
 

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.990
going on and doing their science and
quite successfully and it has nothing to

quite successfully and it has nothing to
 

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.580
quite successfully and it has nothing to
do with and they get very very annoyed

do with and they get very very annoyed
 

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.350
do with and they get very very annoyed
when they hear people going on about the

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360
when they hear people going on about the
 

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.660
when they hear people going on about the
problems of string theory as if that's

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:56.670
problems of string theory as if that's
 

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.190
problems of string theory as if that's
some big problem for physics because

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200
some big problem for physics because
 

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.460
some big problem for physics because
it's not their problem string theory and

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:01.470
it's not their problem string theory and
 

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.110
it's not their problem string theory and
particle physics you know it suffers I

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120
particle physics you know it suffers I
 

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.610

think a lot from that from this business

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620
think a lot from that from this business
 

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.220
think a lot from that from this business

from mathematicians point of you in a
 

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.450
from mathematicians point of you in a
very faddish way that everybody all the

very faddish way that everybody all the
smart people the subject the idea was

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:33.900
smart people the subject the idea was
 

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.090
smart people the subject the idea was
was it would all kind of jump at the

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100
was it would all kind of jump at the
 

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.370
was it would all kind of jump at the
same problem and all try and work in the

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380
same problem and all try and work in the
 

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.040
same problem and all try and work in the
same problem very often because the

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.050
same problem very often because the
 

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.530
same problem very often because the
subject was driven by experiment and you

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:42.540
subject was driven by experiment and you
 

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.540
subject was driven by experiment and you
know somebody would go out and turn on a

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:44.550
know somebody would go out and turn on a
 

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.040
know somebody would go out and turn on a
new accelerator like the LHC at higher

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.050
new accelerator like the LHC at higher
 

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.870
new accelerator like the LHC at higher
energy and this is certainly gonna

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880
energy and this is certainly gonna
 

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.280
energy and this is certainly gonna
happen next year if the LHC you see

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.290
happen next year if the LHC you see
 

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.200

something unexpected everyone in the

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.210
something unexpected everyone in the
 

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.460
something unexpected everyone in the
whole field is going to be trying to

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:52.470
whole field is going to be trying to
 

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.270
whole field is going to be trying to
explain that one thing and so you have a

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:56.280
explain that one thing and so you have a
 

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.640
explain that one thing and so you have a
very kind of a little bit of kind of

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:58.650
very kind of a little bit of kind of
 

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:00.980
very kind of a little bit of kind of
fascist sociology that everybody is

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:00.990
fascist sociology that everybody is
 

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.020
fascist sociology that everybody is
trying to do do the same thing at the

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.030
trying to do do the same thing at the
 

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.790
trying to do do the same thing at the
same time or as in other fields like

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:04.800
same time or as in other fields like
 

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.860
same time or as in other fields like
mathematics people kind of spread out

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:06.870
mathematics people kind of spread out
 

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.600
mathematics people kind of spread out
and develop extra their expertise and

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:08.610
and develop extra their expertise and
 

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:12.590
and develop extra their expertise and
work on different things so part of the

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600
work on different things so part of the
 

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.630
work on different things so part of the
problem of the the politics of particle

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640
problem of the the politics of particle
 

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.380
problem of the the politics of particle
theory and has been that you have people

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.390
theory and has been that you have people
 

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:20.300
theory and has been that you have people
used to the idea that well you should

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:20.310
used to the idea that well you should
 

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.010
used to the idea that well you should
look around and see what these smart

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:22.020
look around and see what these smart
 

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.330
look around and see what these smart
people are working on and I should work

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340
people are working on and I should work
 

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.460
people are working on and I should work
on the same thing as them and so you've

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:25.470
on the same thing as them and so you've
 

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.920
on the same thing as them and so you've
got you know all these people kind of

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:26.930
got you know all these people kind of
 

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.870
got you know all these people kind of
trying to do this and so string theory

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880
trying to do this and so string theory
 

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.300
trying to do this and so string theory
then got identified back in 84 as being

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:32.310
then got identified back in 84 as being
 

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.970
then got identified back in 84 as being
the hot topic and for a lot of reasons

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980
the hot topic and for a lot of reasons
 

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.460
the hot topic and for a lot of reasons
partly and probably because it was an

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:37.470
partly and probably because it was an
 

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.510
partly and probably because it was an
intriguing idea but

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:38.520
intriguing idea but
 

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.180
intriguing idea but
but partly also because one of the

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.190
but partly also because one of the
 

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.230
but partly also because one of the
there's one of the great geniuses of our

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240
there's one of the great geniuses of our
 

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.670
there's one of the great geniuses of our
subject that Edward Witten who's a steel

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:45.680
subject that Edward Witten who's a steel
 

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.750
subject that Edward Witten who's a steel
fantastic genius has done these amazing

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760
fantastic genius has done these amazing
 

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.460
fantastic genius has done these amazing
things and you know he got very

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:49.470
things and you know he got very
 

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.460
things and you know he got very
interested in it and he started

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:51.470
interested in it and he started
 

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.570
interested in it and he started
promoting idea that this is a very

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580
promoting idea that this is a very
 

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.940
promoting idea that this is a very
promising idea and so everyone kind of

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:55.950
promising idea and so everyone kind of
 

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:01.100
promising idea and so everyone kind of
jumped jumped on it and and and my

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.110
jumped jumped on it and and and my
 

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:03.050
jumped jumped on it and and and my
initial reaction at that time that was I

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:03.060
initial reaction at that time that was I
 

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.190
initial reaction at that time that was I
was just getting out of graduate school

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200
was just getting out of graduate school
 

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.570
was just getting out of graduate school
at that time and you know partly the way

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580
at that time and you know partly the way
 

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.370
at that time and you know partly the way
I work the way I think III wasn't so

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:10.380
I work the way I think III wasn't so
 

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.630
I work the way I think III wasn't so
interesting idea of try and do it same

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:11.640
interesting idea of try and do it same
 

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.070
interesting idea of try and do it same
thing as everybody else I would prefer

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080
thing as everybody else I would prefer
 

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.200
thing as everybody else I would prefer
to work on something a bit different and

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.210
to work on something a bit different and
 

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:19.430
to work on something a bit different and
partly also Minh say me that you know it

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440
partly also Minh say me that you know it
 

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.630
partly also Minh say me that you know it
wasn't that this was obviously a good

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:20.640
wasn't that this was obviously a good
 

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.520
wasn't that this was obviously a good
idea it might be a good idea might not

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:22.530
idea it might be a good idea might not
 

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.810
idea it might be a good idea might not
but but there were obvious problems with

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820
but but there were obvious problems with
 

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.830
but but there were obvious problems with
it from the beginning and so anyway so

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:27.840
it from the beginning and so anyway so
 

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.510
it from the beginning and so anyway so
starting any idea before everybody

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520
starting any idea before everybody
 

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.880
starting any idea before everybody
started working on this and I think my

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:31.890
started working on this and I think my
 

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.130
started working on this and I think my
reaction to it was well you know that's

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:34.140
reaction to it was well you know that's
 

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.899
reaction to it was well you know that's
great that they're doing this and what's

00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:35.909
great that they're doing this and what's
 

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.070
great that they're doing this and what's
going to happen is what normally happens

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080
going to happen is what normally happens
 

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.530
going to happen is what normally happens
in the subject is that after six months

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540
in the subject is that after six months
 

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.720
in the subject is that after six months
or a year or two years people will see

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:41.730
or a year or two years people will see
 

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.450
or a year or two years people will see
whether it's a good idea or not and you

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460
whether it's a good idea or not and you
 

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.889
whether it's a good idea or not and you
know you and if it's not a good idea

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899
know you and if it's not a good idea
 

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:49.540
know you and if it's not a good idea
they'll move on and the really peculiar

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:49.550
they'll move on and the really peculiar
 

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.830
they'll move on and the really peculiar
thing that happened here was that you

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:51.840
thing that happened here was that you
 

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.790
thing that happened here was that you
know 25 years later this is still

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800
know 25 years later this is still
 

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.810
know 25 years later this is still
there's still a lot of people doing this

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820
there's still a lot of people doing this
 

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.850
there's still a lot of people doing this
I mean it really kind of caught fire and

00:34:58.850 --> 00:34:58.860
I mean it really kind of caught fire and
 

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.150
I mean it really kind of caught fire and
even without succeeding it still kind of

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160
even without succeeding it still kind of
 

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.570
even without succeeding it still kind of
developed into this whole into this huge

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580
developed into this whole into this huge
 

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.940
developed into this whole into this huge
subject and it kind of in some sense

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:07.950
subject and it kind of in some sense
 

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.200
subject and it kind of in some sense
kind of achieved some kind of critical

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.210
kind of achieved some kind of critical
 

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.580
kind of achieved some kind of critical
mass and more and more people were

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:10.590
mass and more and more people were
 

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.500
mass and more and more people were
working on it and working on it for so

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:12.510
working on it and working on it for so
 

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.750
working on it and working on it for so
long that people ended up kind of

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760
long that people ended up kind of
 

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.130
long that people ended up kind of
devoting their careers to it and did

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140
devoting their careers to it and did
 

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.900
devoting their careers to it and did
it's a very very difficult and a very

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:17.910
it's a very very difficult and a very
 

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.530
it's a very very difficult and a very
complicated subject and it it requires

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540
complicated subject and it it requires
 

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.470
complicated subject and it it requires
quite a lot of time just to even get to

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480
quite a lot of time just to even get to
 

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.520
quite a lot of time just to even get to
the point of understanding what's going

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:25.530
the point of understanding what's going
 

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.040
the point of understanding what's going
on so you had lots of more and more

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.050
on so you had lots of more and more
 

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.620
on so you had lots of more and more
people working on this investing more

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:30.630
people working on this investing more
 

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.720
people working on this investing more
and more of their time and their careers

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:32.730
and more of their time and their careers
 

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.050
and more of their time and their careers
and their lives into it and and I think

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060
and their lives into it and and I think
 

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.340
and their lives into it and and I think
it really got to the enforcement point

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:37.350
it really got to the enforcement point
 

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.890
it really got to the enforcement point
that people were kind of unwilling to

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:38.900
that people were kind of unwilling to
 

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.820
that people were kind of unwilling to
the kind of admit that this wasn't

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:40.830
the kind of admit that this wasn't
 

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.370
the kind of admit that this wasn't
working and it's a natural human

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380
working and it's a natural human
 

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.680
working and it's a natural human
reaction to an idea of you're fond of

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:45.690
reaction to an idea of you're fond of
 

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.720
reaction to an idea of you're fond of
you put a lot into it it's kind of hard

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:47.730
you put a lot into it it's kind of hard
 

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.970
you put a lot into it it's kind of hard
to get to to get you to admit often well

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980
to get to to get you to admit often well
 

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.490
to get to to get you to admit often well
maybe this is

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:50.500
maybe this is
 

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.560
maybe this is
work and and then this was kind of

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:52.570
work and and then this was kind of
 

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.720
work and and then this was kind of
happening very much in spades in this

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:54.730
happening very much in spades in this
 

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.980
happening very much in spades in this
story I think it's been very hard to get

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:55.990
story I think it's been very hard to get
 

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.720
story I think it's been very hard to get
people to name it admit that this this

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:57.730
people to name it admit that this this
 

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:05.470
people to name it admit that this this
is something it hasn't worked out

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480
 

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.720
so there's actually kind of two there

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:07.730
so there's actually kind of two there
 

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.740
so there's actually kind of two there
maybe I could kind of two things that

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:08.750
maybe I could kind of two things that
 

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.240
maybe I could kind of two things that
one is the blog I also have wrote this

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.250
one is the blog I also have wrote this
 

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.140
one is the blog I also have wrote this
book and so the anyway for firm for many

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:14.150
book and so the anyway for firm for many
 

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.809
book and so the anyway for firm for many
years I was I wasn't very happy with

00:36:16.809 --> 00:36:16.819
years I was I wasn't very happy with
 

00:36:16.819 --> 00:36:18.099
years I was I wasn't very happy with
what was going on there and I was kind

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:18.109
what was going on there and I was kind
 

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:19.900
what was going on there and I was kind
of observing it okay this is becoming

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:19.910
of observing it okay this is becoming
 

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.410
of observing it okay this is becoming
more and more problematic there's this

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:22.420
more and more problematic there's this
 

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.940
more and more problematic there's this
you know not only are people kind of not

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:24.950
you know not only are people kind of not
 

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:26.230
you know not only are people kind of not
admitting that this isn't working out

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240
admitting that this isn't working out
 

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.410
admitting that this isn't working out
but you know there's there's this whole

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:28.420
but you know there's there's this whole
 

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.280
but you know there's there's this whole
that you know there's a lot of kind of

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:30.290
that you know there's a lot of kind of
 

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.410
that you know there's a lot of kind of
public promotion of the subject and and

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:32.420
public promotion of the subject and and
 

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.760
public promotion of the subject and and
it's a very difficult complicated

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:33.770
it's a very difficult complicated
 

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.380
it's a very difficult complicated
subject a lot of people don't don't

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:35.390
subject a lot of people don't don't
 

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.500
subject a lot of people don't don't
understand it and so it's this is really

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:38.510
understand it and so it's this is really
 

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.970
understand it and so it's this is really
not a healthy situations that someone

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:39.980
not a healthy situations that someone
 

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.620
not a healthy situations that someone
should kind of you know could have

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:41.630
should kind of you know could have
 

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.920
should kind of you know could have
clearly explained to larger community of

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:44.930
clearly explained to larger community of
 

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.990
clearly explained to larger community of
physicists and also to non physicists

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000
physicists and also to non physicists
 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.819
physicists and also to non physicists
exactly what the situation is here and

00:36:48.819 --> 00:36:48.829
exactly what the situation is here and
 

00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:51.370
exactly what the situation is here and
and so I wrote an article about this and

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.380
and so I wrote an article about this and
 

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.180
and so I wrote an article about this and
then I finally wrote this book and it

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.190
then I finally wrote this book and it
 

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.170
then I finally wrote this book and it
took a while to get the book published

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.180
took a while to get the book published
 

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.150
took a while to get the book published
that's a long and interesting story but

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160
that's a long and interesting story but
 

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.690
that's a long and interesting story but
but then while after I guess since after

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:01.700
but then while after I guess since after
 

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.609
but then while after I guess since after
after the book was written I also

00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:03.619
after the book was written I also
 

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:05.349
after the book was written I also
started it's hard to see there are a

00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359
started it's hard to see there are a
 

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.579
started it's hard to see there are a
couple other physicists what started

00:37:06.579 --> 00:37:06.589
couple other physicists what started
 

00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:07.990
couple other physicists what started
blogs and I thought well this isn't

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000
blogs and I thought well this isn't
 

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.880
blogs and I thought well this isn't
interesting interesting thing to try to

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:09.890
interesting interesting thing to try to
 

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.730
interesting interesting thing to try to
do and I can both talk about you know

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:12.740
do and I can both talk about you know
 

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.990
do and I can both talk about you know
these issues related to string theory

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000
these issues related to string theory
 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.270
these issues related to string theory
and things which I was trying to get out

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280
and things which I was trying to get out
 

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.740
and things which I was trying to get out
through the book but also kind of follow

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:17.750
through the book but also kind of follow
 

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.559
through the book but also kind of follow
it in a day to day basis and also just

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:20.569
it in a day to day basis and also just
 

00:37:20.569 --> 00:37:21.460
it in a day to day basis and also just
kind of write about whatever I'm

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:21.470
kind of write about whatever I'm
 

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.910
kind of write about whatever I'm
interested in so the the blog I I guess

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920
interested in so the the blog I I guess
 

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.030
interested in so the the blog I I guess
I don't worry a lot about who about the

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040
I don't worry a lot about who about the
 

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.799
I don't worry a lot about who about the
about the audience for it it's kind of

00:37:29.799 --> 00:37:29.809
about the audience for it it's kind of
 

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:31.690
about the audience for it it's kind of
written because I realized it's very

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:31.700
written because I realized it's very
 

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.140
written because I realized it's very
much just really just kind of whatever

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.150
much just really just kind of whatever
 

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.250
much just really just kind of whatever
whatever I would like to read so I'm

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:36.260
whatever I would like to read so I'm
 

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.390
whatever I would like to read so I'm
gonna read I'm kind of writing whatever

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400
gonna read I'm kind of writing whatever
 

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.559
gonna read I'm kind of writing whatever
I would like to read stuff this so if

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:38.569
I would like to read stuff this so if
 

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:40.450
I would like to read stuff this so if
there's somebody out there exactly like

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:40.460
there's somebody out there exactly like
 

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.470
there's somebody out there exactly like
me they much find this really

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480
me they much find this really
 

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.150
me they much find this really
fascinating and if there's something

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160
fascinating and if there's something
 

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.650
fascinating and if there's something
quite different they find it not at all

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:44.660
quite different they find it not at all
 

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.599
quite different they find it not at all
interesting and so but because of that

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:46.609
interesting and so but because of that
 

00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:49.180
interesting and so but because of that
it's some the kinds of things in the

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.190
it's some the kinds of things in the
 

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.920
it's some the kinds of things in the
blog are often you know if I if I learn

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:50.930
blog are often you know if I if I learn
 

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.089
blog are often you know if I if I learn
something or something new interesting

00:37:52.089 --> 00:37:52.099
something or something new interesting
 

00:37:52.099 --> 00:37:53.200
something or something new interesting
going on and even in pure mathematics

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:53.210
going on and even in pure mathematics
 

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.450
going on and even in pure mathematics
I'll be writing about that or pretty

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:55.460
I'll be writing about that or pretty
 

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.470
I'll be writing about that or pretty
much anything going on in between

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480
much anything going on in between
 

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.640
much anything going on in between
mathematics and physics

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:57.650
mathematics and physics
 

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.500
mathematics and physics
I'll be writing about that writing a lot

00:37:59.500 --> 00:37:59.510
I'll be writing about that writing a lot
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:04.299
I'll be writing about that writing a lot
about the LHC and but and also just

00:38:04.299 --> 00:38:04.309
about the LHC and but and also just
 

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:05.410
about the LHC and but and also just
about whatever is going on in this

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:05.420
about whatever is going on in this
 

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.089
about whatever is going on in this
controversy over string theory and it um

00:38:07.089 --> 00:38:07.099
controversy over string theory and it um
 

00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:13.480
controversy over string theory and it um
it's kind of memorial that this my book

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:13.490
it's kind of memorial that this my book
 

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.650
it's kind of memorial that this my book
came out and there was at the same time

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:14.660
came out and there was at the same time
 

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.260
came out and there was at the same time
there's a book by another physicist with

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:17.270
there's a book by another physicist with
 

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.600
there's a book by another physicist with
a similar point of view to mind

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:18.610
a similar point of view to mind
 

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.610
a similar point of view to mind
came out so that that caused a lot of

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:20.620
came out so that that caused a lot of
 

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.140
came out so that that caused a lot of
controversies with a lot of reviews and

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.150
controversies with a lot of reviews and
 

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.510
controversies with a lot of reviews and
a lot of argument going on on these

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520
a lot of argument going on on these
 

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.700
a lot of argument going on on these
blogs and a lot of people refer to this

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:26.710
blogs and a lot of people refer to this
 

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.890
blogs and a lot of people refer to this
as the string Wars and so the there's

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:28.900
as the string Wars and so the there's
 

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.430
as the string Wars and so the there's
this free for for a year or two there

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.440
this free for for a year or two there
 

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.370
this free for for a year or two there
there was a kind of a very interesting

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:35.380
there was a kind of a very interesting
 

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.630
there was a kind of a very interesting
if you're interesting this kind of thing

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640
if you're interesting this kind of thing
 

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.160
if you're interesting this kind of thing
there's an interesting warfare in terms

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.170
there's an interesting warfare in terms
 

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.020
there's an interesting warfare in terms
of blog postings and comments going on

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.030
of blog postings and comments going on
 

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.480
of blog postings and comments going on
on my site and various others and that

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:42.490
on my site and various others and that
 

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.610
on my site and various others and that
was a ultra little that would lead to

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:44.620
was a ultra little that would lead to
 

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.710
was a ultra little that would lead to
all sorts of strange things

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720
 

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.180
some I don't mean III often learn you

that that's very interesting in order
 

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.290
that that's very interesting in order
all they'll often send it to me

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300
all they'll often send it to me
 

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.569

you might be interested in this and so I

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200
you might be interested in this and so I
 

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.690
you might be interested in this and so I
get a lot of that and learn a lot that

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700
get a lot of that and learn a lot that
 

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.349

way

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359
way
 

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:15.500
way
oh one interesting I thought amusing

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:15.510
oh one interesting I thought amusing
 

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.880
oh one interesting I thought amusing
like the whole string theory thing

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:16.890
like the whole string theory thing
 

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:21.620
like the whole string theory thing
discussion was that it's a it really is

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:21.630
discussion was that it's a it really is
 

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.319
discussion was that it's a it really is
it's an incredibly complex and difficult

00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:24.329
it's an incredibly complex and difficult
 

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:28.700
it's an incredibly complex and difficult
subject and so it's really hard to

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:28.710
subject and so it's really hard to
 

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.880
subject and so it's really hard to
overemphasize how it's a something that

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:31.890
overemphasize how it's a something that
 

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:33.710
overemphasize how it's a something that
really nobody understands very well and

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720
really nobody understands very well and
 

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.210
really nobody understands very well and
even the people who are the most experts

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220
even the people who are the most experts
 

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.329
even the people who are the most experts
at it are you know and it's amazing

00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339
at it are you know and it's amazing
 

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:39.890
at it are you know and it's amazing
experience of having a conversation with

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900
experience of having a conversation with
 

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.690
experience of having a conversation with
some Nobel Prize winners who people are

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700
some Nobel Prize winners who people are
 

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.490
some Nobel Prize winners who people are
thought of as the the brightest people

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500
thought of as the the brightest people
 

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.870
thought of as the the brightest people
this field and asking them what they

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880
this field and asking them what they
 

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.099
this field and asking them what they
think in string theory and they'll say

00:39:46.099 --> 00:39:46.109
think in string theory and they'll say
 

00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:47.660
think in string theory and they'll say
no I don't know I don't really

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:47.670
no I don't know I don't really
 

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.220
no I don't know I don't really
understand what's going on I want to

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.230
understand what's going on I want to
 

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.530
understand what's going on I want to
comment on it and it's just I'm baffled

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540
comment on it and it's just I'm baffled
 

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.319
comment on it and it's just I'm baffled
by it so one interesting thing about the

00:39:54.319 --> 00:39:54.329
by it so one interesting thing about the
 

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:56.180
by it so one interesting thing about the
some of these discussions in the blog

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:56.190
some of these discussions in the blog
 

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.750
some of these discussions in the blog
was I found one way to figure out

00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760
was I found one way to figure out
 

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.510
was I found one way to figure out
exactly what's going on in in string

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520
exactly what's going on in in string
 

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.339
exactly what's going on in in string
theory and whether you know something is

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:04.349
theory and whether you know something is
 

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:06.980
theory and whether you know something is
really a problem or or not is to just

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:06.990
really a problem or or not is to just
 

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.829
really a problem or or not is to just
put up my understanding of it you know

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839
put up my understanding of it you know
 

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:11.210
put up my understanding of it you know
in a blog post here in the comment or

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220
in a blog post here in the comment or
 

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.880
in a blog post here in the comment or
whatever and then fairly quickly you

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
whatever and then fairly quickly you
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.349
whatever and then fairly quickly you
would find that either you know either I

00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359
would find that either you know either I
 

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:16.400
would find that either you know either I
was wrong and there there was some

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:16.410
was wrong and there there was some
 

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.380
was wrong and there there was some
reason that this actually made sense

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.390
reason that this actually made sense
 

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.300
reason that this actually made sense
even though I thought it didn't and this

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:20.310
even though I thought it didn't and this
 

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.220
even though I thought it didn't and this
would I would I would quickly often

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:22.230
would I would I would quickly often
 

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.720
would I would I would quickly often
abusively he explained me what an idiot

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:23.730
abusively he explained me what an idiot
 

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.089
abusively he explained me what an idiot
I was and why this was you know here's

00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099
I was and why this was you know here's
 

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:27.470
I was and why this was you know here's
the here's the answer what you really

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480
the here's the answer what you really
 

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.740
the here's the answer what you really
should have known or and then then I

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:30.750
should have known or and then then I
 

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.120
should have known or and then then I
found out that okay I learned something

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.130
found out that okay I learned something
 

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.280
found out that okay I learned something
or or or often I would found out that if

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.290
or or or often I would found out that if
 

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.599
or or or often I would found out that if
I was right if there really was a

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:35.609
I was right if there really was a
 

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:37.339
I was right if there really was a
problem here the answer I would get

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:37.349
problem here the answer I would get
 

00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:39.440
problem here the answer I would get
would often be just this abuse of oh you
