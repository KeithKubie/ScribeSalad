One final bit on camera access. Of course on a

00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:07.338
mobile device, that typically has a front-facing and a rear-facing camera,

00:00:07.338 --> 00:00:09.942
you're going to want to select which camera to use

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:12.130
or let the user select it. There's a way to do

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.380
this with get user media using the MediaStreamTrack getSources api.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.090
This api will return a list of IDs that you can

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.980
then pass into get user media. And that let's you choose

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070
which camera to use. As you can tell on my phone,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.550
I have two cameras to choose from.
