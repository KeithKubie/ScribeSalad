00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.739
Two women just graduated from Army Ranger
school, starting the all-too-familiar debate

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.240
of women in combat.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.080
After more than 10 years of war, with women
participating alongside: is there any science

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:20.290
that says they shouldn't be all that they
can be?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.231
When First Lt. Shaye Haver and Capt. Kristen
Griest passed the nine-week training program

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:29.320
to become Army Rangers, they made history,
but they also made the news.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.480
Ranger School is the Army's most rigorous
training program.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.399
36 percent of attendees fail in the first
four days, and only 42 percent will finally

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.039
walk away with the black-and-gold Ranger tab.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.430
But even though these women passed all the
tests, they still may not see combat.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.440
In January of 2013, then-Sec of Defense Leon
Panetta announced the end of male-only combat,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.350
requiring women be allowed to serve in combat
roles by January 2016.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.039
Many argue that women aren't ready for frontline
combat, or simply cannot manage the hell that

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.590
is war, and as the equality train hits the
voting booth, the bedroom, the workplace,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.820
and onward: the theater of war is yet another
stop.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.219
After Panetta's order, the armed forces began
conducting studies and assessing standards

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.079
to see if sex integration will be the future
of our military.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.170
Women have been part of fighting forces for
decades in Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers, Ireland's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.880
IRA, and soldiering in Sierra Leone.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.500
But now, the U.S. has to determine if they
can open the remaining 220,000 men-only jobs

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.920
to women too.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.479
According to military data, three things are
important for combat readiness: mental health,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.420
physical capability, and proper training.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.170
A National Center for PTSD study in 2011,
found men and women developed mental health

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.539
issues equally after "combat, firing a weapon
in combat, being fired upon, handling human

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.900
remains and witnessing injury and death,"
but men were more likely to fall into substance

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
abuse.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.219
Those findings were supported by another study
in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.509
But a 2006 study of women and men in combat,
found emotional responses were different,

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.120
and quote "in stressful situations, men are
more likely to resort to physically aggressive

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.550
responses than women," and according to a
piece in TIME by Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.680
Mark Thompson, "aggression leads to more accidents
and injuries in men" It would seem, mentally,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.420
women can hack it as well as men, and may
handle some things better, as they don't abuse

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.940
substances, become aggressive, or injure themselves
due to stress.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.661
Physically, though, women have less upper
body strength than men overall; according

00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:35.610
to a 2004 U.S. Army study.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
Women do have smaller hearts, skeletons and
muscle mass, and a greater percentage of body

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.720
fat relative to their male colleagues; which
ups the injury rate significantly.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.700
Injuries are anything that takes a servicemember
out of combat.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.630
Pregnancy adds to women's injury stats, but
even if you remove it from the data -- women

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.080
are hospitalized at 30 percent higher rates
than men.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.840
According to data from the Pentagon, men are
hospitalized for general injuries, poisonings,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.450
and disorders of the muscles, skin, or "connective
tissues," while women are hospitalized for

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.760
genital and urinary disorders, mental disorder,
and tumors.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.950
With this data in mind, the military is working
to design gender-neutral training programs

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.870
and understand injuries.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.290
Even though women, on average, have less strength,
not all women are weaker or prone to injury.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.170
Some females are stronger than males, and
they deserve an equal chance at a combat position.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.370
That is echoed by Army General Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.400
According to every statement I read, military
requirements will not be eroded, lowered,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.160
lightened or lessened in any way on the road
to gender neutrality in combat.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.190
Instead, they'll make it "about science and
observation" and ensure people can perform

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.510
needed duties.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.640
If so, they get the job.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.640
Period.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.580
According to a 1980 paper assessing women
in combat by Major Thomas H. Cecil, people

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.650
should be "allowed to serve in whatever role
that could use best the talent and capability

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.430
each individual has."

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.570
After racial integration and the repeal of
"Don't Ask; Don't Tell," the military is disrupted

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.820
at first, but they gets over it as long as
people are perceived fairly and equally in

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.170
training and practice.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.570
There is no evidence males break down when
females are killed or injured in battle, or

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.290
are distracted by their fellow female warriors.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.380
As long as the training is equal, our armed
forces are trained to protect each other regardless

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.090
of which chromosomes we possess.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.340
Of course, there will be sex between members
of the military, but that is not new at ALL.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.920
GIs in every war we've ever engaged in found
girls abroad, and that tradition continues

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.510
with these women too, but the fear comes from
societal stereotypes about female sexuality,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.860
not fact.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.230
In the end, they are servicemembers first
and women second.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.870
Caliber and ability are the currencies of
our armed forces.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.980
As serving females are trained equally and
prove they can do anything fellow males can

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.300
do; they will earn the same benefit: to serve
their country as a volunteer in America's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.350
armed forces.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.800
If you want to show your support from home,
start a website and showcase your support

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.520
your favorite female servicemember.
