00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.130
rinderpest now perhaps it is time to
 

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:08.310
rinderpest now perhaps it is time to
conclude but I would like to say that

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:08.320
conclude but I would like to say that
 

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.500

IAEA was established in 1957 at that

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:14.510
IAEA was established in 1957 at that
 

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:19.500
IAEA was established in 1957 at that
time perhaps the countries that were

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:19.510
time perhaps the countries that were
 

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.050
time perhaps the countries that were
suspected of developing nuclear weapons

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:22.060
suspected of developing nuclear weapons
 

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:28.690
suspected of developing nuclear weapons
were not the countries like a BLK or it

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:28.700
were not the countries like a BLK or it
 

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.020
were not the countries like a BLK or it
will not Iran that have the

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.030
will not Iran that have the
 

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.410
will not Iran that have the
proliferation problems but now it is

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:35.420
proliferation problems but now it is
 

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.550
proliferation problems but now it is
these countries that have problems

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560
these countries that have problems
 

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.290
these countries that have problems
nuclear terrorism was not an issue

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:41.300
nuclear terrorism was not an issue
 

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.900
nuclear terrorism was not an issue
perhaps 50 years ago but now it is top

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:46.910
perhaps 50 years ago but now it is top
 

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:51.480
perhaps 50 years ago but now it is top

they are the most important issues in
 

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:12.520
they are the most important issues in
the world today so as the director

address these issues both the prevention
of proliferation of nuclear weapons and

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.390
of proliferation of nuclear weapons and
 

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.660

peaceful use of nuclear techniques in

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:28.670
peaceful use of nuclear techniques in
 

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:32.400
peaceful use of nuclear techniques in
the context of 21st century and I think

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.410
the context of 21st century and I think
 

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:36.220

could provide small devices possibly

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140
could provide small devices possibly
 

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.650
could provide small devices possibly
handheld devices to detect threats of

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.660
handheld devices to detect threats of
 

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.630
handheld devices to detect threats of
terrorism at major events such as the

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640
terrorism at major events such as the
 

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.000
terrorism at major events such as the
London Olympics and stuff what do you

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.010
London Olympics and stuff what do you
 

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.070
London Olympics and stuff what do you
think is the biggest threat to security

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.080
think is the biggest threat to security
 

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.010
think is the biggest threat to security
today is it small-scale terrorism at for

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020
today is it small-scale terrorism at for
 

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.720
today is it small-scale terrorism at for
instance the London Olympics as a major

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:23.730
instance the London Olympics as a major
 

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.630
instance the London Olympics as a major
event or is it large-scale bomb building

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640
event or is it large-scale bomb building
 

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.420
event or is it large-scale bomb building
by countries like Iran and North Korea

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:31.430
 
 

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:35.450
 
we have not detected large amount of

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460
we have not detected large amount of
 

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.850
we have not detected large amount of
nuclear material but we have from

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:39.860
nuclear material but we have from
 

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.680
nuclear material but we have from
detected or we have on the report of

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:42.690
detected or we have on the report of
 

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:46.700
detected or we have on the report of
having detected or the highly enriched

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:46.710
having detected or the highly enriched
 

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.690

uranium on some the highly enriched
 

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.950
uranium on some the highly enriched
uranium was very well packed so we

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960
uranium was very well packed so we
 

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.300
uranium was very well packed so we
suspect that this is some a part of the

00:44:59.300 --> 00:44:59.310
suspect that this is some a part of the
 

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:04.480
suspect that this is some a part of the
bigger amount we do not know how much

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:04.490
bigger amount we do not know how much
 

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.940
bigger amount we do not know how much
amount is circulating in the black

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:07.950
amount is circulating in the black
 

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.200
amount is circulating in the black
market how capable theorists are to

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.210
market how capable theorists are to
 

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.870
market how capable theorists are to
develop nuclear weapons but if they have

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880
develop nuclear weapons but if they have
 

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.480
develop nuclear weapons but if they have
this such material fall into the hands

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:20.490
this such material fall into the hands
 

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:25.190
this such material fall into the hands
of our theories it is easy to make a

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200
of our theories it is easy to make a
 

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.849
of our theories it is easy to make a
dirty bomb for example dirty bomb means

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859
dirty bomb for example dirty bomb means
 

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:35.170
dirty bomb for example dirty bomb means
an a-bomb that do not explode by the

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:35.180
an a-bomb that do not explode by the
 

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.099
an a-bomb that do not explode by the
fusion or fission but by chemical

00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:39.109
fusion or fission but by chemical
 

00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:44.390
fusion or fission but by chemical
chemical function and some if dirty bomb

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400
chemical function and some if dirty bomb
 

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.690
chemical function and some if dirty bomb
is used in cities like in New York that

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700
is used in cities like in New York that
 

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:52.370
is used in cities like in New York that
will cause a huge panic and the effect

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380
will cause a huge panic and the effect
 

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:56.700
will cause a huge panic and the effect
will be beyond imagination

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:56.710
will be beyond imagination
 

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.420
will be beyond imagination
and we cannot identify the size of bombs

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:00.430
and we cannot identify the size of bombs
 

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.050
and we cannot identify the size of bombs
but we can tell that terrorists can use

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.060
but we can tell that terrorists can use
 

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.530
but we can tell that terrorists can use
nuclear material and if they do the

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:07.540
nuclear material and if they do the
 

00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:11.550
nuclear material and if they do the
consequences will be enormous hey other

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:11.560
consequences will be enormous hey other
 

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.540
consequences will be enormous hey other
questions anybody would like to raise

time for maybe three or four depending

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:23.500
time for maybe three or four depending
 

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.500
time for maybe three or four depending
on how long the questions and answers

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:25.510
on how long the questions and answers

is a more stable scenario to have no to
 

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.030
is a more stable scenario to have no to
ask all the other countries in the end

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040
ask all the other countries in the end
 

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.240
ask all the other countries in the end
to get rid of the nuclear weapons or to

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.250
to get rid of the nuclear weapons or to
 

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.670
to get rid of the nuclear weapons or to
have a few number of countries of local

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680
have a few number of countries of local

simple the nuclear weapons are should be

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:50.020
simple the nuclear weapons are should be
 

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.910
simple the nuclear weapons are should be
eliminated and we need to achieve the

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920
eliminated and we need to achieve the
 

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.599
eliminated and we need to achieve the
world free from nuclear weapons the IAEA

verification I talked about

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:11.650
verification I talked about
 

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.880
verification I talked about
non-proliferation because even though

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:14.890
non-proliferation because even though
 

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.070
non-proliferation because even though
nuclear weapon States eliminate their

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:17.080
nuclear weapon States eliminate their
 

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.000
nuclear weapon States eliminate their
weapons suppose them non-nuclear weapon

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.010
weapons suppose them non-nuclear weapon
 

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.430
weapons suppose them non-nuclear weapon
States develop are there are weapons it

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440
States develop are there are weapons it
 

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.230
States develop are there are weapons it
is not am right free from nuclear

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240
is not am right free from nuclear
 

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.320
is not am right free from nuclear
weapons nowadays even terrorists can

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:28.330
weapons nowadays even terrorists can
 

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.859
weapons nowadays even terrorists can
develop nuclear weapons so our fight

00:47:30.859 --> 00:47:30.869
develop nuclear weapons so our fight
 

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:34.890
develop nuclear weapons so our fight
against nuclear security against

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:34.900
against nuclear security against
 

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.750
