JANNA LEVIN: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.049
It's really great
to be here Google.

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm always curious as
to what Google is up to.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.040
So maybe I get to ask you
guys questions after the talk.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.750
It's about this detection
that I want to talk today.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.120
I don't know if people heard,
on February 11th, 2016, just

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.740
this year, there was
an announcement made

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.900
about an otherwise very
obscure experiment nobody

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.340
had heard of before.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.410
And suddenly, it was on the
cover of all the newspapers

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.300
internationally.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.500
It was reported everywhere,
radio and television,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.720
that this obscure
experiment had announced

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.360
the discovery of the century,
the first human-procured

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.550
recordings of
gravitational waves.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.940
Did you hear this?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.807
And gravitational waves
were cited as ripples

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:00.890
in the shape of spacetime.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.830
That's what everyone
always says.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.579
They're ripples in the
shape of spacetime.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.290
They're literally a squeezing
and stretching of space.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.420
The recording that
was captured was

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.640
of the collision of
two black holes that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.270
rang the space and
time around them,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.070
like mallets on a drum
ringing the drum of spacetime.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.490
Those waves in
the shape of space

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.144
emanated out, traveling
at the speed of light,

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:23.560
although they are
not light, which

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.393
I think is a very
important distinction I'll

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:26.640
try to emphasize.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
And they took a 1.3-billion-year
journey before sloshing over

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.350
the Earth and striking
this experiment.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.371
Did you hear the
gravitational waves?

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:35.870
OK.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.996
We're going to listen
to them anyway.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:37.662
[RUMBLING SOUND]

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:39.560
Ooh, that's loud.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.970
[SQUELCHING SOUND]

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.540
Loud was good.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.372
[RUMBLING SOUND]

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.660
[SQUELCHING SOUND]

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.132
So that sound was not so loud.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.590
They were actually listening
to the detector in the control

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.110
room when this struck, and
it was too quiet to hear.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.690
It would actually probably
have been loud enough

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.090
to hear by the human
ear through the speaker

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.949
system in the control room.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:14.160
But it happened so fast that the
operators in the control room

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.240
couldn't have parsed it, really.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.420
It happened too fast.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.000
But I want to discuss why we're
talking about this as sound,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.500
really.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.930
That's the part I
want to emphasize.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.160
I know people have heard this.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.326
They've heard the recording.

00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:27.140
They saw the discovery
in the papers.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.910
But I think that people are
still quite unsure what it all

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.400
means, why it's a sound,
why it isn't a picture,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.670
and what this discovery means.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.480
So that's kind of what I
want to pick apart today

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.620
before we do the Q and A.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.650
Here is the universe,
sort of, as we know it.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400
This is from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.650
Every object in this
survey has been observed.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.230
This is not a cartoon.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.730
These are real observations.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.380
Those objects are all galaxies.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.760
So each galaxy has 100
billion stars or more.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.620
And there are a hundred
billion galaxies

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.060
in the observable universe,
as many galaxies as there

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.860
are stars in the Milky Way.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.280
And it just goes on and on
forever, every one of these

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.490
being an entire galaxy.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.820
Now, so much of what we know
about the universe, almost

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.410
everything that we know
about the universe,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.170
comes to us from light, from
things like telescopes, right?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.910
We sit on this planet,
for the most part.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.730
Occasionally we put
something in orbit

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.190
around the Earth or the sun.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.360
But we just from the confines
of this rocky planet,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.440
basically, we collect light
and take pictures of the sky.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.400
And we've amassed this
incredible story--

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.180
that the universe is 13.8
billion years old, that it's

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.280
full of galaxies,
that we are not

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.990
at the center of the universe,
that the universe expands,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.030
that there was a big bang
13.8 billion years ago.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.560
We know that there
are black holes, maybe

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.740
hundreds of thousands, maybe
millions in every galaxy.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.940
We think there are supermassive
black holes, millions

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.350
or billions of times
the mass of the sun.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.030
And their centers
are these galaxies.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.760
We know that there's
dark matter-- matter

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.060
that we can't see but
we only indirectly

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.270
see its effects--
and dark energy.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.279
But what else is out there,
is sort of the question?

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.899
If we know that there is
dark matter and dark energy,

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.459
are there other dark things
that we simply can't see?

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.950
And black holes are an
example of dark things

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.080
that usually we can't see.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.602
So here is a astronomical image.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.810
Again, this is not a cartoon.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.250
This is a real image of a galaxy
in the direction of Hercules,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.860
the constellation Hercules.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.630
It's an entire galaxy,
hundreds of billions of stars.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.230
It's actually a very big galaxy.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.530
It's bigger than that.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.690
In the center is a supermassive
black hole, we suspect.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.070
And why do we suspect it?

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.260
Because we see these huge
jets coming out of the galaxy

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.080
that are powered by
material being taken down

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.660
by the black hole and spat
out before it falls in.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.950
People often ask me, how
did the material get out

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.370
from inside the black hole?

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.180
Nothing can escape a black hole.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.460
It doesn't come from
inside the black hole.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.140
It actually never
makes it inside.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.770
It gets shot out along
these tremendous jets,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.432
and those jets are millions
of light years across.

00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:15.140
And we see them from
this great distance,

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.610
and that's how we figured out
black holes are out there.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.210
But essentially, black holes
should be invisible to us,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.974
usually.

00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.640
So there's lots of
black holes out there

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.460
that we simply
couldn't see, that

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.519
are too dark to possibly see.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.560
And that's where the
gravitational waves come in.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.060
So gravitational waves are a
way of observing the universe,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.810
but not through light.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.450
The gravitational-wave
observatory

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.680
that made that discovery is
not a telescope of any kind.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.650
It doesn't take
pictures of the sky.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.630
It actually makes a
recording of the ringing

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.740
of the shape of spacetime.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.820
So you want to try to
get into that stuff?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.950
So let's try to get
into that stuff.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.830
It was interesting
that all of this

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.470
does come from
Einstein's theory.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.920
So a lot of people were
saying very excitedly,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.100
this was the confirmation
of Einstein's theory

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.910
of relativity.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.990
But nobody was that
surprised about

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.720
this particular confirmation.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.190
In some sense, it was
much more the fact

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.120
that it could even
be done at all.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.380
So here's an example
of spacetime.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.640
You know, if we're in
the space of this room,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.227
we don't see curves
in spacetime.

00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:24.310
This is Einstein's theory.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.629
Einstein's theory is that
spacetime is curved in response

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.420
to mass and energy.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.930
But we can't see these curves.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.450
If you were to float in empty
space, and you were to, like,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.720
throw objects in
empty space, they

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.860
would trace straight
lines, right?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.510
If you're an astronaut, and
you're far from the Earth,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.110
and you can't see any stars,
and you were to just throw-- I

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.756
don't know.

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:46.380
What do astronauts
have their hands on?

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.921
I don't know.

00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:49.050
A bolt, something, a tool.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.150
It would travel in a
straight line, right?

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.800
So if I imagined painting
those curves in spacetime,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.830
I would imagine painting
a straight line grid.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.680
This is a way to give you
an explanation of what

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.400
curved spacetime-- an
intuition for what it's like.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.430
Einstein's theory says if I put
a big mass in that space time

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.459
like a star, it will curve
the shape of space around it.

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:15.000
And you already know
that to be true.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.510
If I take this clicker
and I throw it,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.790
you know it's not going to
travel in a straight line,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.289
right?

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.050
It's definitely going to trace
an arc and fall to the Earth.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.170
And if we could
paint all the paths

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.820
that I could imagine
of throwing probes,

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.030
you could actually paint the
curved spacetime around it.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.320
And so intuitively,
it's actually--

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.820
it seems like such a huge
leap, but yet intuitively,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.070
we all know it's true.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.330
We live in a spacetime
where things do not

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.130
travel in straight lines.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.160
And those paths that
things travel along

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.790
when they're free and
weightless, like this would

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.160
be if I let it drop or like
it would be if I threw it,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.590
those are the
curves in spacetime.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.230
So when Einstein
proposes this theory,

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.521
you know, it takes him forever.

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:03.200
He really struggles
with the mathematics

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.450
of general relativity.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.390
But when he comes
up with the theory,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.940
the first thing he
turns to is the topic

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.660
of gravitational waves.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.900
And here's the reason why.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.720
If spacetime is curved
by heavy masses,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.260
then if those masses
move, the curves

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.140
have to move and adjust
to follow it around.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.660
Surely if the sun were to go
halfway across the universe,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.210
the curves it creates
around it must also move.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.059
And those are the
gravitational waves.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.950
What happens is
the curves in space

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.169
actually have to move and adjust
slower than the speed of light

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.549
or at the speed of
light, in this case,

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.370
because no information, not
even gravitational information,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.090
can go faster than
the speed of light.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.910
So these waves curve and
adjust and follow the mass,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.510
and then wave outward
throughout spacetime.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.920
Now, Einstein many times said
gravitational waves are real,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.070
they're not real, they're
real, they're not real.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.902
Over decades, he was
changing his mind

00:09:03.902 --> 00:09:05.110
and writing different papers.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.160
Sometimes he would
write a paper that

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.760
said gravitational
waves are not real.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.580
And between acceptance of
the paper for publication

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.930
and print, he would write it
saying-- which one did I say?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.430
Not?

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.140
That they are.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.639
OK?

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:20.430
So he changed his
mind many times.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.180
This is not simple stuff.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.300
So this is from 1915 to 1916.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.430
In the '30s, people
are still arguing

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.290
if gravitational waves are real,
some people even in the '60s.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.050
In the early '70s,
very visionary people

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.270
like Kip Thorne start
to become convinced

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.800
that gravitational
waves are real

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.180
and that somehow, they're
fundamental to our whole theory

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.840
of gravity hanging together.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.920
This is a computer
simulation, now modern times,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.110
of two black holes colliding.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.060
And it's a very formal
mathematical system

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.600
based in relativity.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.540
This problem, even on
a computer-- since you

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.240
guys like to code a
lot, will appreciate--

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.000
was so hard, even though
we know Einstein's

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.390
theory of curved spacetime.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.380
We can write the equations down.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.740
We can plug them
into a computer.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.270
It doesn't just run.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.290
It was a numerical problem
that seemed insoluble.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.880
And that's because gravity
is very non-linear.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.450
As a spacetime would curve
and change with the two

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.090
black holes, it would
feed back into itself

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.570
in such a complicated
way that they

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.280
couldn't get the codes to run.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.170
It took 30 years,
three decades, for them

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.700
to write the codes properly and
solve that numerical problem.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.320
So here is a beautiful
visualization of one

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.910
of the numerical solutions.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.670
It shows two black holes.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.990
They've helpfully painted
the curves in spacetime

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.640
around it, kind of contours.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
If you can see the
red coming out,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.560
those are the
gravitational waves

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.760
emitting as two black
holes bang on the drum,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.010
ringing spacetime,
sending the waves outward

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.230
at the speed of light.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.180
The two black holes collide.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.160
They make a bigger
black hole, which

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.370
just settles down to this
perfect shape and goes quiet.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.350
And that's the prediction.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.090
This prediction is already--
this must be many years old,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.740
this simulation,
maybe 10 years old.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.730
And it's an incredibly
accurate prediction

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.197
of what the gravitational
waves would sound like.

00:11:26.197 --> 00:11:27.780
They would travel
through the universe

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.760
getting quieter and quieter
until it hit the Earth.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.870
This is-- I'm going to
show you a much less

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.820
sophisticated simulation
that's based more

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.750
in analytical calculations.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.780
I'm going to show you the
orbits of two black holes.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.610
I'm not going to show the
contours of the space.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.240
But we're going
to listen to them.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.990
So this is what it would
sound like if you could record

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.700
the ringing shape of the drum.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.770
So one of the black
hole paths is yellow.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.080
One is red.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.090
And they're going to start
to spiral in together.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.590
[BUZZING SOUND]

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.545
So these two black holes
are equal in mass, which

00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:09.300
is why they're both moving.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.880
One's not heavier
than the other,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.501
so they're both whirling around.

00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:15.000
And as they get
closer together, you

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.690
can hear the frequency goes up.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.790
And eventually,
they're going to merge.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.460
So you heard that chirp, and
that's a lot like the chirp

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.670
in the actual signal.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.878
You see how similar they are.

00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:30.160
That's what's called the
chirp, is when it sweeps up

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.320
in frequency as they collide.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.724
Now, even now, you sort of
maybe have a better intuition

00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:35.640
of what the waves are.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.080
But why are they sound?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.350
If you were an astronaut
floating nearby

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.340
those two black
holes colliding, you

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.820
would not be able to see them.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.220
But it could ring your eardrum.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.750
I mean, I always say that.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.400
I'm not-- I don't know
anatomy that well.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.090
So I have talked to people
who study the ear in detail.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.296
And they say it's plausible.

00:12:56.296 --> 00:12:58.670
You know, I've never tried to
do the experiment, floating

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.550
near a black hole.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.190
But if you heard that, you'd,
like, want to get out of there.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.750
If you're floating
near darkness,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.880
and you hear this chirping
up, it's like time to scoot.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.880
So technically, it is
very much like sound.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.570
It's not just a weak analogy.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.910
You know, I can take
any kind of light waves

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.260
and translate them into sound.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.460
That's not what's happening.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.880
This is not light.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.210
It's literally
vibrations on the drum.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.750
And so, it's almost like
having an electric guitar,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.370
where you pluck the string,
and it makes no sound

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:35.040
until you amplify it, until you
record the shape of the string

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.220
and you amplify it.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.350
That's kind of what
this instrument does.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.085
It records the
shape of the ringing

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:41.620
drum-- we'll talk
about that more--

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.840
and it plays it back as sound.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.420
Here's another pair
of black holes.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.100
One is much heavier, so
its orbit is in yellow.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.750
It hardly moves because it's 10
times heavier than the other.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.250
The other moves much more.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.940
You can see the orbits of
black holes are pretty crazy.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.970
They're not like
solar-system orbits.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.700
When they get close together,
they get pretty wild.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.706
And you can hear the
difference between this one

00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:07.580
and the previous one.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.266
[TICKING SOUND]

00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:10.220
Hear how it gets quiet?

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.490
And then louder?

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:16.160
So we can hear that the whole
system's moving like this.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.029
We can hear that they're
not on circular orbits.

00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:21.820
And we can even hear
that they're spinning,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.903
if you know how to listen.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:26.090
[WHIRRING SOUND]

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.250
OK.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.200
And then they merged.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.510
But it still chirps.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.380
That chirp is a
real characteristic

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.690
of all these black-hole systems.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.190
Sorry.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.621
Did I touch the volume?

00:14:36.621 --> 00:14:37.120
OK.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.620
Wait.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.000
Before I do that, let
me go back for a second.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.380
At the time that people decided
to build this instrument,

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.657
LIGO-- so the experiment,
this obscure experiment

00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:49.740
no one had ever heard of
that made this detection,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.570
is called LIGO.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.190
It's the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.740
It actually made the
detection in September--

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.115
September 14th, 2015.

00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:01.740
They didn't announce
it until February,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.030
but it made the
detection in September.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.060
This experiment was
dreamed up in the late '60s

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.210
and sort of started to spread.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.200
Different ideas were
spreading about trying

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.510
to do something like this.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.040
But one of the original
architects was Rai Weiss.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.690
He was a young professor at MIT.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.370
He didn't understand the
general theory of relativity.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.850
He was trying to teach
it because MIT said,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.330
you're running a
gravity-research program.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.940
You should teach
general relativity.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.315
And he says, I
couldn't tell them

00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:35.310
I didn't know general
relativity, right?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.260
So he starts to
teach this class.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.862
He says, I was bumbling, but
the students didn't walk out.

00:15:39.862 --> 00:15:41.320
And the reason they
didn't walk out

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.964
is because he was dreaming up
ways to actually do experiments

00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:45.630
with the theory.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.325
And that's when he
dreamt up this idea.

00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:48.950
Look, if there are
gravitational waves,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.470
he thought, and they
come across the Earth,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.770
then things will bob on the
wave by the time they get here.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.970
If I could suspend
mirrors very delicately,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.410
they would sort of bob
as the wave passed.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:03.860
And if I could keep track of the
distance between those mirrors,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.200
I would know if they had
moved slightly apart and in,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.520
and I could record the
shape of the ringing drum.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.760
So if you could time-- had
extremely accurate clocks,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.070
you would be able to do that
with what we call just one

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.270
arm, just two
mirrors in a vacuum

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.294
so the laser light
doesn't get scattered.

00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:25.210
And shine the laser light
between the mirrors,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.000
and with a very
precise clock, you

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.060
could keep track of
where those mirrors are.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.670
We don't have such
precise clocks.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.430
So instead, he thinks of
an interferometer, which

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.290
is two arms in an L-shape.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.200
And you'll see the LIGO
instruments in a second.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.540
And the light comes back
and goes down the two arms

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.730
and comes back.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.220
And if it traveled the same
distance in both directions,

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.640
then the light would
interfere perfectly.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.730
And if it travelled
different distances,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.424
then it would
interfere imperfectly,

00:16:54.424 --> 00:16:56.840
and the waves would create
what's called a fringe pattern.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.060
And so it's a much
simpler detection

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.710
to look at the fringe
pattern than it

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.110
is to try to use a clock.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.210
And he started
building this machine.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.000
It was 1.5 meters.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.349
He was building in a place
called the Plywood Palace.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.710
It was this ramshackle
structure that was thrown up

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.839
during World War II.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.339
And it was supposed
to be torn down,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.200
and they didn't tear it down.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.960
It was supposed to
last for 10 years.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.869
It wasn't torn down
for another 50 years.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.440
And they used to punch
holes in the ceiling

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.680
and break the pipes.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.119
And they would literally
perform experiments and go right

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.490
through several stories.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:29.100
And it was a crazy place.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.240
Nine Nobel Prizes came
out of the Plywood Palace.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.110
And it was almost the
crappiness of the structure

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.550
that allowed them to just
be free to experiment.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.130
He describes that when he
began these experiments,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.990
everybody thought he was crazy.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.380
First of all, they said,
it will never work.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.310
Technologically it's impossible,
what you're trying to do.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.650
Because by the time the
gravitational waves get here,

00:17:53.650 --> 00:18:00.470
their variations in distance
that we expect it to affect

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:07.050
is a billionth of a trillionth
of the length of your machine.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:07.550
OK?

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.020
A billionth of a trillionth
of the length of your machine.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.680
So a 1.5-meter machine
isn't going to get anything.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.030
One of his colleagues from
MIT said, you couldn't even

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.370
record the sun exploding.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.140
I could look out the
window and do better.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.850
You know?

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.440
And eventually, he
ran out of funding.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.630
His grants were turned down.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.539
And then he found
out after he had

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:32.080
been declined from his grants
and people started telling him,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.955
you're not going to get
tenure and you're not

00:18:33.955 --> 00:18:37.730
going to succeed, he found
out that a German group which

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.450
had read his grant to review
it for the National Science

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.610
Foundation had started to build
these instruments, but bigger

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.960
and better.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.950
So there he is in this
ramshackle structure

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.042
with no money.

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:50.000
People are against him.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.780
They don't even believe
gravitational waves are real.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.363
They certainly don't
think black holes

00:18:53.363 --> 00:18:57.420
are real at this stage in time.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.600
And he's about to
lose out, right?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.820
He's about to lose out.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.870
And he says, then what happened
is I met Kip, Kip Thorne.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.390
Kip Thorne is the
iconic astrophysicist

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.110
from your part of the world.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.260
He's a Caltech professor, very
theoretical, very brilliant

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:12.950
man.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.480
And they go on this
campaign together.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.010
So skipping ahead a bit,
50 years later, 800 people

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.281
invested in the experiment,
nearly a billion dollars.

00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:30.220
Two instruments that
each span four kilometers

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.760
make the detection
of the century,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.950
and it's not an easy 50 years.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.430
It's an arduous 50 years.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.450
Here is the full-scale detector.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.200
This is an instrument
in Hanford.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.500
These are the arms.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.570
The mirrors are suspended
at the ends of these arms,

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.149
and the laser light travels
along those vacuums.

00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:49.690
That's the site in
Louisiana, and you

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.790
can tell because it's swampy.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.600
There are alligators
and bass and things

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.200
like that in the swamps.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.350
And so here we're going
to see the laser light.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.890
This part is a
cartoon, obviously.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.550
You can't go inside the beam.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:09.410
But that vacuum wasn't
built until 1998.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.990
It has stayed in a vacuum.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.870
It's two of the largest holes
in the Earth's atmosphere ever

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.720
made.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.660
And these are the chambers
at the corner stations where

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.410
the mirrors are and the
beam splitters and all

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.730
of the optical components.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.150
But the rest of it's just
vacuum and laser light.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.610
So if that vacuum is broken, one
of the lead scientists told me,

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.680
we'd all go home.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.880
It would all be over.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.850
A lot of the expense is in
keeping that vacuum alive

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.790
or building it in
the first place.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.470
There's the physical difference
between the two sites,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.450
and they put them far
apart so that there's not

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.210
the possibility of
coincident false alarms.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.350
And they're basically
recording devices.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.510
So imagine some ripple
in the shape of space

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.670
comes from far away.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.820
It rings the instruments.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.710
They record it, and they
literally play it back as

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.940
sound in the control room.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.065
You can listen to the
detector in the control room,

00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:02.390
and it's constantly
noisy and humming.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.650
They hear earthquakes in China.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.490
They hear winds from the Gulf.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.330
They have all kinds
of seismic activity.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.370
Planes, the moon, the sun,
tides-- everything rings

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.980
this machine.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.460
It's very noisy.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.290
But the billionth
of a trillionth

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.840
of an arm, a
four-kilometer arm, amounts

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.400
to tiny variations in distance,
less than a ten thousandth

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.190
of a width of a proton.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.405
And that's what they recorded,
which is quite remarkable.

00:21:28.405 --> 00:21:29.030
[HUMMING SOUND]

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.100
This is a sound of the
instrument in the control room.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.800
This is a noise.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.810
This is what it sounds
like most of the time.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.120
You can hear different
modes in that.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.620
OK.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.010
So this is what happened.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:45.900
On September 14, there's--
Ray himself, 50 years later,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.150
is still at the sites
working on the machine.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:54.370
He was there on September 13
looking for radio interference.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.330
And they were not ready
to run detections.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.860
The machines were operational.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.780
They were ready.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.220
But some of the
algorithms weren't

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.750
ready for the data analysis.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.040
And they were still doing
what they call an engineering

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.060
run, which is you run tests,
and you interrupt the machine,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.870
and you see how it responds
to certain vibrations-- trucks

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.890
braking, banging
on it with hammers,

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.130
whatever they're doing.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.240
Ray, luckily, his
wife says, come home.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.120
So he puts down his
tools, and he goes home.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.400
In the middle of the night
on September 14 in Louisiana,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.310
in the middle of the night
in Hanford, Washington,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.520
where the other instrument
is, the young scientists,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.624
the people working on the sites
and the graduate students,

00:22:33.624 --> 00:22:34.790
they're running their tests.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.230
They're taking the
machine on and offline.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.870
They finally decide
they've had enough.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.700
It's too late.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.680
And they go home.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.400
4:50 AM, coming from
the southern sky after

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.570
a 1.3-billion-year journey,
within a span of an hour

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.010
of them leaving the
instrument in observing mode,

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.290
it strikes Louisiana.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.220
10 milliseconds later,
maybe a little less,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.910
it cruises across the continent
and rings the Hanford machine.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.740
And it's this spectacularly
loud, beautiful event.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.200
And this is what it was.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.710
If you pointed a telescope--
this is a computer simulation,

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.150
not a picture, not a movie.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.085
We couldn't possibly
see it with a telescope,

00:23:09.085 --> 00:23:11.760
but this is what it
would look like if you

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.280
could look at the lensing
of the light behind the two

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.070
black holes.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.900
One was about 29 times
the mass of the sun.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.500
One was 36, I think.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.480
They're pretty big black holes.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.530
They're orbiting each other in
the final seconds of their life

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.180
together.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.240
This is vastly slowed down.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.102
They're going at a half to
0.7 of the speed of light.

00:23:33.102 --> 00:23:34.560
Do you guys want
to see that again?

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.400
It's pretty great.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.360
Let's see that again.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.300
They're going about a
half the speed of light

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.710
up to almost 0.7
the speed of light,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.520
like 70% of the speed of light.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.550
They're about 200 kilometers
across, roughly, in size.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.980
And all we caught was
the last four orbits.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.050
That was the only part that
was loud enough to detect.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.160
The event horizons
are empty space.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.290
These are just
holes in spacetime.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.160
The event horizons
touch and coalesce

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.580
and make a bigger black hole.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.390
You can see how
deformed it looks.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.000
And eventually,
that bigger black

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.530
hole rings down
and becomes quiet.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.340
And we'll hear it
again in a second.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:12.850
So look.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.530
It's quite spectacular how
distorted they start to look.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.460
And then they wobble together,
and they form one quiet,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.780
spinning black hole.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.060
You can't even tell that
black hole's spinning.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.480
So here's what happened
at the observatories

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.245
1.3 billion years later.

00:24:30.245 --> 00:24:32.089
[WHOOSHING SOUND]

00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:33.130
So that's what they hear.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.321
And again, it's slowed down.

00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:36.780
[SQUELCHING SOUND]

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.600
[WHOOSHING SOUND]

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.500
They only hear it
once, of course.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.760
It's just for effect that
they like to repeat it.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.541
They had 200 milliseconds,
a fifth of a second.

00:24:49.541 --> 00:24:51.290
So you've got to play
it four times to get

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.860
any kind of feeling out of it.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.250
So it took them months
to analyze the data.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.260
But that morning in
Europe, people wake up,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.350
and they see this candidate
event in the data.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.530
And there starts to
become a lot of chatter.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.900
People start talking about it.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.280
People wake up
eventually, 8:00 AM,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.270
a few hours after it
happened, on the east coast

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.940
and eventually in Hanford.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.330
And they start to
hear all this chatter.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.120
And everyone's incredulous.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.570
Somebody said, we just
turned the thing on!

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.340
There's no way.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.800
People told me it
wouldn't be until 2018

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.340
that the first
detection was made.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.690
And everybody told me it
wouldn't be black holes,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.280
except for Kip Thorne.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.750
Kip always said it's going
to be black holes first.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.440
And [? Rana ?] who is one
of the experimentalists,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.904
said this time we're
going to detect something.

00:25:36.904 --> 00:25:38.820
And I said [? Rana, ?]
how can you be so sure?

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.756
And he said, I always say that.

00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:43.540
I say that every run.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.440
And he said he didn't even
look at the data for a day

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.179
because he was so incredulous.

00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:50.470
He thought, this is ridiculous.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.720
It's not real.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.820
And they worried that it had
been intentionally injected

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.350
into the data as a false
signal, which is something

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.870
that the experimentalists do on
purpose to test the experiment.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.280
They inject false
signals into the data.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.020
So everyone thought, oh, God.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.130
It's a blind injection.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.000
This is ridiculous.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.290
Mike Landry, lead
scientist at Hanford,

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.610
said he sat down that morning.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.920
He was kind of pissed off
at the team of injectors.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.140
He's like, what
are you guys doing?

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.348
We're not ready for this yet.

00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:20.473
He sits down next to
the guy, and says,

00:26:20.473 --> 00:26:22.264
are we going in a phase
of blind injection?

00:26:22.264 --> 00:26:25.300
And the guy goes, like, no.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.430
And he starts to ask-- he's
not allowed to ask, did you do

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.010
a blind injection of two
black holes colliding.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.920
But he can sort of
ask, are we in a phase?

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.440
And he permutes the
question a few times.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.600
And he keeps getting no.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.960
And finally, he says, are
we in a phase of injections

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.630
of any kind anywhere?

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.180
And the guy says no.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.210
And he says, I got cold,
is what he told me.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.560
He said, I just went cold.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.490
So on the telecom that
day, everyone's talking.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.930
And many people are
raising the possibility

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.190
that it's a blind injection.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.774
And somewhere in
the phone call, Mike

00:26:58.774 --> 00:27:00.940
says-- I don't know how
many people are on the line.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.400
Many, many voices on the line.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.980
This is an 800-person,
international collaboration.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.020
Mike says, it's not
a blind injection.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.430
Someone else says, sorry, Mike.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.270
You know, can you
say that again?

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.300
And that's when they started
to take it seriously.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.230
It's pretty remarkable,
pretty fortunate.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.820
It just shows that
quitting and going home

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.630
can be a very
effective technique.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.110
So here, just to wrap up, is
another view of our universe.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.420
Again, this is not a cartoon.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.100
This is real data
from the Hubble.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.670
Everything you're seeing
here is an entire galaxy.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.500
And again, we can see
a lot in the universe.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.260
But we know that all the
light that we receive,

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.660
that the constituents of the
universe that are luminous

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:50.910
is less than 5% of what
the universe has in it.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.730
Everything else is dark--
dark energy, dark matter.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.500
Among that 5%, black holes are
actually part of that small 5%.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.010
But it just means
that the universe

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.700
is a vast amount
of dark phenomena

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.590
that we will never see with
telescopes, that we could only

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.850
hope to record with something
like a gravitational-wave

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.850
observatory.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.900
So as the universe expands
and eventually gets darker,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.597
the universe will also go quiet.

00:28:17.597 --> 00:28:19.180
But in the meantime,
what we're really

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.330
hoping for from these
experiments is that they'll

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.050
detect things we haven't
even thought of before,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.090
not just black holes, colliding
neutron stars, supernovae.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.980
These are all game for
the gravitational-wave

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:30.830
observatories.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.240
Neutron stars are stars
that didn't quite become

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.780
black holes, that
died and collapsed

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.030
but couldn't form black holes.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.390
We expect to be able to
record a whole range,

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.490
as long as it's kind of
cataclysmic, big, astrophysical

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.160
phenomena.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160
But I think the real
hope is that we'll

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.081
detect something we've never
even thought of before.

00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:47.580
OK.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:47.900
Thank you.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.755
I'd love to take
questions if people want.

00:28:49.755 --> 00:28:53.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:56.210
Hi.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.043
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:28:57.043 --> 00:28:58.950
I was curious how you
were able to locate

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.926
the event in three-dimensional
space with two interferometers.

00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:04.050
JANNA LEVIN: It's not easy.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:09.987
So I always liken this to
listening for your phone.

00:29:09.987 --> 00:29:12.320
If you don't know where your
phone is, and it's ringing,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.480
and you can't see it, it's
really hard to find your phone.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.870
So you need two ears for any
kind of location ability.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.360
And two interferometers helps.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.790
If you only had one,
you would be saying,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.260
it's kind of from over there,
like a whole huge patch

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.170
of the sky.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.785
With two, you can do better.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.570
But it's not great.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.580
And so the future is expecting
many more interferometers,

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.760
a whole network on the
Earth, that there's

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.820
going to be an underground
instrument built in Japan.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.740
There's one in Italy
that's almost online.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.480
It's not as sensitive, but it
will really help with location.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.900
There might be one in India,
which is going forward.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.310
So that's going to help a lot.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.820
Yes?

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.320
Hi.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.000
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.958
So many questions, I
don't know where to begin.

00:29:57.958 --> 00:30:00.290
Let me ask this one.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.490
We know electromagnetic
radiation attenuates

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.112
with distance.

00:30:03.112 --> 00:30:03.820
JANNA LEVIN: Yes.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.880
AUDIENCE: Is that true of
gravitational waves, as well?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.630
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.510
It gets quieter with distance.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.250
So the closer you are, the
louder the event would be,

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.980
definitely.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.670
And also, I should
point out that this

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.170
was the most powerful event
we've had since the Big Bang,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.260
that we've detected
since the Big Bang.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.020
The power that came out was
many billions and trillions

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.040
of times the power that comes
out of the sun in light.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.360
So this is an incredibly
powerful event,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.100
yet it's very quiet.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.597
So if you blew up
a nuclear bomb,

00:30:39.597 --> 00:30:41.930
you would not be able to
measure the gravitational waves

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.429
from it.

00:30:42.429 --> 00:30:44.690
It would be totally
insignificant.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.620
Yes.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.110
AUDIENCE: So you got this
event within a few hours

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.520
of turning the instrument on.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.543
And now it's been
on for half a year.

00:30:51.543 --> 00:30:52.626
Have you gotten many more?

00:30:52.626 --> 00:30:53.360
JANNA LEVIN: Mhm.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.240
OK, well I have to clarify
that I'm a totally theoretical

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.200
physicist.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.580
So I don't build the machine.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.370
And part of what happened
is that I started following

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.020
so closely this experiment
out of fascination--

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.350
because it was other.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.060
I do a lot of theoretical work
about the colliding black holes

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.100
and the predictions.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.433
But the idea that anybody
would take it seriously enough

00:31:11.433 --> 00:31:15.570
to try to build a machine
just seemed ridiculous to me.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.260
And so I am technically
not supposed to be

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.989
privy to the detections.

00:31:22.989 --> 00:31:24.030
They did tell me, though.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.020
I think I was the only
person that was officially

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.150
told of the detection before the
formal announcement on February

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.100
11.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.790
And I can tell you that in
that February 11 announcement,

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.250
they did talk about another
bump, another signal that

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.480
looks like-- sounds like
two colliding black holes.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.620
But it was nowhere near loud
enough or significant enough

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.530
for them to have made a claim
of a first detection with that.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.620
It came later.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.490
But it was significant
enough that it's helping them

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.310
assess how often this happens.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.010
And so it looks like
there's going to be a lot

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.524
of black-hole-black-hole
collisions.

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:03.940
And the machine
is down right now.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.410
It's been down since January.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.490
It was not at
advance capability.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.480
It was at-- it was better
than the previous generations

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.030
of machines.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.780
But that's also why
nobody really expected

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.385
it to do anything right away.

00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:18.080
It still needs to become
more sensitive by at least

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.229
a factor of three or four.

00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:21.770
So they take it down, and they
tweak it, and they work on it.

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:24.410
And they're going to bring it
back up, probably, late summer.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.680
And when we expect-- yes, we
fully expect maybe monthly

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.665
we're going to be hearing things
like black hole collisions.

00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:33.790
We don't know if we're
going to hear anything else.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.290
Yes?

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.310
AUDIENCE: So somewhat
related to the attenuation

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.170
question-- so if you take a
bowl of water and you tap it,

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.000
you'll see waves.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.708
And they will still
after a little while.

00:32:44.708 --> 00:32:48.890
So is there a analog of
viscosity in spacetime that--

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:49.890
JANNA LEVIN: Not really.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.600
It's interesting.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.700
Nor for light.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.420
So we still receive
light from the Big Bang

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.290
that's been traveling to
us for 13.8 billion years.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.090
It's colder, right?

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.477
It's redder than
when it was created.

00:33:02.477 --> 00:33:04.560
That has to do with the
expansion of the universe.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.660
But light never tires.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.860
Light never slows down like
what you're describing,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.846
and there's no friction.

00:33:11.846 --> 00:33:13.470
And in the same way,
there's really not

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.620
for gravitational waves.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.600
They travel at the
speed of light.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.556
And they also never
tire or slow down.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.240
We say that all particles
that are massless

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.477
travel at the speed of light.

00:33:27.477 --> 00:33:29.060
So you know the
wave-particle duality.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.750
For light waves, there's
a quantum particle

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.690
called the photon.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.960
And as long as that
photon is massless,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.620
it will travel at
the speed of light.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.300
If it has any mass, then yes,
it will slow down and stop.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.640
And the graviton, which is the
particle analog or the particle

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.340
complement to the
gravitational wave,

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.540
is massless, as far
as we understand.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.970
If it does have some small mass
and we're wrong about that,

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.130
then maybe they would
eventually slow down and stop,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.080
and they would not be traveling
at the speed of light.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.360
Any other questions?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.860
Please.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.570
AUDIENCE: Just a
quick follow-on--

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.403
JANNA LEVIN: Just come
up to the microphone.

00:34:04.403 --> 00:34:05.950
AUDIENCE: A quick
follow-on to that--

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.219
we've not detected anything
like a graviton, right?

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.677
JANNA LEVIN: No,
it's way too hard.

00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:11.389
So gravity is so weak,
we're nowhere near

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.389
the regime of probing
the quantum scale.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.600
AUDIENCE: What would the-- I
mean, we kind of understand

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.575
the photon, how waves,
electromagnetic waves

00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:27.670
and photons can
be converted back

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.510
and forth between each other.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:33.060
Theoretically, what would
the gravitational wave

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.239
that they detected look
like for gravitons?

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.400
JANNA LEVIN: You mean if we
could probe the quantum level?

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.370
So the light in this room is
made up of so many photons

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:49.110
that it's really hard to notice
the particulate nature of it.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.000
And similarly, the
gravitational waves

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.750
are made up of so many
gravitons that it's

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.230
impossible to notice the
particulate nature of it.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.270
We haven't really
very well thought

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.300
of an experiment where
we could do that.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.120
And probably, the energy
scale you'd have to get to

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:11.710
is something like
a million times

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:15.980
the Large Hadron Collider
energy, something like that.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.501
So it's not an ambition
of the near future.

00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:19.750
I mean, this was pretty crazy.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.650
But that would be really crazy.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.169
Yes?

00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:25.960
AUDIENCE: So it sounded
like-- I'm not sure

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.730
if I understood correctly.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.250
But part of the
reason your software

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.422
was able to detect this
event and notify you guys--

00:35:30.422 --> 00:35:32.630
because you kind of knew
what you were listening for.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.690
You kind of had a prediction
for what it would sound like.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:34.955
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:35:34.955 --> 00:35:35.670
AUDIENCE: Is that correct?

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.128
JANNA LEVIN: Well,
that is correct.

00:35:37.128 --> 00:35:38.880
One of the difficulties
in this experiment

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.910
is that the sound will often
be quieter than the noise.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:49.020
And so they'll have to sometimes
run the predictions, especially

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.580
the numerical ones, in through
the data and filter it that way

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.330
and pluck it out.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.220
But this one was so loud, it's
just right above the noise.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.850
It's actually really loud.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:02.690
So it's not as reliant
on that as we fully

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.400
expected things to be.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.970
AUDIENCE: So is it that you
guys are actually just running

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.230
straight up anomaly detection?

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.400
And that's what you want
to use to possibly detect

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.660
other events in the future?

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.769
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.310
There's three or
four different teams

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.499
within the collaboration that
use different models to pluck

00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:17.790
out different kinds of signals.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.950
Some are burst signals.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.970
Some are these-- what we call
compact binary coalescence,

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.040
things like black holes and
neutron stars and white dwarfs.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.327
And some stochastic,
which is just noisier.

00:36:29.327 --> 00:36:31.160
So there's all of these
different algorithms

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.880
that people write.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.260
But I don't think
anyone expected

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.690
the first signal we detect
to be just noticeably loud.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.190
Yeah.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.770
JANNA LEVIN: Sure.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:39.890
It was just fast.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:43.180
If it had been slower, I
think they would have heard it

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.470
in the control room.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.969
It was that loud.

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:47.510
AUDIENCE: What is
the range of events

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.634
that you expect to be
able to detect with LIGO?

00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:51.050
I understand there
are [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.240
like solar-system scale
interferometers for detecting

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.440
less energetic events or
more energetic events.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.231
JANNA LEVIN: Right.

00:36:57.231 --> 00:37:00.580
So the scale-- so
it happens that LIGO

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.470
is sensitive to the
human auditory range.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.130
And that's just
strange, coincidence.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.100
But these black holes
about this size, that's

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.060
the natural frequency
at which they

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.352
would emit gravitational waves.

00:37:14.352 --> 00:37:16.726
But I think when they designed
the instrument-- you know,

00:37:16.726 --> 00:37:18.270
this has been going
on for 50 years.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.890
They were looking for supernova.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.720
They were hoping to
hear things like that.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.010
So it turns out that
the supernova might

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.500
be too quiet or too
difficult And that these

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.950
are much more populous.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.424
And but yes, if you send
something in space--

00:37:33.424 --> 00:37:35.090
and there is a project
to send something

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.410
into space-- millions
of kilometers apart,

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.460
they would be way outside
of the human auditory range,

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.300
way lower in frequency.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.830
And they would be
detecting things

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.380
like supermassive black holes
colliding, bigger things, lower

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.400
frequency stuff.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.929
Yes?

00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:50.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.010
JANNA LEVIN: Hi.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.274
AUDIENCE: How
close would we have

00:37:52.274 --> 00:37:54.148
had to have been to the
colliding black holes

00:37:54.148 --> 00:37:57.980
for them to kill us with
gravitational force.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.790
JANNA LEVIN: That's an
interesting question.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.790
It would be pretty hard to kill
us with gravitational waves.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:04.720
They're so weak.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.940
It would be really hard.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.280
Like, to be squeezed
and stretched

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.170
like-- with your bare hands,
you could squeeze and stretch

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.300
me billions of
trillions of times

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.840
harder than a
gravitational wave could.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.570
So I think I'd be much more
worried just about being

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.017
near the black holes generally.

00:38:28.017 --> 00:38:30.350
But black holes aren't really
the engines of destruction

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.600
that they are portrayed to be.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.560
If our sun was replaced
with a black hole tomorrow,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.300
we wouldn't get sucked in like
a vacuum cleaner would suck us

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:37.810
in.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.170
We would actually
orbit just fine.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.690
The orbit would be
exactly the same.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.050
It would be totally fine.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.680
I mean, we'd be dead because
it would be cold and dark.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.850
But we wouldn't fall in.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:51.155
And we were actually very slowly
falling into a black hole now.

00:38:51.155 --> 00:38:52.530
There's a supermassive
black hole

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.761
at the center of our galaxy
4 million times the mass

00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:55.260
of the sun.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.343
And we are, in fact, falling
into that black hole.

00:38:57.343 --> 00:39:01.420
It's going to take a very
long time, very long time.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.650
I really am worried
about other things.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.430
Yeah?

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.679
AUDIENCE: If you had an
infinitely sensitive detector,

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.679
where would you see
gravitational waves from?

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:10.845
Would it be from everything?

00:39:10.845 --> 00:39:11.880
Or is it just--

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.880
JANNA LEVIN: Everything.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.410
I would make gravitational
waves right now.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:19.030
Infinitely sensitive
detector would pick up

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.820
gravitational waves from
all of us moving around.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.320
And--

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.779
AUDIENCE: So you
have to be moving.

00:39:23.779 --> 00:39:25.236
JANNA LEVIN: You
have to be moving.

00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:27.160
So a black hole
just sitting there

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.890
is not going to create
gravitational waves.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.320
And it's just a funny
thing, that if, like,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.774
a star exploded
perfectly symmetrically

00:39:35.774 --> 00:39:37.440
in all directions,
it actually would not

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.120
create gravitational waves.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.260
So you need what's called a
quadripolar or a certain kind

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.040
of asymmetry and
accelerations of masses.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.550
Yeah.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.480
But I'm not
spherically symmetric.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.160
So I am making
gravitational waves.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.295
AUDIENCE: About the one
that [INAUDIBLE] I'm

00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:56.770
curious about what we
can know about them--

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.143
their relative size?

00:39:58.143 --> 00:39:59.768
JANNA LEVIN: The
black holes, you mean?

00:39:59.768 --> 00:40:01.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
one that we have.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:02.540
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.490
AUDIENCE: --the sound.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.657
What can we know about them?

00:40:05.657 --> 00:40:06.406
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.470
It's pretty amazing.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.850
So the details that we
seem to be able to extract

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.280
is one was about 29 times the
mass of the sun to begin with.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.930
One was over 30.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.730
By the time they collided,
they made a black hole maybe

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.840
about 62 times the
mass of the sun, which

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.720
means some of the energy
that we call E = mc2 energy

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.480
was emitted in the
gravitational waves.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.826
A few percent of the
energy was emitted

00:40:30.826 --> 00:40:31.950
in the gravitational waves.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.200
And that's a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.360
That's just a huge
amount of energy.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.240
And that black hole is out
there right now, spinning.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.960
They think they know it's
spinning very rapidly, probably

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.650
hundreds of times a second.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.700
We saw the last
four orbits or so.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.765
AUDIENCE: But that--
we know the location

00:40:50.765 --> 00:40:52.130
now of this black hole?

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.510
JANNA LEVIN: Not very well.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.610
Not very well.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.720
It came from the southern
sky, somewhere over there.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.740
They have a map, a
kind of a splotchy map.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.380
It sort of came from over there.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.075
It's 1.3 billion years away.

00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:06.490
AUDIENCE: Are they
trying to find it?

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.280
JANNA LEVIN: They
can't find it anymore

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.310
because a telescope
can't see a dark object.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:15.160
And so what they could try
to do is pinpoint the galaxy

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.480
that it lives in.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.587
And then that
would tell it how--

00:41:18.587 --> 00:41:20.670
something about the galaxy
might tell us something

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.660
about the black holes.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.562
Very surprised that
they were that big.

00:41:23.562 --> 00:41:25.270
That was something
that surprised people.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.900
I wasn't particularly surprised.

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.040
I work on this a
lot, and I never

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.290
had a prejudice against
big black holes.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.350
But a lot of people did.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.240
They just thought it'll
be hard to make 'em.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.730
But we-- the details of how to
make black holes is so hard,

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.230
I always thought, we're
probably not right about a lot

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.520
of that stuff.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.789
So this was real
astronomical information

00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:47.830
from the first detection.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:51.220
It wasn't just we recorded
gravitational waves.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.990
It was we've discovered the
first black-hole system,

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.070
and we've discovered the first
collision of black holes.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.570
And we know things that
we didn't know before.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:02.380
It's very cool.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.630
They were very
lucky, very lucky.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.780
Yes?

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.890
AUDIENCE: What other
gravitational wave detection

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.650
systems are coming online soon?

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:14.400
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.935
So there is this one
called KAGRA, which

00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:18.060
is going to be underground.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.030
And that helps isolate
it seismically.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.620
So that will be helpful.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.180
At some level, the
experiments are limited just

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.764
by quantum noise,
that there's nothing

00:42:25.764 --> 00:42:27.638
you can do about quantum
mechanics, you know,

00:42:27.638 --> 00:42:28.830
quantum fluctuations.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.640
If you've heard about
Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.980
principle, it makes
it impossible.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.860
In some regime, they're working
on suppressing quantum effects.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.800
But eventually, they'll hit
some fundamental physical limit

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.810
where the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle says you can never

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.590
precisely locate an object.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.110
And they'll be up against
that limit with the mirrors.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:50.620
Right?

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.980
It's just-- it doesn't exist
in a precise enough location

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.240
anymore, technically.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.470
But KAGRA will help
with seismic stuff.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.910
And there's VIRGO which is an
Italy, which will hopefully

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.257
come online in the
summer, as well.

00:43:05.257 --> 00:43:06.840
And then I mentioned
the one in India.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.950
And there's GEO.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.790
And I can't remember all
of the others right now.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.120
TAMA, I think, is offline now.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.180
But there's a whole
network of them.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.220
Eventually in space-- that
would be very exciting.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.220
Do you mean just gravitational
wave, by the way?

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.570
Or any gravity experiments?

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.020
AUDIENCE: Gravity waves.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.770
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.740
So these are the ones.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.510
They're are all of
the LIGO variety,

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.950
except the space-borne
LISA, which

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.860
would put three spacecraft,
disconnected, millions

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.490
of kilometers apart
from each other,

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.267
freely floating in space for
gravitational wave passes.

00:43:40.267 --> 00:43:41.850
They all just bob,
and they keep track

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.510
of each other with a laser.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:45.282
It's a really clever experiment.

00:43:45.282 --> 00:43:47.740
There are some people who are
trying different ideas, again

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.990
going back to atomic clocks
and timing experiments.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.850
But, you know, they're very new.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.440
So it would be interesting to
see if anyone makes progress

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.260
with that.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.604
I put the clock at--
we're counting down to 1.

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.020
But I think we
could take one more

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.080
question if somebody wanted to.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.820
Yeah?

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.110
Or two more.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.610
Yes.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.048
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
about the earlier question

00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:13.047
about the gravity waves.

00:44:13.047 --> 00:44:14.990
So they were formed
by the black holes.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.640
They came by.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.431
They were detected.

00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:20.300
And as they spread out,
they get weaker and weaker.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.180
So they don't really dissipate
because there's no friction.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.150
So what happens to them?

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.510
They just keep going on forever?

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.560
JANNA LEVIN: Well, just
imagine a light bulb up close

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.440
is very bright.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.734
And far away, it's very dim.

00:44:31.734 --> 00:44:34.150
And it's just cause you're
really intercepting less of it,

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.010
to some extent.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:35.510
Right?

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:36.860
You're up close,
you're intercepting

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.010
a whole lot of the light.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.170
But if it's very
far away, you're

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.253
getting very little of it.

00:44:40.253 --> 00:44:42.630
The rest went to other
planets and other galaxies.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.770
And, you know,
the farther out it

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.830
spreads, the less any small
patch of sky is going to get,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.362
just like a light bulb.

00:44:52.362 --> 00:44:53.820
AUDIENCE: But they
would ultimately

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.700
just keep going forever?

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.217
JANNA LEVIN: Yeah.

00:44:58.217 --> 00:44:59.800
And if the universe
is finite, they'll

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.570
come back again, eventually.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.960
They'll wrap around, and
then they'll come back again.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.490
We'll hear it a second
time, even quieter.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.900
AUDIENCE: The
picture of the wave

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.510
showed a vertical axis of
frequency oscillating around 20

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.770
hertz, I noticed, for
the last 0.4 seconds.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:18.860
Surely the two objects were
actually orbiting much faster

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.670
than that, right?

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.280
So how does that relate to
their actual orbit [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.155
JANNA LEVIN: It
actually-- 20 hertz.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.020
So the gravitational
wave is directly related

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.631
to the orbital rate.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.980
So if you think about that,
that's extremely fast.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.570
Right?

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.820
20 hertz is really
fast because you're

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.910
talking about something
200 kilometers

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.970
traveling several
hundred kilometers

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.360
and doing that orbit
many times a second.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.600
So it's actually
incredibly fast.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.930
OK?

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.910
And so you are going
near the speed of light

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.240
to be able to hit
that frequency.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.670
And that's how-- there
was a previous question

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.350
about what sets the frequency.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.058
That's sort of one
way to think about it.

00:46:06.058 --> 00:46:08.140
You know, how far is
it going in an orbit?

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.170
And how fast is it going?

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:13.271
And that will set the frequency.

00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:15.520
The gravitational wave is
twice the orbital frequency,

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.353
is the relationship.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:20.060
I think that's it.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.370
Thank you!

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:22.270
Thanks very much.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.920
[APPLAUSE]
