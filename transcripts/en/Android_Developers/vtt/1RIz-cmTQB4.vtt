KOH KIM: Hi.

00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:07.200
My name is Koh Kim.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.870
I'm on the Google Play Business
Development team

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.990
covering games for
global and Korea.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.880
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA:
My name is Yoshi.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.330
I'm also working for the
Google Play BD teams--

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.582
I'm on their Japan.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.850
KOH KIM: We wanted to take some
time to share some pro

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.020
tips on how you as a game
developer or an app developer

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.600
can take your app or game to
Korea, Japan, or really any

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.180
other country.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.920
So let's start about how big
this opportunity is in Asia,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.680
specifically in Korea
and Japan.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.630
So in the subways, you can see
that everyone is glued to

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.450
their smartphones.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.130
And what are they doing
on those phones?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.250
They're playing games.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.830
And it's not just the subway,
it's while they're walking

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.850
down the street, heading
to school, heading to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.890
restaurants, meeting
up with friends.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.180
I mean, they are gaming
everywhere.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.390
And what kind of phones do you
think that all these people

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.230
are playing their games on?

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.510
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Android.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.010
KOH KIM: Android.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.690
Especially true in Korea, where
everywhere is an Android

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.870
phone, and then even in
Japan and a lot of

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.165
parts of Asia as well.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:10.710
And so how do you take advantage
of the opportunity

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.450
is that you really got to pick
the right game to export.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.650
So what game in your portfolio
is really going to engage the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.650
players that are in
these communities?

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.120
Well, let's take a look at some
of the most popular games

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.290
that are in Korea and
Japan right now.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.790
So in Korea, we have games
such as "Dragon Flight,"

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.050
"Anipang." "Fish Island,"
"Isamaru," defense games such

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.600
as "Cat War." In a lot of
these things, you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870
definitely tell that there's
a different art style and a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.500
different way that players
actually would want to look at

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.310
these games and actually
feel like games.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.420
And what is it like in Japan?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.930
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: And in
Japan also, they are the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.100
games plus something like
puzzle functions

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.322
or like quiz effect.

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.900
KOH KIM: So what's an example
of a good localized game?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.160
So let's take a look at Glu's
"Eternity Warriors 2." This is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.310
a very good example of what you
can do to fully localize

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.020
your game for that market.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.400
And so this is a screen shot of
the banner graphic that you

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.590
can see for both "Eternity
Warriors 2" in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.530
Korea and in Japan.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.960
And notice that they've
definitely taken and been

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.330
very, very detailed on the font
that they use, also the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.810
way that they localize
to that audience.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.570
So we think this is a very good
example of what a good

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.930
localized game can be
in Korea and Japan.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.750
Which also means that
localization does not equal

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.910
translation.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.520
Actually, can we repeat
this again?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.140
Localization does not equal
to translation.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.080
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Yes.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.170
KOH KIM: So this will carry
out throughout all our

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.430
presentation.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.620
If there's one thing you should
remember, it's this.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.835
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: This
is a big point.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.865
KOH KIM: So first impressions
do count.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.140
Let's take a look at this game,
"Anomaly Korea," by 11

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.650
bit studios.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.050
Actually, this game "Anomaly
Korea" is localized in Korean.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.010
There is actually Korean
translations within the game.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.320
What's actually very unfortunate
is within the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.120
Google Play listing in Korea,
there's actually no Korean

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.670
screenshots, or banner graphics,
or anything that's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.640
translating.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.690
Which is actually very
unfortunate for the Korean

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.120
player who actually looked at
this game, was like oh, look.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.150
And it's like this game
looks really cool,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.800
really awesome graphics.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.240
But they have no idea that
it's in Korean, because

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.230
everything in the description
is an English.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.090
And this same could probably be
true for you guys in Japan,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.470
too, right?

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.280
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA:
Yes, we do.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.550
Everyone's hard to
read in English.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.080
Once they are translated into
Japanese, they can't

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.375
understand what the game's on.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:36.680
KOH KIM: Right.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.180
So that's why you should
localize your listings to your

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.385
fans in Korean and Japanese,
especially if the game is

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.910
available in those languages.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.450
If you look at "Gun Bros 2,"
what's great is that they

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.030
actually created specific
graphics, not only, obviously,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.970
for the English game, but
for Korean and Japanese.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.210
And I actually think the Korean
version of this graphic

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.720
is pretty cool looking.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.710
I think the Japanese one looks
pretty cool as well.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.470
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Yeah,
it's pretty cool.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.790
And so it's pretty different,
the Korean versions and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.780
Japanese versions.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.870
And then feature graphic as a
Korean version using entirely

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.460
the Koreans, and also the
Japanese version using the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.055
original titles plus Japanese.

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:16.440
KOH KIM: And it's not just about
what's in the Google

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.709
Play store listing, it's all
about what you do within your

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.540
game as well.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.600
So you really got to think like
your local gamer in the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.280
sense of that you have to figure
out how your gamer

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.700
within Korea and Japan
is actually going

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.980
to play your game.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.250
So we have two examples that
are actually very good

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.260
examples again.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.670
We have "Beeline Smurf Village"
in Japanese actually.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.070
And then we also have "Madfinger
Shadowgun DeadZone"

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.050
that's actually in Korean, but
also localized in many other

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.620
different languages.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.970
And what's really great is that
they actually thought

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.380
about how the text is going to
fit within the context of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.420
their game.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.830
So in the case of "Smurf
Village," it's

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.530
actually pretty simple.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.220
It's a social network game, so
they really did focus on

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.240
allowing the user to be able
to manipulate their village

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.660
and make the game changes
as necessary.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.500
Whereas in "Shadowngun," it's
all about upgrading your

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.280
equipment, upgrading your
weaponry and choosing weapons.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.680
So they actually made really
sure that all that text was

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.340
spot on and exactly what
a gamer in that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.330
region would feel like.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.130
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: That
technically is not like a

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.300
machine language, right?

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.045
Like machine translation
language.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.540
KOH KIM: Yeah, as far as some of
my Korean friends say, they

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.400
said it was like they didn't
even know it was developed by

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.815
a European developer, so
that's a good sign.

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:31.890
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Let's talk
about a final layer in

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.730
the Asian language.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.250
You can see the Asian language
is pretty different from the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.730
English within the game.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:47.100
So you can see that layout is
using the pretty weird font,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.600
and also the layer is pretty
blocky in the Asian language.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.320
KOH KIM: So the one thing you
do have to keep in mind is

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.220
that Asian languages do
present a little bit

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.760
differently from what English
or some of the European

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.420
languages can put into a game.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.780
So sometimes you really got to
watch whether your menu button

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.880
is actually big enough to
fit that Asian language.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.510
So this is definitely you should
take into mind, and

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.070
definitely something you tell
your QA teams to check on.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.110
Now let's talk about speaking
the language.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.820
And so what we mean by speak the
lingo is that there's some

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.950
things that a Korean and
Japanese game player is used

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.530
to when they encounter things,
such as price for example.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.910
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA:
This is pretty

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.930
important for the users.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.180
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.310
So you really got to make sure
whatever you set for your

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.970
in-app purchases or your prices
are actually the right

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.250
price for that region.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.620
So what do I mean by this?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.180
So typically in the US you see
a lot of things that are

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.860
$0.99, or in euros,
79 euro cents.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.550
But in Korea and Japan, there's
no such thing as

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.240
prices that end in nines--

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.760
they actually end in zeros.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.010
And so in the Korean, which
is in red, that's 1,001.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.070
In Japanese, it's 100 yen.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.470
So what we see most often
that's actually a pretty

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.180
common mistake is that we see
really weird currency

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.040
converted numbers.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.672
So if you put in $0.99 into US,
you're actually going to

00:07:07.672 --> 00:07:11.320
see 1,050A1, which is actually
a very weird number.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.680
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Yes,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.140
KOH KIM: And the next important
thing is to provide

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.940
customer support in that
local language.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.080
So what's often very frustrating
for any user is

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.790
that the customer service
representative can't

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.570
understand the language that
the user is complaining in.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.440
So this is an example from
Japan, where actually the

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.256
replied review is in Japanese.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.250
And so don't reply to
review in English.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.900
You don't want to make your
users pissed off.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.970
And finally, what we want to
end on is to know your

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.710
players' gameplay behavior.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.150
What do I mean by this is that
oftentimes I like to say that

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.340
an Asia female casual game
player is a lot more hardcore

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.870
than an 18-year-old American
boy that's playing

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.070
first-person shooters.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.460
And what do we mean by this?

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.060
It actually just means that
Asian players really go

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.520
through content like no other.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.840
You've really got to think about
updates, you've got to

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.340
think about new content,
you've got

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.210
to think about events.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.390
Yoshi, what do "Puzzle and
Dragon" do in terms of their

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.025
content updates?

00:08:17.025 --> 00:08:18.805
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: They
do in every day is

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:20.055
their updated event.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.250
KOH KIM: We're in the land
of super competitive, and

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.040
everyone wants to really
eat your content.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.020
But that's a good sign, it just
means you're just going

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.200
to have to keep up.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.270
So thanks for listening to
our presentation today.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.240
If you have any other questions,
just let us know.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.540
Thanks.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.790
YOSHITSUGU HIROTAKA: Arigato.
