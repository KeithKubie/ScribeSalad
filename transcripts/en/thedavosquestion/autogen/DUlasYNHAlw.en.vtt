of view if you have a look between the
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.240
of view if you have a look between the
region of Europe and Central Asia you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
region of Europe and Central Asia you
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.120
region of Europe and Central Asia you
will see a lot of diversity but I think

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
will see a lot of diversity but I think
 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.970

if you have a more detailed look in both

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
if you have a more detailed look in both
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.999
if you have a more detailed look in both
regions you will see within this

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
regions you will see within this
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160
regions you will see within this
diversity there are a lot of chances

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
diversity there are a lot of chances
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.090
diversity there are a lot of chances
because we are as Europeans living in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
because we are as Europeans living in
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.780
because we are as Europeans living in
the aging society Central Asia this is a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
the aging society Central Asia this is a
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479
the aging society Central Asia this is a
real another story we don't have so much

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
real another story we don't have so much
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430
real another story we don't have so much
resources but there are a lot of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
resources but there are a lot of
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.729
resources but there are a lot of
resources or you gas mining with all

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
resources or you gas mining with all
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.180
resources or you gas mining with all
different kinds in Central Asia and so I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
different kinds in Central Asia and so I
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.180

think we could exchange views we could
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.990
think we could exchange views we could
exchange our employees we could see what

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
exchange our employees we could see what
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.599
exchange our employees we could see what
we could do in this region working

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
we could do in this region working
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.359
we could do in this region working
together because if they have resources

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
together because if they have resources
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.570
together because if they have resources
and we don't if we have experienced

expertise in innovation and you need
that of course this could create a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
that of course this could create a
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170
that of course this could create a
