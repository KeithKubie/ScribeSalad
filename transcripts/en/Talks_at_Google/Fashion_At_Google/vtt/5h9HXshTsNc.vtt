[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:07.762
-My name is Andrea Zapata.

00:00:07.762 --> 00:00:09.350
I'm 16 years old.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.995
I'm from Minnesota, and
I have cystic fibrosis.

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:13.800
Cystic Fibrosis is
a genetic disease

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.880
that makes the secretions
in my body thicker.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.860
That's why my lungs and
sinuses get full of mucous

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.050
and infected.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.470
My pancreas doesn't
produce the enzymes

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.538
that help to digest my
food and the insulin

00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:28.530
to keep my sugars stable.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.840
And my liver gets
full of stones.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.450
There's no cure for
cystic fibrosis yet.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330
But there's a lot
of treatments that I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.120
have to take to stay healthy.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.235
For example, I have to take
four of these with every meal

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:42.090
so I digest my food properly.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.710
And these are vitamins.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.310
Some are for my liver, and
for a bunch of other things.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.650
This is not even a week of
pills that I have to take.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.630
This is my nebulizer.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.250
I use it from three
to four times a day,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.450
and twice a day with my vest.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.280
Together they help
me to keep my lungs

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.170
clear and without infection.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.470
I also have to get IV
antibiotics from three to four

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.550
times a year.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.140
And because my veins don't
work property anymore,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.960
I recently had to get a
Port-a-Cath implanted, which

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.190
is this little bump right here.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.130
And my mom just puts
a little needle in it,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.010
and the treatment lasts
from two to three weeks.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.740
Last year, after a rough couple
of months in the hospital,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.280
my doctors introduced
me to Make-A-Wish,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.520
and they helped me to apply.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.900
I was so shocked
because I couldn't

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.020
believe that they could
take my lifetime dream

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.570
and make it come true.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.200
A lot of people ask me why
I chose Google as my wish.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.340
It wasn't because the offices
looked cool on the moves.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.890
Google is so much more than
what everyone imagines.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.110
For me, it was an inspiration
to see the Googlers work hard

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.990
every day to make
people's lives easier

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.760
with big smiles on their faces.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
The adventure has started
here in Venezuela,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.933
when my family and I
got onto the plane,

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.076
and the pilot came
to my seat and asked

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:06.750
me to go with him to the cabin.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.710
He explained to me
how everything works.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.150
We took selfies, and it
was a really nice surprise.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.380
Make-A-Wish also made
possible for my brother

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.300
to go, which made the
experience so much better,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.642
since he's a student in England.

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:21.920
They let us explore the
whole city of San Francisco,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.910
and we got to see a lot
of wonderful places.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.880
The first place that
we visited was Verb.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.310
I was so confused because I
hadn't heard of that company

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.010
before.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.550
But I'm so thankful that I did.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.760
Ethan, Brian, and
[INAUDIBLE] explained to us

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.670
everything that they
were working on.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.700
And I was so
impressed to see how

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.590
they create tools
that fit in perfectly

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.420
within people's health needs.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.790
I also asked them to keep
cystic fibrosis in mind

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.170
because I hope that one day they
can create something to help CF

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.230
patients all around the world.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.960
Then we met Andrew, an amazing
Googler from Google Fit.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.760
I had the opportunity to ask him
a few questions about Google,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.590
and he was so pleased
and glad to answer them,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.820
as I was to hear them.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.400
He also gave me some pretty
cool gifts, like Moto 360.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.010
Right before going to lunch,
we took a lot of pictures

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.840
with Stan, the dinosaur.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.180
Then we had lunch
at Charlie's Cafe,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.520
which is the most popular
cafe in Googleplex.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.610
I had the best burrito
that I have ever

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.810
had in my entire life.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.360
After this is when I saw
one of the things that

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.470
really impressed me,
the conference bicycle.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.490
It fits six people, and
they have meetings in there,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.153
while riding around campus.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:38.880
How cool is that?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.170
Then we met Grace, who
works at the Chrome office.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.330
And besides how great she
was, she gave me a Nexus 5.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.880
I was so excited.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.220
One of the most unbelievable
things that I saw

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.230
was this self-driving car.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.000
I never imagined that I
would get on one of them.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.210
It was so crazy to
see how well it works.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.951
Sadly, the day was over.

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:02.450
We went to Google
merchandise store,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.820
where I got this cooler, this
pen, this mouse pad, and Alisha

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.470
gave me this t-shirt.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.020
I have no words to thank
Make-A-Wish, especially

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.470
Jessie and Sasha, for
making my wish come true

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.110
and letting me enjoy this
wonderful week with my family,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.050
along with Katie and Alicia, and
every single person in Google

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.140
who shared their
experiences and time with me

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.520
and made it the
best day of my life.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.130
I can't forget to thank
my amazing medical team

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.990
at the University of
Miami Cystic Fibrosis

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.450
Center-- my doctors, my
nurses, my therapists,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.485
my social worker, and especially
[? Alisa ?], [INAUDIBLE],

00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:48.960
and Andrew for always helping me
to stay as healthy as possible

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.480
and who introduced
me to Make-A-Wish.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.830
I hope that you can keep
making every wish of every kid

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.800
all around the world come
true and you can make

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.990
them feel like feel right now.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.870
Now I know that
wishes do come true.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.741
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:10.491
NIGEL BARKER: Wow.

00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:14.340
I don't about you, but a
round of applause for that.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.017
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:16.850
MATT TARGETT: How do
you follow that, right?

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.980
NIGEL BARKER: I don't
know how you follow it.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.164
I mean, first of all, to
have that much attention

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:21.580
with a camera on
your face-- and I

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.790
know from talking on
television, you always

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.290
want it to push off and
show all the B roll moments.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.960
But actually, she was as
fascinating, if not more.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.210
Wow, what a character.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.760
If she gets to work for
Google, I think you're lucky.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.650
MATT TARGETT: One
day, hopefully.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.650
Well, thankfully we have
some B roll to save us.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.520
But I do have a welcome
and a bio for everybody.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.834
So welcome to another
Talks at Google.

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:44.000
Nigel, I have your bio here.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.250
You seem like a bit of an
overachiever, so I'll--

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.170
NIGEL BARKER: Don't
believe it all.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.920
MATT TARGETT: So for
those who don't know,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.670
Nigel Barker's an
internationally renowned

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.800
photographer who opened his
New York studio in 1996.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.370
He's most famous for serving 17
seasons as "America's Next Top

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.630
Model" judge and then
became into "The Face"

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.700
with Naomi Campbell.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.695
And now has his own radio show,
"Radio Andy" in a couple hours

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:08.195
actually.

00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:10.653
You have two books, "The Beauty
Equation" and "The New York

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:13.920
Times" best-selling
"Models of Influence,"

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.200
which came out last year.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.810
You live here in New York
City with your wife Cristen,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.240
half of the Chin twins, and
your two kids, Jack and Jasmine.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.740
Welcome.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.636
NIGEL BARKER: Thank
you very much.

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:23.410
That's very sweet of you.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.910
Thank you.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.300
Well, that means, by the
way, is that I'm old.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.492
That's all.

00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:32.200
MATT TARGETT: I was
going to get to that.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.866
So you've been in New
York for 20 years.

00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:36.852
But there's a life before that
that took you to New York City.

00:06:36.852 --> 00:06:38.060
Can you take us through that?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.560
NIGEL BARKER: Yeah,
well, certainly,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.680
very quickly, I was a
lucky kind of character.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.790
I think a lot of things happened
for me that sort of set me up

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.436
for where I am sort of today.

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:51.310
I'm a born and bred
Londoner from Chelsea.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.500
But I come from a mixed
background, mixed family.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.541
And I started-- growing
up in the '70s in England

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.570
as part Sri Lankan,
part English,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.760
I was one of the only
kids that sort of looked

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.892
my way in my neighborhood.

00:07:00.892 --> 00:07:03.350
And at the school I went to
there were very few mixed kids.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.600
Of course, now when I look
across almost any audience,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.210
you have a beautiful array
of color and different types.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.710
But that wasn't
the case, certainly

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.092
not in the '70s in London.

00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:12.550
And that was one
of the reasons why

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.547
I was very interested
in exploring the world.

00:07:15.547 --> 00:07:16.880
And I know you're an Australian.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.546
And Australians love
to travel the world

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:20.339
and see what the rest
of the world's like.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.255
I think England's a
similar thing-- an island,

00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:23.860
and people trying
to get off quickly.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.570
And certainly, myself,
I always-- who am I?

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.680
What am I?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.420
And the fashion world
intrigued me very early on.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.770
At school, I'd been interested
in things like fashion design

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.730
and pattern cutting and
tailoring and weaving

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.340
and photography and art.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.540
Yet I was predisposed to be
better at math, sciences,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.540
and so I was going to be
a doctor because that's

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.235
what everyone says you
should be because you can be.

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:52.980
But it wasn't what
interested me.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.690
And so for me, as
fate would have it,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.470
there was a show on
television in England

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.730
called "The Clothes Show."

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.270
And it's rather an
ironic situation

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.728
because it's one of the very
first televised model searches

00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:03.950
ever, in the '80s.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.700
And I didn't win, but
my mother entered me

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.880
onto this TV show, which ended
up with me getting a contract

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.350
to become a model that I
decided I do for a year

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.660
in between medical school,
raise a little bit of money

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.680
before going back.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.682
One year lead two.

00:08:15.682 --> 00:08:17.140
Be careful, parents,
what you allow

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.490
your kids to do because
financial independence meant

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.670
after two years, that when
they said, OK, now you

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.850
need to go to school and study
medicine, I said, well, see ya.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.400
And I disappeared into Europe
and hung out in Milan and Paris

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.169
and enjoyed that world
and became a photographer

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.380
eventually, when things changed
in the mid-'90s, and I realized

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.210
I was not hair and chic
androgynous or ever going to be

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.350
a waif model.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.310
And I didn't want to throw
away the six years of history

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.490
I'd had in modeling, so.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.190
MATT TARGETT: Interesting.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.356
So it sort of seems like
your life came full circle.

00:08:49.356 --> 00:08:51.194
Your mother was a
Miss Sri Lanka winner?

00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:52.360
NIGEL BARKER: She was, yeah.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.340
MATT TARGETT: And you just
judged the Miss USA contest.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.320
NIGEL BARKER: I have been a
judge of many beauty pageants,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.900
one way or another, whether
it's modeling or you

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.370
"The Face" with Naomi Campbell,
"Top Model" with Tyra,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.090
obviously, Miss Universe
with the Donald.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.480
And I've recently done Miss
USA, Miss World, you name it.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.490
If there's been a
pageant, I think

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.360
I might be the most
qualified beauty pageant

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.440
judge in the world, if
that's an actual title.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.850
I think I've done
more than most,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.900
which is really weird
because it's not actually

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.840
not how my mind thinks
or how I like to operate.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.150
I'm not really a
judgemental guy.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.430
But one way or the other.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.639
I've been involved with that.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.263
MATT TARGETT: That's
super interesting.

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:36.590
And I imagine "America's
Next Top Model," 17 seasons,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.220
was a real career accelerator
that allowed you to do that.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:39.730
NIGEL BARKER: It's funny.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.640
It's one of those things--
yes, absolutely, right.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.090
It was a risk
thought at the time,

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.190
and I think that
that's what's something

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.390
that people don't often see.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.760
You often look at things
with hindsight, like, OK,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.309
that was obviously a good idea.

00:09:49.309 --> 00:09:50.350
Well done for doing that.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.390
I didn't know it was necessarily
a brilliant idea at the time.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.430
It was a risk, and
I'll tell you why.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.830
Back then, when I first got
involved with "Top Model,"

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.045
the show was on a
small network, UPN,

00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:04.360
that doesn't exist anymore.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.636
Fashion was extremely
elite and exclusive.

00:10:06.636 --> 00:10:08.010
And it was all
about the "Vogues"

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.600
and the "Harper's Bazaars"
and the big designers.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.890
And to leave that world
to go on primetime

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.610
was a huge commercial
step, and I was sort of

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.160
at the brink of
a sort of moments

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.800
in my career which
were up and coming.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.520
And big designers
were calling me.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.170
Jil Sander of Versace
was getting a lot

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.930
of big breaks in editorial.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.290
And so it was a risk.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.855
However, as a young man trying
to break into it in New York,

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.230
I thought, well, how am I
going to get my name out there?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.830
I might do one or two big jobs.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.420
But then it might
just fade away.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:35.970
This is new.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.580
This is novel.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.891
And this is really
pre-Instagram, pre-Facebook,

00:10:39.891 --> 00:10:41.890
pre a lot of everything
that anyone was used to,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.450
really pre the internet,
to some extent.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.810
I mean, it was obviously there.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.380
But it was very early days.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.080
Yet I kind of always
liked the idea

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.290
that we could crack open the
doors of the fashion industry

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.080
and open it to people so they
could see really how it worked.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.650
It had changed my life.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.760
I had found a place where
I wasn't being questioned

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.830
about where I was from,
why I looked different,

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.350
why I liked fashion.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.945
Was I gay?

00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:05.570
Was I straight?

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.790
None of that mattered.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.790
It had to do with my talent
and who I was as a person.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.410
And I felt that other people
should learn about that

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.680
and should find out about it.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.430
And that the fashion
industry is, in fact,

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.030
a place where there's a
lot of misfits and people

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.760
who had a difficult
childhood who find themselves

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.886
in the fashion industry,
and they find a home there

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:24.968
because they're not judged
for any of those things

00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:25.930
I just mentioned.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.864
And that, I thought,
was important.

00:11:27.864 --> 00:11:29.280
And I like that
about "Top Model."

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.920
And, hey, it went on from being
a small show to being a cult

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.650
phenomenon, that we
were in 146 countries,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.850
with a weekly viewership
of over 100 million people

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.220
watching the show.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.846
It became the largest
television export

00:11:42.846 --> 00:11:44.220
out of the United
States, beating

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.565
"Sesame Street" and "Baywatch."

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:47.240
So there you go.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.027
Watch out.

00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:49.610
MATT TARGETT: Sorry,
David Hasselhoff.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.790
NIGEL BARKER: Grover.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.094
MATT TARGETT: So you spoke
about diversity before.

00:11:54.094 --> 00:11:55.260
That's important in fashion.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.020
Obviously, a big topic,
and those companies

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.670
are doing it well and
really reaping the benefits.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.280
Amongst your 1.2 million
followers on Google+,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.580
how have you built your
brand in today's world right?

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.540
You mentioned TV was the
only outlet back then.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.570
Now you have so
many more outlets

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.899
and mediums to consider.

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:15.940
NIGEL BARKER: Absolutely.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.191
I think that ultimately what
the most important thing,

00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.606
and I think one
of the reasons why

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.620
I was somewhat well-positioned
to take advantage

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.650
of social media,
is that if you're

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.869
going to be successful
on reality television,

00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:28.160
and it's one of the reasons
why I think certain reality

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.880
shows don't work, is because of
the authenticity of the cast.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.870
And that one of the reasons why
"Top Model" was a huge success

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.970
is that when Tyra asked me to
come on, I was nobody, really.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.070
I mean, I was me.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.320
And I was a photographer.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.410
And I was her friend.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.530
And I did what I did.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.670
But that's all.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.800
And I think that was
also the genius of her

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.127
casting me to be that part.

00:12:51.127 --> 00:12:52.710
She could have found
someone, perhaps,

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.090
who was better known or more
of a television personality.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.570
But, likewise, with
Miss J and Jay Manuel

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.480
and all the other
people she involved,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.800
they were really here
makeup artist, the person

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.200
who taught her to walk around.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.400
They were the real deal.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.102
Everyone did that job.

00:13:07.102 --> 00:13:09.310
And I think that oftentimes
in reality television now

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.130
you'll find judges and
people who are famous

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.340
and they're already a celebrity.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.480
That doesn't really
resonate in the long term.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.780
And I felt that our
truthfulness and reality worked.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.500
And that also works
in social media.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.880
And I've always applied
that, as in, who am I?

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.779
What am I about?

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:30.320
And that is the message that I
put out there on social media.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.760
So if it's my family, if
it's about my emotion,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.750
if it's about something I
see, some advice I have,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.570
I give it freely and openly.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.610
And I don't try and kind of
wrap it or produce it or make it

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.330
look extra glossy or anything.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.410
It has to have all
the reality behind it.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.250
And I think that
the good reality

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.860
shows, like a "Top
Model," were all

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.760
about the behind the
scenes, which is really

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.680
what so much of social
media is based on

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.450
is the behind the scenes
and that learning process.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.550
So we were already kind
of plugged into that.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.067
And that's helped me regardless
of whether I understand all

00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:02.150
social media, and I don't.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.733
Have the time, I'm
completely confused

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:06.140
by how these things work and
why they do what they do.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.400
But I do love the interaction.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.219
And I've always been
fascinated in people.

00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:11.260
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.950
So how do you stay authentic
in today's day and age?

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.800
I noticed the other
foundations you

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.330
work with are largely align
with who you are as a person.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.770
And why did you
choose Make-A-Wish?

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.540
NIGEL BARKER: I didn't
choose Make-A-Wish.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.910
I think the reality is
Make-A-Wish chose me.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.480
And I think that's the
thing about Make-A-Wish.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.240
Make-A-Wish chooses everybody.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.270
And one of the wonderful
things about the Make-A-Wish

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.470
Foundation is that when
you're asked to grant a wish,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.690
you inadvertently have
your own wish granted.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.590
And it's a wish that
you didn't realize

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.337
you wanted to have granted.

00:14:47.337 --> 00:14:48.670
It's sort of the weirdest thing.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.190
When I first got
asked, there I was.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.940
I was on this television
show. "Top Model"

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.040
is being super successful.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.950
And this young girl, her wish
was to be a model for the day.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.090
And she knew of me because
she watched the show.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.355
And if she could have this
wish, who better for her

00:15:01.355 --> 00:15:03.860
at that moment then to have the
guy from the television show

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.290
take the picture?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.590
That was the guy she knew.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.289
And I was honored
enough to be asked.

00:15:08.289 --> 00:15:09.330
It was as simple as that.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.960
And I thought, sure, I'll
do it-- very flippant,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.970
a bit really.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.650
I was young and excited
about everything

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.941
that was going on in my career.

00:15:15.941 --> 00:15:18.740
I really didn't
understand the full impact

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.260
this was going to have on me.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.909
And I say this
because it was one

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:23.450
of those extraordinary
moments, Matt,

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.740
where I had this young girl
who'd flown in to New York.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.760
She'd had all the star
treatment of staying

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.870
in a wonderful hotel, and
she'd been flown over.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.130
And a limo had taken
her to the studio.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.230
We're shooting in
this wonderful space.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.130
She's excited.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.550
She's only all of 13 years old.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.400
She had had a type of cancer
and multiple operations,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.790
and her arm was all shriveled.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.900
And she was an
incredible character.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.480
But one half of her body was
all really, kind of deformed

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.370
and withered away.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.856
And the other half
seemed normal.

00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:54.230
And I remember her standing
in front of me in this dress.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.750
And she stood there with her arm
all withered, and there's me,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.760
the photographer, thinking,
OK, I see this withered arm.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.990
I see the other side
looking perfect.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:05.050
Let me take a couple
of frames of her here.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.634
Then I'll turn her around, and
we'll get the perfect shot.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.800
She let me take a couple
of frames of her like that.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.250
Then I said, OK, Nicole,
would you turn around?

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.529
And she looked at me, and she
said, I don't really want to.

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:19.070
And I sort of smiled and said,
oh, well, we've got this side.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.260
Let's get the other side.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.020
But she was very savvy.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.070
And she looked at me
straight in the eyes.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.050
I remember to this day.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.466
It's down the
barrel of my lenses,

00:16:26.466 --> 00:16:31.210
these beautiful blue eyes,
deep and they were sad,

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.340
but they were positive,
and they were confident,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.460
and they were real.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.251
And she looked to me
and said, do you know?

00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:37.410
I don't want to.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.550
This is why I'm here.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.360
This is my story.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.920
This is a part of me.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.940
And it was a defining moment.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.190
Here I am, a man
who defined himself

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.640
by searching for beauty,
telling people what was pretty,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.850
what was not, how to be a
model, all the rest of it.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.770
And a little girl
of 14 years old

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.850
made me see for the first
time what true beauty was.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.990
The courage, the
bravery in that moment

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.440
alone redefined my
concept of beauty,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.649
and it set me on a
trip forever after,

00:17:08.649 --> 00:17:12.640
of searching for that kind of
person, that kind of beauty.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.494
In the films that I
filmed and the charities

00:17:15.494 --> 00:17:17.910
I've been involved with, it's
about those kinds of people.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.599
That they move me,
and they're the ones

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.250
who make me fall
in love with people

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.349
and life and the potential.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.849
And she became a
lifelong friend.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:33.050
I was incredibly in
awe of this young girl,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.320
and I followed her career.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.040
And in fact, when she went to
college and she went to Parsons

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.580
and she graduated, I actually
collaborated with her

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.850
on her first exhibition,
where I put her art

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.704
into my photographs.

00:17:44.704 --> 00:17:47.120
And we did a show in New York
City, which she opened with.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.249
And we did a complete
sold-out show of all her work,

00:17:50.249 --> 00:17:51.165
and it was phenomenal.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.514
And for me, my wish is being
granted over and over again.

00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:57.930
And I've noticed that with
everybody who I've got involved

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.950
is that you won't believe how
life changing Make-A-Wish is

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.790
for everybody involved.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.420
And it takes a village
to do these wishes.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.604
It's not a one-man a band.

00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:08.895
MATT TARGETT: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.019
I was going to get to that.

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:12.470
There's a lot of volunteers
behind the scenes.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.040
People obviously
donate their money

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.120
and also donate airline miles.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.474
I know United Airlines is
offering a donation match.

00:18:19.719 --> 00:18:20.760
NIGEL BARKER: Absolutely.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.426
MATT TARGETT: You
said it takes an army,

00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:25.530
and summer is the busiest
time for Make-A-Wish.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.140
Can you go over that for a sec?

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.850
NIGEL BARKER:
Absolutely, well, there's

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.691
no doubt that summer
is obviously, as far as

00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:33.690
weather-related and
everything else, the summers

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.898
are always an important time.

00:18:34.898 --> 00:18:38.360
And of course, kids are out
of school and more available.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.850
And parents tend to perhaps
have vacation time and things

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.350
like that.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.130
So there's a realness to the
actual timing of these things.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.990
And there's a campaign
that Make-A-Wish

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.600
has called Wishes Can't Wait.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.755
And there's a couple of things
about Make-A-Wish, first

00:18:52.755 --> 00:18:54.380
of all, that I'd just
like to say, too.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.280
That people often
think that the children

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.510
who are having their wishes
granted have terminal illness.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.957
Sometimes that's the case.

00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:05.540
But it's not the
story of Make-A-Wish.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.966
Make-A-Wish is
about children with

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:08.090
life-threatening illnesses.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.910
And reality is that many times
the actual wishes themselves--

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.420
and this is what doctors have
said over and over again--

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.140
have given the children
a sense of hope,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.780
an ability to dream,
like you heard

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.950
of this young girl who
was talking just now,

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.590
that wishes do come true.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.430
And when you live a life
from an early age of pain,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.170
suffering, medication,
hospital visits, you often

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.260
don't know what it
means to be a child.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.750
You don't realize what it's
like to wish and to dream

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.470
and to fantasize about
what could happen

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.010
or what the future's
going to look like.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.990
And all of a sudden, when
you experience something

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.781
like this young girl
did of going to Google

00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:44.870
and seeing how you live and
what you're doing for the world,

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.230
and she thinks, goodness,
that could be me.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.760
I might have a
chance to do that.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.840
That moment for a
child can give them

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.700
the courage and the enthusiasm
and the wish and the desire

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.470
to actually heal
themselves from within,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.309
and to make the opportunity
and optimism itself.

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:04.350
It's not a medical thing.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.266
It's not a medication.

00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:06.640
It's hard to quantify.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.480
But doctor after doctor after
doctor have lined up and said,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.205
there is a reason why we refer
our patients to Make-A-Wish.

00:20:15.205 --> 00:20:16.830
It's not just because
we feel that they

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.060
should have a fun time, because
it's cute, because it's nice.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.180
It's because it
actually literally

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.040
can turn the patients around.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.007
So the summer is
an important time

00:20:27.007 --> 00:20:28.465
to get activated,
to get motivated.

00:20:28.465 --> 00:20:30.960
And Because some
children, too, it

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.090
might be their only opportunity.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.810
And I feel that we act now.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.310
We act as fast as
you can and don't

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.180
wait for someone to
ask you, but to get

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.379
involved as soon as you can.

00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:43.420
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.470
We actually have a video of one
of your wishes being granted

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.304
that was shown at
the Make-A-Wish gala

00:20:48.304 --> 00:20:49.220
The Power of the Wish.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.261
Can we show that, please?

00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:51.606
NIGEL BARKER: Show it, please.

00:20:51.606 --> 00:20:52.272
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:52.272 --> 00:20:55.080
-I've been shooting wishes with
Make-A-Wish now for 10 years.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.890
And I've seen
firsthand what a wish

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.410
can do for a child battling
a life-threatening illness.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.600
It can heal their spirit,
give them strength to fight,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.506
and give them back a bit of
power over their own lives

00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:09.640
when all seems out of control.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.857
-Oh, here we go.

00:21:10.857 --> 00:21:11.940
Hey, Pauline, how are you?

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.630
-Hi, Good.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.240
How are you?

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.130
-I'm very well.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.465
I'm very well indeed.

00:21:15.465 --> 00:21:17.440
-Make-A-Wish has been great.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.110
Colleen never would
have had a chance

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.750
to do something like
this without it.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.860
-We've waited for a long
time, and I didn't really

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.220
think that she would be able
to have her dream come true.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.790
-Colleen and Camille,
this was their wish.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.900
-Hello!

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.489
-Hi, guys!

00:21:32.489 --> 00:21:33.280
-How are you doing?

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.407
Nice to meet you!

00:21:34.407 --> 00:21:35.365
-Nice to meet you, too.

00:21:35.365 --> 00:21:35.660
-How are you?

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.730
-They wished that they
could be a model for a day.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.120
-First of all, I just want
to give you a big welcome,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.680
a big Milk welcome.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.760
Today is all about you
doing exactly what you want.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.164
When it comes to modeling,
this is your day.

00:21:46.164 --> 00:21:47.830
But I'd like to
introduce you to someone

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.220
who's very, very important,
someone who's granted wishes

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.530
with me for many, many years.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.970
His name is Rassi, and he is,
of course, the owner of Milk,

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.360
and he's back there.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.150
-Milk Studios have provided the
most incredible studio space,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.240
all the equipment for free.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.740
When you see all the different
people who have come together

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:08.430
to make it happen, from
my hair and makeup teams,

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.520
the stylist who's pulled
clothes for the past week,

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.000
the designers who've given
all the different outfits

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.990
and the accessories
and the shoes,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.450
these people highlight the
best and brightest aspects

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.100
about collective humanity.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.770
They are the true heroes that
make wishes happen every day.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.002
-All right, let's get
this party started.

00:22:26.002 --> 00:22:28.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.377
-Going in here, I didn't
no what to expect.

00:22:31.377 --> 00:22:33.210
I mean, I knew I was
taking a couple photos,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.640
but, like, this is amazing.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.790
The wardrobe was great.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.170
The shoes, the jewelry, like
that was so freaking cool.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.550
-It was really fun, because
I was like really nervous

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.950
beforehand because I
didn't know what to expect.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.690
I'd never done it before.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.980
But then when I was there,
I wasn't really thinking.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980
I wasn't really nervous.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.360
It was just fun.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.880
My favorite part was probably
the actual modeling with Nigel.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.259
-Look at you,
Colleen, my goodness!

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:05.050
I don't know who'd more
excited, you or me.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.888
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:09.307 --> 00:23:11.640
-It was really fun.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.290
I feel like I'm more confident.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.790
I would do it again if
I got the opportunity.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.180
-I chose this wish because
I want to be a model.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.300
It was a great
experience, and I love it.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.780
It was great.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.380
-The whole weekend
has been great.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.380
And it's something that
she's going to remember,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.650
and we'll all remember it.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.520
-It is surreal.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.130
It's like a dream.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.470
-When they put those gowns
on and they transform

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.890
with their hair and
makeup and nails,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.030
they've dreamt of this moment.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.630
And looking forward
to this day, it's

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.730
let them dream
beyond those hospital

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.090
walls and the treatment.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.970
And it's a day they
will remember forever.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.272
I must say, I feel
extremely blessed

00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:54.980
to have had the
opportunity to photograph

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.170
these extraordinary girls.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.990
-My sister's best
friend, her brother,

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.120
was a Make-A-Wish candidate.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.580
Thinking back to the smile
that was on Tyrone's face

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.880
and how the girls
today smiled, it just

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.410
put a smile in my heart.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.260
-These young ladies
were as beautiful

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.650
inside as they are outside.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:22.450
It was a total honor to
do their makeup today,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.550
-This is something that, as
photographers and stylists,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.130
we do every day.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.920
But today is special
because of the impact

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.620
it will have on these two
girls and their families.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.400
-I don't think people realize
the value of giving like they

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.000
should. [CRYING] And for
folks who would take time out

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.746
of their schedule for
us to have this space

00:24:45.746 --> 00:24:47.790
and this opportunity,
that's indescribable.

00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:51.582
And I'm just thankful.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.810
-Thank you to all the
heroes who make each wish

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.463
possible and unforgettable.

00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:04.227
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:04.227 --> 00:25:06.560
MATT TARGETT: Wow. that's the
third time I've seen this,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.920
and I just noticed Crissy's
face in the background.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.490
NIGEL BARKER: Oh, you did?

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.550
MATT TARGETT: Yeah,
the very first time.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.650
I can't believe I missed it.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.550
NIGEL BARKER: That's
my wife, by the way.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.560
So we've been
together for 22 years.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.060
Yeah, she's there behind--
she's not just behind me.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.300
The reality is in my life,
she's not just next to me,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.650
she's really in front of me.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.224
I wouldn't be here in this
position if it weren't for her.

00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:25.140
MATT TARGETT: Yeah, you
guys are a great team.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.402
I noticed you used your
platform to sort of launch

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:29.860
their social media,
the Chin twins.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.080
I think they have 50,000
followers in around about

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.580
a year?

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.704
NIGEL BARKER: That's right.

00:25:34.704 --> 00:25:37.450
50.6 as of today, yes.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.149
It can be done.

00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:40.190
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.660
I guess part of the question
I had earlier I didn't get to

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.670
was the considerations
going into,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.460
you obviously have a photo
of tremendously high quality,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.260
and then you
transform it online.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.142
It loses some of that
quality, the shape.

00:25:52.142 --> 00:25:54.100
What are the considerations
you have for photos

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.260
and also for videos?

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.940
NIGEL BARKER: For shooting for
Instagram and for social media

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.920
in general?

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.310
I don't over
analyze these ideas.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.875
I still put my heart and
soul into everything I do.

00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:05.500
And it's funny.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.510
It doesn't matter
whether it's literally

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.450
what people might think is
the most random shot or not.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.510
I still really care about it
and analyze it and look at it

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.950
and feel for it
and feel passion.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.660
And whatever I'm
shooting, even if it's

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.910
a photograph, like you said,
for my wife's Instagram account,

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.970
I'll really apply as
much production value

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.280
as I can put into it.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.160
And that's really
mostly just caring.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.210
I think the caring
aspect is really

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.920
at the highest level of
production you can ever have.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.370
If you don't care, then it
doesn't matter how much money

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.000
you slap on to the side of it.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.680
You don't really care
about the end product.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.910
And you can see that with big
TV shows and all the rest of it.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.320
Going to "Top
Model," when we first

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.120
started shooting that,
we had $2 million,

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.130
I think, for the first
season to do the entire show.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.120
By the time we got to the end
of shooting like 17 seasons,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.790
we were getting like $2 million
for our catering budget.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.790
So it was a very different--
but show wasn't better.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.530
In fact, our ratings
weren't even as high

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.030
as they were when
we had less money.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.660
So that speaks to
the fact that it

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.980
isn't about the money, often.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.795
It's about the heart and soul.

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.670
MATT TARGETT: Tying this
back to Make-A-Wish,

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.003
sometimes it is about the money.

00:27:14.003 --> 00:27:16.410
You just hosted the
Power of a Wish Gala.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.490
You livestreamed it
for the first time

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.095
and raised over a $1 million.

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.637
Can you describe
what that felt like?

00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:22.886
NIGEL BARKER: It felt amazing.

00:27:22.886 --> 00:27:23.680
It felt fantastic.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.220
And I think galas are one
of those interesting things.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.910
It's something that's very
much a sort of a tradition

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:29.880
of raising money.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.610
And certainly in New
York, the gala world,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.082
the gala season opens up, and
every night there's a gala.

00:27:36.082 --> 00:27:38.540
Sometimes there's more than
one gala, and you're competing.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.380
And who's made what?

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.714
And people are there with all
their money and flashiness

00:27:41.714 --> 00:27:42.671
and all the rest of it.

00:27:42.671 --> 00:27:44.495
But one of the things
that we wanted to do,

00:27:44.495 --> 00:27:46.620
and one of my missions
certainly, with Make-A-Wish,

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.490
and I know that Make-A-Wish
follows me with this too,

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.540
is that it isn't just about
a few wealthy people getting

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.850
involved, that Make-A-Wish
has always been inclusive.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.520
And to open the gala
and stream it live

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.040
and to invite the public,
really, into the gala,

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.680
to be able to be a part of it,
was important for Make-A-Wish

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.630
and myself.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.870
And it was the first time
they'd ever done that.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.210
And I feel that going
forward, the gala itself

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.910
will evolve into a far more
inclusive and involved event.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.830
That really the
Gala ends up being

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.640
a kickoff for a larger
campaign that people

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.830
can be more involved with.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.550
Versus sort of one night
of fund raising, it

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.080
needs to be an ongoing event.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.630
And as we've said multiple
times, it takes an army.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.240
It takes a village.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.820
All these wishes are
created by everybody

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.830
getting involved and
playing their part,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.450
from feeding people to
driving people over,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.660
to all the little aspects.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.250
Maybe you're donating
your air miles,

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.510
or you yourself are
donating your time.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.360
Time is the one
thing that we need.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.450
It isn't the money.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.550
The money is fantastic.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.630
And yes, we need money
for infrastructure

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.677
and for elements of it.

00:28:56.677 --> 00:28:58.260
But unless you've
got the person there

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.100
willing to share--
these children

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.110
aren't asking for money.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.310
They're not asking for you to
pay for this or pay for that.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:08.150
All they really want, and what
any of us ever really want,

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.830
is someone to listen
and to care and to stop

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.830
for a second in that busy life
that they lead and to focus.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.660
And I think that
focus is something

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.956
which we can't put a dollar
value on, but it's invaluable.

00:29:22.956 --> 00:29:25.330
And that's something which we
all have the ability to do.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.750
So if you want to be the
highest donor at any gala,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.670
all you have to do
is donate your time.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.450
And you've done more than the
guy that's given $100,000.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.910
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.326
So this is going to be the
last question before we open up

00:29:35.326 --> 00:29:39.260
for the aisle mics, and
Gina from Make-A-Wish

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.230
is going to join.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.960
So $413.19, what does
that mean to you?

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.680
NIGEL BARKER:
That's my daughter.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.390
My young seven-year-old
took me by surprise,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:56.420
and with her class,
they did a food court.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.740
Basically, it's like an
elaborate lemonade stand, where

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.340
they made pizzas and
lemonades and smoothies,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.846
and they sold it
to their classmates

00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:05.970
and to parents who came by.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:11.220
But they raised $417.13,
whatever the number was.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.640
But I had no idea who
she was raising it for,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.570
other than the fact
that she was doing it.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.750
And then she said,
they decided, the class

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.760
has decided en masse to give
them money to Make-A-Wish,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.200
which was a very sweet gesture.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.880
And she had had to convince
her class of doing this.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.640
But she'd never come to me and
asked me for any information

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.470
or whether she should
or she shouldn't.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.440
But she'd stood in
class and decided

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.880
to get up and
convince everybody.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.260
And she sort of told the
story of Make-A-Wish,

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.240
that she'd heard
from me, and managed

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.409
to convince unilaterally
the entire class to do it.

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:44.950
And all of a sudden, they were
all talking about Make-A-Wish.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.830
And at the gala, we had five
or six of her classmates

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.430
come to the gala
and take a table

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:54.150
and sit there, at seven years
old, with all these adults

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.790
around them, listening.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.450
And she came up on to stage,
and she gave the money away.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.340
It was a wonderful moment
because it really made people

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.950
everywhere, not
just at the gala,

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.765
but everyone watching
through Facebook Live

00:31:04.765 --> 00:31:06.140
or what have you,
at that moment,

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.420
realize, OK, if a little girl
can do this and spend her time

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.330
and realize that she can make
a difference, then I can too.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.414
I think that was powerful.

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:15.455
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:17.220
So it's obvious you're
an incredible role

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.610
model, amazing fashion
sense, t-shirt,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.972
jacket, like well done.

00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:22.180
NIGEL BARKER: I got the memo.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.860
Sorry I wore socks,
is all I can say.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.750
I didn't-- I got
the Google thing.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.400
MATT TARGETT: It's all right.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.810
You're old.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.684
You said it yourself.

00:31:27.684 --> 00:31:28.945
NIGEL BARKER: Yeah, thank you.

00:31:28.945 --> 00:31:30.320
MATT TARGETT:
First of all, thank

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.523
you so much for being here.

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:33.310
Before we stop for
questions, I really

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:39.100
want to thank you for being
here and spending your time.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.265
Gina, can we have
you on stage, please?

00:31:41.265 --> 00:31:42.890
NIGEL BARKER: Do we
need another chair?

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:43.806
Oh, that's brilliant..

00:31:43.806 --> 00:31:46.454
I might just move my chair,
so I don't back to you.

00:31:46.454 --> 00:31:48.370
GINA FLORESCU: It's hard
to share it with you.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.390
Hi, there.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.260
MATT TARGETT: So the
Wishes Can't Wait Campaign,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.920
can you take us
through that please?

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.060
GINA FLORESCU: Sure.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.980
So I'm Gina Florescu.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.480
I'm the head of Communications
and Marketing at Make-A-Wish.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.110
And we really have some
great things to work with,

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.640
and Nigel has helped us
do so many great things.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.420
And it opens the
door for us to be

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.830
able to really talk much
more deeply about what

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.150
we do from day to day.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.746
Because I think although people
know Make-A-Wish, they don't.

00:32:19.746 --> 00:32:22.000
I don't think they realize
how much we're just

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.700
in your community
from day to day.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.824
So our summer campaign is
really off of the gala.

00:32:27.824 --> 00:32:29.740
One of the things we did
in the gala is really

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.540
want to make sure that
everybody understood

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.310
that what we're doing,
not just in New York

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.050
or Make-A-Wish nationwide, but
really understand that we're

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.280
in your community,
that these kids,

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.850
they might be your
neighbors, or they

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.100
might be somebody who your
children go to school with.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.690
And that it's really important
that everyone knows that they

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:47.780
can play a part in it.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.420
We've done a lot of work to
try to get people to understand

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.140
the impact and how that
goes through a community

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.660
and how everyone's impacted.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.395
So what we did in
the gala is really

00:32:56.395 --> 00:32:58.270
start talking about the
boroughs and the work

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.426
that we do in each
of the boroughs.

00:33:00.426 --> 00:33:02.050
In New York City we
have five boroughs.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.450
We also work in Nassau County,
and each of those Boroughs

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.260
has a tremendous
group of hospitals,

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.160
a tremendous amount of health
care workers who help us,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.950
volunteers who help us.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.710
The community that
usually, when they

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.850
know a kid is sick in their
community, they rally around

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.120
and help out.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.710
So we wanted to start really
going deeper into what

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:20.850
that impact looks like.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.970
And so we talked about
the boroughs at our gala,

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.450
and we brought that through
in a boroughs campaign.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.730
But it was really being
able to really look

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.640
at summer is our busiest time.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.610
We have over 200 wishes to
grant this summer, which

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.060
makes us internally very busy.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.080
But that means our
volunteers and our outreach,

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.480
everything has to ramp up.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.430
Our fundraising has to ramp up.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.140
And we wanted
people to understand

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.550
that it's really urgent.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.200
We say wishes can't wait because
these kids have gone through--

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.722
quite often they've gone through
some tremendous treatment.

00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:52.180
They've gone through
months, if not

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.720
years, of trying to get better
or deal with an illness.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.142
They've waited they.

00:33:57.142 --> 00:33:59.100
And they've been able to
get this wish granted.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.920
Sometimes it is that
case where they're

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.270
looking at this wish all
along, and it helps them heal.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.590
It helps them with hope.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.491
It helps bring their
family back together

00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:11.449
when they're going through
a tremendous crisis.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.570
And quite often a wish
is that crowning piece

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.860
that they get to go do
something with their family.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.131
And that happens a lot in the
summer because they can travel.

00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:21.880
So they can't wait
because these kids have

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.000
gone through-- they've
gone through so much

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.920
to get where they are.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.750
And we can't let them wait
another season to do that.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:34.940
But we also in our Wishes
Can't Wait campaign, each week,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.199
we take a story of
a child and tell you

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.730
what they've gone through and
why their wish can't wait.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.120
And we tell it where the
borough that they're from

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.848
and what the
hospitals are there,

00:34:45.848 --> 00:34:47.639
how they help us so
much with outreach, how

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:51.510
those medical professionals
help us reach those kids

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.060
and teach those kids
about what a wish can do,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.429
and about the volunteers
that are in the community.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:58.550
So we really try to tell a
little bit about each community

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.050
as well.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.330
Again, really showing
everybody that it takes

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.650
a lot of different people.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.119
And you can probably, in the
stories, find yourself in it.

00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:09.160
MATT TARGETT: Absolutely.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.350
We're going to have the website
for information and donations

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:12.880
as well.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.100
So there's 350,000 wishes
granted worldwide, right?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.600
Are there any that
stand out to you?

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.980
I think everyone's heard
of that Bat Kid and SF.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.955
But are there are any
that are lesser known?

00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.580
NIGEL BARKER: I think
one of the things

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.480
that I find fascinating is,
listen, there's definitely

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.700
that big wishes, right?

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.140
There these fantastic
over-the-top wishes,

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.480
like in Chicago and
they shut the city down,

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.300
and everyone gets
involved, and it's

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.950
super glamorous and over the
top, and you're like, wow.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.430
And that wish is fantastic.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.710
It's obviously great
for press, and everyone

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.780
gets to hear about it, and
the kid has this amazing wish,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.300
and other kids are
like, wow, that's cool,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.670
and they hear about Make-A-Wish.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.044
That's the wonderful
thing there.

00:35:49.044 --> 00:35:53.290
But what for me, what I found
fascinating about Make-A-Wish,

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.490
and the wishes in general,
is that the children are just

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.370
children.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.530
And what they wish for
is very specific to them,

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.450
and they're not always massive.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.250
Children come from all
different walks of life.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.042
And some of them
have these dreams

00:36:08.042 --> 00:36:09.750
because they're into
a superhero and they

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.090
want to be a superhero.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.360
But others, their wishes
can be very simple.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.950
And I've known of
wishes where kids

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.840
have wanted to go to a farm to
touch an animal because they

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.230
live in an urban environment,
and they've never actually

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.050
been to a farm.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.120
And they've only ever
seen sort of animals

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.251
on television or in a book or
on the shelves of a supermarket,

00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:28.750
literally.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:29.833
And they would like to go.

00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:32.440
Or they want to go to the
beach and feel the water

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.650
between their toes in the sand.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.230
And you're like,
that's your wish?

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.630
It's just to go to the beach?

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.000
But I don't belittle it.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.100
The reality is that
for that child,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.020
they've never seen a horizon.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.620
They've lived in
hospital rooms, where

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.850
they've only ever seen a wall
and a TV that's in the thing.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.220
And for them, all
of a sudden, just

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.814
to see the sunset on the
water and to hear the water

00:36:58.814 --> 00:37:00.480
and to see the sand,
it's only something

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.130
they've seen in a film.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.890
Then you realize that that
is a beautiful moment,

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.550
yet it could be life
changing for them.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:07.920
And we take it for granted.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.290
Those wishes, I think,
are so powerful.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:12.860
And they're no less powerful
than the big wishes, which

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.430
is, again, the reason why
we all have the opportunity

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:16.110
to get involved.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.360
Sometimes when you see
these gigantic wishes,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.530
you're like, well, heck, I
couldn't have pulled that off.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.352
But there are things you can
do that can make a difference.

00:37:24.352 --> 00:37:26.810
GINA FLORESCU: There was a
great wish that we had recently.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.110
It does embody sort of
what children go through

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.350
and how they're actually
trying to come up

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.570
with a wish that
really comes out

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.175
of their creativity and heart.

00:37:36.175 --> 00:37:37.550
Because we're a
New York City, we

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.966
do what are called
"wish assists."

00:37:38.966 --> 00:37:42.610
So other chapters who are
coming, who have wishes,

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.860
they come to New York
and we assist them.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.840
This kid wanted
to ride elevators.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.860
It was elevators and
push elevator buttons.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.900
And the genesis is,
to a certain degree,

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.887
because he'd always
been in hospitals.

00:37:52.887 --> 00:37:54.720
And he always wanted
to touch those buttons.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.430
And he's lying down.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:00.320
He can see the exit signs, and
his world was very different.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.090
He was a nonverbal kid.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.730
But this is what
he wanted to do.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.590
So they set up this
brilliant wish.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:10.590
Macy's let him in
before it opened,

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.350
and they let him
click the switch that

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:16.500
started those old wooden
escalators going up the middle.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.287
He'd had never seen
anything like it.

00:38:18.287 --> 00:38:20.620
And then he took some of the
different elevators around.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.650
And then there was
the freight elevator,

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.930
where he's standing there,
and it opens up sideways.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.800
And there's this man
standing in there,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.597
and this kid was so enamored,
like I said, he was non-verbal,

00:38:32.597 --> 00:38:34.430
but at the end, he sort
of made this motion.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.660
And his mom said,
oh, he wants a hug.

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.760
So this big elevator operator
who had no idea what his day

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.410
was going to be like when
he walked in that day,

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.490
you know he's never
going to forget that.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:45.810
NIGEL BARKER: He was a hero.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.018
GINA FLORESCU: He was a hero.

00:38:47.018 --> 00:38:51.240
But again, I'm sure his wish
was granted that day too.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.770
It's amazing how
much it touched.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.340
So they went through several
other tall buildings,

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.840
and I don't remember
what they were.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.999
But those things
are pretty common,

00:38:59.999 --> 00:39:01.290
that we hear stories like that.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.430
NIGEL BARKER: The
value that everybody

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.160
feels having granted a
wish-- the wishes that I've

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.020
heard of kids who wanted
go bake bread, for example.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.560
And you look-- They
love the smell of it,

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.600
and they've never
actually seen the process.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.590
And the kids are
fascinated with process.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:20.440
And I have two little children.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.150
They want know how
everything-- how do I do this?

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.640
What's that?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:22.980
Why?

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.480
How?

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.313
All the time, right?

00:39:24.313 --> 00:39:25.730
And it's always
about the process.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.854
And cooking with kids is
something they love to do.

00:39:27.854 --> 00:39:29.460
So it often is
these little things.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.990
So having that time, finding a
baker that will open themselves

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:36.050
up and take the kids in
and go through the process,

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.390
it's enormously rewarding
and fabulous and very easy

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.430
to actually do.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.720
It just takes coordination.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.670
And that's where
Make-A-Wish is brilliant.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.940
GINA FLORESCU: That's also
a very interesting thing,

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.970
because the wish granters
that we have, they

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.420
have two that go in to visit
each child and talk to them

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.000
and get to know them and
really try to help figure

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.417
out what that wish is, not
that it's just a simple travel,

00:39:54.417 --> 00:39:56.374
or they're not trying to
go through it quickly.

00:39:56.374 --> 00:39:58.410
They're trying to get
to the bottom of what is

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.618
it that would make you happy.

00:39:59.618 --> 00:40:02.410
And those ways granters
are always volunteers.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.300
So they go in, and they
work, and they get to the kid

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.800
and figure out what
it is they want.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.790
NIGEL BARKER: Who doesn't
want to be a genie?

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.480
MATT TARGETT: Seriously.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:09.580
NIGEL BARKER: Right?

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.079
Come on.

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:12.410
I mean, it's like that's
the ultimate thing.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.879
If you could be the genie,
how amazing is that?

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:16.670
And so really, Make-A-Wish
allows everybody

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.020
to become a genie for a moment.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.594
And so that is a
very special thing.

00:40:20.594 --> 00:40:22.052
MATT TARGETT: Yeah,
what a fun job.

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.475
I'm very envious
of your position,

00:40:23.475 --> 00:40:25.600
but thank you so much for
coming into Google today.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.308
I know you have to go
to your radio show.

00:40:27.308 --> 00:40:29.660
And thank you so much for
coming to New York City

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.620
to help make a difference,
and thank you to the audience.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.520
NIGEL BARKER: Thank you.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.420
MATT TARGETT: And we'll
see you next time.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.461
GINA FLORESCU: Thank you.

00:40:34.461 --> 00:40:38.499
