00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:02.636
- [Voiceover] What is the
sum of all the solutions

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:04.211
to the above equation?

00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:05.804
All right, this is interesting.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:10.212
We have three plus the
square root of six M

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:15.073
six M minus 26 is equal to M.

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:17.792
So any time you have a
radical equation like this,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.936
it's a good idea to try
to isolate the radical.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.980
So, or unless you try to
isolate the radical first.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.193
So let's try to subtract
three from both sides

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:27.186
to just be left with just the radical

00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:28.759
on the lefthand side.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.785
And so three minus three is zero

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:31.833
and on the lefthand side

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.286
you're just left with the square root

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:36.200
of six M minus 26

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.622
and that's going to be
equal to M minus three.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.330
Now, to get rid of the radical,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.379
we can square both sides of this equation.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.947
So, we'll square that side

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:49.204
and then we can square that side as well.

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:53.606
And so the square root of
six M minus 26 squared.

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:57.244
That's going to be six M minus 26,

00:00:57.244 --> 00:00:59.737
and then M minus three squared.

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:01.585
That's going to be M squared

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:04.340
minus six M,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.348
it's gonna be minus
three M, minus three M,

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:08.036
plus nine.

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:09.552
And if this step,

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:10.830
you found a little confusing,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.790
I encourage you on Khan Academy to review

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.174
multiplying expressions,

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.082
so I'll do a quick primer right here.

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.475
M minus three times M minus three.

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.786
That's the same thing as
M minus three squared.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:24.745
You'll have M times M,

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.095
which is M squared,

00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:27.905
M times negative three,

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:29.516
which is negative three M,

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:31.378
negative three times M,

00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:32.841
which is negative three M

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:34.990
and then negative three
times negative three

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.712
which is positive nine

00:01:36.712 --> 00:01:38.754
and the negative three M
plus the negative three M,

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:40.540
that is negative six M.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.657
And I encourage you,
especially 'cause on the SAT,

00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:43.903
we'd have to do this under time pressure,

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.099
to be able to do things

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.165
like square a binomial
like this very quickly

00:01:48.165 --> 00:01:49.692
to realize it was gonna be M squared

00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:52.846
plus two time the product of these.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.503
The product of these is negative three M,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:56.094
two times that is negative six M,

00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:59.745
then negative three times
negative three is positive nine.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:02.400
So now let's see if we can solve for M.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.520
So let's get all of...

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.595
Let's get all of our everything
on the righthand side

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:07.380
of the equation.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.298
So let's subtract six M from both sides.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.487
So I'm gonna subtract
six M from both sides,

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.576
and let's add 26 to both sides.

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:16.143
And the whole reason why I did that

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:19.294
is to just clean out what I
have on the lefthand side.

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:21.393
So on the lefthand side,

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:23.978
I'm just gonna be left with zero,

00:02:24.217 --> 00:02:26.458
and on the righthand side
I'm gonna have M squared

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.480
minus 12M

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.911
plus 35

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:35.592
or I could write M
squared minus 12M plus 35

00:02:36.462 --> 00:02:37.654
is equal to zero.

00:02:37.654 --> 00:02:40.912
And, so let's think about
the M's that satisfy this.

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:43.550
Well, I can factor this if I think about,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.529
"Well, what two numbers
have a product of 35,

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.255
"but if I were to sum them,
I'd get to negative 12?"

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:52.632
Well 35, I can think of seven times five,

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:55.107
but seven plus five is positive 12,

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.983
but what about negative
seven times negative five?

00:02:57.983 --> 00:02:59.864
Well, their product's gonna be positive 35

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:03.175
and negative seven plus
negative five is negative 12.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:04.957
So I could factor this into

00:03:04.957 --> 00:03:07.331
M minus five

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.173
times M minus seven is equal to zero

00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:13.949
and if this step does
not make sense to you,

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.931
where I factored this quadratic,

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.509
I encourage you to look
up factoring quadratics

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.002
on Khan Academy to get a little bit more

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:21.520
practice doing that.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.905
But if I have the product of
two things that equal zero,

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:25.948
that means that one or both of them

00:03:25.948 --> 00:03:27.600
need to be equal to zero.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.512
So, M minus five

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:31.075
could be zero

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:34.833
or M minus seven would be equal to zero.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.170
Well to make M minus five equal to zero,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.843
you just add five to both sides.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.235
You'd have M is equal to five

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.170
or same thing over here,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.446
add seven to both sides,

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:46.120
M is equal to seven.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.647
So the two solutions are five and seven.

00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:50.181
If you want the sum

00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:51.343
of all the solutions,

00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.263
it's going to be five plus seven

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:55.692
is equal to 12,

00:03:55.692 --> 00:03:58.530
and if you just want to verify
that these actually work,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.702
try them out right over here.

00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:02.009
Six times five is going to be

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.485
30 minus 26

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:06.401
which is four.

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.869
The principle root of
four is positive two.

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:12.651
Three plus two is equal to five.

00:04:13.161 --> 00:04:14.646
It's equal to M.

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:16.401
And if M was seven,

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:17.670
if M was seven,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.526
this is gonna be three
plus the square root of

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.016
42 minus 26 is 16

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:24.899
and this needs to be equal to seven.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.702
Well, the principle root of 16 is four

00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.676
and three plus four is indeed

00:04:29.676 --> 00:04:31.909
equal to seven.
