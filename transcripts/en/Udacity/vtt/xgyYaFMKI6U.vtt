00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.042
Now find the slope of the regression line using the fact that we know that the

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:09.890
slope is equal to a Pearson's r or the correlation coefficient times the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.150
standard deviation of the y values divided by the standard deviation of the x

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.800
values.
