00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.375
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.840
All right, so the
idea is to believe

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.180
in a more brilliant world.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.967
Of course, this requires a
childlike state of wonder.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.800
As Alan Harrington wrote
in The Immortalist,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.970
we must all remain
uncompromising child voyagers--

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.480
retain a child's eye
view of what might be.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.080
What happens with
adults is that we

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.350
become jaded-- the
been theres and done

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.720
thats of the adult mind.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.880
It's a form of laziness.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.570
It's a form of dispensing
with the here and now

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.470
and jumping to the conclusions.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.180
It's a sort of impatience
with lived life

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.660
that we need to transcend.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.970
We need to re-engage
with the senses.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.850
We need awaken the
mind's attention

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.170
from the lethargy of custom
and the film of familiarity,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.120
and redirecting it instead
to the wonders of existence.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.690
Absolute unmixed attention
is a form of prayer.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.600
Looking begins with love.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.130
Love begins with looking.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.580
This is the eye of the child.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.110
This is the mind of the child.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.930
We're all born artists.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.890
We're all born ecstasy seekers.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.310
And then it just gets
pummeled out of us.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.470
It gets stripped
away by banality.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.530
What is banality and boredom, if
not defences the educated mind,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.030
employs against experience
so that it's not continually

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.170
exhaustingly astonished,
as Michael Pollan wrote

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.170
in The Botany of Desire?

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.960
And it's true, it would be
astonishing to be open to it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.170
all at any given time.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.070
Just read James Joyce.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.871
But we must, nonetheless,
strive to reenter these spaces,

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.870
because these are the
only spaces that have ever

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.470
led to visions that have
transformed the world.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.626
That, my friends, is that.

00:01:52.626 --> 00:02:12.445
