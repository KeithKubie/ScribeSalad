ALANA WEISS: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.670
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.650
My name is Alana Weiss.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.690
And today, it is my
pleasure to welcome

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.220
Greg McKeown to the
Authors at Google series.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.230
Greg was here in 2010,
on his book "Multipliers.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.930
How the Best Leaders
Make Everyone Smarter."

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.760
And today, he's here to
present on "Essentialism.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880
The Disciplined
Pursuit of Less."

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.699
Please join me in
welcoming Greg.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.904
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:30.820
GREG MCKEOWN: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.430
It's just a thrill to be with
Google, and to have all of you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.610
come and join us.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.100
So 15 years ago, and I might
need a little cheer for this.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
That's a warning.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.600
15 years ago, I
was at law school,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.680
and I quit to do something
useful with my life.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.720
OK, so now's the cheer.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.744
That was it.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:53.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.790
I was expecting no
less from Google.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.600
And the reason I
quit was because I

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.017
had a particular
question in mind.

00:01:01.017 --> 00:01:02.850
And I realized that I
just couldn't actually

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.220
do both, both do the
work I was doing,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.400
and really pursue this question
to eventually teach and write

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.900
on it.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.184
And here's the question.

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:12.100
So I've had 15 years to
think about the answer

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.190
to this question.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.620
You're going to have 15 seconds,
but I expect great things

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.940
from you, so it's no problem.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.490
OK, so here's the question.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.090
What is it that keeps otherwise
capable and driven people

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.826
from breaking through
to the next level?

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.450
So, I'm going to ask
it again, and then

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.830
I really want-- don't be shy.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.084
Real answers, as
fast as you can.

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:35.750
AUDIENCE: Focus.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.208
GREG MCKEOWN: That
was really fast.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.850
I was going to ask it again,
and there was none of that.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.260
OK, so say what did you say?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.110
AUDIENCE: Focus.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.480
GREG MCKEOWN: Focus,
that's what keeps us back.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.855
That's because
you think you know

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.445
what the subject of
the-- lack of focus.

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:49.030
Good.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.410
More.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.710
AUDIENCE: Fear.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.500
GREG MCKEOWN: Fear,
like what kind of fear?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.750
AUDIENCE: Fear of the unknown.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.640
Fear of change.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200
GREG MCKEOWN: Just don't want
to get out of our comfort zone.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.450
Right.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.720
Thank you.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.350
Fear of failure, good.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.850
More.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.360
Justin?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.775
AUDIENCE: Themselves.

00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:00.150
GREG MCKEOWN: How
does that work?

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.960
AUDIENCE: The person.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.950
GREG MCKEOWN: Just
get rid of myself.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.470
AUDIENCE: The person is our
own worst enemy sometimes.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.400
GREG MCKEOWN: Worst enemy.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.900
In what way?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.080
How do you, how does your--

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.870
AUDIENCE: Self-confidence, fear.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.634
It's all of it, but
it's all that person.

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:10.050
You are your worst
enemy at times.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.440
GREG MCKEOWN: You
are your worst enemy.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.731
AUDIENCE: You overthink things.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.910
You're afraid of failure.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.020
GREG MCKEOWN: Get
rid of yourself,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.530
and you're on your
way to success.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.960
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.000
GREG MCKEOWN: No, it's
an interesting point

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.240
that you made.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.156
We'll come back to it.

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:22.560
Go, Frank.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.340
AUDIENCE: Not focusing on the--
Letting little things that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.850
aren't important
take up your time.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.330
GREG MCKEOWN: Right.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.392
Being consumed by all
the different things that

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:31.350
can come along, that
maybe aren't so important.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.140
OK, I want a couple
more thoughts on this.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.000
AUDIENCE: Lack of time.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.124
GREG MCKEOWN: Lack of time.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.599
Too many big things
get in the way

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.640
of being able to break
through to the next level.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.170
What is it that keeps back
capable and driven people

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.330
from breaking through
the next level?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.430
The answer that I
came to, eventually,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.720
was counter intuitive.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.870
Something hidden in plain sight.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.840
The answer to the
question of why

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.970
otherwise capable and
driven people don't break

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.860
through the next
level is success.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060
And this is how it works.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.660
I first observed this
working with executive teams

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.560
in Silicon Valley.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.980
And this is the process.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.580
The paradox of
success is that when

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.630
they were focused on a
few essential things,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.900
the right things, they could
get unified behind it and so on.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.760
And it coalesced to
momentum, and with that, they

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.910
were able to produce success.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.770
But success came with it,
options and opportunities,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.490
which, although they're
the right problems,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.380
they do turn out, in
fact, to be problems.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.410
Because they undermine the
very focus on essentials

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.720
that led to success
in the first place.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.060
So I'm exaggerating the
point in order to make it,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.850
but success can become
a catalyst for failure.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.760
And if not that,
at least success

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.570
can become a catalyst for
plateauing in our progress.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.550
And suddenly,
we're just consumed

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.136
with all of the good things.

00:03:54.136 --> 00:03:55.260
So think about it this way.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.300
So this is a true
story, somebody

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.010
I interviewed for the book.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.090
Based in a stone's throw
from where we are right now.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.525
And he was in a company.

00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:06.620
He was focused on the
things that he loved to do.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.786
He's doing a great job at
them, but then his company

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:11.610
was purchased by a larger,
more bureaucratic firm.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.620
And he went in there wanting
to be a good citizen.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.395
A team player, which was code
for try to say yes to every one

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.770
without really
thinking about it.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.353
So if there's an
email chain, he wants

00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:26.690
to be the first person on it.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.030
If there's a conference call,
and he's invited, he goes.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.560
A meeting, the same.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.480
But what he found was that as
the frustration and stress was

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.200
going up, his quality
of work was going down.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.810
And eventually, that gap
became so large and painful,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.830
he considered leaving
the company altogether.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.750
And just to make the
temptation even greater,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.333
they actually came to him, and
offered him an early retirement

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:55.530
package.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.500
Well, what to do?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.790
He goes to a mentor, and
as they discuss this,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.910
they realize that he doesn't
want to retire at all.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.890
What he wants to do is
do this kind of work.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.590
Even if he retired, he'd
just start a consultancy

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.900
doing the same kind of
work he's already doing.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.940
And then, he thought
who would my clients be?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.180
Well, one of them
would be the company

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.440
I'm currently working for,
because they could clearly

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.800
use the help.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.330
So the mentor listening to all
of this says, you know what?

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.260
You need to retire in role.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.960
Now that's different than quit,
stay, and don't tell anybody.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.360
We've sometimes worked with
people in that category.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.110
It was to use a lens of
focusing on a few things.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.450
For example, he just said,
well, if I was a consultant

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.550
into this company, I wouldn't
be on every email chain.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.060
And I wouldn't go
to every meeting.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.710
I would use so much more
selectivity about what I did.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.740
And so he started pushing back.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.400
Started not simply
going to everything.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.610
Not attending every meeting.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.410
In fact, one of the meetings
he'd been regularly going to,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.520
he just stopped going to.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.496
It was an experiment.

00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.120
That doesn't always
work well, but what

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.160
happened for him is that they
came to him a little concerned.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.730
We missed you at the meeting.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.260
He said, what do you need?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.010
Well, we needed this
project getting done.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.968
Oh, great, I'll do that
by the end of the week.

00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:12.790
Solved his our commitment
in the meeting.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.830
Two minutes conversation, done.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.340
Well, he continued this
experiment for a few months.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.850
What happened?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.920
He got fired.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.580
He didn't get
fired, but it would

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.470
change the tenor
of the conversation

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.247
if that is what had happened.

00:06:26.247 --> 00:06:27.330
No, this is what happened.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.290
Let's start at
home, first of all.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.440
At home, what he
got back was-- Well,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.972
he said, he got his life back.

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:36.430
At 6 o'clock, he
put off the phone.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.240
It wasn't necessary anymore.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.580
He set different expectations.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.460
So he ate dinner with
his wife every night.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.700
He went to the gym.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.650
Suddenly, he got a
sense of control back.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.110
What happened at work?

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.220
By the end of the year, his
performance ratings went up.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.100
Massively up.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.900
And he ended off
the year with one

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.710
of the largest bonuses
of his whole career.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.060
How's it possible?

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.610
Well, actually, the way
it's possible is arithmetic.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.530
It's a really simple idea,
and possible to execute.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.290
Because you can either do many,
many things averagely well,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.759
or you can do a few
things superbly well.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.800
And if you do the right
few things superbly well,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.174
you're far more likely to be
acknowledged for what you've

00:07:19.174 --> 00:07:21.570
done and to make a
significant contribution.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.910
So this is the value
proposition of essentialism.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.030
It's done right, you can
increase your contribution,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.810
overall.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.640
Well, what about you?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.140
All right.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.320
So I want you to snap if
these are true for you, OK?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.890
I want you to think about this.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:43.140
So, have you ever
been overworked,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.630
and at the same
time underutilized?

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.582
OK, snap for that.

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:47.650
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.150
OK.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.007
Have you ever been stretched
too thin at work or at home?

00:07:53.007 --> 00:07:53.590
Snap for that.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.150
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:02.602
Have you ever said
yes just to please?

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:04.330
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.460
Or just to appease?

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.420
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.674
Or just to avoid trouble?

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:12.530
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.840
So if you snap to
any of the above,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.890
then the way out is
what I would call

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.490
the way of the essentialist.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.670
It's a very different way of
thinking about everything else.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.352
It's not one more thing to cram
into your overstuffed life.

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:26.810
It's not just one
more little idea.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.476
OK, that's good.

00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:29.720
I should be an essentialist
sometimes, too.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.370
It's a different way of
looking at everything.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.610
A different lens.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.780
A different mindset.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.460
And it's radically,
totally different

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.110
than what we see
today in society.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.669
Because I would argue
to you, With you,

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.989
that we are going through
right now, a new bubble.

00:08:47.989 --> 00:08:50.280
So we've had, of course,
Silicon Valley bubbles before.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.621
We've had real estate bubbles.

00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:53.370
And years and years
before that, centuries

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.661
before, we had the tulip
bubble and all of this, right?

00:08:55.661 --> 00:08:57.130
We know about bubbles.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.500
But I think, right now, we
have a bubble of more, where

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.570
we are irrationally overvaluing
the idea of having it all,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.310
doing it all, fitting it
all in if we possibly can.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.560
That this, in fact, is
the very way to success.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.570
But what I found
is the opposite.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.470
That that logic leads to the
undisciplined pursuit of more,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.810
to use Jim Collin's phrase.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.050
And the antidote to it is
the disciplined pursuit

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.540
of less, but better.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.890
So you can take
that design ethic.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.320
The design ethic,
by the way, came

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.860
from Dieter Rams, the head
designer at Braun for 35 years.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.710
And he summarized all
of his life's learnings

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.160
into 10 principles, summarized
those even further to one,

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.060
and then summarized
that into three words.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.530
Less, but better.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.270
And he applied it to
the design of products,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.110
and superbly
successful in doing so.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.900
But I want to make the case that
we can take that same design

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.810
ethic, and use it to great
advantage in our careers,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.540
in our leadership, and also,
in our lives, writ large.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.860
And the importance of that
is difficult to overstate.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.840
Because it is a matter of fact,
and I want to put it to you,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.710
and then ask kind of a
big and crucial question

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.430
for our conversation today.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.810
I'll put it to you
that the evidence is,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.620
that at the end of
our lives, there

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:31.690
seems to be a tendency to
regret the way we lived them.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.680
Bronnie Ware is the
Australian nurse.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.440
This is just one
example, one data point,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.805
but she spoke to a lot of people
at the end of their lives,

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.430
captured them, and
wrote a piece called

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.160
"The Five Regrets of the Dying."

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.040
At the top of that
list was having

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.760
lived a life that was not true
to myself, but to the life

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.760
other people expected of me.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.950
And the second was,
too much time in work,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.450
too little time with family
and key relationships.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.830
And then the list goes on.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.310
But the point I
want to put to you

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:03.110
is that nobody
intended to be there.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.480
Nobody designed that outcome.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.620
It happened by default.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:14.300
And my question to you
is how it happened.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.080
So here's the question.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.420
Why is it that otherwise
intelligent people end up

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.130
getting tricked by the trivial?

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.240
This is my question to you.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.580
It's not an
insignificant question,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.550
because other people just
as smart as you, as us.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.770
Just as driven.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.870
Just as thoughtful.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.760
Just as careful,
somehow seem to end up

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.260
where they didn't
intend to end up.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.040
And that is more than
intellectual curiosity,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.730
although it is that, to me.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.730
It's also just a question
we ought to ask about,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.900
because we just get the one wild
and precious life, after all,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.170
so how do we design our
choices really matters.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.370
So coming back to you now,
I want the answers again,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.630
fast and furious.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.190
why is it otherwise
intelligent people get tricked

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.820
by the trivial?

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.570
This is the question
I want to put to you.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.234
What are your thoughts?

00:12:07.234 --> 00:12:08.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.180
GREG MCKEOWN: So you're
just so busy, you

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.700
get into a busyness cycle,
where you're so busy,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.314
you don't have
any time to think.

00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:16.730
So that means that
you're so busy,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.313
that you don't have
any time to think.

00:12:18.313 --> 00:12:20.620
And so it goes for
many, many years.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.930
And so this is why
very routinely, I'm

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.290
talking to people, here
in Valley and all over,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.219
that will say, Yeah, I ended up
spending 15 years at X company,

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.010
and I just can't
understand how I did that.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.750
Why that happened or why I
spent the time doing that,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.210
when there were other things
I really wanted to do.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.320
So I love that idea.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.200
A busyness cycle.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.070
Thank you for that answer.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.470
More.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.950
Go.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.075
AUDIENCE: It gives a false
sense of accomplishment.

00:12:42.075 --> 00:12:44.434
When you do trivial things,
you can accomplish them,

00:12:44.434 --> 00:12:45.725
and the bigger ones are harder.

00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:48.570
GREG MCKEOWN: Yes,
small, quick wins.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.704
Or at least feel like wins.

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:50.870
They get them off the plate.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.625
I sent the email.

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:52.750
I responded to that person.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.180
It feels like accomplishment.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.370
And by the way, if
you didn't say it,

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.510
but it was true for you, I want
you to snap for those, too.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.301
Thank you for that.

00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:58.812
More.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:12:59.770
There was another hand.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.270
Go.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:00.800
And others.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.360
Don't be shy.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.270
I want to hear your thoughts.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.770
Go.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.741
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we respond to
urgency more than importance

00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:06.665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:09.040
GREG MCKEOWN: That's a great
new phrase for us all there.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.169
A to-do list pack rat.

00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:12.710
So what does it
mean, really, though?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.542
AUDIENCE: Well, your lists get
longer, and longer, and longer.

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:17.910
And you're constantly
crossing them off to do them.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.070
GREG MCKEOWN: Have
you ever notice that?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.611
That by the end of
the day, your list

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:23.400
is longer than at the beginning?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.117
I once made a list like
this, a list of everything

00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:26.950
that was on my mind.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.937
400 things by the
time I was done.

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:30.270
Some of you will be much higher.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.430
Smaller brain,
that's how it goes.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.490
400 things.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.340
And I just looked at
that list, said OK.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.240
And I thought, OK, from
now I'm going to cross off

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.330
every time I do
something, and I'm

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.320
going to add it every time I
make a commitment to anyone

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:40.820
new, right?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.020
I just did it for a week
or two, just to see.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.920
Yeah, it's very predictable.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.970
The list got longer
every single day.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.370
There's a problem
there, isn't there?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.892
Take that forward for the
next however many years,

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:57.600
and you've got a
problem with perpetually

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.017
being in a certain cycle.

00:13:59.017 --> 00:13:59.850
A certain challenge.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:00.641
Thank you for that.

00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:02.235
More.

00:14:02.235 --> 00:14:05.397
AUDIENCE: Passive
participation [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:06.230
GREG MCKEOWN: Right.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.080
Passive--

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:09.760
GREG MCKEOWN:
Passively going along

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.600
with other people's agenda.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.670
Let me just speak to
that for a moment.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.379
In fact, I was talking
to Vint Cerf here.

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:21.420
And we were talking about
a few different things,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.870
but one of the things
he said in passing,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.329
which I thought
was interesting, is

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:26.120
I must have mentioned
information overload.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.730
And he said, Oh,
information overload.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.494
He says, I hear
this all the time,

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:30.910
but we've had
information overload

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.430
since we had a library.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.390
So this is not
some new challenge.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.990
Now I don't fully agree with
him because a library is still

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:42.230
so passive, in comparison
to the information that

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.100
has come over the last 20 years.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.220
But still, I think
he's onto something.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.125
That it's not just
information overload today

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:50.250
that we're struggling with.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.300
It's opinion overload.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.880
And that's a very different
psychological challenge.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.570
Information overload
is just stuff.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.420
Stuff you could learn about.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.545
Stuff you could read about.

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:02.210
Opinion overload, that has
come with the advancement

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.700
of social media and
smart technology,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.370
means that people's agendas,
which always affected us,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.119
suddenly are affecting us
in a hyper connected way.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:13.410
So I think that's a nice point.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.970
More.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.840
What is it that tricks
otherwise intelligent people

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.410
to believe that
what they're doing

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.330
is important when it's not?

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.180
How do we get tricked
by the trivial?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:24.930
Don't be shy.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.100
Speak up.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.245
What are your thoughts?

00:15:27.245 --> 00:15:28.580
AUDIENCE: Habit.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.490
GREG MCKEOWN: Habit.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.306
What do you mean by habit?

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:32.970
AUDIENCE: It feels normal.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.232
GREG MCKEOWN: It feels
normal to just keep

00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:36.190
doing what we're doing.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.610
It's become routine.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.317
I love this.

00:15:38.317 --> 00:15:40.150
You two, I want to come
back to in a moment.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.274
Let me just talk to this
routine idea for a moment,

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.090
because one of the things that
interested me so much when

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.010
I was looking into
this whole subject

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.170
is how do you make
doing the essentials as

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.580
effortless as possible?

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.975
It's doing the essential work
in our life is always difficult.

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:56.350
If it's always
the hardest thing,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.666
we won't do it,
because we'll tend

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.040
in a sort of self
interested way,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.280
to do the stuff
that's effortless.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.630
So the key, of course, is
eventually to get to the point

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.830
where our routine
supports the things

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.680
that we think are
actually essential,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.030
and making that as
effortless as possible.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.260
And so in that mindset,
I was visiting China.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.700
And I was in the cube.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.330
Remember, from the
Beijing Olympics,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.420
where Michael Phelps
astounded the world.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.240
And as I was sitting
there watching it,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.440
I was struck by how different
the kind of execution we all

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.170
saw in that room, is so
different than the kind

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.560
of execution we see
on a day to day basis.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.429
I mean, for example, no one was
forcing it at the last moment

00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:32.970
there, right?

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.576
Nobody was falling
into the pool,

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:37.700
because they hadn't quite
got themselves organized.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.660
I mean, the whole thing
appeared effortless.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.130
I don't mean it really was,
but there's still something

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.000
about it being a kind of
frictionless experience.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.430
And then, as I went to research
that, the Michael Phelps

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.390
phenomenon there,
I found that he

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.690
had followed a very
particular selected routine

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.240
from his coach, Bob Bowman,
and had followed that routine

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.850
for many years, prior to
being in the Olympics.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.850
And this is the routine.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.720
He arrived two
hours ahead of time.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.170
He swam a whole set of lengths.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.440
400 back stroke.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.890
800 freestyle, and so on.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.849
He gets out, puts
on a particular kind

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.099
of swimming trunks.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:12.670
Then he sits.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.069
At 45 minutes before the time,
he sits on the massage table.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.550
Never lies down.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.310
From a certain point on, he
never speaks to the coach,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.780
and the coach never
speaks to him.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.589
It's just silent.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.810
When he sits down, about
to go up to the podium,

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.450
he always sits down
and puts the towel

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.033
to one side, his
goggles to the other.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:32.270
Puts in the same music.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.860
When they announce his name,
they take out the same earbud

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.860
first, then the other.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.900
He dries the podium.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.470
Always gets on
from the left side.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.970
And on and on it goes.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.350
This incredibly
designed routine that he

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.990
had practiced hundreds and
hundreds of times, prior

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.040
to being in the Olympics.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.450
And it doesn't even end there.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.200
His coach had created what he
called, "put in the videotape."

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.770
There's no videotape,
but the idea

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.930
was, every night
and every morning,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.510
he was to visualize, in slow
motion, the perfect race.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.260
Every single stroke
from beginning to end,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.110
including the
elation of success,

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.700
the screaming in
triumph, and the water

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.030
slow-motion dripping
off his face.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.080
Every day, twice a
day, for a decade.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.280
When he came to the Olympics,
it was so routine, so built-in

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.056
to him, he just continued.

00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:25.930
He didn't have to think
differently about it.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.042
It was routine.

00:18:27.042 --> 00:18:29.500
So in a way, what I want to do
is turn this around and say,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.690
how do you build a
habit or a routine,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.470
that supports the things
that are most essential?

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.100
So that that becomes
the default position,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.050
and not only when we're
sort of aggressively

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.884
trying to pursue it.

00:18:40.884 --> 00:18:41.383
Yeah.

00:18:41.383 --> 00:18:43.600
Just what is essential
and what isn't essential?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.750
I mean, this is a really
important question.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.247
And it's a non-trivial question.

00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:50.330
And the thing that I want
to put to you about this

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.630
is that we just often now
don't create the space,

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.250
to be able to think about this.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.150
In fact, I was at
Twitter recently,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.490
and somebody said in passing.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.156
They just asked.

00:19:00.156 --> 00:19:02.940
They said, do you remember
what it was like to be bored?

00:19:05.097 --> 00:19:06.680
They said, when
you're in the airport,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.250
and the flight isn't coming.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.666
And you don't have
anything to do.

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:11.899
You have to sort of think.

00:19:11.899 --> 00:19:13.440
Maybe you get a book
and you read it,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.147
but you have to do
something a little deeper.

00:19:16.147 --> 00:19:17.730
And he said, now
there's none of that.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.580
None at all.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.589
We have used every
ounce of that space.

00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:21.380
We're on the phone.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.020
We're responding.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.686
We're listening.

00:19:22.686 --> 00:19:25.210
We're taking information,
and we're doing something.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.980
And it does raise the question
of what a society will

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.900
be like that
doesn't ever ponder.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.790
That just is always plugged in.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.540
That is addicted, in that sense.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.475
So thank you for that thought,
and then a comment here, too.

00:19:38.475 --> 00:19:39.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.954
So the I said the
answer to this.

00:19:43.954 --> 00:19:45.649
My opinion is--

00:19:45.649 --> 00:19:46.440
GREG MCKEOWN: Yeah.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.136
So the challenge is that
if you have a manager who's

00:19:49.136 --> 00:19:50.760
completely infected
in nonessentialism,

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.929
who thinks that the
answer is just more,

00:19:53.929 --> 00:19:55.470
than you've got
yourself a challenge.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.430
And let me just tell you, I feel
like I've seen this a hundred

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.060
times, because this
idea has infiltrated

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.010
into corporations, for sure.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.990
And you can see it.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.580
In fact, you can
see it in a word.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.680
Let me give the history
lesson of the word "priority."

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.180
Does anybody know this?

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.560
So the word "priority" came
into the English language

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.640
in the 1400s.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.860
And it was singular.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.165
"Priority."

00:20:21.165 --> 00:20:22.040
Now what did it mean?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.373
Tell me what you think it meant.

00:20:23.373 --> 00:20:24.270
Give me the obvious.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.719
What does the word
mean, "priority?"

00:20:26.719 --> 00:20:27.510
Don't overthink it.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.292
What does it mean?

00:20:28.292 --> 00:20:29.500
AUDIENCE: The most important.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.320
GREG MCKEOWN: Most important.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.070
The first thing.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.820
The prior thing.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.870
Exactly so.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.760
And it kept that very clear
and simple and sensible

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.850
definition for the
next 500 years.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.630
Only in the 1900s did
we pluralize the term,

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.780
and start speaking
of "priorities."

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.900
But what does it mean?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.130
What does the word even mean?

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.530
Can you have very many
very first prior things?

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.970
So you see this Sometimes,
coming back to the comment,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.730
that you have managers who say,
with no sense of irony at all,

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.130
here are the ten priorities.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.849
In fact, I was at
group not long ago.

00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:07.140
And they knew I was coming
to teach about essentialism.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.223
And they knew about this
definition of "priority,"

00:21:09.223 --> 00:21:11.650
and it still didn't
stop them sending out

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.020
to the entire group, the nine
priorities for the fiscal year,

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.981
and not in priority order.

00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:19.730
And so what we did,
which was kind of fun,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.070
is that after the
presentation, they

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.150
took the next hour, changed
their whole schedule,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.445
and they got everybody to
vote on which the ones, what

00:21:25.445 --> 00:21:27.570
the order should be, and
which ones were essential.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.460
And they did identify what the
top one was, and the top three,

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.490
and it was clear winners
across the other ones.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.490
And it helped, of course,
the whole organization

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.250
to be able to get sensible about
what they would say yes to,

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.620
and what they would say no to.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.360
So this whole idea of
priority and getting back

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.010
to the singular sense of
it, I think is important.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.800
What is it that gets in the way?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.620
How do otherwise
intelligent people

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.245
get tricked by the trivial?

00:21:49.245 --> 00:21:51.830
What are your thoughts on this?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.143
How else does it happen?

00:21:53.143 --> 00:21:53.830
Go.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:22:00.380
So the comment was this idea
that the non-trivial is often--

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.810
This idea of
planning, and so on,

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.327
doesn't give an
immediate payoff.

00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:06.410
And so that's a challenge.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:06.940
You're planning.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.606
You're thinking.

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:08.670
You're organizing.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.650
You're not doing, in
the traditional sense.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.770
And in fact, I would go
even one stage further

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.480
to suggest that often, we are
rewarded for bad behavior,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.660
and punished for good behavior.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.269
So, if you say yes to someone,
just like that, immediately,

00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:24.060
Oh, thank goodness.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.070
They're relieved,
and that's good.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.687
And you're doing
it, and you have it.

00:22:26.687 --> 00:22:28.520
If you say no, or you
push back, then that's

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.265
not so emotionally good or
safe in the relationship.

00:22:31.265 --> 00:22:33.420
So there's a withdrawal
that takes place.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.960
But over time, if you simply
allow that to guide you,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.630
then you can have your whole
life consumed in things

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.459
that you didn't
otherwise choose.

00:22:42.459 --> 00:22:43.250
Thank you for that.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.910
More.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.985
Yes.

00:22:44.985 --> 00:22:46.360
When I think about
that, it makes

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.300
me think of an absolutely
classic example of everything

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.570
we're talking about, in the
embodiment of Rosa Parks.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.680
What I think is interesting
about Rosa Parks,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.900
and the very famous story
that she is so well known for,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.200
is that she wasn't
growing up at all likely,

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.260
or even just earlier
in her adult life,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.560
at all likely to say no.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.990
In fact, when she
first joined the NAACP,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.700
they needed someone
to be the secretary,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.430
and she did it because she was
asked to do it, and she says,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.640
it never even occurred to
her that she could say no.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.014
And so this same person, who
was so willing to sort of do

00:23:24.014 --> 00:23:26.430
the things that other people
were asking her and expecting

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.310
of her, is the same person,
that in a different situation,

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.109
is able to say no in
this critical moment.

00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:34.775
So when the bus driver
came to her-- Now

00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:35.691
what's the difference?

00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:39.050
It's important, because
it's the same person here.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.640
But in the moment that the bus
driver came to her and said,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.390
you need to leave.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.540
You need to get up.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.550
You need to leave
out of these seats.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.560
She said, in that moment,
a feeling of clarity

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.840
came over her, like
a warm blanket.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.800
Wrapped her around, and
she could feel certain.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.960
And she simply knew she would
never ride the bus again

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.966
in that way.

00:24:00.966 --> 00:24:02.590
What I think is
interesting is that she

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.379
didn't try to manipulate
the driver, as a result.

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:07.420
When the driver said,
Well, I'll call the police,

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.380
her response was,
"You may do that."

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.910
So she was clear about
what she was going to do

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.390
and not going to do, and wasn't
trying to necessarily even get

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.970
to the conversation with him.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.489
Now, of course, it
caused conflict.

00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:21.280
But this is exactly
what I'm suggesting, is

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.040
that there's a tension
between internal clarity

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.720
and social expectation.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.390
And what we need
to do to make sure

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.030
that social expectation
doesn't completely own us,

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.350
is to have that time and
space to ask the question.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.720
What is essential?

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.070
So that we can gain highest
levels of clarity on that.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.730
Thank you.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:39.380
More on this.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.470
Go, thanks.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.600
AUDIENCE: I'd say, passion
to get things done.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.940
Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.120
GREG MCKEOWN: What you said
was the desire to just execute.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.330
That you want to be the one.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.330
So if nobody else picks
it up in the team,

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.210
you're going to be
the one to do it.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.780
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.480
GREG MCKEOWN: So one of the
reasons that you take things

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.680
on is because other
people aren't.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.300
You see it as being important
to the project, and you do it.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.620
I mean, of course, one
can argue that you're

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.470
doing the right thing
in that situation.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.290
But the challenge is not simply
allowing it to be the default.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:08.940
The norm.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.850
That you become the yes person.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.970
The I'll pick it up person.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.800
Someone dropped the
ball, and I'll take it.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.030
So someone that I
really sort of feel

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.820
symbolically that the
book is written to,

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.170
is someone who, learning
of essentialism,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.082
suddenly discovered
that I can push back.

00:25:24.082 --> 00:25:25.790
I don't have to operate
the way that I've

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.120
been taught to operate.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.880
And as a result of it, she goes
and negotiates with her manager

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.710
to have five days
off work, to be

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.800
able to focus solely on the
preparation for her wedding.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.350
They negotiate and
agree that this

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.100
is the work that needs
to be accomplished.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.970
This is what's critical.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:41.577
She does it.

00:25:41.577 --> 00:25:42.660
She does it ahead of time.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.280
She makes it happen, and the
boss is thrilled with it.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.150
But then, as she
enters the five days,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.350
the boss says, well
somebody dropped the ball,

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.810
and I just need you to do it.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.750
It's really very important.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.200
I need you to do it.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.970
And in the past,
by a factor of 100,

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.220
she would always have done it.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.210
She'd never said no.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.130
Never pushed back.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.130
She just was that person,
and for the first time,

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.360
she pushes back.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.630
She says no.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.240
The boss is not pleased.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.300
But what happens is that a
week later, when they get back

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.882
a week or two later
after the wedding,

00:26:14.882 --> 00:26:16.090
the boss says, You know what?

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.950
I realized after you said
that, and pushed back,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.200
that there were other people
who hadn't been pulling

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.440
their weight
properly on the team.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.981
And this was the first time I
was really having to face that.

00:26:23.981 --> 00:26:26.890
So that's how it sort of
ended up turning out there.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.660
But she herself was so
touched by the experience,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.570
so impacted that
she had more power

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.590
than she had
previously realized,

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:39.100
that the non essentials
were negotiable,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.610
that when she went
to her wedding,

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.350
she added into her vows the
idea that I will essentialize

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.200
this marriage relationship
over all other commitments

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.620
and relationships in my life.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.860
I think that's powerful,
because it captures this idea.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.400
That what I'm
suggesting is we need

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.400
to design our
lives deliberately,

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.240
or they will end up being
designed for us by people that

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.910
aren't as invested
in us achieving

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.780
the essential
mission of our lives.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.530
Good.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.630
Let me shift to a slightly
different question.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.530
The question is this.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.330
I want you to think about
the people in your life.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.269
The inspirational people,
that you think do this.

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:22.560
The people that you can look
to and say, you know what?

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.630
They really do
focus on the things

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.360
that they are built to do.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.514
That are essential to them.

00:27:27.514 --> 00:27:28.680
They live a meaningful life.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.135
They're not simply
consumed in all

00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:32.910
of the different things
that are going on.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.134
And I want you to ask,
how do they do it?

00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:37.550
And as you're
thinking about this,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.966
I want to at least
share one story

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:42.410
as we're thinking about it,
which is Kay Krill, who I feel

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:45.650
is such a good example, because
it's like so many of us,

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:46.889
previously.

00:27:46.889 --> 00:27:48.430
And so early on in
her life-- so this

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.600
is Kay Krill, who's now the
CEO of Ann, Inc., and the Ann

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.300
Taylor brand, and
Loft, and so on.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.040
Early on in her
career, in her life,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.800
she found myself saying
yes to everything.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.370
Every social meeting after.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.600
Every extracurricular at work,
and even social engagements

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.880
outside of work.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.980
And a mentor came to her, and
said, and I love these words.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.800
They said, you've got
to learn to jettison

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.260
the activities, and
even the relationships

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.680
from your life that are
less meaningful to you.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.976
So that-- and it's
important, the so that--

00:28:20.976 --> 00:28:24.590
so that you can invest your time
and energy into the things that

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.550
are truly meaningful to you.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.790
Why I like this story is that
she's really learned to do it.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.000
That over the years in
that interim period,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.060
she has practiced.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.380
She has experimented
with essentialism.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.390
She has tried it out.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.180
Now she really feels,
it's easy for me.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.174
It's easy for me to say
no to the things that

00:28:43.174 --> 00:28:45.340
are less important, and I
know that things that are.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.860
So it's a learnable skill.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.520
Now with that as an
intro, back to you.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.640
What is it that the people
that inspire you do?

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.980
How do they do this?

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.990
How are they able to
focus on the things that

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.969
are really essential, and
push the other things aside?

00:28:59.969 --> 00:29:01.260
What are your thoughts on this?

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.560
How do they do it?

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.330
Courage, and commitment,
and a sense of unyielding,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.230
purposeful clarity.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.820
That's exactly what I found,
is that when we're clear enough

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.310
on purpose, when we have a
clear enough, strong enough yes

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.460
burning within us,
then we're able to,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.090
sometimes almost effortlessly,
just navigate the no.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.930
We're not running around
saying no to everybody.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.860
But at the same time,
we've thought so deeply

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.940
about what we do, and what we
believe, and what is valuable,

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.290
we're able to navigate a
lot of social pressure.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.490
One of my favorite
examples of this,

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.824
as I was researching the book.

00:29:38.824 --> 00:29:40.240
Steve Jobs is
someone who is often

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.448
cited as someone who said
no, and all of that, right?

00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:45.920
But what I love is a story of
someone who said no to him.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.200
And this was when he
left Apple, and he'd

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.760
started the company, NeXT.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.140
And he was trying
to find a logo.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.640
And so he found one of the best
people in the business, Paul

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.020
Rand, who designed ABC's
logo, Bloomingdale's,

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.995
and a bunch of others.

00:29:57.995 --> 00:29:59.370
And they have the
meeting, and he

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.550
says, look, what
I need you to do

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.716
is, I need you to bring me
a whole bunch of options.

00:30:02.716 --> 00:30:04.460
Graphical designs, so
I can look at them,

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.187
evaluate them, and so on.

00:30:06.187 --> 00:30:08.520
And that's what every graphic
designer gets asked to do,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.984
so a fairly normal request.

00:30:09.984 --> 00:30:11.400
And it's Steve
Jobs asking for it.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.060
So maybe, not so
easy to push back on.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.100
This is Paul Rand's response.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.800
He says no.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.180
He says, no, I will solve
your problem for you.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.930
And then he added,
and you will pay me.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.387
And you don't have to use
it, but you will pay me,

00:30:29.387 --> 00:30:30.970
and I will solve
your problem for you.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.260
He says, if you want to have
all these other options,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.840
you may get those
from someone else.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.560
But this is how
it works with me.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.060
Well, Steve Jobs went
for it, signs with him,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.810
pays him the $100,000
for the logo,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.150
loves it, describes
it as a "jewel."

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.400
But also, and this is sort
of the most important point

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.720
in the story, he
described Paul Rand

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.430
as the ultimate professional.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.350
He said, because he had thought
through the client relationship

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.910
more deeply than I had.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.560
So to this idea of when we have
a deep enough sense of what

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.500
is that we want, and what's
the right thing, and the best

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.150
use of us, then we're
able to navigate

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.300
and learn to negotiate the rest.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.990
As Peter Drucker put it,
he said, effective people

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.300
are effective
because they say no.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.540
Because they say,
this isn't for me.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.422
But to be able to do that
with any conviction at all,

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:23.880
we actually have
to do the thinking

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.730
time to get the clarity.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.260
And then, with that clarity,
we have a force and a power

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.490
with which to negotiate.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.570
Thank you for this.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:31.370
What do they do?

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:32.870
The people that inspire you.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.680
What do they do, and
how do they do this?

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.370
How they do it?

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.980
What are your thoughts?

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.480
Let me put to you someone
that's inspired me.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.874
Someone that I think
captures the very embodiment

00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:48.040
of what we're talking about.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.774
And it was another barrister.

00:31:50.774 --> 00:31:52.190
Well, I didn't
become a barrister,

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.880
because I quit, but
would have been.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.490
Started in London,
England, and he

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.948
would have been a barrister
for the rest of his life, other

00:31:57.948 --> 00:32:00.460
than he had this family thing
come up in South Africa.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.980
And so he leaves.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.034
Goes to South Africa, and
on the way to South Africa,

00:32:05.034 --> 00:32:06.450
has one of these
defining moments.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.390
He gets kicked off the train.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.960
And he gets kicked off the
train, because he's Indian,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.150
and he's not allowed
to be in first class.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.567
And instead of just taking
it and dealing with it,

00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:18.400
he goes, it's wrong.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.025
It's injustice.

00:32:19.025 --> 00:32:20.390
It's wrong.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.330
And he takes on the
South African government,

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.630
specifically about this issue.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.780
He goes through a whole process
with them, and finally wins.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.940
And having won at least
a portion of a victory,

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.200
he leaves to go
back now to India.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.459
We're talking about,
of course, Gandhi.

00:32:37.459 --> 00:32:39.000
And when he goes
back to India, there

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.910
is another test for
him waiting there.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.030
But it's unusual test.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.860
It's the test of success.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.060
Failure will test us,
but nothing like success

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.780
will test us.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.180
And so when he arrives,
everyone is expecting something

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.150
from him.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.695
Everyone wants him to
run for public office.

00:32:55.695 --> 00:32:56.570
They want him to run.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.160
Be prime minister.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.170
They've heard of his victory.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.211
They want to support him.

00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.740
There's momentum, and social
pressure, and, of course,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.490
he wants to make a
difference in his life.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.470
So, of course, that
would be the thing to do.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.650
A nonessentialist would
have done just that.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.720
But instead, think
of the discipline,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.220
and think of the logic that
would drive such behavior.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.780
He said, no.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.690
I will spend a year
listening to India.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.780
I will travel, and I will
go to the paddy fields,

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.790
and I will meet people.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.040
And I will try to
understand what's going on.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.050
What is essential?

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.460
So that I can discern
it, and see it.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.910
And you know what he found?

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:37.600
He found what was
essential was salt.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.360
It wasn't obvious before.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.450
And this is how he described it.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.170
He said, if you can control salt
production as the British did,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.760
then you can control
the bread production,

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.710
and the rest of the
food production.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.190
And so, by this single
control mechanism,

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:57.947
you can keep 300 million
people easily under control.

00:33:57.947 --> 00:33:59.780
And so this is when he
came up with the salt

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.490
marches, in which he
walked across India.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:08.170
And 600,000 people followed
him in a symbolic statement

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.880
of support, and pushing
back on the British empire.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.866
And then through a
series of experiments.

00:34:14.866 --> 00:34:16.449
He called them
experiments with truth,

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.657
but we could call them
experiments with essentialism.

00:34:18.657 --> 00:34:22.340
The same idea, because what
it came down to was a phrase.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:28.050
He said, I was learning
to reduce myself to zero.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.330
Instead, to fill his life
with only the purpose

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.850
for which he was built.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.900
It included all sorts of fun
and sort of strange experiments

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.659
including, a diet that he chose.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.570
Many, many different
kinds of diets as he

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.736
was going through, choosing
those things that really

00:34:43.736 --> 00:34:45.290
worked, and actually
helped him to be

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.980
most in attunement in his life.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.267
It included not reading a
newspaper for three years

00:34:50.267 --> 00:34:52.350
at one time, because it
was too cluttering to what

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.800
he was trying to focus on.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.929
One day a week, for a period
of time, not speaking.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:59.030
Well, that is a challenge.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.610
And on it went, including
eliminating from his life

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.320
the stuff.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.930
So he died with just
10 things to his name.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.460
But, of course, not only that
to his name, but something else.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.950
As the Secretary of
State, George C. Marshall

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:19.990
said at the time, that
he'd become the spokesman

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.530
for the conscience
of all mankind.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.380
And Einstein said of
him, "Generations to come

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.100
will scarce believe
that such a one as this,

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:33.270
ever in flesh and blood,
walked upon this earth."

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:37.110
Well, we don't
have to be Gandhi.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.790
But we could
probably channel some

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:44.510
of the power of that story,
to inspire us to make sure

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:49.120
that we live a life built
around the voice inside,

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.560
instead of the noise outside.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.800
That we can learn to
discern what's essential.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.330
The vital few from
the trivial many.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.540
That we can make micro
adjustments in the things

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.650
we do often, to be able to
take us closer to the life that

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.680
truly is essential
down the path.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.350
Well, life is fast and
full of opportunity.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.850
And the complication is, we
think we have to do everything.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:18.410
And my position is that we
can make a different choice.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:22.150
That we can learn to eliminate
the non essentials, and as

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.090
a result of that, live a
life that really matters.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.740
Do truly great work.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.459
And I think that that decision
really, really matters.

00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:31.000
Thank you ever so
much for having me.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.954
Thank you.

00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:38.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.790
AUDIENCE: In order to
get to essentialism,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.830
it seems as if discernment
is a very large component

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.500
of this process.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.229
Do you have any recommendations,
in regards to discernment?

00:36:50.229 --> 00:36:51.020
GREG MCKEOWN: Yeah.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.811
Thank you for that.

00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:54.480
Do I have any recommendations
for discernment?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.930
I think we can start
really easy on this,

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.440
because such low hanging fruit.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.350
Just start the day off.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.350
Don't reach for your phone.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.840
Almost reach for
anything else, actually.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.140
But reach for a journal.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.621
I've kept a general now for
the last, easily, 10 years,

00:37:10.621 --> 00:37:11.620
and hardly missed a day.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.520
And I tell you,
just start small.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.770
This is the way to do it.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.430
Just write less
than you want to.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.730
But just have a moment.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.820
A space to be able to
at least reflect on

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.670
yesterday and what
you want to do today.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.530
This is a very simple practice.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.117
Start with a minute a
day, and eventually it

00:37:27.117 --> 00:37:28.700
will become it's own
sort of-- I don't

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.075
want to use the
word "addiction,"

00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:33.540
but its own success cycle,
where you find yourself wanting

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.610
to write more and reflect more.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.730
Because instead of having
the world act on you

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:41.630
as our phones do, we
can act upon our lives

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.580
and upon the future.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.820
It's one very small
thing to do, but I

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.460
think getting a morning routine.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.290
A first thing routine is a
really powerful way to start.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.110
Thank you for that.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming out.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.860
I wanted to ask you.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.250
So it seems like
the overall goal

00:37:56.250 --> 00:38:00.030
is fulfillment and
happiness, right?

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:04.270
With essentialism, and the
way the workforce works now,

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:08.300
do you see a dichotomy
between what people probably

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.430
need to do to feel fulfilled,
versus what companies

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.849
look for in promotions, and
moving people up the ranks?

00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:18.640
GREG MCKEOWN: Yeah.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.860
I mean, the answer's yes.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:27.030
I mean, is there a distinction,
and a contradiction

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.010
between what companies
want from us,

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.220
and what will actually help us
to be able to be successful?

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.980
At times, absolutely.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.830
And I think that learning
to decide which trade offs

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:38.850
we want to make is the
essence of strategy.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.810
So in our personal
strategy, it's exactly that.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.800
Which things do I want to do?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.700
Now, one thing I can
certainly recommend.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.510
It's a very quick fix.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.460
Or at least a quick
fix to understand it,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:55.220
is work with people who value
the same things that you do.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.720
And there's a big range on that.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.070
And I was recently
listening to a CEO talk.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:05.690
And the way that they
talked about life

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.530
being equivalent to the company.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.560
They said, point blank, in
this sort of Q&amp;A session.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.860
I absolutely have given my life
to this company for 20 years.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.640
my family have been the victims.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.300
This is completely, not
really apologetically,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.470
but just very candidly.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.219
I'm sure lots of other
people had done it,

00:39:24.219 --> 00:39:25.760
but they were owning it.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.330
And so, in the middle of it
they say, "I answer my emails

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.700
at 3:00 in the morning,
and I respond by 3:05."

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.770
And then, as if that wasn't
enough, that got our attention.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.390
Then they pointed to the
back of the room and said,

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.570
"And my assistant
is the same way.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.510
Isn't that right?"

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.780
And of course, all heads turned,
and this assistant at the back

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.700
is nodding, as you can imagine.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.640
And they say, "When I
email you at 4:00 AM,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.890
you respond by 4:05.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.240
Isn't that right?"
"That is right."

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.130
So, that is very
far on a spectrum,

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.690
but it only goes
to prove the point

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.700
that there is a whole range.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.440
And I think the selection
of who you spend time

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.940
with, including who
your manager is,

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.780
and being very
careful about that,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.940
will make a big difference
to the trade-offs

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:09.850
you have to make.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.040
I have found it in my life.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.290
I mean, I could sell a
personal story about this.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.190
I have found a high cost
to getting that wrong.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.530
Actually, maybe I'll share that.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.470
And maybe tie it up on this.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:25.520
So, my wife is here today, Anna.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.669
And so, she could tell you
this story maybe better

00:40:27.669 --> 00:40:28.210
than I could.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.820
Or at least, a different
perspective on it, but this

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.630
is how it worked.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.370
So my wife is expecting
one of our daughters.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:38.080
And I got an email from
my manager at the time,

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.730
and said, "Friday would be a
very bad time to have a baby.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.540
Because I need you to be
at this client meeting."

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.550
And you know, maybe
they were joking.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:53.247
But somehow, that stayed
with me through the week.

00:40:53.247 --> 00:40:55.080
And instead of being
able to focus, and just

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.840
enjoy this moment,
and so on, I was

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.010
torn trying to straddle both.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:00.020
Do them both.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.750
It's a nonessentialist
trick, right?

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.350
I can do both.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:04.120
I can fit them both in.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.490
And the day comes.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.740
Daughter's born on Friday.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.467
And I'm in the hospital,
baby's healthy.

00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:12.800
My wife's there looking radiant.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.030
And so, I said, filled
with clarity now.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:23.580
I said, with all the
conviction I could muster, yes.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.750
And so I went.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.900
I remember after the meeting,
my manager said to me,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.780
"The client will respect you
for the choice you made."

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.640
I don't know that they did.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.292
The look on their faces did not
evince that kind of confidence.

00:41:39.292 --> 00:41:43.130
But even if they had, and even
if some extraordinary thing

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.810
had come from it, which
nothing did, surely,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.580
even in those
best-case scenarios,

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.270
I had made a fool's bargain.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:52.845
It was there, in a
sort of quite deep way,

00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:54.690
that I learned this lesson.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.480
If you don't prioritize your
life, someone else will.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.882
This is not a neutral
game we're playing.

00:42:01.882 --> 00:42:03.090
People have their own things.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.048
They have their own
agendas, and we will simply

00:42:05.048 --> 00:42:07.710
become a function of those,
unless we deliberately

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.440
do something else.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.900
So, in the final analysis, we
can either choose deliberately

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.570
to pursue the vital few,
or we can, by default,

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.100
be pulled into the trivial many.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.910
So, again, thank
you for your time,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.450
and so great to be with you.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.230
Thank you.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.780
[APPLAUSE]
