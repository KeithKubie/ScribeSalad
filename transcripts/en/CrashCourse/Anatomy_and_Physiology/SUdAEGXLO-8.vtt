00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
Welcome to the main event!

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.879
After weeks of talking about our reproductive
parts and how they work, today we finally

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.370
discuss what happens when those parts come
together, to do what they were born to do

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.799
- the sex.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.160
But first, let’s talk about what we won’t
be talking about:

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.960
We’re not going to give any advice. We’re
not going to talk about STIs - even though

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990
some STIs can affect conception.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.310
We’re also not going to talk about sexual
behavior, or mate selection and there will

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.300
be no discussion of birds or bees.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.980
And while people have sex in lots of different
ways and for lots of different reasons, we’re

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.860
only going to be talking about the kind of
sex that could lead to fertilization.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.720
We are going to talk about contraception,
though, in terms of how, and where, and when

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.600
different kinds can prevent fertilization.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.440
And, we are going to look at what exactly
is going on in your body before, during, and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.480
after sex, in the most very safe for work,
clinical terms possible.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
Humans have been experiencing coitus for as
long as they could be called humans. And actually

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.310
before that, because obviously there would
be no humans without the sex.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.980
And although it’s something that comes pretty
naturally, it wasn’t until the late 1950s

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.750
and 60s that anyone thought to look at the
physiological science behind the act of sex.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.750
So when American gynecologist William Masters
and sexologist Virginia Johnson kicked off

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.850
their unprecedented -- and controversial -- research
into the so-called human sexual response cycle,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.370
they began by inviting hundreds of male and
female volunteers to come into the lab and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.860
have sex in the name of science.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.320
Though it wasn’t as voyeuristic as it might
sound.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.650
Outfitted with loads of wires and heart monitors,
volunteers were periodically interrupted in

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.370
the middle of the act to be measured.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.140
10,000 trials or so later, Masters and Johnson
found out some interesting stuff. Namely,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.660
that a typical complete sexual cycle runs
through four distinct phases: excitement,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.880
plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.820
During the excitement phase, things are just
getting going. Sexual arousal triggers the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.300
parasympathetic reflex that causes arterioles
in the external genitalia to dilate and fill

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.530
with blood, which is actually one of the only
times the parasympathetic system controls

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.890
any arteriole action.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.830
The plateau phase is marked by increased muscle
tension, heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.690
rates. Here the male urethral sphincter contracts
to make sure urine doesn’t mix with semen.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.110
During orgasm, pelvic and other muscles around
the body contract rhythmically as an anatomical

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.560
male ejaculates, releasing the sperm that
might just get a chance to fertilize an egg,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.010
depending on the situation.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
Female orgasm is not required for conception,
and some may never experience one. But if

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.060
it does happen, the resulting uterine contractions
and increased lubrication can help draw up

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.380
and hold sperm in the uterus.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.390
As the body relaxes after all that excitement,
it enters the resolution phase.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.480
Here we see males entering a refractory period
that may last several minutes to a day or

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.540
two, during which they are usually unable
to reach orgasm again.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.310
Anatomical females are thought not to need
this time out physiologically -- though they

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.320
may need it physically. Instead some females are
actually capable of serial orgasms, one after the other.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.280
Masters and Johnson’s work has its share
of critics, many of whom point out that not

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.860
everyone fits into their four-stage mold,
and that things are not always quite so linear

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.030
in the heat of the moment.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.160
But overall, their core physiological framework
is still accepted.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.810
Now, regardless of exactly how sex happens,
if it involves a fertile anatomical female

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.630
and male, and the timing is right, it could
ultimately end with fertilization.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.920
So how do a single little ovum, and an even
tinier sperm come together to make a fertilized

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.580
egg, or zygote, that divides and multiplies
and grows into the trillions of cells that

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.550
make up the glorious, complex individual that
is you?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.590
You’ll remember that during ovulation, about
once a month, an ovary releases a secondary

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.550
oocyte that heads down the fallopian tube
and toward the uterus.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.720
That oocyte has a window of about a day, or
less, to meet a sperm before it’s no longer

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.140
viable. But, that being said, sperm can persist in the
female reproductive tract for as much as 3-5 days.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.840
Which means, for fertilization to occur, they
have to either be in place during ovulation,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.870
or they have to arrive no more than a day
after.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.379
But now I feel like I’m getting a little
ahead of myself.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.079
Let’s go back to how sperm typically get
to the anatomical female body in the first place.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.720
During sex, if a male ejaculates into a female's vaginal
canal, millions of hopeful sperm will be on their way.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.580
Despite the fact that they only have about
a dozen or so centimeters to go, their journey

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.530
isn’t for the faint of heart. Luckily they
don’t have hearts.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.690
The truth is, most sperm never reach an oocyte.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.819
Some go in the wrong direction. Others are
killed in the strange new acidic environment

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.300
of the vaginal canal. And millions more fail to penetrate
the gauntlet of mucus that surrounds the cervix.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.700
Even the ones that swim hard enough and manage
to reach the uterus may then be culled by

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.529
defending resident white blood cells.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.319
In fact, sometimes only a dozen or so of the
original millions make it through all those

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.539
trials to actually reach an oocyte.

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.499
But even if they do it’s still not over
for them.

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.819
The sperm that do make it to the uterus, and
then the fallopian tube, have another hurdle

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.120
to overcome, because they can’t actually
penetrate an oocyte. Not yet.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.789
They could literally hang out right next to
one for hours, and be unable to make a move

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.520
until they are what’s known as “capacitated,”
and go through one last set of changes.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.659
As they swim through the cervix, uterus, and
fallopian tube, female secretions start to

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.339
degrade some of the sperm’s protective proteins
until the the cap on the tip of its little

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:57.009
head -- called the acrosome -- is fragile
enough it can leak special hydrolytic enzymes.

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.680
Those enzymes are the key to getting through
the oocyte’s protective outer layers.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.949
But before that it has to weave through the
granulosa cells that form the oocyte’s outermost

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.979
layer, known as the corona radiata.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.319
Once it’s past that, it runs into the zona
pellucida, a layer of glycoprotein that covers

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.050
the oocyte’s plasma membrane.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.180
And this is where it starts to get a warmer
reception: This layer has specific sperm receptors

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.550
waiting for it to bind to, and when it does,
it opens a bunch of calcium channels, which

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.729
flood the sperm with calcium ions.

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.309
These ions trigger the final acrosomal reaction
that releases the enzymes the sperm needs

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.839
to work through the zona pellucida.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.129
Now, a number of sperm make it to this phase.
And in terms of strategy or luck, it’s best

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.339
to arrive on the scene after your compadres
have already been hard at work digesting holes

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.439
through the pellucida.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.599
Because once a path is cleared, a lucky sperm
can wiggle against the now-exposed oocyte

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.439
membrane until it locks onto another set of
sperm-binding receptors. And when a sperm

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.490
docks into one of those, the membrane of the
sperm fuses with the innermost membrane of

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.950
the oocyte, and the contents of the sperm
enter the oocyte proper.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.050
Then something pretty cool happens.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.819
Remember that the “egg” is still just
a secondary oocyte here, and hasn’t completed

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.759
meiosis. As the sperm delivers its payload,
it causes a flash of calcium ions from the

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.509
oocyte’s endoplasmic reticulum.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.719
This tells the secondary oocyte to get ready
to complete its second meiotic division. But

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.409
it also triggers a reaction that suddenly
seals the egg by destroying all the leftover

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.699
sperm receptors in the membrane, preventing
any other sperm from weaseling in.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.029
The oocyte then quickly completes meiosis
II, leaving two daughter cells: the large

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.990
ovum and a puny second polar body.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.490
Meanwhile, the sperm’s detached nucleus
swells up to five times its original size, forming

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.979
the male pronucleus, one of two sort of proto-nuclei
that contain each gamete’s genetic information.

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.789
The other one, the female pronucleus, takes
shape from the nucleus of the ovum, and then

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.569
the two then start to approach each other,
pulled along a protein scaffolding, or

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.499
mitotic spindle, between the two.

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.879
When the membranes of the two pronuclei rupture,
chromosomes go flying, and boom, you officially

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.759
have a diploid zygote, which almost immediately
starts mitosis.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.189
And that, folks, is how you fertilize an egg.

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:02.179
But even though our bodies are made to have
lots of sex and babies, there are plenty of

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.259
people who are interested in enjoying the
sex part, without enjoying the baby part.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.879
And given all of the things that usually need
to go right to achieve fertilization and implantation,

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.599
a little disruption at some stage along they
way is usually all you need to remain baby-free.

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.189
So folks have been experimenting with various
herbal, chemical, physical, and behavioral

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.499
methods of contraception for centuries -- for
millennia.

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.869
Some of which have been pretty nutty, like
drinking cocktails laced with lead, or wearing

00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:31.349
weasel testicle amulets or rabbit butts, or shoving
herbs in places where herbs should not go.

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.140
But, of course, contraception has come a long
long way in recent years. In cultures that provide

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.520
access to it, folks have wide range of contraception
options -- you know, in addition to abstinence.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520
First, if you’re really sure you don’t want
kids, or more kids, sterilization is an option.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.860
During a tubal ligation or vasectomy procedure,
a doctor snips, blocks, burns, or ties up

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:54.659
the fallopian tubes or vas deferens, effectively
ending the gamete express by permanently preventing

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:57.339
sperm and egg from ever getting to the penis
or uterus.

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:00.069
But those who prefer a less permanent option
also have lots of choices.

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:04.399
We’ve got barrier methods that work mostly
by physically keeping sperm and egg on either

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.669
side of a wall, which is usually made of latex.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:10.610
Condoms, of course, cover the penis and catch
ejaculated sperm before it can go anywhere,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.240
while diaphragms, sponges, cervical caps,
and female condoms are inserted into the vagina

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.839
where they form a wall over the cervix, turning
sperm away.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:21.709
Hormonal methods of contraception -- like
the pill, or any number of newer shots, patches,

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:26.050
and rings -- use synthetic estrogen and progestin
to prevent the progression of the ovarian

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.839
cycle to ovulation, and sometimes make changes
to the functional uterine layer, the endometrium,

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:33.210
and cervical mucus to help deter sperm.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.320
An IUD, or intrauterine device, is a small
T-shaped object a medical provider inserts

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.740
into the uterus to prevent zygotes from implanting.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.020
And the implantation is key.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.780
Because, even if a sperm and egg manage to
complete fertilization, in order for gestation

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.530
to take place, the zygote has to find a home
for itself in the uterus pretty quickly, so

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.180
it gets the nutrients it needs to continue
developing.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.150
So that’s what we’re gonna be talking
about next time. It takes a long time to talk

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.880
about all the ways to make a baby -- but it’s
important!

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.810
But for now you learned about the four phases
of the human sexual response, how a sperm

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.390
finds and fertilizes an egg, creating a zygote,
and how different types of contraception work

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.810
to prevent that from happening.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.020
