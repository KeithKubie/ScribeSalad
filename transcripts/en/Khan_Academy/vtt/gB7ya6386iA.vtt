00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.291
- [Instructor] Here is a passage

00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:03.543
from the Scottish philosopher, writer,

00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:08.168
even a little bit of mathematics,
historian Thomas Carlyle.

00:00:08.168 --> 00:00:11.280
And, he wrote this On
Heroes, Hero-Worship,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.188
&amp; the Heroic in History.

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:15.839
And this is in reference to his view

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.640
on Mohammed and the spread of Islam.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.839
A poor shepherd people,

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.023
he's referring to the
Arabs before Mohammed,

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.125
roaming unnoticed in its deserts

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.214
since the creation of the world:

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:30.877
a Hero-Prophet was sent down to them

00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:33.075
with a word they could believe;

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:37.213
see the unnoticed becomes
the world-notable,

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.697
the small has grown world-great;

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:41.404
within one century afterwards,

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:45.923
Arabia is at Grenada on
this hand, at Delhi on that.

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:49.182
He's speaking of within 100
years of Mohammed's death,

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.797
the Muslim empire has spread
from what would eventually

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:56.508
be Southern Spain, all
the was to Northern India.

00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:01.286
These Arabs, the man Mahomet,
and that one century,

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:05.054
is it not as if a spark
had fallen, one spark,

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:08.419
on a world of what seemed
black unnoticeable sand;

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:12.143
but lo, the sand proves explosive powder,

00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:15.567
blazes heaven high from Delhi to Grenada.

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:19.734
I said, the Great Man was always
as lightning out of Heaven;

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:24.311
the rest of men waited for him like fuel,

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:27.529
and then they too would flame.

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:30.862
And Thomas Carlyle is known
as one of the proponents

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:33.885
of the of Great Man view of history,

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.934
that history is nothing but the story

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:38.485
of a series of great men,

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:43.026
who changed the direction
in which humanity travels.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:44.878
So, what we're gonna do in this video

00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:49.435
is think about whether it
really is all about a great man,

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:52.259
or were there other things
that were in the context

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.426
of the time and space in
which these things occur.

00:01:57.462 --> 00:02:01.079
This is what the world
looked like in the year 600.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.380
Mohammed starts spreading
his revelations in 610,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.570
and so you can see on this
map, there's two major powers:

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.700
the Byzantine, which is
the Eastern Roman Empire,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.288
the vestiges of the Roman Empire,

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:18.966
and you also have the
Sassanid Persian Empire.

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.630
The Byzantines are a Christian empire,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.354
and the Sassanids are Zoroastrian,

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:27.028
and Mohammed is from the Quraysh tribe,

00:02:27.028 --> 00:02:28.773
which is in charge of Mecca,

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.483
which is considered a pilgrimage site

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.168
for the various tribes of Arabia.

00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:36.118
But, you can see that
Arabia is fragmented,

00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:39.716
and this doesn't even do justice
to how fragmented it was.

00:02:39.716 --> 00:02:43.883
But, if you fast forward 200
years, you see a major change,

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.229
and in fact, you wouldn't
have to go all the way to 800,

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.746
even by the early eighth century,

00:02:50.746 --> 00:02:52.421
you see that Islam has spread

00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:56.524
from the Iberian peninsula
all the way to the Indus,

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:58.629
and most of this, as mentioned,

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.779
happens within 100 years
after Mohammed's death.

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.779
But, let's ask our central question:

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:09.811
why did Islam emerge so
rapidly where and when it did?

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:14.791
And there's no clear right
or wrong answer here,

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:16.647
it's all going to be conjecture,

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:18.209
but that's what's fun about history,

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.156
we can think about what we think we know,

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:23.607
and then we can debate,
and think about are there

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:26.753
some patterns here that we
see over and over in history?

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:28.810
Well, what's the context?

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.977
So, we know for a fact
that Arabia was fragmented,

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:37.348
that the law of the land
in Arabia was tribal,

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:39.548
and tribal justice, and this is the world

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:41.276
that Mohammed grew up in.

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:44.805
The various tribes often
worshiping different gods.

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.291
We also know at this time that Mohammed

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.450
had exposure to other religions,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.119
some of which had penetrated
the various tribes of Arabia.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.831
Most notably, you have Christianity,

00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.454
and Mohammed's wife's cousin
was, in fact, a Christian.

00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:01.621
And you also have Judaism.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.557
These two clearly being related religions,

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:08.480
Christianity coming out
of a Jewish tradition.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.011
We also know that the
two great empires here,

00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:13.514
the Byzantines and Persian empires

00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:15.641
are in constant conflict, and in fact,

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:17.852
the Arabs and many in the Middle East

00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:20.856
are the pawns in that conflict.

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:25.023
And so, you have the
Byzantines versus the Persians,

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:30.312
with the possibility of
those living in their lands

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.989
might not have been happy with either.

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:35.932
There's also the sense that
we're at the very beginning

00:04:35.932 --> 00:04:39.515
of a long decline for
the Byzantine Empire.

00:04:42.043 --> 00:04:46.210
So, one thesis could be that
Mohammed was able to bring

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.512
many of the ideas of
Christianity and Judaism,

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:55.679
but these ideas helped to
unify a fragmented Arab people.

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.568
And not only did it unify them,

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:02.519
but it gave them the energy

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.162
that you could have
through religious zeal,

00:05:05.162 --> 00:05:07.233
and that energy is what allowed them

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:10.349
not only to unify in Arabia,

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.273
and they're able to unify most of Arabia

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.505
by the time of Mohammed's death.

00:05:14.505 --> 00:05:16.590
But, within 100 years of his death,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.102
they're able to take over
the entire Sassanid Empire

00:05:20.102 --> 00:05:24.311
and make major inroads
into the Byzantine Empire.

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:26.275
And so, one argument might be,

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.726
and I encourage you to argue with me,

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:32.333
that they were unified, they
had this missionary zeal,

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.849
which perhaps was only seen
in Christianity before Islam,

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.749
and they were able to
take advantage of conflict

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.647
and discontent between the Byzantines

00:05:41.647 --> 00:05:44.314
and Persians in order to spread.

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:48.592
Now, another question is do
we see any patterns here?

00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:51.792
Are there any other examples
in history of this happening?

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.888
Well, the most comparable
religion is Christianity,

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:57.536
which is, today, larger than Islam,

00:05:57.536 --> 00:06:02.160
but Christianity, you have
a long period between Jesus,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.790
who is the central figure of Christianity,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.224
who is the underlying spiritual figure,

00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:11.139
and when Christianity really spreads,

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.992
and really becomes and empire,

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:16.325
and that really starts with Constantine,

00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:21.590
roughly 300 years after the time of Jesus.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.292
What's interesting about
the example in this video,

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:27.606
the example of Islam, in
terms of the religion,

00:06:27.606 --> 00:06:31.164
Mohammed plays a little
bit of both of these roles.

00:06:31.164 --> 00:06:35.580
He is a spiritual figure,
he has revelations,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.966
but he is also the founder of an empire,

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:43.133
he also governs, he is also a
military and political figure.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.875
And so, perhaps for the first
time in history on this scale,

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.149
you have the combination
of religious zeal,

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:57.102
of spiritual belief, of faith,
combined with governance,

00:06:57.102 --> 00:07:00.750
combined with the desire
to create an empire.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.172
In terms of empire, the only
thing that might be comparable

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:07.465
in terms of the vastness and
the speed in which it happens,

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:12.125
is the Mongol empire, the
Mongols are an example

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:16.105
of people who were
fragmented initially, tribal,

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:19.885
unified by Genghis Khan,
and through that unification

00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:22.977
were able to spread incredibly rapidly,

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:26.289
and take on some long historic

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.872
and possibly declining empires.

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:32.264
So, I'll leave you there,
it's a fascinating question

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.819
that historians debate to this day.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.905
Islam started awfully fast,
and spread awfully fast.

00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:40.528
Why did this happen?

00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:43.187
Was it some unique
characteristics of Mohammed?

00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:45.741
Was it some unique
characteristics of the religion?

00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:48.491
Or, as Thomas Carlyle alludes to,

00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:51.784
maybe this whole region was just waiting

00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:53.283
for something like this,

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:55.409
something to unify the tribes of Arabia

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:59.576
and take on the decaying
Byzantine and Sassanid empires.
