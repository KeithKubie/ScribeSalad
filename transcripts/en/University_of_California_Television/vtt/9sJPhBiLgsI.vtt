00:00:01.797 --> 00:00:03.610
- [Announcer] This program is presented

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.830
by University of California Television.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:47.544
- Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:50.911
I'm Mary Comerio, professor
of the graduate school

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.430
in the College of Environmental Design,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.500
and chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.120
We are pleased, along
with the graduate council,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.930
to present Lucy Jones, this year's speaker

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.510
in the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock lecture series.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.163
Dr. Lucy Jones has
served as a seismologist

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:10.630
with the U.S. Geological Survey

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.215
and a visiting research associate

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:17.215
at the seismological laboratory
at Cal Tech since 1983.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.690
She created the Science
Applications for Risk Reduction,

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:25.580
SAFRR, project to innovate and protect

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.386
safety, security, and economic
well-being of the nation.

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:31.530
One of the major projects of this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.647
is a shakeout earthquake scenario

00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:38.210
and a sort of public
emergency preparedness event

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.450
that began with five million people

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.830
in Southern California in 2008,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.990
and has expanded to more than

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.540
24 million people around the world.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.450
Now, let me tell you, Lucy got up

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.678
at 5:30 this morning and was out there

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.812
on the shakeout that took place today.

00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:56.531
So she was in Oakland helping

00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:58.720
with the office of emergency services.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.717
She's a real trooper with this.

00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:02.990
And these efforts have earned Lucy

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.320
the nickname "the Earthquake Lady."

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.048
She has sometimes been thought
of as the Earthquake Mother,

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:11.270
because she had to talk to
news reporters on camera

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.610
while holding one of her children.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.520
She is trusted and beloved,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.614
not just because she's a reassuring mom,

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:19.391
although that may be part of it,

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.620
but because she knows how to explain

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.120
complicated science to the public.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.528
In 2007, I was part of
a multi-year, seven year

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:31.604
research project with a large team

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:35.610
led here at Berkeley by
professor Jack Maley,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.592
who's here today, looking
at the risk reduction

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.980
in older concrete buildings.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.782
We chose the city of Los
Angeles as a case study,

00:02:44.782 --> 00:02:47.800
and we did extensive data collection

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.050
on the inventory of
buildings that were part of

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.780
our engineering analysis
of building performance

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.850
and part of our loss modeling.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.180
This work became background
data when, in 2014,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.860
Lucy Jones was asked to
serve on a special assignment

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.066
by the mayor of Los Angeles,

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:07.549
a science advisory
seismic safety committee

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.250
applying the results of
the shakeout scenario

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.865
and are using some of our
research in the background,

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.789
to look at the city's
older concrete buildings.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.297
The planning, water backup systems,

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:22.160
the fire department building,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.954
solar powered wireless networks.

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.900
A series of things.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.350
And the wonderful news about this amazing

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.777
year that she spent building a coalition

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:37.530
of different political groups
in the city of Los Angeles

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.196
was that on October 9th, just last week,

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:43.052
Lucy celebrated a triumphant moment

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:44.840
as the legislation was passed

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.592
and required mandatory
earthquake retrofits

00:03:47.592 --> 00:03:51.930
on 15000 buildings in Los Angeles.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.126
As researchers, we were in
tears, we were so happy.

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:57.757
We can't tell you how important this is

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:00.000
and how much it meant.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.348
But before I tell you
about her superb training,

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:06.230
let me tell you a story
about women in science.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.180
Although her father, an engineer,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.530
encouraged her interest
in math and science,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.774
her high school guidance counselor said,

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:15.110
you shouldn't show you're good at math

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.240
'cause boys won't like you.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.060
Even when she earned a perfect score

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.840
on the science aptitude test,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.828
the counselor assumed that she cheated

00:04:22.828 --> 00:04:25.240
and made her take the exam again

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.860
while the counselor watched.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.180
Of course, she had a perfect score again.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.453
Dr. Jones received a
bachelor of arts degree

00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:35.819
in Chinese language and
literature, magna cum laude,

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.970
from Brown University in 1976.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.217
At Brown, she also studied physics

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:45.212
and began to gravitate towards geophysics.

00:04:45.212 --> 00:04:49.380
Needless to say, she was
the only woman in physics.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.513
In 1981, she earned her
PhD in geophysics from MIT.

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:56.392
She is a fellow of the
American Geophysical Union,

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:59.700
member of the Resilient
America Round Table

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.630
of the National Academy of Science,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.170
and previously served on the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.970
California Seismic Safety Commission.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.642
She has received numerous awards,

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:10.650
including meritorious service award

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.360
from the Department of Interior,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.650
and the Ambassador Award from
the American Geophysical Union

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.900
for outstanding contributions
to policy and public service.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.737
In early October, very recently,

00:05:21.737 --> 00:05:23.966
she was awarded the Samuel J. Heyman

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:27.449
Service to American Medal
in citizens' services,

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.980
often referred to as the
Oscars of government service.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.400
The Sammies recognize federal workers

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.180
who have made a notable impact

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.040
in the United States and around the world.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.613
Despite being a woman in
a male-dominated field,

00:05:41.613 --> 00:05:43.668
Jones has never asked for special

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:46.000
treatment because of her gender.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.730
She never needed to.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.353
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Lucy Jones to Berkeley.

00:05:59.111 --> 00:05:59.961
- Thank you Mary!

00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:03.760
Well with that introduction.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.850
I think I'm gonna have
to acknowledge that,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.800
in fact, I think that there are times

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.426
where the gender has actually helped me,

00:06:12.426 --> 00:06:15.550
especially in these public roles.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.346
Because, you know, if
you ever have wondered

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:21.459
why you come and talk to a seismologist

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.456
after an earthquake anyway,

00:06:23.456 --> 00:06:26.370
why do you care about which fault it is,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.552
doesn't help you rebuild your building.

00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:30.828
In fact I sort of, we give it a name,

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:33.830
we give it a number, we give it a fault,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.030
we make it sound more
understandable, less frightening.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.750
And I think people always feel better

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.040
when mommy tells them it's
okay than when daddy does.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.170
So when a woman scientist gets up there,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.400
we seem to be remembered more than the men

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.423
when they do exactly the same thing.

00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.247
This talk is a bit of an experiment.

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:56.206
I haven't given a preliminary
version of this anywhere,

00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:59.259
so you get to be my test subjects.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.860
What I want to do is to actually

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.054
take what happened in Los Angeles

00:07:04.054 --> 00:07:06.364
over the last year-and-a-half

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:09.545
and the really pretty
extraordinary experience

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:11.856
of trying to work that closely

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:15.432
with elected officials as a scientist,

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:18.416
and what insight I've been able to gain

00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:20.980
about the nature of the interaction

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.255
and why we so often seem to
be talking past each other,

00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:26.229
and try and take from that

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.770
some lessons for all of us as scientists

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.350
about what we, ways in which we could

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.193
do a more effective job of communicating.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.190
Mary already told you
quite a bit about this.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.180
Of course, in Southern California,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.620
as up here, the scientists have been

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.882
doing a lot of work to understand
the nature of the risk.

00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:52.882
Back in 2007 into 2008, we
created the shakeout scenario.

00:07:54.012 --> 00:07:57.088
You probably all went
through the shakeout drill.

00:07:57.088 --> 00:08:00.595
That was created to help people understand

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:05.595
the scientific model that
we had already created.

00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:07.653
So we had hundreds of experts

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.550
trying to with the cutting edge science

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.203
from basic geology through seismology,

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:15.339
engineering, and the social sciences,

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:17.058
to get a comprehensive picture

00:08:17.058 --> 00:08:19.300
of what the big earthquake would be like.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.190
And the drill was actually created

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.804
to help people understand it.

00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:25.510
And that's been out there and
we've been talking about it,

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.520
but it hasn't, you know,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.850
there's only some
traction that it's gained.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.905
A lot of emergency managers
used it for response,

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:35.541
but we weren't seeing people picking it up

00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.398
as a way of understanding

00:08:37.398 --> 00:08:39.465
how they could change the outcomes,

00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:40.930
you know, that we weren't trying to do it

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.570
to say how bad it's gonna be.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.945
We were trying to say how bad it could be

00:08:44.945 --> 00:08:48.045
and why don't we not get there.

00:08:48.045 --> 00:08:50.378
So we've been hoping to get more traction

00:08:50.378 --> 00:08:55.208
on how to use the information
to stop the losses.

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:58.220
And then, in a large part actually,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.270
because of the peer
study and the concrete,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.980
well, it was only a mix of it.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.410
Because of what's been
going on in San Francisco,

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.740
we went and approached
the mayor of Los Angeles.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.900
We wanted to tell him about

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.060
the CAPSS Project in San Francisco,

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.700
which has been a decade-long effort

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.210
since the anniversary
of the 1906 earthquake,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.103
the centennial, to really try
and bring people together.

00:09:18.103 --> 00:09:20.669
We wanted to get something
similar going in Los Angeles.

00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:23.397
And we had the meeting set up,

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.636
and the Los Angeles
Times ran a bit article

00:09:26.636 --> 00:09:30.920
about the concrete buildings
and the whole peer study

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.010
that came out two days before the meeting,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.388
which had been already set
for a couple of months.

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:39.340
It did affect the nature
of the discussions.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.209
We had a little more focus

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:42.902
on what we were trying to talk about.

00:09:42.902 --> 00:09:46.070
So the mayor was very interested

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.296
and a big piece of this, I have to say,

00:09:49.296 --> 00:09:51.990
is really Mayor Garcetti having

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.950
the intelligence to understand the issues

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.586
and the confidence to take them on.

00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:59.966
We've had previous elected officials

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.310
with one or the other,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.860
and you really need to
have them both in place

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.257
to get action on a
difficult project like this.

00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:09.030
What we ended up negotiating

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.146
was me actually spending
the year at City Hall,

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:15.129
which is about as different
a place from Cal Tech

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:17.125
as any place I can imagine.

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:20.446
I've spent my whole career
on campus at Cal Tech

00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:22.698
where, I think even more
than this institution,

00:10:22.698 --> 00:10:25.200
I don't have to worry about somebody

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.940
trying to look at me, let
alone try to talk to me.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.467
And to go down to City Hall

00:10:29.467 --> 00:10:32.137
and have people talking to me all the time

00:10:32.137 --> 00:10:35.343
was an interesting experience.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.952
But I'd like to take
this and look at some of

00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:43.770
what happened here and how
I came to understand it,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.750
and where it took us.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.493
Just remind you that, you
know, we set these goals,

00:10:50.493 --> 00:10:52.687
looking at what all the
earthquake issues are.

00:10:52.687 --> 00:10:55.311
We wanted to protect the
lives of our citizens,

00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:57.807
we wanted to improve
our ability to respond,

00:10:57.807 --> 00:11:00.164
and make sure we were ready for recovery.

00:11:00.164 --> 00:11:04.700
Well, these have been our
goals for a long time, right?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.940
That hadn't changed.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.183
What's changed is how we've
been able to respond to it.

00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:15.183
And here's a quick list of
what the mayor's plan is.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.171
It's extremely comprehensive,

00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:20.969
addressing multiple areas of problems

00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:25.857
with the built environment,
particularly old buildings,

00:11:25.857 --> 00:11:29.960
and the mandatory retrofit
of soft-first story,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.730
concrete, and excessive damage.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.800
Buildings that are badly
damaged in an earthquake

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.118
have to be strengthened
and not just repaired.

00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:39.910
Those are the ones that were wrapped up

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.360
into one ordinance that
passed last Friday,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.398
a really big deal.

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:47.330
The voluntary rating
system, it's voluntary,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.780
it doesn't require inspection.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.301
Both of these have already been in place.

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.260
Most of these other items

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.460
are underway and getting started.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.450
So it's been a, it's a huge project,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.630
it's comprehensive and it's

00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:04.410
more than I thought I was
gonna get going into City Hall.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.650
So why?

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.253
What did we do differently this time?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.010
What I wanna do is start with some

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.740
sort of basic things of thinking about

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.610
what the scientific process is

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.249
and how that compares with the way

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:17.880
the rest of the world works.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.030
I don't know how many of you watch the,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.634
what is it, xkcd cartoons.

00:12:22.634 --> 00:12:27.033
The difference between
normal people and scientists,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.364
the question of, with the science,

00:12:32.364 --> 00:12:36.404
we don't think that coincidence

00:12:36.404 --> 00:12:40.120
is automatically causality.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.488
And in fact, I think you can put this,

00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:47.140
that scientists actively reject stories.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.406
Stories give you the wrong answer, right?

00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:52.948
You go through this
situation and who knows

00:12:52.948 --> 00:12:55.560
whether or not it was
really connected to that.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.310
You have to test it over and over again.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.110
The scientific process is the process

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.970
of making sure you are
not misled by a story,

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.500
that you go to your statistics

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.860
and you work out all of the details.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.450
And in fact, I'm gonna do this to people.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.090
How many of you are
scientists in the room?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.779
Okay, definitely the majority.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:21.650
So you have a pretty good idea

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.200
of how the scientific method works,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.370
and it's not what your kid tends

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.870
to get taught in fourth grade, right?

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.568
You tend to notice something that happens.

00:13:28.568 --> 00:13:30.425
You actually wonder whether it's

00:13:30.425 --> 00:13:33.200
a coincidence or coincidental,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.369
and you go and set up tests for it.

00:13:36.369 --> 00:13:39.342
You come up with a model that you think

00:13:39.342 --> 00:13:41.070
would explain that pattern

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.440
that's actually consistent with

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.740
the rest of the physics that you do.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.586
You make predictions from the model

00:13:46.586 --> 00:13:48.316
and you test the predictions.

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:52.600
Only after all of this do you
present it to your colleagues

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.503
and you make sure you explain
all of this along the way,

00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:58.022
and your colleagues then go
and rip you to shreds, right?

00:13:58.022 --> 00:14:02.712
This is a core piece also
of the scientific process.

00:14:02.712 --> 00:14:05.230
That's the point of peer review,

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.800
it's to keep you from fooling yourself.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.572
You may have thought you avoided
that story that misled you.

00:14:10.572 --> 00:14:13.754
Your colleagues have the
job of making sure of that.

00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:16.761
And this affects quite a bit about

00:14:16.761 --> 00:14:20.660
how we go about communicating
with each other.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.660
Because, as colleagues, our job
is to attack our colleagues.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.429
It is to find the
weaknesses in the argument.

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:30.936
And we get taught this in grad school.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:34.733
So we never ever give the answer first.

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:37.690
You know you're gonna be
pulled apart by your colleagues

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.470
if you've given the answer already.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.510
Before you say what your result is,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.800
you make sure you explain
the full background,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.867
how you laid out the experiment,

00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:48.409
all the uncertainties that you considered,

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:51.800
and only then do you give the result.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.680
Because otherwise, your colleagues
are gonna get that result

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.140
and immediately jump to
ideas of why it's wrong.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.800
So you don't communicate that way.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.295
You always start with
the previous information

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:04.048
and work your way down

00:15:04.048 --> 00:15:06.953
and give your result as the last thing.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.271
This is classically the opposite

00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:13.430
of the way most of the
rest of the world operates,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.300
and especially journalists.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.179
When you read a newspaper article,

00:15:17.179 --> 00:15:19.443
they start with the result,

00:15:19.443 --> 00:15:22.930
then they give you a
bit of why this matters,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.180
and only when you get down
to the bottom of the article,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.440
for the few people who make
it all the way through,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.680
do they give you that background

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.960
information to set the context.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.141
So when we go and communicate this way,

00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:37.920
we've got half of the
people listening to us

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.258
who have stopped listening
before we ever get to the result.

00:15:41.258 --> 00:15:43.081
This is, I think, really,

00:15:43.081 --> 00:15:46.842
you've got the core issue, I think,

00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:50.209
and how our communications
tend to fall apart

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:52.310
is right in here.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.656
And there's a lot of other
things that fall out of it.

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:59.590
If we go ahead and look at
it in a bit more detail,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.783
there's so many different ways

00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:06.661
in which we differ
between the way you handle

00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:10.110
scientific arguments or
scientific expression,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.140
and the way journalists do it,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.330
which is essentially the way

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.860
most of the rest of the world does it.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.970
And part of this is writing.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.893
This was actually done up as an exposition

00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:26.212
on how differently scientists
and journalists write.

00:16:26.212 --> 00:16:29.614
But it really can also
go into how we speak.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.889
And when we talk about our results,

00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:35.465
we're going to always
give our evidence first.

00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:37.915
We're always gonna talk
about the uncertainties.

00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:40.016
We always try to make sure

00:16:40.016 --> 00:16:42.268
that there's a logical argument.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:45.008
And we think that people
make their decisions

00:16:45.008 --> 00:16:49.989
on logical arguments, which
also, in general, isn't true.

00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:53.878
Another fundamental difference between

00:16:53.878 --> 00:16:56.479
scientists and the rest of the world

00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:58.894
is we live in uncertainty.

00:16:58.894 --> 00:17:03.894
If it's already understood,
it is no longer interesting.

00:17:04.072 --> 00:17:07.460
Nobody's doing research on
things that are well-understood.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.410
That's not what we wanna talk about,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.490
it's not what we wanna thing about.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.973
We think about what we don't know.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.240
But when we're looking at what it is

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.070
that people need to have from us,

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.777
they want to know what we do know,

00:17:21.777 --> 00:17:24.540
the part that we're no
longer caring about.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.960
And again, when we talk about our results,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.725
we're gonna make sure we explain
what the uncertainties are,

00:17:32.725 --> 00:17:35.970
and people, non-scientists,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.220
often hear that as what we don't know.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.200
And in fact, I'll get to a
little more detail on this later,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.410
but there's a very significant issue

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.560
when we deal with earthquakes,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.190
of how afraid people are of earthquakes,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.910
that really is out of proportion
to the risk that they pose.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.098
And when you look at what
makes people afraid of things,

00:17:55.098 --> 00:17:59.637
uncertainty increases fear.

00:17:59.637 --> 00:18:02.017
If somebody says, you know,

00:18:02.017 --> 00:18:05.082
we know exactly what could happen,

00:18:05.082 --> 00:18:07.602
that is less frightening to most people

00:18:07.602 --> 00:18:11.500
than not knowing what might come through.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.610
And so when we're communicating
in crisis situations,

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.170
it is a time when people particularly

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.618
want certainty from us, right?

00:18:19.618 --> 00:18:24.080
And it's very tempting to
go and say we are certain.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.780
Well scientists will tell
you all about the uncertainty

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.790
and leave people upset because of that.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.601
The non-scientists tend
to move to certainty

00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:32.575
even when it isn't there,

00:18:32.575 --> 00:18:35.292
and say, don't worry,
we've got this handled.

00:18:35.292 --> 00:18:38.275
And then if it turns out, in fact,

00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:43.275
that they were wrong, it
actually becomes worse.

00:18:44.034 --> 00:18:46.019
And in fact, there have been some studies,

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:48.968
you're gonna see some work,

00:18:48.968 --> 00:18:51.847
Tim Sellnow and Deanna Sellnow,

00:18:51.847 --> 00:18:54.610
they were at the University of Kentucky,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.200
they just moved a month ago
to the University of Florida,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.299
have done a lot of work in analyzing

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:04.305
how messages are perceived.

00:19:04.305 --> 00:19:07.019
They're professors of risk communication.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:09.518
And show a couple of different examples,

00:19:09.518 --> 00:19:12.830
when you look at the number
of stories that are created.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.200
So what we've got here is versus time,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.900
number of stories, the
red's about swine flue,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.640
the green is about vaccines,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.100
and the blue is about
shortages of the vaccine.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.110
So early on, people were saying,

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.336
don't worry, we've got
the vaccine, it's coming.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:31.840
When, in fact, it didn't come,

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.701
then there was a whole
other set of stories

00:19:33.701 --> 00:19:36.801
that developed about the shortages,

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.727
and got people much more
distressed about this

00:19:39.727 --> 00:19:44.070
because they had been proved wrong.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.064
Similar sort of data from media coverage,

00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:48.470
I don't know if you remember

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.836
when there was salmonella in peanut paste.

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:53.880
And peanut paste turns out

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.759
to be put into all sorts of
different manufactured foods.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:59.534
Originally they denied that it was there,

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:01.519
denied that there was a relationship.

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:04.530
When more information came out later,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.120
you get this whole other surge

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.530
of extremely negative stories

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.520
because of the fact of being proved wrong.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.500
And it's just to say that

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.519
the uncertainty we talk
about causes distress.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.342
Turning it into certainty,

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:21.070
if you aren't gonna be
able to pull it off,

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.263
turns out to have a whole
other suite of problems.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.850
If we go back to some of the more

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.114
fundamentals about science communication,

00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:32.018
there's a lot of ways in which we can use

00:20:32.018 --> 00:20:35.130
this thought about certainty versus

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.890
uncertainty in how we describe it.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.716
So especially on the earthquake side,

00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:42.943
people are often asking us if
we can predict earthquakes.

00:20:42.943 --> 00:20:44.570
Which we can't, right?

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.670
There's nothing that's different

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.280
about the beginning of a six than a three,

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.793
so it's nothing, you know.

00:20:49.793 --> 00:20:52.040
The threes are happening all the time,

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.714
so we don't see any changes
because the six is coming.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.059
But people ask us that question,

00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:00.138
and us literal-minded scientists

00:21:00.138 --> 00:21:02.630
try to answer the question we're asked.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.150
That's also one of the
mistakes that we tend to make.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.500
Just as a general, answer the question

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.774
they should've asked instead
of the one they asked,

00:21:09.774 --> 00:21:12.290
and you're often gonna
be a lot better off.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.605
And if you ever listen to a politician,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.556
you realize that they never get bothered

00:21:15.556 --> 00:21:17.880
by the idea of answering a different

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.724
question than they were asked.

00:21:19.724 --> 00:21:23.427
When you look at what
happens with earthquakes,

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:25.180
you see this a lot.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.829
Because people ask us when
the next one's coming,

00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:28.431
we can't answer it,

00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:31.566
we've created a whole
series of probability maps

00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:35.410
expressing the probability
that we would be having this.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:38.114
We tend to do a lot of
miscommunication through this method.

00:21:38.114 --> 00:21:41.492
We're always choosing
30 years to express it.

00:21:41.492 --> 00:21:43.768
I don't know if you
know that we do 30 years

00:21:43.768 --> 00:21:45.951
because it's the length of
most people's mortgages,

00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:47.901
and therefore a timeframe on which

00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:50.153
they are making financial decisions.

00:21:50.153 --> 00:21:52.520
And we were asked to use 30 years

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.646
so we faithfully come
along and use 30 years.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:58.060
And I would say probably half
of the population hearing this

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.370
thinks we know something about 30 years,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.530
and that that's the
reason that we chose it.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.117
So, in general, I'm not sure how much good

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.845
we've done with this,
because there's a lot

00:22:08.845 --> 00:22:11.179
of misinterpretation that comes through.

00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:14.024
And we also had the issue that the places

00:22:14.024 --> 00:22:16.554
that don't have the
really high probabilities

00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:18.308
say, oh, I'm okay.

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:20.757
I don't have a figure of this,
the classic one is San Diego.

00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:24.960
They look at the red around
Los Angeles and San Francisco

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.820
and they're only yellow to orange.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.815
Hey, we're good, we don't
have the problem that they do.

00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:30.649
Any other state in the union

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.983
they'd be the most
dangerous city there was.

00:22:32.983 --> 00:22:35.676
So again, what we are
communicating as we do this,

00:22:35.676 --> 00:22:37.603
as we focus on the probabilities,

00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:41.295
is we tend to increase the
feeling of uncertainty.

00:22:41.295 --> 00:22:44.221
And what we're ignoring,
then, is the fact that,

00:22:44.221 --> 00:22:46.949
in fact, we know exactly
what's gonna be happening

00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:50.420
in the earthquake, we
just don't know when.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.011
So by turning to scenarios,

00:22:52.011 --> 00:22:55.204
so this is a scenario
we're working on right now

00:22:55.204 --> 00:22:57.970
to get a much more detailed picture

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.060
of what we expect to happen
on the Hayward Fault.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.120
We're calling it the Haywired Scenario,

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.549
'cause we're looking at the
impact on the digital economy,

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:09.960
as well as from the basic science of it.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.130
By focusing on this, yeah,
we don't know when it is,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.650
but we can tell you
what's gonna be happening.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.620
And we have a lot of details
and a lot of certainty,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.559
and by going to scenarios,
we have been able

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:23.265
to focus on what we know

00:23:23.265 --> 00:23:25.785
rather than on what we don't know.

00:23:25.785 --> 00:23:27.840
We increase the feeling of certainty.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.173
There's an acceptance that
we don't know the time,

00:23:30.173 --> 00:23:32.461
but we're able to focus on the fact

00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:35.420
that, you know, time's not predicted,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.520
a lot of other things are,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.770
and a lot of other things
that can be useful.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:44.670
Another significant issue
in these differences

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:48.308
is really how we treat
conflict and consensus.

00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:53.308
To a journalist, the
story is in the conflict.

00:23:53.985 --> 00:23:56.410
Just like to a playwright.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.450
They look for where there's disagreement,

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.719
and that's where you hear the story.

00:24:00.719 --> 00:24:03.842
So most journalist come in

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:06.570
and they hear an argument
between two people,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.230
they think that's significant,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.370
and in politics it is.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.815
Of course, in science,
argument's what we do every day.

00:24:13.815 --> 00:24:16.010
That is the scientific process,

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.879
where one person has a model

00:24:17.879 --> 00:24:20.015
and the other person's
trying to break it down,

00:24:20.015 --> 00:24:24.462
and the process by which we
find truth is the conflict.

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:28.340
So when we have a story
is when we have consensus.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.990
When you've got everybody agreeing

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.660
and we stop being interested in it,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.363
that's when you actually
have your scientific results.

00:24:37.272 --> 00:24:40.890
And again, here's another problem.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.200
Once it's settled and we've moved on,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.270
that's really when we need to make sure

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:48.170
that it's being communicated
to the decision-makers.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.760
So just the whole scientific process

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.511
does not encourage us to communicate

00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:55.830
focused on the complete certainties.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.190
It tends to get us focused
on the uncertainties,

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.713
which is what we want to do anyway.

00:25:01.892 --> 00:25:04.969
Another difference, I think,
that's significant in this

00:25:04.969 --> 00:25:09.969
is that the work in science is in details.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.420
You might eventually be able to pull

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.698
everything back to a big unifying theory,

00:25:14.698 --> 00:25:16.788
but to prove that something's true,

00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:20.526
you need to get down
into the tiniest details,

00:25:20.526 --> 00:25:24.090
be able to isolate one
factor from all others,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.923
and be able to prove
what that one factor does

00:25:26.923 --> 00:25:31.811
without the confusion
of the other factors.

00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:36.811
So, in most sciences, we do our
work deep down in the weeds.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.008
We are really focused
on separating it out.

00:25:40.008 --> 00:25:41.981
And that also is gonna be how

00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:44.000
we tend to talk with each other.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.710
Because, to our colleagues, again,

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.760
it's where the interest is.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.737
But in general, those details are not

00:25:49.737 --> 00:25:52.616
what a policymaker needs to go

00:25:52.616 --> 00:25:55.230
and make decisions about this.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.109
So it's one more place where I see

00:25:57.109 --> 00:26:00.743
our cultural differences

00:26:00.743 --> 00:26:03.123
get in the way of the communication.

00:26:03.123 --> 00:26:07.163
So if we sort of sum it up,
what the scientists are doing,

00:26:07.163 --> 00:26:12.005
we're rejecting stories, we're
spending most of our time

00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:16.290
dealing with uncertainties and
details about uncertainties,

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.284
and we expect to be arguing
with each other all the time.

00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:21.444
That's what our process is.

00:26:21.444 --> 00:26:25.066
So by comparison, what goes
on with an average person?

00:26:25.066 --> 00:26:30.066
Richard Feynman had the classic
scientist address to it,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.040
if they can understand it,
it must not be worth doing.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.386
So there is an aspect of it that we

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:40.658
don't find any incentive to make our work

00:26:40.658 --> 00:26:43.561
understandable to the more general person.

00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:45.883
But compared to the scientists want,

00:26:45.883 --> 00:26:49.270
they do respond to stories, those are very

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.740
important in making emotional connections.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.240
They want to know what's known,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.980
they don't want to know
what we don't know.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.980
They wanna hear that there
isn't conflict, I miswrote that.

00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:04.389
They want to know what's the consensus

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:07.370
rather than the conflict,
and the want the big picture,

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.590
they wanna understand
how it matters to them.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.294
So we have some very
fundamental differences in here.

00:27:13.294 --> 00:27:17.137
And a lot of them are tied
around emotional issues.

00:27:17.137 --> 00:27:20.794
Decision-making is much more emotional

00:27:20.794 --> 00:27:24.570
than most scientists would
like to know that it is.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.280
You can make the logical argument

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.992
and they will use the logical argument,

00:27:27.992 --> 00:27:32.079
but people need to feel how
they connect to that story

00:27:32.079 --> 00:27:34.552
to want to take any action on it.

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:36.409
So then we need to get into

00:27:36.409 --> 00:27:39.242
a lot of the ideas around how people

00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:42.632
perceive their risks and respond to it.

00:27:42.632 --> 00:27:44.950
And again, there's some really interesting

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.452
research that's been put together

00:27:46.452 --> 00:27:50.701
in social sciences about
how people look at risk

00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:53.697
and how it affects their decision-making.

00:27:53.697 --> 00:27:57.540
Quite literally writing the book on it,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.750
the book is called The Perception of Risk,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:00.950
it's by Paul Slovic.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.403
He's a psychologist out of
the University of Oregon

00:28:03.403 --> 00:28:05.270
and much of the field is developed

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.571
from work from him and his students.

00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:09.533
But they've been able to identify

00:28:09.533 --> 00:28:12.226
several things that really increase

00:28:12.226 --> 00:28:17.114
fear and how people respond
to emotional messages.

00:28:17.114 --> 00:28:21.189
One of the biggest ones
is the involuntary.

00:28:21.189 --> 00:28:25.580
We are quite happy to choose
things that are risky.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.490
We drive on the freeway all the time,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.641
and it's one of the most
dangerous things we do.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:32.320
But we have the illusion
that we're in control,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.181
'cause we're holding the steering wheel,

00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:37.240
and we've chosen to do it.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.230
So we are much more upset about

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.938
risks that are imposed on us

00:28:40.938 --> 00:28:45.489
than when they come out of
things that we chose to do,

00:28:45.489 --> 00:28:48.020
and earthquakes are sort of the ultimate

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.503
out-of-control experience,
and generate a lot of this.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.254
We're also more afraid of things

00:28:54.254 --> 00:28:57.331
that have the potential for
affecting a whole society,

00:28:57.331 --> 00:28:59.514
potentially catastrophic,

00:28:59.514 --> 00:29:03.423
increases our feeling
of it being dangerous.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.690
An interesting on is, they call it

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.710
the dreadedness of the outcome.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.357
If it's a really awful death,

00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:12.290
it's somehow much worse to us

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.583
than a death that
wouldn't be that painful.

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:17.010
If we really wanted to
make our lives safer,

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.510
we'd shut down McDonald's, right?

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:20.020
We would be trying to deal with

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.327
the heart disease that we're facing.

00:29:22.327 --> 00:29:25.206
But the idea of being
trapped in a downed building

00:29:25.206 --> 00:29:27.710
and then the fire comes through,

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.810
I mean that's about as
awful as you can think of,

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.810
and again, earthquakes hit
a lot of those buttons.

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.734
The other thing is the idea

00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:42.734
that it is invisible, unpredictable,
and unknown to science.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.540
They all sort of tie together.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.870
It increases that feeling

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.530
that we aren't in control of things.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.281
And to the public, science,

00:29:52.281 --> 00:29:56.970
it looks like we don't
understand earthquakes.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.440
Partly because we get this focus

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.520
on when they're gonna happen,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.685
which is the one part we really can't do.

00:30:01.685 --> 00:30:05.621
It's also, though, that we don't do

00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.810
a very good job of communicating
what we understand.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.253
And I see this as a fundamental,

00:30:10.253 --> 00:30:12.850
back to that answering the question

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.502
they should have asked idea,

00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:16.650
the reporter comes in,
the earthquake happens,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.077
they're faced with a scientist,

00:30:19.077 --> 00:30:20.841
my god, how do I get this guy talking?

00:30:20.841 --> 00:30:23.480
All right, what did you
learn in this earthquake?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.380
'Cause that's a good way to get

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.860
a scientist to get talking, right?

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.930
The scientist takes it literally.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.560
They wanna know what I
learned in this earthquake.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.601
So they tell them what we didn't
know about the earthquake,

00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:36.062
instead of replying, actually,

00:30:36.062 --> 00:30:38.080
this was really predictable damage,

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.913
we got the, you know,

00:30:38.913 --> 00:30:41.205
the buildings we thought were
gonna come down came down.

00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:43.360
That's not the answer you give

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.340
to what did you learn in this earthquake.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.860
So we tend to give messages
that we don't understand them,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.271
and there's a very strong
perception in the public

00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:53.512
that the damage is quixotic

00:30:53.512 --> 00:30:55.938
and we don't know where it's gonna happen.

00:30:55.938 --> 00:30:59.247
There's another issue that has

00:30:59.247 --> 00:31:01.337
a pretty strong impact on how

00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:05.215
people perceive our information,

00:31:05.215 --> 00:31:07.650
and it's what's called numeracy.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.731
You know, it's like literacy,

00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:12.076
people who can understand numbers.

00:31:12.076 --> 00:31:14.062
And so there's one fundamental issue

00:31:14.062 --> 00:31:16.883
that there are a chunk of people

00:31:16.883 --> 00:31:19.730
who are, who don't really
understand numbers.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.600
They are not necessarily stupid people.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.233
There are some very bright people

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:25.521
that are considered less numerate.

00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:28.922
And highly numerate individuals

00:31:28.922 --> 00:31:32.638
do do a better job of
handling probabilities.

00:31:32.638 --> 00:31:36.422
You will often see in this
situation an overthinking.

00:31:36.422 --> 00:31:39.140
Well I mean, come on,
10 percent in 30 years?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.350
I think I'm fine, you know?

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.332
You can overanalyze some of the numbers.

00:31:42.332 --> 00:31:45.316
But you also see that
the emotional impacts

00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:47.220
have a much higher effect

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.867
on the people with low numeracy.

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:52.053
And it's something, you know,

00:31:52.053 --> 00:31:54.150
there's actually been quite a bit

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.647
of research on how people handle this,

00:31:56.647 --> 00:31:59.093
and it's not an obvious thing.

00:31:59.093 --> 00:32:01.024
Like I said, it's not being stupid,

00:32:01.024 --> 00:32:02.963
but there is a significant percentage

00:32:02.963 --> 00:32:05.703
of the population that
does not process numbers

00:32:05.703 --> 00:32:08.200
the way we think about it.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.695
We also have discovered that even when,

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:15.695
even highly numerate
people can misinterpret,

00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:19.588
they don't use the probabilities

00:32:19.588 --> 00:32:21.960
when strong emotions are involved.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.570
And so even the people who think

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.220
they're being very logical,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.274
we will see with strong emotions

00:32:27.274 --> 00:32:30.850
that there are extreme reactions

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.500
to something that would really

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.449
be a very low probability risk.

00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:36.860
But if it's got a strong
emotion attached to it,

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.838
that doesn't really go through.

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:41.270
And I just had to add this other one,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.550
'cause I find this really odd,

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.951
that even highly numerate people

00:32:47.951 --> 00:32:51.284
respond differently to what's called

00:32:51.284 --> 00:32:54.198
relative frequency instead
of to probabilities.

00:32:54.198 --> 00:32:58.006
If you say something has a
one in 10 chance of happening,

00:32:58.006 --> 00:33:00.328
people see it as being more likely

00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:02.824
than when you say 10 percent.

00:33:02.824 --> 00:33:05.065
Even people who understand numbers,

00:33:05.065 --> 00:33:07.480
there is an emotional reaction.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.163
They think it's tied to,

00:33:09.163 --> 00:33:11.740
when you say one in 10,
you're focusing on that one,

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.689
you're focusing on things
that have a bad outcome.

00:33:14.689 --> 00:33:17.780
Whereas a 10 percent chance is sort of

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.018
focusing on it not happening.

00:33:20.018 --> 00:33:22.840
And it applies across the board,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.510
however much education you've got

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.110
and what level of numeracy you've got.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.884
We always see more compelling responses

00:33:31.884 --> 00:33:34.252
when you use frequencies.

00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:37.460
Which actually changed
some of my behavior,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.280
'cause I sort of recognized
not everybody got it,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.310
and I used to say, well you know,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.590
there's a five percent chance

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:42.920
that this will be a four shock.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.771
That means that it's a one in 20 chance,

00:33:44.771 --> 00:33:46.907
95 percent chance that it won't happen.

00:33:46.907 --> 00:33:48.390
And I would tend to give them

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.630
all of these different numbers,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.249
some of them with relative frequency

00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:53.490
and some with probabilities.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.270
And that was probably a
really bad way of doing it,

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.494
because people hear
them differently enough,

00:33:58.494 --> 00:34:01.373
it ends up confusing the messages.

00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:04.647
Okay, let me go back then and say,

00:34:04.647 --> 00:34:06.570
if we've got these sort of differences,

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.960
how are we trying to bridge the gaps?

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.320
And I think, there's a couple of ways

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.290
in which we've gone about doing this.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.010
One is recognizing that our scientific

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.050
belief that logic is how
people make decisions,

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.370
we just needs to accept that

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:24.530
that's not true in a lot of people.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.116
And especially in the elected environment,

00:34:27.116 --> 00:34:29.220
they need to be responding

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.370
to the emotions of their constituents.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.030
And that, the value-based judgment

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.900
is how it is going to be happening.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.958
And if you wanna convince
an elected official

00:34:38.958 --> 00:34:41.361
to take an action, you don't do it

00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:44.751
by giving him numbers
and giving him the logic.

00:34:44.751 --> 00:34:47.015
What you need to do is help them

00:34:47.015 --> 00:34:50.011
be able to see how this action

00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:53.663
or decision affects their world.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.546
And one of the things that I've done

00:34:57.546 --> 00:35:00.180
within the USGS over the last decade

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.888
is leading a program to develop

00:35:01.888 --> 00:35:06.253
scenarios of various natural disasters.

00:35:06.253 --> 00:35:11.245
We began with the shakeout scenario, here,

00:35:11.245 --> 00:35:13.300
but we've also done ones of storms,

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.483
we've done ones with tsunamis.

00:35:15.483 --> 00:35:17.830
As I said, we're moving up here now

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.767
into the Hayward Fault one.

00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:24.767
And these scenarios serve
a couple of functions.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.126
One of them is focusing on what we know

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.360
as opposed to what we don't know,

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.550
really being able to
concentrate on the impact

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:36.790
rather than the uncertainty
about what the time is.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.250
The other thing we're doing, though,

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.650
is we're making a story.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.580
And I didn't realize it at the time,

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.300
but as I look back, I'm realizing

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.410
the incredible importance
of that approach,

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.510
that a scenario is essentially

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.230
a scientifically-defensible story.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.098
And in fact, that
scientifically-defensible part

00:35:54.098 --> 00:35:56.570
is by far the hardest.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.400
When we make one scenario,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.681
we're picking on plausible outcome,

00:36:00.681 --> 00:36:03.885
and the scientists tend to look at it

00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:06.320
and go, but why'd you
make this assumption?

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.360
Why'd you make that assumption?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.810
Don't you think this
could be what happened?

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.549
Don't you think we should be
doing this probabilistically?

00:36:10.549 --> 00:36:12.662
And we have to say, you know,

00:36:12.662 --> 00:36:16.366
this isn't trying to express
the true range of risk.

00:36:16.366 --> 00:36:20.371
This is being plausible,
helping people understand

00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:25.371
how the disaster fits in their
world and their decisions.

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:29.752
And we have to accept that,
when we make a scenario,

00:36:29.752 --> 00:36:34.673
we are not going to be
getting that earthquake.

00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:39.200
So many assumptions went
into creating shakeout.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.370
That will not be the
earthquake that happens.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.820
We are trying to say this
is a plausible earthquake,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.772
it's the type of thing that
we need to be planning for,

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:49.930
but giving them that story

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.867
let's them see how it affects their world.

00:36:52.867 --> 00:36:55.570
And one of the things
we did in this process

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.453
was move closer to storytelling

00:36:57.453 --> 00:37:01.227
that I ever would've imagined
before we got into it.

00:37:01.227 --> 00:37:03.700
And in fact, what I'm gonna show next,

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.357
this is actually, we took
all of the scientific

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:09.505
analysis for the shakeout scenario,

00:37:09.505 --> 00:37:14.100
and we turned it not just
into a story, but a movie.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.040
We are working in Southern California,

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.793
around the corner from Hollywood.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.760
- [Narrator] It's a sunny
morning in Southern California.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.273
Across the region, 7.5 million
people are busy at work.

00:37:39.273 --> 00:37:40.968
Several hundred thousand of them

00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:44.270
are commuting to jobs
in different counties,

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:45.643
far from where they live.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.590
Over 200000 commuters work and reside

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.263
on opposite sides of
the San Andreas Fault.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.689
Today, these families, and many others

00:37:55.689 --> 00:37:59.643
across the region, will be separated.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.903
1800 people will die.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:10.633
53000 people will be injured.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.300
And 213 billion dollars
in damage incurred.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.930
It's 10:00 AM.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.550
The largest earthquake to
hit Southern California

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:23.420
in modern times has just begun.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.633
Some people react
appropriately, others don't.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.070
In the intense shaking, nearly
1500 buildings collapse.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:34.281
Infrastructure is severely compromised,

00:38:34.281 --> 00:38:38.440
and 300000 buildings
suffer significant damage.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.210
The rupture travels 200 miles northwest

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.330
along the San Andreas Fault.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.220
Violent shaking, lasting as long

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.700
as two minutes in some areas.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.970
Finally, the earthquake is over.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.240
Many of the lifelines
of Southern California

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.900
have been disrupted.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.490
A large number of people are
trapped in collapsed buildings.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.710
Over 1600 fires start,

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.510
some turning into super conflagrations.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.180
Millions of people are
trying to use their phones,

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.379
causing the system to become overloaded.

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.370
In the months ahead, there will be

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.582
tens of thousands of aftershocks.

00:39:12.582 --> 00:39:15.577
Residents will struggle to
recover from the earthquake.

00:39:15.577 --> 00:39:18.689
There will be no water
for weeks or months,

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:21.170
and no electricity.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.580
Traveling from point to point

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.590
within the city will
be extremely difficult.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.653
And 255000 people will be
displaced from their homes.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.700
We are all in this together.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.440
We will suffer the consequences

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.733
if we don't do our part right now.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.020
How quickly life gets back to normal

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.900
after this disaster is up
to you and those around you.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.780
Your level of personal preparedness

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.560
will determine your quality
of life after the quake.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.230
It's a good idea to have
a fire extinguisher,

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.720
a first aid kit, and enough water

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.290
for each person in our household

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.260
to have at least one gallon
of water a day for three days.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.020
Have an emergency plan.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.650
Decide now where you will meet

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.150
your family after an earthquake.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.010
Make sure there's a person out of town

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.940
you can contact to let your loved ones

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.640
know that you're okay.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.964
Homeowners should be sure to bolt

00:40:13.964 --> 00:40:16.460
their house to its foundation.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.380
Consider whether earthquake insurance

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.592
makes sense for you as part
of your financial plan.

00:40:21.592 --> 00:40:23.720
Even if you're not a homeowner,

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.810
you can secure your personal possessions

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.680
against earthquake damage.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.010
Preparedness is not only for
the home but also for business.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.210
Be sure that your company has emergency

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.152
plans for a major earthquake.

00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:37.613
Empower yourself and your family.

00:40:37.613 --> 00:40:39.293
Be prepared.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.260
- Okay.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.640
So, not the usual way in which

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.413
we usually publish our scientific results.

00:40:55.517 --> 00:41:00.450
It has, however, gotten a
million hits on YouTube.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.505
And it's gotten our message out

00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:06.569
much farther than any other
thing that we could've done.

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:09.218
I'm getting close to wrapping up.

00:41:09.218 --> 00:41:12.510
I wanna spend a moment,
it is shakeout day,

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:16.040
to look at some of the
other communication messages

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.820
we got out of the process
of creating shakeout,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.720
and which ones of them work.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.719
So we had a few different explicit tactics

00:41:23.719 --> 00:41:27.132
that we developed as we
were creating shakeout.

00:41:27.132 --> 00:41:29.240
We talked with the social scientists

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.184
and we came up with certain objectives

00:41:31.184 --> 00:41:34.771
as we went and put the pieces together.

00:41:34.771 --> 00:41:37.942
Let me just go through them.

00:41:37.942 --> 00:41:42.942
Consistent messaging
is a big piece of this.

00:41:43.595 --> 00:41:47.960
When people hear the same
message from multiple sources,

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.940
it is more reassuring,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.908
it increases that feeling of certainty

00:41:51.908 --> 00:41:54.650
than when you get different
people saying different things,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.679
that greatly reduces
the level of certainty.

00:41:56.679 --> 00:41:59.071
So we made the decision,
of all of the different

00:41:59.071 --> 00:42:01.428
earthquake safety proponents,

00:42:01.428 --> 00:42:03.820
that we would settle on the same message,

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.956
we would focus on drop cover hold on,

00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.580
and that we would, and then plus,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.720
take one more step, do one other thing.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.830
And we went out through multiple media.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.132
We bought, some of us bought advertising,

00:42:17.132 --> 00:42:20.760
had a lot of different ways
in which we went about it,

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.560
and we shared the messaging

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.460
and made sure that it was consistent,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.761
creating something called the
Earthquake Country Alliance

00:42:26.761 --> 00:42:28.955
in Southern California, it's now been

00:42:28.955 --> 00:42:31.358
working out more nationwide.

00:42:31.358 --> 00:42:34.679
Another piece of it is
visual reinforcement.

00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:37.520
People are more likely to do

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.820
what they see other people doing.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.098
This was one of the reasons
we focused on the drill,

00:42:42.098 --> 00:42:44.965
because how do you see people
preparing for an earthquake?

00:42:44.965 --> 00:42:47.380
That's a pretty abstract sort of thing.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.749
Whereas looking like
an idiot under a table

00:42:49.749 --> 00:42:52.338
and trying to not have
your butt sticking out,

00:42:52.338 --> 00:42:54.323
I've done this too many years,

00:42:54.323 --> 00:42:58.060
it's a very defined visual, and it says,

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.070
oh, these people are
thinking about earthquakes.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:03.010
So we are, that is part of it,

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.749
but it's a generalized picture,

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:08.684
not just the drill itself,
that you are taking this on.

00:43:08.684 --> 00:43:10.925
So drop cover hold on, we actually got

00:43:10.925 --> 00:43:14.106
all of these graphics that were donated

00:43:14.106 --> 00:43:16.219
during the process of keeping that going.

00:43:16.219 --> 00:43:19.087
We also focused on
making this the biggest,

00:43:19.087 --> 00:43:21.339
you know, a big media event.

00:43:21.339 --> 00:43:23.464
How do we get that visual image?

00:43:23.464 --> 00:43:25.450
We were trying, you know,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.736
we explicitly took on things
like the quake cottage

00:43:27.736 --> 00:43:29.466
and things that were visual

00:43:29.466 --> 00:43:31.370
to get it to show up on TV,

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:35.243
to try and encourage that visual process.

00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:38.975
Another aspect is that people only

00:43:38.975 --> 00:43:41.146
come to the decision to do something

00:43:41.146 --> 00:43:44.300
by talking about it with
people they care about.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.090
This is apparently a
pretty important piece.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.321
It is very rare for somebody to just go,

00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:51.548
oh okay, I understand this
risk, I'm gonna do this.

00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:53.960
They usually need to take a process

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.249
that gets them from the
acceptance to the action,

00:43:57.249 --> 00:44:00.686
and being able to talk about
it makes a big difference.

00:44:00.686 --> 00:44:03.553
In the drill, what we did is focusing

00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:07.036
on trying to have the drill happen

00:44:07.036 --> 00:44:10.890
in all of the different
entities at the same time.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.420
The reason we're doing this

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.340
is to encourage people to talk about it,

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.940
so that the kid comes home from school

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.090
and says, mommy I had an
earthquake drill today,

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.350
and mommy's like, oh, I
had one at work today too,

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.830
and daddy's, yeah, so did I.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.823
And maybe you get some
family discussion going.

00:44:24.823 --> 00:44:27.070
At a different level, this is really

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:30.050
the process that happened
by me moving into City Hall.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.230
One of the reasons it had happened

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.912
where I think it hasn't in a more,

00:44:34.912 --> 00:44:37.628
you know, without such
close collaboration,

00:44:37.628 --> 00:44:40.800
is because you needed
to sit and talk about it

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.440
and make it seem real and make it part

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.373
of the discussion to get it to happen.

00:44:47.353 --> 00:44:49.199
But then I think one of the other

00:44:49.199 --> 00:44:51.614
really important things that they said

00:44:51.614 --> 00:44:55.213
is that we shouldn't be
just presenting the problem.

00:44:55.213 --> 00:44:57.535
And this is one of the core issues,

00:44:57.535 --> 00:44:59.241
and I think it's gonna,

00:44:59.241 --> 00:45:01.877
it plays into a lot of other
scientific communication,

00:45:01.877 --> 00:45:05.740
that we as scientists are only comfortable

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.460
talking about the things
that we do, right?

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.800
I'm an expert on seismology,

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.970
I need to be talking about that

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.370
and not about the engineering issues.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.150
And especially, even if I'm willing

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.759
to pretend I'm an engineer,

00:45:17.759 --> 00:45:19.740
or at least talk about what my

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.649
engineering colleagues have done,

00:45:21.649 --> 00:45:24.120
the policy part really feels

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.570
like it belongs to someone else.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.560
But it's been really clear

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.854
that when you present the
problem without a solution,

00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:36.440
you don't encourage action,
you encourage anxiety.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.110
And in fact, some more
work from the Sellnows.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:43.249
They expressed it as this,
they called it the idea model,

00:45:43.249 --> 00:45:46.744
that internalization,
explanation, and action

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:51.191
all have to be part of
any crisis communication.

00:45:51.191 --> 00:45:55.126
And that if you don't
have all three pieces,

00:45:55.126 --> 00:45:58.424
you often make it actually worse

00:45:58.424 --> 00:46:01.175
and less likely that
people will take action.

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.460
They did a lot of different studies.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.990
I decided I'd just throw this up here

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.010
and say, yes, there's
numbers behind all of this,

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.674
as they tested various groups of people.

00:46:09.674 --> 00:46:12.181
But what you get down to is

00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:15.374
if you only tell people
what they should do

00:46:15.374 --> 00:46:17.592
and the science of it,

00:46:17.592 --> 00:46:20.950
but you don't tell them
how it relates to them

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.874
and why they individually
should care about it,

00:46:22.874 --> 00:46:24.825
you generate indifference.

00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:27.750
If you convince them
that it matters to them

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.640
and you tell them why, what's going on,

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.418
but you don't tell them
what to do about it,

00:46:32.418 --> 00:46:34.206
they actually test out with

00:46:34.206 --> 00:46:36.320
diminished knowledge and confidence

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.256
and less likely to take action.

00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:42.060
You have to put all three of them together

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.610
to actually see an increase in action

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:46.883
and working towards these things.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.690
So, what does this have
to do with climate change?

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.050
Obviously this isn't really
a talk about climate change,

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.903
I'm sorry if you got
teased in here on that

00:46:56.903 --> 00:46:58.946
and we aren't getting to it.

00:46:58.946 --> 00:47:02.766
But my experiences out of
that earthquake process,

00:47:02.766 --> 00:47:05.378
and I feel like I'm
coming up with results,

00:47:05.378 --> 00:47:08.954
but let's think about it, how it applies

00:47:08.954 --> 00:47:13.954
to what is going on in climate change.

00:47:15.491 --> 00:47:18.625
And I think there's two big pieces,

00:47:18.625 --> 00:47:21.680
and you've heard me saying
it over and over again today.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.734
One is our focus in on uncertainty.

00:47:23.734 --> 00:47:25.730
When we're talking about this,

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.350
we all know it's happening.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:32.350
What we are interested in as
scientists is the details.

00:47:32.813 --> 00:47:35.889
How much of it is human-induced?

00:47:35.889 --> 00:47:39.198
Exactly where are the models working out?

00:47:39.198 --> 00:47:43.080
What exactly is gonna be
the result for California?

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.957
How much extra rain are we gonna get?

00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:46.900
We focus on all the things

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.420
that we don't have the answer to.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.200
The absolutely basic, you can
do it in a high school lab,

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.540
that when you put heat and you have

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.040
extra carbon dioxide, you trap more heat,

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.465
and you take out the carbon
dioxide, you trap less heat,

00:48:02.465 --> 00:48:06.493
it's so simple, we don't talk about it.

00:48:06.493 --> 00:48:09.686
And yet that absolute
basic and being certain

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:14.284
is the message that people need to hear.

00:48:14.284 --> 00:48:17.930
But wait a minute, we've just told them

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.050
that all the scientists agree,

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.290
and where the hell did this number

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.619
97 percent of scientists come from?

00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:25.619
Sometimes I really wonder who
those other three percent are.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.702
But that's telling people

00:48:29.702 --> 00:48:32.270
you aren't smart enough
to make your own mind,

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.170
you need to believe it because

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:35.993
all the right people tell you to.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.350
And I think this ties back

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:43.950
to a pretty fundamental aspect

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.290
of how we treat science education.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.473
We educate people in science

00:48:49.473 --> 00:48:52.760
to find the future scientists.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.330
Go listen to the discussion.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:56.450
We need to have more STEM education,

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.541
'cause look at all those STEM careers.

00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:03.541
We never say everybody needs
to be a science researcher.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.154
And I don't mean understand science facts.

00:49:08.154 --> 00:49:12.008
We sort of treat science the way

00:49:12.008 --> 00:49:15.433
people in the Middle Ages treated reading.

00:49:15.433 --> 00:49:17.830
Reading was for a specialist.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.683
You didn't need to do it yourself.

00:49:19.683 --> 00:49:20.770
Right?

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.780
If you needed somebody
to read or write for you,

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.480
you went and got a
scribe to do it for you.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.310
Even the kings didn't write.

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.130
You got your information by hearing what

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.530
the priest was telling you in the pulpit.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.221
But with the advent of the printing press,

00:49:32.221 --> 00:49:34.610
we started really changing that,

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:36.471
and within, you know, not that long,

00:49:36.471 --> 00:49:38.584
after the advent of the printing press,

00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:40.755
you needed to be able to read yourself

00:49:40.755 --> 00:49:43.760
to participate in the social discourse.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.300
You could still get a job,

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.453
but you weren't really part of society.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.830
And we're treating science

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:51.930
the same way we used to treat reading.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.280
If you need to get a
scientific analysis done,

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.836
get a specialist to do it for you.

00:49:55.836 --> 00:49:57.577
And you know, most of us in this room

00:49:57.577 --> 00:49:59.267
have made jobs out of that

00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:00.920
and made careers out of doing that,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:05.310
and we don't really expect
others to be doing it as well.

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:09.010
But I would suggest that,
in the internet era,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.581
that the whole digital revolution

00:50:10.581 --> 00:50:15.581
is changing societal need
for scientific analysis,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.834
that with the removal of the constraints

00:50:19.834 --> 00:50:22.550
of the cost of print and ink,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:25.570
absolutely any information gets published

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.250
and is accessible to everyone.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:29.041
We no longer have an editor telling us

00:50:29.041 --> 00:50:32.744
what's fit to print, what
you should be listening to.

00:50:32.744 --> 00:50:35.635
Absolutely everything,
including the complete nonsense,

00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:39.030
is out there available to people.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:42.570
And individuals now need
to make their own decisions

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.730
about what information
is worth listening to.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.270
That is the scientific skill.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.410
That's what scientific analysis is.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.551
How to look at data and
understand its significance

00:50:52.551 --> 00:50:55.024
and understand the implications of it.

00:50:55.024 --> 00:50:56.858
And really, to handle the flood

00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:58.843
of information in the internet era,

00:50:58.843 --> 00:51:03.550
everyone needs some level
of scientific analysis.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.459
And if people in general had those skills,

00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:10.020
we wouldn't be having this
discussion about climate change,

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.670
we wouldn't be saying believe it

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:13.690
because all the scientists believe it.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.457
It would be so blazingly obvious.

00:51:15.457 --> 00:51:18.453
So I think that's one big aspect,

00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:21.870
that we really need to take a hard look,

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.699
as scientists, at how
we are educating others,

00:51:24.699 --> 00:51:26.672
and how do we take these skills

00:51:26.672 --> 00:51:29.750
and not restrict them solely to the people

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.421
who are gonna become our clones,

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:35.403
but really recognize it's a
skill that everybody needs.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.538
The second issue that I think we're facing

00:51:38.538 --> 00:51:40.512
with climate change is that

00:51:40.512 --> 00:51:43.693
we have done the classic thing of

00:51:43.693 --> 00:51:45.666
we've told people but the problem is

00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:48.640
without giving them a solution.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.088
When scientists get up there
and talk about climate change,

00:51:51.088 --> 00:51:54.014
we talk about all the
things that are going wrong,

00:51:54.014 --> 00:51:55.872
and you gotta deal with it.

00:51:55.872 --> 00:51:58.983
And most people, I've actually started

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:01.277
sort of checking this out with people,

00:52:01.277 --> 00:52:02.870
and we should probably do a more

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.880
statistical analysis of this,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.772
I am astonished how
many intelligent people

00:52:07.772 --> 00:52:10.593
who accept climate change,
your general Californian,

00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:14.308
believes that the only way to deal with it

00:52:14.308 --> 00:52:16.380
is giving up our current life.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.509
It seems like the solution has gotta,

00:52:19.509 --> 00:52:22.040
we've gotta give up fuels, fossil fuels,

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.450
doesn't that mean we have
to give up our computer,

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.450
how are we gonna manage
to have the life we want,

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.460
and we really don't wanna
give up the life we want.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.990
So we move back from thinking about it.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.780
Yeah, it's happening, but I
guess we'll have to adapt.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.872
Or I don't wanna think it's happening

00:52:37.872 --> 00:52:40.490
because I don't wanna deal
with the consequences.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.430
And I would suggest, if we want

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.711
to get action on climate change,

00:52:44.711 --> 00:52:46.790
we need to give people something

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.587
concrete and positive to do.

00:52:49.587 --> 00:52:52.768
When I look at it, I tie it, actually,

00:52:52.768 --> 00:52:57.420
to the rather fundamental
issue that oil is finite.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.536
There's various versions of this model

00:52:59.536 --> 00:53:02.694
that show oil production versus time

00:53:02.694 --> 00:53:05.320
and how it's expected to go.

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:09.916
And as we have, you know,
the graph shifts at times.

00:53:09.916 --> 00:53:11.590
When we started fracking,

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:15.010
we got a lot more versions of oil.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:17.532
We have deepwater drilling
that's able to go on.

00:53:17.532 --> 00:53:21.770
As we make explorations, we've been able

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.415
to delay the running out of fossil fuels.

00:53:25.415 --> 00:53:28.759
But that does not mean we
won't run out of fossil fuels

00:53:28.759 --> 00:53:31.150
any more than avoiding an accident

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:33.554
somehow makes you immortal, right?

00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:36.352
There is still only so much oil out there.

00:53:36.352 --> 00:53:39.530
And at some point, and whether it's 2050

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.911
or 2100 or sometime,
we will be out of oil.

00:53:42.911 --> 00:53:47.911
And when that happens, we will
either no longer have energy,

00:53:48.356 --> 00:53:51.640
or we will have renewable energy.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.138
And I'm pretty sure,
we're pretty smart people,

00:53:54.138 --> 00:53:57.010
we will have renewable energy.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.049
So that's where we're
going to be eventually.

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:01.685
And the only question is
how much social disruption

00:54:01.685 --> 00:54:05.890
and how much ecologic
disruption we take to get there.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.233
So there's a really clear, obvious answer

00:54:08.233 --> 00:54:10.400
to what we do about climate change,

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.331
and that's, we vest a whole lot of money

00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:15.071
in renewable resources,
because whoever develops

00:54:15.071 --> 00:54:18.461
the really efficient renewable energy,

00:54:18.461 --> 00:54:20.440
they're gonna be ruling the world

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.560
when we get to this world without oil.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.550
Why don't we want that to be us?

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:26.105
And we can take that message

00:54:26.105 --> 00:54:27.930
and combine it with climate change

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.681
and say, there's your solution,

00:54:29.681 --> 00:54:32.282
and it's good for the long-term
health of our country.

00:54:32.282 --> 00:54:35.680
Let's take positive action
and move in that direction.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.216
And I think, you know,

00:54:37.216 --> 00:54:41.487
why I was successful in L.A.,

00:54:41.487 --> 00:54:46.487
it was having a clear story
of what the problem was,

00:54:46.853 --> 00:54:48.810
and tied it to a solution.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.705
You take these actions and
you are protecting our city.

00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:54.225
We need to do the same
thing with climate change.

00:54:54.225 --> 00:54:57.476
People don't want a
world that falls apart.

00:54:57.476 --> 00:54:59.730
They don't want it so badly

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.480
that if we don't give them a solution,

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.890
they need to believe that
it isn't gonna end up there.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:05.120
And to be able to believe it

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.309
they need to see the path forward.

00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:08.273
So thank you.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.080
- [Audience Member] I
wonder how much of your talk

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.893
we could also summarize by the
words of visual imagination.

00:55:20.893 --> 00:55:23.296
You mentioned that
scientists think one way,

00:55:23.296 --> 00:55:25.270
journalists think the other way,

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.325
but in my experience, every scientist

00:55:27.325 --> 00:55:29.415
I've ever known thinks visually,

00:55:29.415 --> 00:55:31.853
and when I read
newspapers, it's very clear

00:55:31.853 --> 00:55:34.453
that the journalists are verbal thinkers.

00:55:34.453 --> 00:55:38.010
And there's a big big difference.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.829
You mentioned numeracy, and again,

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:42.743
everyone I know thinks of numbers

00:55:42.743 --> 00:55:46.342
or visualizes numbers
in a sorta visual way,

00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:49.999
but yet those who call themselves

00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:52.867
not so numerate, or whatever one uses,

00:55:52.867 --> 00:55:56.791
are actually usually people
who do not think visually.

00:55:56.791 --> 00:56:01.621
And then you also mentioned the
process of science education

00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:05.173
where we select those who
will be future scientists.

00:56:05.173 --> 00:56:08.029
Basically, our science
education right now,

00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:10.491
it's selecting those who think visually

00:56:10.491 --> 00:56:12.293
and excluding other people.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.634
And I think you also
pointed to an ideal world

00:56:15.634 --> 00:56:17.886
in which the general public

00:56:17.886 --> 00:56:20.255
is kind of scientifically literate,

00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:23.854
and I would venture that that
ideal world you described

00:56:23.854 --> 00:56:26.048
is actually where everybody

00:56:26.048 --> 00:56:29.624
is somewhat visually imaginative,

00:56:29.624 --> 00:56:33.003
that everybody still has
the same visual imagination

00:56:33.003 --> 00:56:35.441
that they had when they
were five-years-old

00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:37.993
before they learned to read.

00:56:40.783 --> 00:56:43.810
You pointed out Gutenberg
and how Gutenberg

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.191
changed the world and changed reading

00:56:46.191 --> 00:56:49.384
from being something that
only a select few did

00:56:49.384 --> 00:56:51.811
to something that most people could do,

00:56:51.811 --> 00:56:54.574
and I would say using visual imagination

00:56:54.574 --> 00:56:57.511
might be the equivalent of your Gutenberg,

00:56:57.511 --> 00:57:00.623
that if we get everybody
to use visual imagination,

00:57:00.623 --> 00:57:04.315
then what we call scientific thinking

00:57:04.315 --> 00:57:08.790
would not be the world
of just a select few.

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.270
- I would agree that all
of these things, I think,

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.765
would help, and I do think
visualization is part of it.

00:57:13.765 --> 00:57:16.644
I do think the storytelling part

00:57:16.644 --> 00:57:20.545
is one of the biggest
things that can be visual.

00:57:20.545 --> 00:57:24.680
But we know as scientists
we have to reject it,

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.127
and yet the users, we could
really use more light than this,

00:57:28.127 --> 00:57:33.127
the users need the stories
for the emotional connection.

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.130
Yeah.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:37.540
- So in stories we might
set up a heroes journey,

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:38.620
and pretty quickly we're gonna

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.712
get into good guys and bad guys.

00:57:40.712 --> 00:57:43.180
Is that gonna work in a case like this?

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.570
Do we need to talk about
good guys and bad guys?

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:47.140
- I don't think we should be talking

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.330
about good guys and bad guys,

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:50.905
and I think that that's actually
been one of the problems,

00:57:50.905 --> 00:57:53.216
and whereas just going, here's a solution

00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:55.166
that makes a difference, and you tie

00:57:55.166 --> 00:57:57.813
a concrete solution and
an action you can take,

00:57:57.813 --> 00:57:59.580
it's gonna be a lot easier

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:02.363
to acknowledge it and move forward.

00:58:03.548 --> 00:58:05.550
- Hi, great talk.

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.856
I was really, the last thing

00:58:07.856 --> 00:58:09.480
you talked about was the action,

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.130
and you gave a very big example,

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:14.390
that we can change our entire system.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.995
But I'm wondering if it wouldn't be

00:58:15.995 --> 00:58:17.940
at least as effective to give people,

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.090
like, maybe even solutions that,

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:22.590
as a person who really
cares about global warming,

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:23.901
you feel like, oh my
god, this is pathetic,

00:58:23.901 --> 00:58:25.850
but if your goal is to get someone

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.162
to begin to believe the science,

00:58:28.162 --> 00:58:30.855
then like, planting a tree in their yard

00:58:30.855 --> 00:58:34.543
might actually help them
believe global warming science.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.075
- I think you have to have
some connection already made

00:58:39.075 --> 00:58:41.640
to get, I mean I don't
think that it's wrong

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.650
to go for those small actions,

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:46.123
giving people individual
things that they can do,

00:58:46.123 --> 00:58:48.420
and I think one of the problems

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.267
with climate change is it's so large,

00:58:50.267 --> 00:58:53.413
it is a hard thing to
make that connection.

00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:59.659
None of the solutions are
absolute, let's put it that way.

00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:05.279
But I think that these
ideas that you tie solutions

00:59:05.279 --> 00:59:08.274
to the problem, you give actions,

00:59:08.274 --> 00:59:12.477
it makes it easier to
process the information.

00:59:12.477 --> 00:59:15.300
And you can say, we've
got these bigger ones

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.900
and we can take these smaller
actions along the way.

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:23.716
- At the risk of being disdained for this,

00:59:23.716 --> 00:59:28.120
I honestly do wanna know
about educating scientists,

00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.357
because as a science writer,

00:59:30.357 --> 00:59:35.357
I have worked with
scientists most of my life,

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:40.380
and when I have individually
talked to small groups

00:59:42.489 --> 00:59:46.660
of, often, PhDs and former academics

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.603
who are now in the private sector,

00:59:51.233 --> 00:59:54.720
I'm not credible to them

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.020
until I tell them about
my science training.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.050
And then all of a sudden,
okay, you're okay,

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:02.410
you're a geologist, that's good.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:06.243
No I'm not, I was a mediocre
geologist, I'm a superb writer.

01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:10.457
So what I have done with small groups

01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:13.174
is talk to them about, you know,

01:00:13.174 --> 01:00:15.392
because I was in marketing eventually,

01:00:15.392 --> 01:00:18.654
how we perceive information.

01:00:18.654 --> 01:00:22.160
And I mentioned, each time, five traits

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.748
of very highly-trained scientific minds

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:29.400
versus some of the negatives
in terms of marketing

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.150
for the highly-trained scientific minds.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.653
You know, the fact that
you go to negatives first,

01:00:34.653 --> 01:00:36.452
and you're presenting that to others.

01:00:36.452 --> 01:00:39.730
After that, I asked every single one

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.030
of the listeners to please write down

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:43.840
all the positives and all the negatives.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.270
Not one person remembered
all the positives.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.620
Almost all of them
remembered all the negatives.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.670
I think that has to do with
their critical thinking skills.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.680
Because they are going
to the negatives first,

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.640
they don't understand the filters.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:00.380
So my concern is about mutual respect.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.828
I want to bring that to both parts,

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:06.835
both the fear that people won't
understand the scientists,

01:01:06.835 --> 01:01:09.831
scientists are disdaining others

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:10.820
- Well I think that that's sort of what

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:15.820
I'm trying to say, is that
the training of scientists,

01:01:16.112 --> 01:01:21.112
what's needed to do the science
of rejecting the stories,

01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:23.623
of being critical of each other,

01:01:23.623 --> 01:01:27.118
are processes that we
have to do as scientists,

01:01:27.118 --> 01:01:28.643
and what I'm asking is that I think

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.740
that we need to acknowledge
that those can't,

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.740
that's not the way the
rest of the world thinks

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.806
and it can get in the
way of our communication.

01:01:35.806 --> 01:01:39.197
So not give it up, because we
have to do it as scientists

01:01:39.197 --> 01:01:41.414
or we aren't gonna get the right answer,

01:01:41.414 --> 01:01:45.431
but we need to recognize
that it is not the way

01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:48.410
much of the rest of
the world communicates,

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.990
and we need to take that into account

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.040
when we're trying to do it,

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.590
and not say other people are wrong

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.253
for not doing it that way.

01:01:56.426 --> 01:01:58.481
But I think helping everyone understand

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:02.150
the nature of peer review
and critical data analysis

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.173
is gonna help as well.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.328
- So this is fascinating,
thank you for talking about it.

01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:09.860
I think the difference in
the way that scientists

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.110
and normal folks, as it were,

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.160
communicate is relatively large.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.210
I come out of a religious community,

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.043
and especially, I think,

01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:18.100
the way we think about the way

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.739
that global warming gets tied up

01:02:19.739 --> 01:02:22.340
with narratives around
creation, especially for,

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.740
like, conservative or
evangelical Christians.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.658
And so my question is just kind of,

01:02:26.658 --> 01:02:30.002
their world view and
their approach to ecology

01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:32.660
is so embedded in a particular narrative

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.588
about the way the world
works, and is there,

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:35.969
do you know if there's any

01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:38.040
work that's being done around that?

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.440
Or how can we communicate with folks

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.280
whose entire story that they tell

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.700
about reality differs so drastically?

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.823
- Well, yeah, I can't solve everything.

01:02:48.624 --> 01:02:50.157
I would just say that that,

01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:53.326
it's a temptation that we need to avoid

01:02:53.326 --> 01:02:57.471
to think that that is the
definition of religious.

01:02:57.471 --> 01:02:59.189
I would rather say that that is

01:02:59.189 --> 01:03:02.410
the definition of a very small subset.

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.867
And if you've got people who insist

01:03:04.867 --> 01:03:07.370
that there is no data and that

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:09.320
the world is 6000-years-old and that's it,

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.007
and anything that says
otherwise is God testing you,

01:03:12.007 --> 01:03:15.095
that's a logically consistent model

01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:19.890
that's incompatible with what
it is we're trying to do.

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:21.991
But I think that, you know,

01:03:21.991 --> 01:03:24.460
there's a whole lot of other range,

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.090
and I will say, I'll end
on a controversial note,

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.140
how about I do that?

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.470
Is that one other difference

01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:33.149
between scientists and journalists,

01:03:33.149 --> 01:03:37.010
scientists believe in reality.

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:41.090
Our science is an
attempt to model reality.

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:43.493
We always know we don't have it right.

01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:47.080
Every new science advance is
disproving something else,

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.822
and we know that eventually,

01:03:48.822 --> 01:03:51.540
our models are gonna be supplanted.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.408
So eventually, so we know we're wrong.

01:03:53.408 --> 01:03:56.786
But we are trying to do
the best possible job,

01:03:56.786 --> 01:03:59.930
and we know there is right and wrong

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:01.913
and there is something real.

01:04:02.752 --> 01:04:05.901
And I will say that that's part of

01:04:05.901 --> 01:04:08.990
the religious worldview too,
is that there is reality,

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:11.508
Different ways of understanding

01:04:11.508 --> 01:04:14.680
and different parts of reality

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.240
that perhaps aren't reflected

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.320
in the data in the physical world,

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.640
but they believe that there is truth.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.600
To a journalist, there's often not truth.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.050
There's always the
other side of the story.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:29.010
And they don't accept the concept

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.245
that something can just be right.

01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:33.044
And I think that's another time

01:04:33.044 --> 01:04:35.270
that when you always have to

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:37.030
find the other side of the story,

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.755
instead of saying,
actually, this is just true,

01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:44.039
or even to accept the concept
that something can be true,

01:04:44.039 --> 01:04:46.953
is a challenge, and I think that sometimes

01:04:46.953 --> 01:04:49.940
there are bigger differences between

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.435
scientists and journalists than between

01:04:51.435 --> 01:04:53.513
scientists and people of faith.

01:04:53.513 --> 01:04:58.513
So on that note, thank you.
