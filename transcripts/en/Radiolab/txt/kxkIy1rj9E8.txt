Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab, the podcast. Yes. Nick, you were a little off our game right now because we are not in our normal studio. We're actually in Detroit right now. We're on tour. We're in the first leg of our tour. It's super fun going well, but we do have an interesting podcast for you who you do indeed, but it might be more efficient if we go back to New York. We're, Soren wheeler is standing by because he and I had a conversation with someone. We can just, yes. Yeah. Do you want to, do you want to carry it forward? Sure. Do it. So today we have a story of an obsession that deep swallowed reporter Dan Ingber and disappeared pretty much whole of all the things to catch your attention. How did this happen to pop into your head?

Speaker 1:          00:53          It happened to pop into my head because I was talking to a friend of mine who's an elementary school teacher and we were discussing quicksand as, as one does. Oh Gosh, it's elementary school teacher and I, and she just said, you know, the kids in my class just don't even, they don't, they've never heard of quicksand. Like second graders, third grade. Like what? Nine year old, 10 year old. Fourth grade is prime time for quicksand. Right when I was nine, quicksand was a major part of my life. Yeah. We live, you know, poor water in the corner of the sandbox and say, oh, it's quicksand, but you're your teacher friends. Students didn't, right. But so I went to, to her, I visited her class. I might discover that she was wrong. Almost all of them had heard of quicksand, but she was right in so far as quicksand was not important to them. In fact, they thought it wasn't scary at all. And I was like, well, what are you afraid of? And they said, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:46          zombies, the alien in Pacific Rim Ghost, when I was actually lost a writing being attacked by a dinosaur, that would be totally more scary.

Speaker 1:          01:54          So we actually went and talked to some third graders and while some of them said,

Speaker 2:          01:58          well, I guess it's Sorta scary, but

Speaker 1:          02:00          most of them weren't scared of it at all.

Speaker 2:          02:04          I don't think so. I usually don't think about it.

Speaker 1:          02:07          They thought it was something that maybe their parents had been afraid of.

Speaker 2:          02:10          They told me that when he was little, his friends always said like, look out. That could be quicksand.

Speaker 1:          02:16          Friends ever say that to you? Yeah, they would say people used to be scared of that, but it's not scary anymore. So that got me to thinking what happened? Why is quicksand not scary the way it used to be? And with that simple question, Dan got sucked into a world he never even knew existed. So the next step was going to the Internet and within a minute I discovered the quicksand fetish. Community it quick fetish. Yeah, like fetish fetish. Like sex fetish. Yes. Oh, so then so in the quick, among the quicksand fetishists, there are so called sinkers. These are people who seek out quicksand in nature and want to jump in with another person and kiss or are by themselves with no clothes on or, or is the sex part some of them by themselves with no clothes on, some smaller group with another person.

Speaker 1:          03:11          That's if they can convince their partner to come with them. But they always have a rope with them, I hope. Oh yeah. Oh, if you go, if you go onto the sinkers message boards, there's a Google map which has sinking spots all over the world and each one is rated for, you know, thickness, depth, privacy available, parking nearby. I mean, it's a really, it's been very thought through and, and wonderfully collaborative community. So there's sinkers in one hand and then there are the watchers. They just want to see people where animals sinking into quicksand. So they'll watch movies and just find the quicksand sequence in the movie. And here's where Dan sunk even d because he discovered that one of these watchers, this guy crypto had in the course of his fetishistic quicksand watching Colada dis, you know, this list of, of well over a thousand quicksand scenes in film and television, this part of the country.

Speaker 1:          04:21          There were scenes going all the way back to the birth of filmmaking. I mean, this is the greatest impetus for scientific research to take off your shoe. And if you have to like a fetishistic interest in the data. And Dan thought maybe this data can give us a clue about how the way we think about quicksand has changed. So I went through and I pulled out every feature film from the list and then with information from the MPA, I figured out how many movies were being released every decade. And then I sort of computed a, like what percent of movies had quicksand? And every decade going back to, uh, the first quicksand movie they have is from 19 Tino nine. It's a silent film where a woman gets rescued from quicksand by some hooded monks. I'm unable to find this movie, but I'd love to see it.

Speaker 1:          05:15          I don't know what it's about. Um, but anyways, I s I started looking at the number of movies by decade and the beginning of the century, it's like one in a thousand movies. By the 30s it's up to one in 500 and then in the forties one and 200 and then in the 1960s all of a sudden it just shoots up like one in 35 like almost 3% of Hollywood movies have quicksand. The 1960s are just clearly a moment for quicksand and Dan says it wasn't just the number of films, the quicksand scenes that showed up in the 60s were serious dramatic seas. For example, Lawrence of Arabia where Peter Ode tool is, you know, pushing through the dust storm to try to save his companions is being sucked under.

Speaker 1:          06:11          That movie won seven Oscars and then women in the dunes came out this like art, see Japanese existentialist meditation. And for about the next 10 years, Dan says you had all these serious films that featured quicksand and then it fell off dramatically in the 1970s. It's already fallen to something like one out of 75 and then by the 1980s, it's like one out of 130. And then in the 90s, quicksand is mostly gone. Huh. And I think also in the 80s that had migrated into help television, I'm stuck in quicksand. Boy. Yeah, you have a one bad day. Larry and Belky and perfect strangers are falling into quicken sand. There's quick sand in my little [inaudible] pony. It's quicksand in Rainbow Pride. I mean, it's Zany. Quicksand basically dances. Quicksand had become a joke. And so, and that's the end, I think when, when quicksands in, you know, Saturday cartoons, I think, I do think that adventure gags probably have, um, a lifespan.

Speaker 1:          07:33          So just for a gut check, Dan and I decided maybe we should run this past somebody who knows the business. I'm Carlton cuse and I'm a television writer and producer and Carlton was actually the showrunner for the TV show lost. And that's a show that by rights should have tons of quicksand. I mean, absolutely, they should be in quicksand all the time. They're on, they're stranded on a tropical island. It's an adventure show. But according to Carlton, whenever one of the writers would say, you know, okay, so Kate goes running down a path and then all of a sudden she falls into a pit of quicksand. The rest of them would be like, um, um, uh, I don't know if we can really pull that off. So what is that like? What is it? It would make that not, I, you know, I just think a lot of people would sort of be rolling their eyes and not, and not buying it.

Speaker 1:          08:29          That's, I know it sounds, it sounds kind of crazy because you know who you are making sort of a crazy show with smoke monsters and polar bears and time travel. And for someone to say, no, no, no, but we don't believe quicksand. I know. It's, um, but ultimately you just sort of trust your gut. And just right now we're quicksand is just not sort of, I think the right metaphor for how we're all feeling. But in the 60s, it because someone speculated as to the reason why the 60s. Oh, I've, I've speculated, uh, at great wave. I mean, it's, it's a fascinating moment because it's not just in movies. I believe that this nation should commit itself. So we're planning the moon mission in the early sixties, a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. And this Cornell astronomer named Thomas Gold has what if, when the Apollo lander descends to the surface of the Moon, it just sinks into a lunar quicksand. I remember this. I remember Tom Gold saying that too. Yeah. So right at this golden moment of quicksand, people are discussing real life quicksand on the frontier of that. Yeah. Now is the time. And then 1963 Martin Luther King now is the time. Makes us, I have a dream speech foundation from the quip sense of racial and Tufts does. He says, now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice.

Speaker 1:          09:55          And then I came here to speak to you about Vietnam. There was Vietnam. I do not have to tell you that our people are profoundly concerned about that struggle, that we now think of Vietnam as having been a quagmire. That's the [inaudible] rhetoric that's used now. But the debate in the 60s between Daniel Ellsberg and Arthur Schlesinger, uh, they use quicksand and quagmire interchangeably. They just, the Ellsberg will switch off and one essay, we'll call it a quick sand and then a quagmire. But the first use of that idea was to describe it as a quick sand. And then it, it kind of migrates from being a quick sand to a quagmire over the course of the late sixties and early seventies. And now, I mean, more evidence. Now we call it a quagmire. We forgot that Vietnam was a quicksand before it was a quagmire. So I'm all of these levels, quicksand is just, you know, as part of these key moments of this 1960s.

Speaker 1:          10:48          Wow. So the question that you know, that was just, I was obsessed with for a long time was why did America fall into quicksand in the 1960s I mean, did it come out of the movies and suddenly everyone's talking about it or was everyone talking about it? And so maybe everybody saw Lawrence of Arabia and they all went back to their jobs, right? Then we're on rocket ship jobs and somewhere on wharfie where are your jobs? And they all just carried Peter O'Toole in their heads as possible. I suppose that's possible. Who knows? I, my sense is that it, it's had to do with just sort of a generalized anxiety about going someplace radically new anxiety about, you know, the Hubris of traveling to the moon, anxiety about social upheaval, anxiety about the foreign entanglement of Vietnam and the state of geopolitics.

Speaker 3:          11:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:45          well, why, why would that, those anxieties manifest themselves in terms of like quicksand. Why is he gets this idea that you're, can I get sucked in? You're going to go too far. You're going to get stuck in whatever new world you've, you've ventured into. And right now there isn't that anxiety and exploration anymore. I mean, quicksand in, in Shakespeare's time was always off the coasts of new continents that had to do with the age of exploration and then it became, you know, desert quicksand and jungle quicksand during colonial era. And I just think the world is, and then it became the moon. Yeah. And then it became the moon. And look at all the real estate this beyond the don't come on. I mean you got like our solar system, you could have the quick sand of Jupiter. Yes, absolutely. I think if we're going to land humans on some black holes, isn't black on black holes? A kind of quick sand? Yeah. This, this is my guarantee. If, if we're about to land humans on some planet, you know, beyond the moon, these thoughts of quicksand would re-emerge oh yeah, this is Carlton cuse again. And now we're going to see this whole new chapter of Star Wars. And clearly we just so happens that the director, JJ Abrams is working on a whole new star wars movie. Yes.

Speaker 4:          12:59          And I think in the context of some strange new world, I think the audience would totally buy quicksand there. Yeah, that's what I'm, that's what I'm hoping for. Yeah. So I'll shoot JJ and email and just say quicksand and just leave it at that. See what happens.

Speaker 5:          13:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:25          I have another leading indicator of quicksand interest for you. I have no idea what you're about to say. None. So when I was a kid, I played quicksand in the sandbox, but sandboxes disappeared in the 1990s in New York City at least, I don't know what the story was in the rest of the country, but this paper came out in the New England Journal of Medicine and a warrant that there might be some [inaudible] derivative in sandbox sand. And the number of sandboxes in New York City went from something like 900 to 30 or 40 by the mid nineties and those kids that you talked to in that class, they had not likely sat in a sandbox pouring water in the corner and worrying it. But sandboxes are back the new imaginative play movement and, and playground redesign. So it's just going to have all lots of sand and lots of water and we want the kids mixing the water in the sand. So who knows? Maybe this is the, this is the front edge of, uh, of quicksand coming back because kids are playing with water and sand and sandboxes in New York City.

Speaker 1:          14:35          Oh, that's by the way, on a more serious note, I have actually one more leading indicator of the return of quicksand. I just saw it in the New York Times actually on the front page in what connection involving Syria, Syria were there. They were referring to Syria. A quicksand. Yeah. And I think they've actually is come up a little bit in terms of Afghanistan too, but um, it kind of seems to be back in [inaudible] yeah. In that, in the political, soon to, thank you. Sorry. Thanks Aaron. Yeah, no problem. And, um, I should say thanks to Dan [inaudible], he's a writer and a calmness at slate magazine where you can find his article about quicksand.
