CAT ALLMAN: Hi, this is Cat
Allman with Google's Open

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.020
Source Programs Office.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.360
I'm here today with my
colleague, Carol Smith.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.560
Carol manages our Google
Summer of Code program.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650
And we're here
today for the second

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.360
of our interviews
about that program.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280
Specifically, we're
here today to talk

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.830
about applying as a
mentoring organization.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.240
So Carol, what the heck is a
mentoring organization anyway?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.740
CAROL SMITH: So mentoring
organizations, at a minimum,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.730
are organizations which
have already released code

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.530
under an OSI-approved
license and have

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.590
at least two contributors
in their community who

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.010
would like to participate in
the program as mentors and org

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.010
admins.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.214
CAT ALLMAN: And can a school
be a mentoring organization?

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:52.130
CAROL SMITH: They can.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.360
We've had universities
participate in the past,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.110
again, assuming that
they've released code

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.220
under an OSI-approved
license and they

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.952
have at least two contributors
would like to participate.

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:02.660
But they should keep
in mind that if they

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.690
have any requirements
from their university,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.860
in terms of their time,
that they should make sure

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.050
that they can balance
those two things.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.660
CAT ALLMAN: And can a company
be a mentoring organization?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.030
CAROL SMITH: They can.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.610
We're a little bit more
restrictive about which

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.432
companies we accept.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.890
Again, they have to meet the
requirements of having already

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.650
released code under an
OSI-approved license, which

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.240
may or may not be the
case for some companies.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.180
But yes, they're still
welcome to apply.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.450
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.120
Why would an organization or a
free and open source software

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.524
project want to participate?

00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:35.940
CAROL SMITH: For
a couple reasons.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.074
One is because
they might get code

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:39.490
that they might
not have otherwise

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.070
been able to create from
the student developers who

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.430
participate in the program.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.440
And also, we've heard
from organizations

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.460
that they get recognized
on a wider, broader

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.000
international open source stage.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.560
CAT ALLMAN: All right.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.540
How much of a time
commitment is it?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.020
CAROL SMITH: For
mentors, it tends

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.740
to be about five hours a week.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.530
But it will really depend on
how the organization's code

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.480
base is, what sorts of projects
they have the students working

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.410
on, and how they treat
and work with developers.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.210
So we just try to give that
as a general guideline.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.910
CAT ALLMAN: And what
about the org admin role?

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.117
What's involved in being the
org admin for the project?

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:18.450
CAROL SMITH: Quite a few things.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270
One is submitting
the application

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.070
to participate in the
program, but also they

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.359
need to be able to manage the
entire scope of participating

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.400
in Google Summer of Code.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.490
So making sure that the
mentors are submitting

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.660
their evaluations on
time during the program,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.660
making sure that the
students are on track,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.520
making sure the projects
are all on track.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.686
And also submitting all the
forms and all the things

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.880
that are required
by Google as well.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.230
CAT ALLMAN: Related
to that, Google

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.290
uses the Melange
software that we've

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.370
developed to run the program.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.367
Is that optional, or do projects
have to work with Melange?

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:52.950
CAROL SMITH: They
have to use Melange,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.717
and anything that they
do outside of Melange

00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:58.800
isn't recognized by Google
as part of the program.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.600
And so they're still
welcome to do that,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.770
but they need to duplicate
that effort within our project.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.100
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.140
All-important question, when
is the application period?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.940
CAROL SMITH: So applications are
open right now, which is great.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.140
And the application deadline
is next week, on Friday,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.840
February 14, at 1900
UTC, which if you're

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.693
on the West Coast of
the US, is 11:00 AM.

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:22.180
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.340
What about the application
itself, are there any gotchas,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.280
or where can they get help?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.370
CAROL SMITH: So if they would
like to just get some general

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.349
guidelines on how to
submit their application,

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.890
I would direct them
into our website,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.130
which is google-melange.com.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.220
And on that site we have
a pretty extensive FAQ,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.280
which has information
about their ideas pages

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.180
and also about participating
as a mentoring organization

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.360
generally.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.100
And then within the FAQ, we also
have linked a mentor and org

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.860
admin manual, which is actually
written by mentors and org

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.790
admins who have
participated in the past

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.340
and intended for exactly these
kinds of people who would like

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.590
to participate in the program.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.030
If they still have questions
that they haven't gotten

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.154
answered, or they'd like
help with our application,

00:04:07.154 --> 00:04:09.100
we also have a general
discussion mailing list

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.780
that they can ask their
specific question on.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.640
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.380
Is there a single,
most common mistake

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.887
that orgs should look out for?

00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:18.970
CAROL SMITH: Yeah, one of
the most common mistakes

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.459
is not spending enough
time on your ideas page.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.430
As part of the application to
be a mentoring organization,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.740
we ask all the
applicants to submit

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.370
what's called an "ideas page."

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.380
Which is essentially just
a list of the projects

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.450
that they think
students might like

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.029
to work on during
the summer time.

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.070
But we want them to make
sure that they've really

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.450
thought about what that
project is going to look like,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.610
how much of a time
commitment it's going to be,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.780
whether they have the potential
mentors to mentor that project,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.880
and really what the
difficulty level is.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.440
So if anything, I would
recommend that organizations

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.040
spend most of their
time on making

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.050
sure their ideas page
is really high quality.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.100
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.800
If an org has applied and
been rejected in the past,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.360
is it a waste of time
for them to apply again?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.972
CAROL SMITH: Absolutely not.

00:05:01.972 --> 00:05:03.930
Having been rejected in
the past has no bearing

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.960
on what decisions we make in
any given year of applications.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.600
But if they've gotten
feedback on what

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.972
was wrong with our application
or why they were rejected

00:05:11.972 --> 00:05:13.930
in the past, I'd recommend
that they definitely

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.200
integrate that and change
those things for this year's

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.760
application.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.600
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.100
Have I forgotten
to ask you anything

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.720
that you get asked a lot online?

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.360
CAROL SMITH: No,
but we always have

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.340
lots of students who are
interested in volunteering

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.381
for open source projects.

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.670
So if they are even thinking
about applying for GSoC,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.420
they can definitely
start talking

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.880
to students and
potential applicants

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.920
now, if they'd like to.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.210
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.100
Well, thank you
very much, Carol.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.180
And thank you all
for joining us.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.790
If you have an open
source project,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.760
and you're considering applying,
we certainly hope you do.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.160
And happy GSoc.
