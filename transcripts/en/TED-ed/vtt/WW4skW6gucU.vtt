00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.281
If you've got a cold, 
mucus is hard to miss.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:19.364
But what is it, and what does it do
besides making you miserable?

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.539
Your body produces more than a liter
of mucus every day,

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.234
and all the wet surfaces of your body
that are not covered by skin,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:28.524
like your eyes,

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.352
nose,

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:30.255
mouth,

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:31.054
lungs,

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.369
and stomach get a liberal coating.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.386
That's why they're known 
as mucus membranes.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.928
Mucus plays lots of roles
in your body.

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.947
It keeps delicate tissues 
from drying out and cracking,

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.355
which would expose them to infection.

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:46.762
It lubricates your eyes so you can blink.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.365
It protects your stomach lining
from acid.

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:53.236
It neutralizes threats by removing
or trapping substances

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.227
that could make you sick.

00:00:55.227 --> 00:01:01.366
And finally, it houses and keeps your
body's trillions of bacterial inhabitants,

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.720
your microbiota, under control.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.083
Mucus contains lots 
of different compounds,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:10.168
including proteins, fats, and salts.

00:01:10.168 --> 00:01:15.851
But a key component of mucus versatility
is a set of proteins called mucins.

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.412
Mucins are the primary 
large molecules in mucus

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:23.054
and are essential 
for giving mucus its slippery feel.

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:26.903
They belong to a class of proteins
called glycoproteins

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:30.465
which are built out of both amino acids
and sugars.

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:35.768
In mucin, long chains of sugars
are attached to specific amino acids

00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:37.564
in the protein backbone.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:43.031
The hydrophilic sugar chains help mucin
dissolve in your body's watery fluids.

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.909
Mucus, which is up to 90% water,

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.831
stays hydrated thanks 
to these sugar chains.

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.003
Some of these mucins can interact
with other mucin molecules

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.602
to create a complex network
that establishes a barrier

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:58.786
against pathogens and other invaders.

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:03.148
That's why mucus is the body's first line
of defense against foreign objects,

00:02:03.148 --> 00:02:05.455
like bacteria and dust.

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:09.314
It's continuously produced to clear them
from the respiratory tract,

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.532
like a slimy conveyor belt.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:15.807
This keeps bacteria from getting
a solid purchase on delicate lung tissue,

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:20.302
or making it to the blood stream,
where they could cause a major infection.

00:02:20.302 --> 00:02:23.929
Many of those harmful bacteria
also cause diseases

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.783
when they cluster into slimy growths
called biofilms.

00:02:27.783 --> 00:02:29.325
But mucus contains mucins,

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:31.609
antimicrobial peptides,

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.899
antibodies,

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:36.839
and even bacteria-hungry viruses
called bacteriophages

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.786
that all work together to prevent
biofilms from forming.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.518
If microbes do become harmful 
and you get sick,

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:48.590
the body ramps up mucus production
to try to quickly flush out the offenders,

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.573
and the immune system floods your mucus
with extra white blood cells.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:57.290
In fact, the greenish mucus often
associated with infections

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.265
gets its color from an enzyme
produced by those white blood cells.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:04.348
This multi-pronged approach 
to bacterial management

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:07.918
is one of the main reasons 
why we're not sick all the time.

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:11.769
Even though mucus protects against
the infectious bacteria,

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.134
the vast majority of your body's bacterial
tenants are not harmful,

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.282
and many are actually beneficial.

00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:21.368
That's particularly true 
when they live in mucus,

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.335
where they can perform 
important functions,

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.053
like synthesizing vitamins,

00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:27.235
suppressing harmful inflammation,

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:30.867
and controlling the growth 
of more harmful species.

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:34.333
So even though you probably associate
mucus with being ill,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.585
it's really helping you stay healthy.

00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:38.246
Sure, it might seem gross,

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:42.393
but can you think of any other substance
that can lubricate,

00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:43.802
keep your body clean,

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:45.153
fight infection,

00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:48.585
and domesticate a teeming 
bacterial population?

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:51.504
Nope, just mucus.
