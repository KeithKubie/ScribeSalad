00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.859
Everyone makes mistakes - even superheroes
- so, even though the characters you see in

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.500
comic book movies are some of the most effortlessly
cool in fiction, it shouldn't come as a surprise

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.160
to find out that the actors portraying them
are every bit as capable of making a fool

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.070
of themselves as you or I.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.470
They might be superhuman on film, but they're
only human in real life, and human error is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.840
an inevitable thing.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.820
In this video, we'll take a look at ten occasions
in which bloopers occurred during the filming

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.310
of superhero movies.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.140

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.870
Here are ten of the funniest superhero movie
bloopers.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.880
Blade: Trinity
2004's Blade: Trinity was the final movie

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.030
in the popular Blade trilogy and it saw a
unique depiction of Dracula - referred to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.070
as Drake in the movie - as the villain.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.020
Portrayed by Dominic Purcell, Drake had a
human form and a monstrous form - and he transformed

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.760
into the latter to fight Blade in the final
battle.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.100
Blade ultimately defeated Drake by injecting
him with the Daystar virus, which results

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.650
in him roaring in pain.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.300
The overdramatic nature of the reaction resulted
in the actor playing him breaking down laughing

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.599
- which is a funny thing to see in full monster
prosthetics!

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.720
Spider-Man 3
Some people would argue that 2007's Spider-Man

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.150
3 was one big blooper - it really wasn't very
well-received - but there were some actual

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.350
bloopers from the movie that have surfaced
online, including one classic "can't stop

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.710
laughing" incident.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000
It's the scene in which Peter Parker and Mary
Jane Watson are in the swanky New York restaurant

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.319
and Gwen Stacy comes over to talk to Peter,
irking Mary Jane.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.030
The blooper sees Tobey Maguire laughing uncontrollably,
seemingly for no apparent reason, over and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:52.800
over again at different points in the conversation
between him and Bryce Dallas Howard's Gwen.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.689
Hellboy II: The Golden Army
In the Hellboy movies, the titular character

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.990
- brilliantly played by Ron Perlman - is a
dab hand in the use of his faithful four-round

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.290
revolver, which is known as the Good Samaritan.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.679
However, Perlman did have some trouble with
it on a couple of occasions.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.910
In 2008's Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, whilst
talking to Abe Sapien, he failed to close

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.130
the gun in an attempt to reload it in his
usual nonchalant manner, and he even struggled

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.340
to get it out of its holster in one instance!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.400
The Avengers
There's an epic scene during the final battle

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.910
between the titular team and the invading
Chitauri army in 2012's The Avengers in which

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.470
both Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer
return to the heroes at the same time.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.520
In the movie itself, both characters seamlessly
catch their signature weapons and continue

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.330
fighting - but a blooper shows that wasn't
always the case for the latter.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.290
While Chris Evans' Cap catches his shield
in style, Chris Hemsworth's Thor fumbles Mjolnir

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.560
and lets out a smile as he juggles it haplessly.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.720
Iron Man 3
Remember that awesome scene at the end of

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.560
2013's Iron Man 3 when Robert Downey Jr.'s
Tony Stark remotely called upon all of his

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.720
Iron Man armours to help him and Rhodey in
the final battle scene against Aldrich Killian

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720
and his Extremis soldiers?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.520
Well could you honestly name all of those
armours individually?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.520
No?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.930
Well, apparently, Downey Jr. couldn't either!

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.780
When he attempts to instruct the Heartbreaker
armour to assist the Red Snapper armour in

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.610
battle, he forgets the name of the latter
and simply calls it "Whatshisname" before

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.110
turning to the camera, making a funny face,
and saying "Red Snapper" when it finally comes

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.600
to him.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.940
Thor: The Dark World
We now come to our second Mjolnir blooper

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.340
in this video - and this one comes from 2013's
Thor: The Dark World.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.030
Chris Hemsworth doesn't seem to have much
luck with Thor's iconic hammer, as this scene

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.030
proves.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.880
It comes after Odin orders Thor not to leave
Asgard, but he attempts to do so anyway, so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.350
Asgard's forces are sent to stop the God of
Thunder.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.400
A group of guards attempt to apprehend Thor
in a doorway and, when the hero hits one of

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.290
them with Mjolnir, the head of the weapon
falls up, resulting in Hemsworth laughing

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.040
and swinging the handle around humorously.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.320
Guardians of the Galaxy
2014's Guardians of the Galaxy was such a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.510
fun movie, it must have been an absolute hoot
for the cast and crew to film it - and the

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.569
bloopers can only have added to that - so
here's one featuring Michael Rooker.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.910
Rooker's character Yondu Udonta was walking
with Horuz - another member of the Ravagers,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.870
played by Tom Proctor - when they walked too
far, reaching the end of the movie's set,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.330
and Rooker lightheartedly shouted at Proctor
for causing the mistake to happen.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.690
Avengers: Age of Ultron
This particular blooper is unique on this

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.441
list, as the mistake was made so many times
that it appears the people behind the movie

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:38.210
just gave up on the scene in question and
didn't include it in the final version.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.970
It came in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron,
and it's Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner trying

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.880
to pronounce a bunch of scientific words and
terms.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.800
We'll never know exactly what he was trying
to say, as he never actually gets any of it

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.540
out, but we'll let you have a listen for yourself
anyway...

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.540
Deadpool
Like the aforementioned Guardians of the Galaxy,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.450
2016's Deadpool looked like it was a hell
of a lot of fun to film, and with hilarious

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.810
personalities like Ryan Reynolds on set, bloopers
were always going to be pretty inevitable

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.410
- especially when he had sex scenes to film.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.380
In one such scene, when Reynolds and Morena
Baccarin are having some adult fun together,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.260
Reynolds just can't hold it together.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.419
His repeated thrusting causes him to break
down laughing, which subsequently results

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:24.340
in him asking for the cameras to stop rolling.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.500
Captain America: Civil War
There's a scene in 2016's Captain America:

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.520
Civil War in which Vision, while aiming to
"turn Falcon into a glider", accidentally

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.120
hits War Machine mid-flight, which disables
his armour, resulting in James Rhodes freefalling

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.520
to the ground, hitting it with a bang, and
being injured very badly.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.199
Tony Stark holds his limp, unconscious body
as Falcon arrives to apologise - but Anthony

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.650
Mackie didn't get his landing right every
time during filming.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.821
In one instance, Mackie comes in to land while
hanging on some wires, but he manages to fall

00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:55.620
face first into the ground.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.020
