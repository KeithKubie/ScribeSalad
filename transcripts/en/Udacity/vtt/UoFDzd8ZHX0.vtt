00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so why don't we take a look at some bit more famous bugs

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that kind of fit this basic flowchart.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So let's talk about a bug that happened to the Mars Climate Orbiter.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Mars Climate Orbiter was sent off to Mars in 1998,  and there were some miscommunications,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
let's say, between NASA and the people they contracted out to which was Lockheed Martin. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And by the time the Mars Climate Orbiter actually got to Mars which was in 1999, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:49.000
quite a while later, there had been some problems that caused the orbiter to drift off course enough

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 that it basically ran into a suicide mission and crashed into the Martian atmosphere

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and broke up and crashed in the planet.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What happened was a basic unit error.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
See, NASA expected units in metric, for example--meters per second,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and Lockheed Martin programmed in English units,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
for example--feet per second and neither of these are wrong.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I mean there are both entirely valid ways to program a rocket and the underlying code

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
was actually correct at least in terms of this bug didn't have anything to do with the underlying code.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But because the NASA software was expecting units in meters per second,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the Lockheed Martin software was sending feet per second English units.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That miscommunication caused its drift off that caused the Mars Climate Orbiter

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to crash into the Martian atmosphere and into the planet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So why don't we go ahead and turn this into a quiz.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Is this a bug in the software under test that is the actual software of the Mars Climate Orbiter?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Was it a bug in the acceptability test when they tested the actual software earlier on?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Was there a bug in the specification, was there actually an underlying bug,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and how they plan on operating the Mars Climate Orbiter?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Or is there a bug in the underlying hardware or libraries

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or compiler or the operating system of the rocket?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So go ahead and mark your answer here.
