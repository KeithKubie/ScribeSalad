00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to office hours for Unit 2.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We'll get started right away with questions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's start with Catherine from New Hampshire.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
She says, "I believe there were at least one or two instances where I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
gave up in frustration and viewed a solution before getting a correct

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
answer in a unit quiz."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
She wants to know, what do the unit quizzes mean?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Should she be concerned if she gets it right?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Should she be frustrated if she's getting them wrong?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I hope people aren't frustrated on the unit quizzes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The quizzes in the units are really there to help keep you engaged--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to help you learn.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you can't get the answer, that's okay that we do have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
answers recorded after them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're not being graded on the quizzes.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They are really there to help you learn.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Some of the quizzes are harder than others.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
One of the things that we do on the quizzes is rate them with gold stars.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Don't be surprised if you're not necessarily able to handle

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
those with gold stars.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Those are questions that will require a lot of thought.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Those are going to be really hard, especially for beginning students.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Those are questions that--I hope by thinking about them--you'll be

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
able to solve yourself.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you're not able to solve it yourself, don't get frustrated.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You can watch the answer--hopefully you'll understand the answer--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then maybe you'll be able to try it on your own again

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
after you've seen the answer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The quizzes don't count towards your grade.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You shouldn't be frustrated or stressed about that.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They are really there to help you learn.
