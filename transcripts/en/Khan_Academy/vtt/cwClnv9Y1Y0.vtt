Narrator: What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:05.536
is dig a little bit
deeper into labor markets.

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:08.679
It's really not going to be
any fundamentally new concepts.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.206
We're really just going
to reapply concepts

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:12.799
that we've already seen before and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.473
maybe use slightly different words,

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.139
but the reason why labor is interesting

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:19.724
is labor is one of the
factors of production.

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:21.522
It's one of the inputs you need for firms

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.821
to produce whatever they do produce.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.599
Unlike in most markets,

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.270
if we're talking about
the computer markets,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.205
let me write over here.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.938
In the computer market, the demand

00:00:33.938 --> 00:00:36.023
is coming from individuals.

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:39.083
It's coming from, I'll just
call it, individual people

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:42.212
while the supply is coming from firms,

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:43.886
is coming from firms.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.470
In the labor market it's
the other way around.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.669
In the labor market the demand is coming

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:53.465
from firms, these are the
people who need labor,

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.500
who are hiring the labor,
so this is coming from firms

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.838
and the supply is coming
from individual people.

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:04.682
So, it's coming from individual people.

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:07.059
What's interesting about that is

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:09.203
because the demand is coming from firms,

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:12.103
in the past, when the supply
was coming from firms,

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:13.842
we could look at a firms cost structure

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:16.602
and we could come up with
a supply curve from that.

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:18.672
Now that the demand is coming from firms,

00:01:18.672 --> 00:01:21.603
we can look at a firms, essentially
their revenue structure,

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:23.338
how much incremental revenue do they get

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:25.608
per extra employee and we could actually

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:28.999
generate a demand curve,
their marginal benefit curve,

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.278
by looking at their business
a little bit closer.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.747
That's essentially what we're
going to be doing in this video.

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.532
These aren't any fundamentally new ideas,

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.469
we just applying them in
a slightly different way

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.347
and we'll use slightly different words.

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:42.274
Now, let's assume, for
the sake of this video

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.387
that I run a car wash, a car wash.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.543
It is a competitive car wash.

00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:50.020
It is a competitive car wash.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.209
I have to be a price taker.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:53.803
I do not have a monopoly, or an oligopoly.

00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:55.590
I'm not even a monopolistic competitor.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.425
There are many car washes in this city.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.408
We are undifferentiated. We are
all offering the same service.

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:02.335
So, I'm going to be a price taker.

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.914
Let's say the equilibrium
price in this market

00:02:04.914 --> 00:02:09.186
for competitive car
washes is $5 per car wash,

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:11.863
$5 per car wash.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:14.471
Just as a little bit of
review, that also means,

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:15.825
remember, this is a competitive firm,

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:16.607
not a monopoly,

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:21.336
that my marginal revenue is equal
to a constant $5 per car wash.

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:24.005
If I do 1 car wash I'll
get $5, 2 car washes, $10

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.335
3 car washes, $15.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.098
In a monopoly, the marginal
revenue would change.

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.249
Let's think about how
much benefit I would get

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.158
from each incremental employee.

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:38.272
First, I'll do a ...
let's make this column

00:02:38.272 --> 00:02:41.125
right over here, let's
take this L for labor.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.403
This is going to be the quantity of labor.

00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:45.507
I'm going to think what
I hire, what zero people,

00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:50.598
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 people.

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:55.832
Let's think about how
much that we can produce

00:02:55.832 --> 00:02:58.340
when I hire these amounts of people.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.004
I'll call that total
product, or we could call it

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.037
total product of labor.

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:06.404
It's essentially saying,
how many cars can I wash?

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:08.333
This is going to be car washes per hour,

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:14.540
so cars washed per hour.

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.418
How many cars can I wash
per hour with a different

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:18.838
number of people here?

00:03:18.838 --> 00:03:21.504
Well, if I have zero people,
I'm going to wash zero cars.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:23.505
Let's say that I find if I have one person

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:27.756
that person can wash 5 cars
per hour by him or herself.

00:03:27.756 --> 00:03:30.335
Two people can wash 9 cars together.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.243
Three people can do 12 cars.

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:34.206
Four people can do 14

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:38.819
and 5 people can do 15 cars together.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.844
We can plot this.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.497
Let's actually plot this on a graph

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:43.081
just to see what's going on.

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:44.542
It always helps to visualize things,

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:48.881
so that is going to be our total product.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.119
That is going to be our total product

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.136
and this is going to be
our quantity of labor.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:04:03.866
The quantity of labor we can
have 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 people

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:05.849
and this is actually zero
people right over here

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.334
and my total product goes
all the way up to 15.

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:11.603
Let's say that this is
15, this would be 10

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:12.992
and this would be 5,

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:15.331
5, 10 and 15.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.872
So we can plot these
points right over here.

00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:19.736
What is the total product?

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:21.402
Well, this is zero/zero.

00:04:21.402 --> 00:04:24.438
Zero people, I'm not
washing any cars per hour.

00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:26.777
Total product is in cars washed per hour.

00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:32.068
If I have 1 person, I
can wash 5 cars per hour.

00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:36.739
If I have 2 people I can
wash 9 cars per hour,

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:39.544
2 people I can wash 9 cars per hour,

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:43.007
3 people, I can was 12 cars per hour,

00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:46.915
3 people I can wash 12 cars,
that's about right there.

00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:50.011
Four people, I can wash 14 cars per hour,

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.280
4 people, 14 is right about there

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.334
and then finally I will do this ...

00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:58.208
well let's see. I'm already
using a lot of my colors.

00:04:58.208 --> 00:04:59.005
Let's see, pink.

00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:01.608
Five people, I can wash 15 cars per hour,

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:04.667
5 people I could wash 15 cars per hour.

00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:09.135
So, total product is a
function of quantity of labor

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:11.000
it will look like a curve that
looks something like this.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.003
I could just connect the dots

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:13.606
or I could make it look
a little bit more curvy,

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:18.789
so it's going to look something like that.

00:05:19.682 --> 00:05:21.267
One way that we should think about it,

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.319
as you'll see in economics
when you always want

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.673
to think about how much
you want to produce

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:26.002
or how much you want to hire,

00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:26.843
you always want to think about

00:05:26.843 --> 00:05:29.867
how much benefit are you getting
for that incremental thing

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.501
when you're thinking
about your cost structure.

00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:33.335
How much cost for that incremental unit?

00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:35.535
When you're thinking about your benefits

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.580
or your demand, you're thinking,

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.003
how much benefit am I getting from

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:39.180
that incremental unit?

00:05:39.518 --> 00:05:42.473
Let's view this as the marginal ...

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:45.748
Let's write marginal product, MP.

00:05:45.748 --> 00:05:47.937
Sometimes in some economics text books

00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:49.868
I've seen this referred to as MPL,

00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.504
marginal product of labor.

00:05:51.504 --> 00:05:52.536
Actually, I'll just write the L there

00:05:52.536 --> 00:05:53.211
to make this clear.

00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:55.942
This is the marginal product of labor.

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:59.418
So, when we go from
zero people to 1 person,

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:02.136
on average between those
2 points over there,

00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:04.751
we're able to ... our delta, our change.

00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:08.335
Delta is just the Greek
letter that symbolizes change.

00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.674
Our change in total product is 5.

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:14.936
We can view that as the
average marginal product,

00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:17.807
or you can kind of view
that as marginal product

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.422
halfway between these or
you could view that as

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:21.845
the average marginal product between

00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:23.329
those two points right over there.

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:24.469
That's why I wrote it in a row.

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.543
That it is in between these two points.

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:29.472
It's taking us from zero to 1.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.468
Actually, let me plot
these while I calculate

00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:33.667
what they are.

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:38.450
So, I'll draw this one
a little bit more flat,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.940
so I have space, which I can
scroll down a little bit.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.622
So, in this axis I'm going to
do marginal product of labor

00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:48.197
and then on this axis I'm going to have

00:06:48.197 --> 00:06:49.551
the quantity of labor.

00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:57.406
This is 1, this is 2, this
is 3, 4 people and 5 people.

00:06:57.406 --> 00:06:59.439
So, this point right over here,

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.689
this point right over here, that's the

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:03.600
marginal product of labor, halfway.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.431
You could view this as a slope halfway

00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:07.546
between zero and 1 or you could view this

00:07:07.546 --> 00:07:10.004
as the average slope from zero to 1.

00:07:10.004 --> 00:07:11.630
So, I'll plot it right over here.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.373
I'll view it and actually I
haven't labeled these axis.

00:07:14.373 --> 00:07:19.686
This is, let's call this 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.857
So, halfway between zero and 1

00:07:22.857 --> 00:07:26.056
my marginal product of labor is 5,

00:07:26.056 --> 00:07:27.736
right over there.

00:07:27.736 --> 00:07:32.085
Then halfway between 1 and 2,

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:35.212
my marginal product of labor,
I go from 5 cars washed

00:07:35.212 --> 00:07:38.870
per hour to 9, so my marginal
product of labor is 4.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.069
So, between 1 and 2 my
marginal product of labor is 4

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:48.264
and then between 2 and 3,

00:07:48.264 --> 00:07:49.644
my marginal product of labor,

00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:53.006
I go from 9 car washes,
cars washed per hour to 12.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.322
So, I have 3 incremental cars washed

00:07:55.322 --> 00:07:57.212
by adding that third person,

00:07:57.212 --> 00:07:58.986
so the average that you could view that

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:02.122
as the slope right over
there is going to be 3.

00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:04.661
So, the slope right over
there is going to be 3.

00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:07.721
I didn't make this completely to scale

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:10.071
and then, these are a
little bit more bunched up

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:12.338
down here, but let's just keep going.

00:08:12.338 --> 00:08:14.869
Then from going from 3 to 4,

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.705
the marginal product of labor,

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.044
I'll go from 12 cars washed to 14,

00:08:19.044 --> 00:08:22.378
so I get 2 extra cars washed
by adding that fourth person,

00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:25.871
so between 3 and 4 I get
an incremental, on average,

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.803
2 cars for that extra person

00:08:29.803 --> 00:08:34.003
and then finally between 4
and 5, I get one extra car.

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:37.069
So, between 4 and 5 I
get exactly 1 extra car.

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:40.007
I'm going to get, it looks a
little bit like a curve here

00:08:40.007 --> 00:08:41.470
because I bunched up the measurements,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.071
but this really should be a line.

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:46.862
This really should be a line.

00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:50.003
Maybe I'll ... Well, that's my best.

00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:52.876
I don't want to have to
re-plot all the points,

00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:54.602
but this should be a line like that.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:09:00.803
Every time we moved up 1, we went down 1.

00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:03.791
Every time we moved up 1, we moved down 1.

00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:04.806
We see that over here.

00:09:04.806 --> 00:09:07.471
We went to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.542
So, this is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:09:09.542 --> 00:09:11.954
This really should be a straight line.

00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:14.207
This is essentially plotting the slope

00:09:14.207 --> 00:09:16.606
of this curve at any point.

00:09:16.606 --> 00:09:18.872
Now, what we can think about is,

00:09:18.872 --> 00:09:21.205
because this by itself, this is telling us

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:23.332
the marginal benefit in
terms of cars washed,

00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:25.005
but this doesn't tell
us the marginal benefit

00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:26.800
in terms of dollars.

00:09:27.107 --> 00:09:31.118
To do that we need the
marginal product revenue

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:32.284
or you could call it the value

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:34.351
of the marginal product of labor.

00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:36.534
Let me write that over here.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:41.961
We could call this the MPR,
for marginal product revenue

00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:44.010
or we could view that as the value

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.676
of the marginal product of labor,

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:47.740
but essentially we're saying

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.099
okay, if we're washing 5 extra
cars from that first person

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:53.238
and I'm going to get $5 per car wash.

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:55.876
I have a constant marginal revenue.

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.217
I am a price taker.

00:09:57.217 --> 00:09:59.957
Then I'm going to make $25
on those incremental 5 cars

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:03.546
and if I wash 4 more cars, 4 times 5,

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:05.546
I'm going to make $20 extra dollars.

00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:09.205
If I wash 3 extra cars, I'm
going to make $15 extra dollars.

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:11.403
Two extra cars, $10 extra dollars.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:12.908
I'm just multiplying by 5 every time.

00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:16.806
This is times 5, times 5, times 5, times 5

00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:19.629
and if I wash one extra
car, times $5 per car,

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:21.211
I'm going to make $5 extra.

00:10:21.211 --> 00:10:22.793
So, essentially we could take every point

00:10:22.793 --> 00:10:25.972
on this curve and we
could multiply it by 5

00:10:25.972 --> 00:10:28.070
to get our marginal product of revenue

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.953
or marginal product revenue.

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:32.066
I have to be careful
where I say the 'of's'.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:32.875
So let me plot that

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.202
and I'll try to plot
that a little bit neater

00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:36.027
so it's clear that this is a line.

00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:41.702
That's my marginal product revenue.

00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:42.802
You could also view that

00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:46.076
as the marginal benefit
calculated in terms of dollars.

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:47.334
You could view this as a marginal benefit

00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:48.469
in terms of cars washed.

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:51.334
This is the marginal
benefit in terms of dollars.

00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.875
Right over here we're going
to have the quantity of labor.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:11:00.373
So, 1, 2, 3 ... Actually, I want them

00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:01.739
to line up a little bit better.

00:11:02.277 --> 00:11:06.091
So, 1 is right over there,
2 is right over there,

00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:08.875
3 is there, 4 is there, and 5 is there.

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:11.672
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.038
Let me just go down a little bit.

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:15.282
This is my quantity of labor

00:11:15.282 --> 00:11:17.386
and the marginal product
revenue goes up to 25.

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:22.925
Let's say this is 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25.

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:26.471
Halfway between zero and 1 person,

00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:28.341
so this is 25 right over here.

00:11:28.341 --> 00:11:32.202
I am producing $25, or
I get an incremental

00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:35.074
revenue of $25 halfway on average.

00:11:35.074 --> 00:11:36.631
You could view this point right over here.

00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:39.799
I multiply it by 5. I'm
getting $25 on average

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.879
for that incremental person.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:44.871
Then, when we go to this
point right over here

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.134
we're getting $20. That's
this right over there.

00:11:49.134 --> 00:11:51.736
Then when we go to this point in orange,

00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:55.020
if we multiply it times
five, we get $15 dollars.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.499
So, this is 5, 10, 15.

00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:58.816
So that's halfway between 2 and 3.

00:11:58.816 --> 00:12:02.231
Our marginal product revenue is $15,

00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:03.818
so that is ... I'm going to make it clear.

00:12:03.818 --> 00:12:05.736
This is 15 right over there

00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:10.740
and then halfway between
3 and 4 people it's $10,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.879
halfway between 3 and 4 it is $10,

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:15.735
so it's going to look something like this

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.002
and then halfway between,
finally between 4 and 5,

00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:21.897
it is $5, it is $5.

00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.936
So, we're just picking points along here.

00:12:24.936 --> 00:12:25.901
We picked kind of the mid-point,

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.012
the slope at those points
or the average slope

00:12:28.012 --> 00:12:29.943
between zero and 1,

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:33.400
but if you assume this
curve has a continuous slope

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.739
the slope changes continuously,

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:35.734
then this will be a line

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:37.833
and then this will be a line as well.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.007
So, our line will look something like that

00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:42.970
and what's neat about this line

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.007
is essentially, this is
the marginal benefit curve.

00:12:46.007 --> 00:12:48.272
Marginal benefit curve for this firm

00:12:48.272 --> 00:12:51.535
as it gets more and more labor.

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:53.073
So, it's essentially the demand curve

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.229
for this firm.

00:12:54.229 --> 00:12:56.343
If you wanted to find the
demand curve for the market

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.939
you could just take the demand curve

00:12:57.939 --> 00:12:59.646
for each of these competitive firms

00:12:59.646 --> 00:13:01.840
and then you would just
add them all together.
