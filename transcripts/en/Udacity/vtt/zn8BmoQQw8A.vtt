00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.620
Now before I start coding, I want to ask

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.520
you, what steps would you take to rename a bunch

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.300
of files on your computer? Don't worry about writing

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.630
any code right now. In simple English, just identify the

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.710
steps you would need to make to create this

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
program. Step one, do this. Step two, do that. You

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.240
can submit your answer on the discussion forum, and while

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.890
still there, you can read the ideas others have submitted.
