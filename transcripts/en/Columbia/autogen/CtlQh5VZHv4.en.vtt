values let me one way to think about

01:00:10.639 --> 01:00:10.649
values let me one way to think about
 

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:13.309
values let me one way to think about
that it's sort of a simple point but

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319
that it's sort of a simple point but
 

01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:15.109
that it's sort of a simple point but
once easy to see is in the case of gun

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119
once easy to see is in the case of gun

control so for example in Canada we tend

01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:17.369
control so for example in Canada we tend
 

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:18.620
control so for example in Canada we tend
to say that people shouldn't have guns

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:18.630
to say that people shouldn't have guns
 

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:21.409
to say that people shouldn't have guns
in the US as an American value we feel

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:21.419
in the US as an American value we feel
 

01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:22.879
in the US as an American value we feel
people should have dogs but then they'll

people should have dogs but then they'll
face the consequence of using the gun so

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:24.719
face the consequence of using the gun so
 

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:26.959
face the consequence of using the gun so
in one case you have an ex ante control

01:00:26.959 --> 01:00:26.969
in one case you have an ex ante control
 

01:00:26.969 --> 01:00:28.699
in one case you have an ex ante control
over behavior the other one is expose

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:28.709
