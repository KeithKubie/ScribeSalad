BILL AULET: I'm Bill Aulet.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.530
I'm the managing director of the Martin
Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.730
We help hundreds of entrepreneurs
build great products and great teams.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.540
These are the two most important
elements for a successful new venture.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.140
We encourage our students
to have hackers, hustlers,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.720
and hipsters on the team because
this hybrid vigor increases

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.075
their odds of producing
a truly great company.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:31.720

ERDIN BESHIMOV: I'm Erdin Beshimov.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.250
I run an experimental
production group at MIT.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.110
I'm also a teaching
fellow in this course.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.109
Bill said that entrepreneurship
is about a team.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.890
Well, so is online education.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.980
We've brought together
Hollywood cinematographers,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.000
great graphic designers, instructional
designers, MIT Entrepreneurship,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.085
MIT faculty to create the Ferrari
of online education for you.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.910
BILL AULET: When MIT first started
in the online education area,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.210
we put people in the back of the room,
with cameras, to record the lectures.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.100
PROFESSOR 1: This is 600, also known
as Introduction to Computer Science.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580
PROFESSOR 2: We're going to
start with non-linear analysis.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.184
PROFESSOR 3: And what is not covered
today can and will be the on the exam.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.600
BILL AULET: That was a good start.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.890
But as time has gone on,
we can do so much more.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.700
Today, with the advanced technologies,
as well as incorporating cinematography

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.590
techniques, we can
interweave powerful stories

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.510
with the lectures to give a vibrant
and energetic experience to people well

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.570
beyond the walls of MIT.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
ERDIN BESHIMOV: This is transmedia
at its most experimental.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.080
And it might be at its best.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.890
We are taking one medium,
filmmaking, and taking it

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.180
into a whole different medium,
the internet and online education.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.120
The goal of the course is to continue
the entrepreneurial revolution

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120
around the world.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.640
If at least one of you
starts a company and feels

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.580
like you're changing
the world and the people

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.454
that you're bringing to
your company, if they

00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:19.540
feel like they're changing the
world, we have done our job.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.630
Nothing will make us happier than that.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.300
So welcome to the course.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.110
And good luck.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.990
NARRATOR: MIT began as
an institution designed

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.830
to serve the needs of our society at an
early stage of its industrialization.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.260
If we are to produce the kind
of world required for the safety

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.480
and well-being of the human
beings who live in it,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.600
we must build on this
international tradition.
