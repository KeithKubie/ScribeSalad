00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.189
We, at The Container Store, and I'm just speaking
with my Container Store hat on as the CEO

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.309
of Container Store, one of the foundation
principles, the company is sort of based on

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.750
a sort of seven foundation principles that
are all very simple but very thought-provoking,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.220
kind of like the golden rule: very, very simple
but very thought-provoking at the same time,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.470
things that nobody ever disagrees with.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.230
How many people do you know that say I don't
know about that do unto others thing, maybe

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.519
that's not such a good idea after all.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.390
So one of them is one equals three; that one
great person can easily do the business productivity

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.399
of three good people.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.370
It's actually an understatement.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.081
There's all kinds of things that you do 14
times or 38 times better than me, but one

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:53.590
equals three allows you to kind of hold out
for only the great employee.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.309
I mean we think the most important thing that
we do is who we hire to join The Container

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.220
Store, that wonderful company, so we're looking
for people that we think will do at least

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.581
three times the productivity that someone
else might hire for that position, and no

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:09.660
one's overqualified.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.520
I mean we always joke that if a retired federal
reserve chairman wants to work in our accounting

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.220
department that's fine with us.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.860
If you go to our stores and look at who's
working there you have masters degrees.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.860
The average full-time sales person in the
store makes about $48,000, which is not an

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.820
enormous amount of money but it's a lot of
money, it's a whole lot of money for a retail

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.290
sales position.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.180
First you have to believe that you can get
great people to work in a retail sales position

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.350
or in a hot distribution center in Dallas
Texas.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.240
And boy have we been successful at that.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.530
And we've been on Fortune magazine’s 100
Best Companies to Work for in America list

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.800
for 15 years in a row, number one twice, number
two twice.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.930
We have a reputation for being a great place
to work, and so we seek out great people.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.800
We put you through eight interviews, so we
wind up with great people and they're very

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.920
productive and they're very innovative.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.120
Then you can pay them well and you need to
pay them well.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.070
People join The Container Store and they never
leave.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.430
I mean our turnover is single digit in an
industry that averages triple digit, and pay

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.020
is part of that.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.430
It's an inverted pyramid.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.610
I don't, as CEO, I make substantially less
than industry average.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.230
The vice presidents make maybe about industry
average, but the people closest to the customers

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.410
and the people in the stores make well above
industry average.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.250
In fact we say in general 50 to 100 percent
above industry average; that can vary a little

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.280
geographically.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.940
It's different in San Francisco and New York
than it is in Fort Worth and Atlanta.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.720
But you're getting three times the productivity
at only 50 to 100 percent higher labor costs.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.990
So the employee wins because she's getting
paid 50 percent more than somebody else would

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.800
likely pay her, the company wins because It's
getting three times the productivity at that

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.840
only 50 percent higher cost, and the customer
wins because they're getting this engaged

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840
really great employee.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
When you go in the stores the people that
wait on you have been there four years or

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.890
eight years or 12 years, they love their jobs
and they're truly interested in your storage

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.100
and organization problem.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.710
So, we're not advocates of paying mediocre
people well, we enjoy excellence, we insist

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.240
on a meritocracy and we really believe in
paying great people well; we give much bigger

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.490
than usual annual increases.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.050
I'll look forward to the day when we have
people on the sales floor making $100,000

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.050
a year.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.560
We don't have a single one yet but I think
we will sometime and I think plenty of people

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.470
are good enough to make that.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.870
A great place to work it's not just about
pay, but pay is still important.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.380
People's families depend upon it.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.900
It's very important.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.240
We're trying to pay in accordance to contribution.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.080
Most business people will tell you I don't
know, some of my worst people make the most

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.330
money and some of my best people make the
least money.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.800
And you just have to realize how important
it is.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.390
You have a finite pie of compensation.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.889
The person who makes the 15th biggest contribution
should have the 15th biggest slice of the

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:23.889
pie.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.060
I think it's important that people feel mildly
tickled, maybe you don't want them to feel

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.040
wildly tickled, but maybe if they feel mildly
tickled about their compensation they feel

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.250
very hopeful about the opportunities they
have for advancement if they want that or

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.410
more money or a lot more money if they want
that.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.870
So, there's also a pride factor.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:55.150
There's also the new groom wants his new father
in law to be proud of what his salary is,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.210
so this stuff’s important.
