00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.140
INTERVIEWER: Over
the past few years

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.630
there's been a worldwide
focus on STEM education,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.370
and nowhere is
that more apparent

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.820
than in the schools,
Build A Plane

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.570
challenge, where school
kids come together

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.315
to literally build an
airplane from scratch.

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:21.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.150
But first let me talk about this
airplane that's being built.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.730
It's not a toy or a model.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.130
It's not a drone flown
by remote control.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.070
It's an actual, legitimate,
real-life airplane-- propeller,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.110
instruments, seating for two.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.950
This one here is a
work in progress,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.620
built by these kids
that will one day fly

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.050
at one of the biggest
air shows in the world,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.390
right alongside some of the most
impressive, most recognizable

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.500
aircraft.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.440
But the satisfaction
of seeing the plane

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.220
you built fly in
front of thousands

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.990
isn't the reason
these kids do it.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.700
I talked to Stuart Blakemore
who is in charge of STEM

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.470
at Wolverhampton
Academy, and who

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.430
is managing this
particular plane project,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.887
and he expressed just how
powerful this program is.

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:04.470
STUART BLAKEMORE: The fact that
they are doing something real.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620
The fact that there's
something tangible.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.730
And the fact that it is
hard and complicated,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.400
it lifts the whole tenor
of what we're doing.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.400
We've got a lot of
Boeing subcontractors

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.560
around where we are, and
we take the kids around

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.460
and work with them.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.660
And when they see
the parts being made,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.600
and they can identify it
with bits on the airplane,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.890
it's difficult to
express verbally

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.510
the way that they are
operating at a level

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.989
that 11, 12, 13-year-old kids
should not be operating at.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.780
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I
mean I imagine that it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.410
can be life changing for sure.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.630
STUART BLAKEMORE: Now, I know
that this project has probably

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.690
changed the lives-- really,
really dramatically changed

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.590
the lives of 15 to 20
people in our area.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590
INTERVIEWER: That change
comes through new skill

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.030
sets, knowledge, friends,
and opportunities.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.100
Graduates of the program
administered jointly

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490
by the Royal Aeronautical
Society and Boeing,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.760
received scholarships,
apprenticeships, and jobs,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.460
thanks to the
experience of building

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.480
an airplane with classmates
and a team of volunteers

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.609
who mentor and coach them.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.400
I talked to one graduate
of the program who

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.720
echoed these sentiments.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.700
What do you look back on
during the Build A Plane

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.937
with like the most fondness?

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.770
JOHN PHILLIPS: Well,
when I look back on it,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.460
I see the way I've changed, and
the way I have helped people

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.960
change.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.040
So, the way it changes them
and gets them into engineering.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.970
So they could leave
and get an instant job

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.370
within an engineering facility.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.190
INTERVIEWER:
Engineering that e word

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.430
kept coming up when I was
talking to people involved

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.580
in the project.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.570
This is a major success and
a goal in STEM education--

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.090
to get kids excited about
science, technology, math,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.041
and engineering.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:41.290
What was your favorite thing
about It-- about building

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.230
the plane in general?

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.430
SUBJECT 1: That's really
hard because I've enjoyed

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.990
building most of the plane.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.940
INTERVIEWER: So there's no one
thing, you just like all of it.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.990
Are you going to take that
skill and go on and do

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.950
something else with it?

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.680
SUBJECT 1: Definitely

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.410
INTERVIEWER: Like what?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.535
SUBJECT 1: I want to be an
engineer when I'm older.

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:56.900
SUBJECT 2: I want to be a
naval engineer when I'm older,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.935
so this will help, definitely.

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:00.476
RAVI RAM GE: When I grow up, I
want to be a website designer,

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:03.810
but I'm also having a bit of
a, like a, change of plan,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.200
thinking because this has
changed things for me.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.950
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.366
RAVI RAM GE: Yeah,
because now I'm

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.130
getting better in
Physics because,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.830
before I never used to
know a thing about physics.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.470
But now, I do, it's great.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.970
INTERVIEWER: Now,
I don't know where

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.900
these kids were before they
started on their journey

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.776
to build an airplane.

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:21.441
I don't know what
their aspirations were

00:03:21.441 --> 00:03:22.830
or what they wanted out of life.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.870
But what I do know is
where they are now.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.430
They are optimistic
and confident.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.872
They are looking
towards a future

00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:30.330
where they'll be putting to
use the skills they've learned,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.650
not just hands on skills like
riveting and using power tools,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.040
but how to work in teams,
how to use math in real life

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.940
situations, and how to see
a project through from start

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.550
to finish.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.130
The plane these kids are
building isn't ready for flight

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.710
just yet, but I
was with them when

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.750
they got to see a past Build A
Plane success story take off.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.130
And yes, they were
excited to see it fly.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.710
But you can tell
they also couldn't

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.880
wait to get back to
their school to complete

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.151
their plane so in two years
they can be right back here,

00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.650
watching a volunteer fly their
achievement overhead in front

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.750
of thousands.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.810
Of course, that will
come with mixed feelings.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.320
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.089
SUBJECT 3: So you know we built
it, and him to be flying in it.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.730
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.694
SUBJECT 3: You've got to be
terrified at the same time.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:22.444
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:34.001
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.750
INTERVIEWER: In order
to respect the power

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.760
and ingenuity of
modern day aircraft,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.720
you have to look to the past.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.790
Meet Tracey Curtis-Taylor,
a true seeker

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.990
and aviator who restored
and flew a classic Boeing

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.279
Stearman around the world.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:48.570
TRACEY CURTIS-TAYLOR: Everybody
calls this real flying.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.950
So I'm going to take an airplane
like this around the world,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.850
flying the rivers, the lakes,
THE shorelines at low level.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.350
This is probably the best
flying adventure in the world.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.850
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you for watching.
