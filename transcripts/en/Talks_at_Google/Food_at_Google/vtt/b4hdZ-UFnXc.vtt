[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.840
NANCY HACHISU: Thank you.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.080
So as Sonya said, I
have two other books.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.660
This is my third book.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.270
A lot of people Google me.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.430
And they think, oh,
you're the farm girl.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.982
And they write me
this email and say,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.190
can I come stay at your farm?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.410
I'm like, no, please no.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.576
I mean, I actually
haven't been able to--

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:32.659
I was never the farm girl.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.250
I grew up in Atherton.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.390
OK.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.410
Let's just be real.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.210
And I did what I could,
because my husband

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.370
was a chicken farmer.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.140
And say, I wanted
to eat the chickens.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.150
So he has to kill--

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.200
or chicken.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.480
And he has to kill it for me.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.590
And then so I should
be the one to clean it.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.170
And I've never done it before.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.400
But that was how I got into--

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.710
and we were also kind of
beatnik types in Atherton.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.740
So it was not so, so
different approach wise.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.570
But I tried really hard
on the farm helping out.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.770
He never sold vegetables.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.000
It was just for the family.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.200
Also, he grows rice and
wheat for the family.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.810
And we have three children,
have a little home businesses,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.980
out of school.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.980
I was teaching cooking.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.060
And so I just did what I
could as the Atherton girl

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.550
who had not the
strength of character

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.140
as this farm husband of mine.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.120
And time went along.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.880
I was also trying to do an
edible schoolyard type thing.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.170
It's really difficult with
three and four-year-olds,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.770
because they run
all over the field.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.610
They smash the little
lettuce seedlings.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.330
And they scatter
the seeds like that.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.210
But I just kept trying.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.290
And then I had wanted
to write a cookbook.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.623
I was thinking I was going to
write a cookbook about my food.

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:08.539
My husband was doing all
the Japanese cooking.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.710
I did some.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.575
I've been cooking
since I was a kid.

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:18.802
And I thought the easiest entrÃ©e
into publishing was in Japan,

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:20.385
because that's where
my contacts were.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.840
But I started taking
online classes at Stanford

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.000
to get back my writing.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.250
And people told me
to start a blog.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.170
And I heard of this.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.110
And so one of my
friends said just

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.160
check David Lebovitz's
blog, which I did.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.740
And there was this blog
camp, which I went to.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.620
David recommended, he said--

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.850
use me as an example.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.960
If you're living on an
organic Japanese farm,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.985
then you should write
a book about niche.

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:58.440
You should write a book about
the 100 best farm recipes.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.580
So I was like, OK.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.820
I was going to write that
book after my little book.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.530
But I guess everybody
wants the Japanese book.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.860
Well in fact, I was collecting
books, because that was my--

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.466
I'm always looking
ahead very many years.

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:18.340
I already have the next
few books mapped out.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.210
But I have never
really seen a book

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.350
that I wanted to cook
from in Japanese cooking.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.084
I do have [INAUDIBLE]
and things like that.

00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:31.750
Actually, I haven't
looked at his books.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.110
And he's probably a good
example of somebody to go to.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.750
But there was a lot
of women's cooking.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.400
And it was not really
appealing to me.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.190
We drink wine, or beer, or
sake, which are not tea.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.747
I wasn't looking for sweet
foods or little stylized foods

00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:55.330
that you have to buy all these
things at the supermarket from.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.850
This is not what we ate.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.720
And so I was always
intending to write--

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.650
and also, I like a
more direct food.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.080
And so I intended to
write a book of my--

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.560
on my [INAUDIBLE] pages
for Stanford I would say,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.370
I'm going to write the book
of this, and this, and this.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.490
When Japanese men
cook was the thing.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.420
And I do that to keep
myself motivated.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.260
OK, five years from now
I will have this book.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.230
But it took a few reunions
before it actually

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.750
materialized.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.010
And I had another friend,
the soba guy, soba chef guy.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.630
And I just loved
their food so much.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.755
There were different foods.

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:40.770
But in the end, I wrote
a book about our food,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.830
my husband's food, Kanchan's
food, and then my food,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.060
because I had never even
made nikujaga, frankly,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.180
which is a so standard dish.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.740
And I was chasing my husband.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.570
Tadaaki, Tadaaki, how
do you make nikujaga?

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.080
He'd say, OK, this much meat,
and this much onions, and glug,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.370
glug, glug soy sauce,
and some ginger,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.630
and simmer it for 15
minutes, and blah.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.910
So I did it.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.670
I got all the stuff all ready.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.110
And then I used what I
thought was the right amount

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.750
and then measured it after
how much I actually used.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.160
And that became the recipe.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.520
And it was perfect the first
time and better than his.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.798
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.530
Which we don't say
in front of him.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.335
And he doesn't watch
these, so no problem.

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.560
Though some of his
friends do and report in.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.570
It's really kind of bad.

00:05:47.182 --> 00:05:48.890
I wrote more, and
more, and more recipes.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.530
Each project, whether it's
a book or it's a meal,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.260
it gels at some point.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.300
And then it shoop, like that.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.180
So you approach it
thinking, OK, I'm

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.070
going to organize the book,
or the project, like this.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.470
Then you don't
want to step on it

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.110
too much, because
then you're messing

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.390
with the creative part of it.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.570
And then finally,
it just makes sense.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.960
And then you can actually
do the nuts and bolts of it.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.480
And that happened
with each book.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.730
I considered regionality
for the first two books.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.090
For the preserving book, I was
really intending to separate it

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.120
regionally and seasonally.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.800
No.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.240
We were talking
about seasonality,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.130
forget the regionality.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.000
I considered seasonality
for the first two books.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.570
And it became too
difficult, because carrots

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.545
were all year round.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:56.430
Komatsuna is the green
leaves, all year round.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.030
And preserving was made
sense to be seasonally.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.560
But there's the summer.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.462
And there's winter.

00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:07.420
And then some of those
vegetables go both ways.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.940
So it made much
more sense that I

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.730
wrote a book about
where I organized it

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.380
through the mediums, the
preserving, or pickling,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.730
mediums.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.730
And also by then, I was
visiting the makers.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.720
It was intended that I had
a small budget for that

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.000
from the publishers,
a production budget I

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.060
didn't have to pay back.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.525
But then at the same time, I was
contacted by Fuji Television.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.890
Now I can ask for payment,
but not very much.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.380
But basically with
TV, they think

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.632
they're doing you a favor.

00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:56.715
But they paid some of the
expenses for the travel.

00:07:56.715 --> 00:07:58.260
And that was very helpful.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.612
And also, it opens
doors, because you say,

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:02.820
oh, I want to come visit you.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.930
And I want to find out
all this information.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.390
And if it's for TV, they're
like, yeah, sign me up.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.080
But if it's a book that they'll
see maybe three years from now,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080
I mean, now I know them.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.970
And so it's fine.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.250
But there was some
issues with this book.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.720
The politicians
were all excited.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.000
I have a friend in the
prime minister's office.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.344
And he said, oh, all these guys
in the prefectural government,

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:26.010
they got really excited
when I told them

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.510
about this book
you're doing, Nancy.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.929
And they want to share
their local recipes.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.000
And then when we really
got down to the fact

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.700
that, well, it's
coming out in 2018,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.390
and this was in
2015, like, what?

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.540
Well, they won't be
in office anymore.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.328
So we'll forget that one.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:48.760
OK.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.760
So it was really hard to--

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.080
I had to pay all the travel
and photography, which

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.920
that's another story.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.890
So I set up for this book.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.100
So that was my life.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.970
I wrote about our
life, our friends.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.570
I also wanted to write about
what I felt was the real Japan,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.270
or the Japan I
knew, because people

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.375
love to tell these stories about
how Japanese are so mysterious.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.670
Oh, there's all sorts
of weird adjectives.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.440
But I mean, I just find
you can hug people.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.540
You can do whatever you
want, except for there's

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.120
some foreign things people do
like, I mean, the shoe thing.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.720
Or I don't like to take big,
foreign men into antique shops,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.280
because they bang things around.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:43.892
But there's a part of
Japan that a lot of people

00:09:43.892 --> 00:09:44.850
don't quite understand.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.030
And that's the
relationship issues.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.850
And that comes into play
with asking for things.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.710
There's an inherent
responsibility

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.770
about how you ask,
what you give back.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.030
And also, I've
occasionally been contacted

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.390
by some filming people.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.200
And me introducing
somebody to them,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.730
there's a huge responsibility
on my part as the introducer.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.760
But otherwise, I mean,
Japanese people wise,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.530
we're all the same
all over the world.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.220
We have some other differences.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.310
So that's what I wanted to show.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.490
And also, frankly, I mean,
some of the cookbook authors

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.530
tell you, oh, every Japanese
has every color on the table.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.040
It's white.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.520
It's black.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.019
It's green.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:31.080
It's red.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.340
Which is just bullshit.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.520
And I'm sorry.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.540
They don't.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.260
And they don't have
sweet, and sour,

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.200
and all these food tastes
on the table every day.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.015
Everybody is just scrambling
to get the food on the table.

00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:51.120
Most likely they're buying it
at the supermarket or 7-Eleven,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.610
big way of life there.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.855
So people are just
trying their best.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.480
And cooking is down
all over the world.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.260
We all know that.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.480
And the Japanese government
is super worried about it

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.040
in Japan.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.780
But the great thing
about Japan is

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.840
things change really quickly,
because if something happens

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.090
in the media or
something happens here,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.970
and then you can take a second
look at their own country.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.640
And that's actually
the great thing

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.410
of living in a small country,
because the US is this morass--

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.570
it's like this frigate.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.390
How do you move that frigate
from its decided course?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:31.300
And actually I was just in
Malibu at a pop-up I did.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.870
And this very famous surfer,
who I don't know the name,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.197
said to me--

00:11:36.197 --> 00:11:36.780
he's Japanese.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.600
And he said, I give your
"Japanese Farm Food" book

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.010
to so many friends when I want
to say this is Japanese food

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.040
that I want.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.340
I mean, he also has a
little organic garden.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.520
This is the food that I
think is Japanese food.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.710
And this is the way Japan is.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.260
And so that was a huge
compliment actually.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.230
That was just recently.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.180
But then I wrote
the preserving book.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.210
A lot of it was research,
and also from friends,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.610
from the makers,
various sources.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.080
And basically, I
wanted it to be--

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.010
it was six months
late turning in,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.830
because there was
so much I found.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.330
And I felt like,
I'm not going to be

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.360
writing another preserving
book for God knows when.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.140
And so this is my chance to
put in methods that actually I

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.370
did once, I mean, if you
could think about it.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.460
And so I put them in as
methods, not recipes.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.000
And OK, fermentation geeks,
they can just give it a go,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.980
and use your brains, and
work it out yourself.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.920
But if you imagine
a preserving book,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:53.360
you get one chance at ume,
the sour, so-called, plum.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.720
Or there's really
one small window

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.280
for doing semi-dry daikon
and those type of pickles.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.340
And so it's in December.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.420
You can fudge it.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.700
But you don't get a lot
of chances at these.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.290
And especially, it takes
a few months for something

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.740
to actually become the
preserve it's supposed to be.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.460
And then oops, and
then what do you do?

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.350
So it was a little bit panicky.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.310
But this book, I
got asked to do it.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:29.450
Phaidon doesn't take
pictures, they ask you.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.920
And it's part of
a country series.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.460
And you guys are
probably too young,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.580
but the Time Life series
is a famous country series.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.390
I think they're trying
to jump into that slot.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:48.050
It started out with a very
famous Italian cookbook

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.760
that's, in English
they translated it,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.370
called "The Silver Pot Palate."

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.240
it was a big, big
seller in Italy

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.656
and then a huge seller here.

00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:56.530
And then they did the
same with a French one.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.160
And then they segued into
asking an author in country.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.400
And then finally, they started
naming it blah, blah, blah,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.270
the cookbook.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.390
And I think they're renaming
some of the older books.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.180
And I was a little
scared, because I was just

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.584
taking a little sabbatical from
my first publisher, who now

00:14:16.584 --> 00:14:17.750
doesn't do my books anymore.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.780
So I've moved on to another one.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.650
They have a new CEO.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.025
And they're trying
to make money.

00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:27.920
So they're doing YA
and some weird poetry

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.650
that I know is really--

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:35.720
I shouldn't even say it, because
I don't know anything about it.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.590
But I guess YA is big
and poetry something.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.150
You probably all know it,
because it's a big seller.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:50.680
And anyway, so I was very
disciplined about this book.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:58.240
And I had signed the
contract 2015, winter.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.910
So I had two years to
two and a half years

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.240
to do it, two years to do it.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:10.960
And I separated the
country out into--

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.310
I don't even have
a watch either.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.860
Hey, Max, can you
give me my phone?

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.670
Thanks.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.610
I separated the
country out to places

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.370
where I knew chefs,
because you can pay someone

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.820
to cook for you.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.790
That's a concept.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.610
And that's the easiest way.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.860
That was the easiest entrÃ©e.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.030
And the chefs know
the local people.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.610
And they know the artisans.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:41.990
And so I started to
travel to these places.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.625
These photos are
not in the book.

00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:45.190
We'll pick that up later.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.845
My idea was I was going
to go two to three times,

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:53.920
then take the photographer
the last time,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:01.330
and developing the
relationship before bringing

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.130
the photographer.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.860
And I wished I could
have gone more.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:12.910
But that's the max on
my personal budget.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:20.230
So I did find that, again,
without the camera, some

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.930
of the people, like
the fisherman lady,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.800
actually didn't want to do the
cooking thing for me again.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.030
And they had with the camera.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.960
Some other local ladies did.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.420
And then some of the
ladies were like, oh, yeah.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.035
They would sit around the table.

00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:37.600
And we're drinking tea.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.560
And they'd be telling
me and the chef

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.900
about all these local
foods that they make.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.960
And oh, yeah, but they
make them at New Year

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.910
or at Obon in the summer.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.510
And what am I going to say?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.385
Can I come next time?

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.384
And can you cook for me?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.910
But I was gathering material.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.380
And then I was photographing
the chef's food

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.540
and organizing the book.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.760
I had to make a
decision pretty much

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.650
not to do Hokkaido and
Okinawa, because they were off

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.640
of Honshu.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.849
But I included Kyushu and
had a lot of material.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:24.700
But then my photographer quit.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.530
And I hired another guy.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.600
And Phaidon didn't particularly
like that guy for some reason.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.760
I don't know why.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.390
And so all these
photos were out.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.870
And I've repurposed
them with another book,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.490
"Food Artisans of Japan" book,
for Hardie Grant in Australia.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:50.290
And I had to rethink, OK, how
will I organize this book now

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.650
without--

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.130
there's no stories, no photos.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.600
There was like
seven in the book.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.750
And the food photography
was done in New York.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:03.880
And around that
time, or before that,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.090
before that I was going
to put a little section

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.970
in the back of some of
the Frenchy Japanese food,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.910
which is super cool.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.940
And the Italiany Japanese food,
because a lot of the chefs

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.930
I know aren't doing
Japanese food.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.000
They're doing
French and Italian.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.780
But it's not really
French and Italian.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.280
One of the guys said
to me, you know,

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:36.280
Nancy, the reason why
this group of chefs

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.690
can do this food, this
Italian or this French food,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:45.100
is because we're approaching it
through our Japanese culinary

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.000
roots.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.320
And so we're bringing the
techniques and the flavors

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.930
into French and Italian food.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.355
And so that's what makes it,
he's not going to say special.

00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:58.870
But for me, that's
what makes it special.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.740
I mean, maybe he's going to say
that's what makes it unique.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.560
I mean, they're using dashi.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.450
There's a lot of clarity
in Japanese food.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.100
And so if you think
about it, I mean,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.650
frankly, I think that some of
the Japanese French and Italian

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.300
food is better than what
I've had in France and Italy.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.230
But anyway, I was going to
put some shojin ryori in there

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.850
too in the back section.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.880
And I know this Zen nun,
known her for years.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.440
And again, it was a situation
of how do I ask her?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.160
And she lives in Okayama,
which is near Kyoto.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.870
And I live near Tokyo, well
an hour on the bullet train.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.830
How do I ask her to cook for me?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.110
I mean, it's a really
hard thing to do.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.890
And I don't really know
what the situation is.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:54.140
Well it turns out, and
I saw her a few times.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.470
And finally, the
second time, there

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.600
is this ceremony
at Meigi Jingu I

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.860
go to every or every
other year, where

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.995
the guy cuts down the
[? carp ?] without touching it

00:20:06.995 --> 00:20:08.390
with this massive knife.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.890
It looks like it
can't cut anything.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.560
But I guess it must
be like a katana.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.940
And the guy's 34th
generation Shijo.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.550
I forget his first
name, ex rock drummer.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.360
And he's the head of this
family, Shijo family,

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.500
that is one of the protectors
of Japanese cuisine.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.900
And they've got a street named
after him in Kyoto, Shijo-dori.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.950
It's the one with the little
river on it, really pretty.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.250
Anyway, so I approached
her at that second one.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.380
And I asked her, I was
kind of feeling her out,

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.300
on how to cook [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.280
And she said, oh, I
can do it any time.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.580
I could come to your
house, or you could come.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.820
So I really pinned
her down on it.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.660
And she wrote me this fax,
because she was not super--

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.670
I know she has a smartphone.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.090
And she does some really
short, little emails.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.570
But she sent me a
fax, a long fax,

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.990
explaining about the situation.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.460
She cooks at two temples.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.570
She doesn't live
there, they're Zen,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.410
because the men priests
are in residence.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.730
And they just eat Japanese food.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.730
And because they don't
really have a big budget,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.490
they don't eat the
greatest Japanese food.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.270
The katsuobushi is the
little, tiny packages.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.610
But she has a really
beautiful feel of her food.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.190
And anyway, I was there.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.390
And then it turns out she cooked
a whole shojin lunch for me,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.730
just for me, not even for her.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.300
And it's quite a big--
it's the temple food.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:48.050
There's just a whole prescribed
amount of dishes and placement.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.650
But she was excited
about the whole thing.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:58.610
And I was planning to come back
for each season in planning

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.640
for the future for
our shojin ryori book

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.520
that I will be doing, hopefully.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.680
And I brought the
photographer once.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.667
But anyway, on that
first trip, she

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:10.250
gave me this book
that she had written

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.333
before she'd become a nun.

00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:14.290
It was called something,
"Kenko Ryori," healthy cooking.

00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:20.300
We didn't have that.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.430
We had her temple food book.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:23.660
And I handed it to my--

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.100
I'm a very lazy Japanese reader,
writer, reader and writer.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.450
And I handed it to my son,
Andrew, who was in between jobs

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.940
and just doing this
all day long, which

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.870
is really irritating, because
I didn't grow up with that.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.080
And I hate it.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.860
And so I give him the book.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.060
And he's got a good palate.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.970
He used to work
for the soba guy.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.970
And I gave him the book.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.229
And I said, Andrew,
can you help me?

00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:50.395
Can you please do something?

00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:52.070
Because also I was feeding him.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.430
And his father was doing
his laundry, not me.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.760
And I gave him a little
stack of Post-its.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.850
And the book is this big.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.650
I think there's
260 recipes in it.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.950
And I said, could you
just mark anything

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.510
that looks really delicious?

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.680
And so eventually, I don't
know how long it took him.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.580
I got the book back.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.620
And it had 100 marks in it.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.480
And I was really excited.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.610
And so I sat down with
one of my ex-students,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.980
who was interning
for me in the summer.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.680
And again, I cook
for the students.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.980
And so they're all
fairly food oriented.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.585
And I know his mom cooks too.

00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:30.830
And he's a local kid.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.710
He was in high school and
on his way to university.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.650
And we sat down together,
because, like I said,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.500
I'm a lazy Japanese reader.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.730
Also, the beauty of this
book, it had recipes but not--

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.800
I mean, just list
up of ingredients

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.096
and then a really loose method.

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:51.470
I mean, publishers
now, they want

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.390
to know how many minutes
for every single thing.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:24:02.170
And she would give like,
it should taste like this.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.590
And she'd give an example.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.570
And I sat down with Keigo.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.480
And we went through the titles,
and they were also really

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.420
unusual titles, the titles and
then what was in each thing.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.150
And we were just like, wow.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.811
And we went through
the whole book.

00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:18.060
Have you ever had that before?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.660
No.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.660
Doesn't that sound good?

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.620
Oh, yeah.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.880
And so we were both
really excited about this.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.250
Yeah, I want to eat that too.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:31.300
And so starting August
1st, in earnest, I just--

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.660
oh, I asked my assistant
to record the book,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.980
because I didn't want
to miss anything.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:47.560
And August 1st, I started
just madly writing recipes,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.980
no proportions yet.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.180
I was just listing
up the ingredients

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.720
and the general method.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.540
And I was going
from the recording

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.100
on one of my old phones.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.350
And then I was just
getting a little bit

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.430
bored with listening to
the voice all the time.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.460
And so I just started reading.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.680
And that was a big
takeaway for that,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.110
because all of the cool material
is in out-of-print books.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.560
Japanese internet started, I
mean, the use of the internet

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.630
started very late.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:22.212
I got to say 10 years
ago or something,

00:25:22.212 --> 00:25:24.420
I mean, they have their
phones, but where everybody's

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.050
got a computer in their house.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.810
And so what you find
on Japanese internet,

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.380
by and large, is Cookpad,
which is the worst recipes.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.950
It's so horrible.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.430
I mean, English Cookpad is
probably a little bit better,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.480
maybe they curate it.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.340
I don't know.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.190
I've looked before
for something.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:50.540
And the most astounding mismatch
and mismatched ingredients,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.411
I've never seen a set
of worse ingredients.

00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:56.660
But I did meet the guy at
one of the Stanford classes.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.830
And he was super nice.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.630
So I'm sorry.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.880
But I think that people
like to eat like that.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.440
It's just not my thing.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.660
I was looking for authentic,
but interesting, recipes.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.990
So I already wrote two books.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.360
And so I didn't want to repeat.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:27.740
And so a large portion of
the material in this book

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.150
was from [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:38.180
That was sort of the
unifying force of the book.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:46.050
And then one of the first places
I'd gone on my research trips

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.170
was to Iwate.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:52.050
There's a really cool chef,
who does Frenchy food.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.110
But he came from
another prefecture.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.380
His wife's from that area.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.595
And he just is so amazingly--

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:03.570
he moved up to this little town.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.220
Then it was hit by the tsunami.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.810
And he took over.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.970
He redid the school
food program.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.860
He's promoting the
fishermen lady's seaweed.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.530
And they sent me some
to take on my tour.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.610
And I've done it before.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.850
And he's really helping
out the local people.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.180
And that's the kind of
people I want to write about,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.180
that kind of a chef or
that kind of an artisan.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:34.110
And he also does this
food gathering every March

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.830
and August.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.540
I've gone a couple
times in March.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.200
And the main cook
is this woman named

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.820
Teiko Watanabe,
who I mortifyingly

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:49.230
wrote as Taiko in the book.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.610
She, luckily, will
never read it.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.540
But I will fix it.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.450
It's just, I don't know what
was going on in my head.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:59.960
But Teiko-san, she feels
like she's six feet tall.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.730
I'm 5' 6".

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:05.280
She must be like 5' 10",
which is really unusual.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.010
She must be 85 now.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:15.750
And she's a very powerful
but gentle woman.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.680
As a person, she
really attracted me.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.050
And her food was not
necessarily my type of food.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.580
But this is not supposed
to be a Nancy Hachisu book.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.790
I wanted to get food that was
delicious, but not my food.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.920
But I was filming her
on my different devices,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.290
and photographing,
and recording,

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.190
and noting, noting, noting.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.440
And then I had
all this material.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.310
I have so many
notebooks of material.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:49.350
But then, oh, I
have this collection

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.670
of Japanese cookbooks, and of
Japanese-Japanese, and then

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.610
Japanese in English, and
Japanese people in English,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:02.054
and then foreigners, like
me, like you, in English

00:29:02.054 --> 00:29:05.800
all from the 80s.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800
And one of the books--

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:15.000
and then Andrew, by then, was
working for me, my second son.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.920
And he comes to
work at 8 o'clock.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.470
And he drinks coffee
for two hours.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.490
He needs a job.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.180
OK.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.430
So Andrew, please,
check these books

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.214
and see which ones
look delicious.

00:29:26.214 --> 00:29:27.380
But he's good with the kids.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.210
And he's a good cook.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.470
So he, oh, this is shit.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.750
No, no, no, no.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.540
And then finally,
he finds one book.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.160
And it was the one book
that I thought was good too.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.400
And Teiko Watanabe's Japanese
spelling of her name,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.495
it's not self-evident.

00:29:45.495 --> 00:29:51.540
And so my assistant said
it was Watabe and then

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.530
another first name.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:57.510
But eventually figured out, oh,
that book that I really like

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.540
is Teiko Watanabe's book.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.710
So I call her up through
somebody else and get the OK.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.550
Can I use some of your
recipes, and maybe

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.880
fresh them up, and
maybe de-sugarize them,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.280
and use [INAUDIBLE]
or less sweet?

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.510
And she said, sure.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:24.540
And so those two
powerful, beautiful women

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.010
made this book what it is.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.050
And then I filled out
with other material

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:35.290
that I had looked at to possibly
include in the other books.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.760
And at the time, I mean, those
are super dated cookbooks.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.550
But looking through
different eyes,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.560
looking through the
eyes of '70s, '80s,

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.930
and a whole different style
of food than I had been making

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.730
and channeling, I could re-see,
ah, this looks interesting.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:56.770
And if we just fix
it up a little bit,

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.870
it will be super
good for the book.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:03.050
And so that's how
it all emerged.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:06.090
Phaidon, they say
it's the Bible Series,

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:11.960
which is a ridiculous idea
in that it's so hard to--

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.044
I wonder if they're
going to see this?

00:31:14.044 --> 00:31:14.543
Sorry.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.375
It's a great series.

00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:22.880
No, it's so hard to
capture the whole cuisine

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.070
of a country in 400 recipes.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.900
I had 350 as the minimum.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.375
And I was personally capping
it at 400, because as it was,

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:33.530
it was madness.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.140
I mean, if you could
imagine testing

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:41.550
400 recipes in the space
of, May, June, July, August,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.050
four months.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.490
I almost hated it.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.420
It was just so much.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.126
But the little preschoolers
enjoyed the testing.

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:54.250
I'd say, who wants a taste?

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.450
And they'd run, run,
run, run, run, run.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.150
And they loved everything.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.680
And the grandmas and grandpas
who came to pick them up

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.290
loved everything.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:09.260
And my assistant, who's
fiftyish, I don't know, I mean,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.255
she kept saying it was
so beautiful tasting.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.422
And that was how
she liked to eat.

00:32:15.422 --> 00:32:16.380
She's not a very good--

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.350
She doesn't cook that much.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.080
But she likes that.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.320
There's some shojin
roots in it, the temple,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.210
because actually that's
how Japan was cooking.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.920
That's the history
of Japanese food.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.795
And so it makes a lot of sense.

00:32:38.795 --> 00:32:41.110
There's plenty of
meat and fish too.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.230
There's a lot of sesame.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:48.320
And there's this amazing sesame
roaster in Osaka, Wadaman.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.910
And he donated to me.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.250
He always donates
to me, sesame oils,

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.160
I mean, white, gold, black.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.780
The sesame production in
Japan is totally gone,

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.810
because it's
outsourced to China.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.030
So he buys his sesame
through contract farmers

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.810
from three different countries.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.000
But it's in the roasting.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.160
I mean, of course, the
farmer is an important part.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.050
But the roastery is where
the sesame, just like coffee,

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.590
becomes transformed into
this beautiful product.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.300
And some of the
places that I've been

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.050
doing pop-ups, the sesame
that's in other kitchens

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.120
is most likely rancid.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.530
It's just horrible.

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.020
So the Japanese Pantry has it.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.770
And they also donated
a bunch of stuff.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:36.925
But the sesame was
life-changing and the ume.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.090
OK, it's in the Bible Series.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.240
But it really is a
moment in time in Japan.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.520
And for that way,
it makes sense.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.230
And for me, that was a
great moment in time,

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.230
because they were sort
of bubble years of Japan.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.700
It was after the 50s, 60s,
because the war really

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.470
decimated the food situation.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:03.840
And people were just scrambling.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.740
And finally, food was
coming into Japan.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.510
And there was a prosperity.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.989
And so that was a time-- and
it's not farm food, per se.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.670
It's not farm food.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.370
It's maybe more town food
or some seaside food.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:24.850
But I think it's really
exciting and cool food

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:29.770
and made me re-excited
about Japanese food.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.210
So I stand behind it.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:37.460
So that's all I've
got right now.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.120
And if you have any
questions, I'm happy to ask.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.440
I need some water.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.940
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a little bit

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.360
about your creative process.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:52.580
And at the point where
everything kind of came

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.710
together, and took on
its own creative force,

00:34:54.710 --> 00:35:01.640
and just became the book,
how much do you think--

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.510
I mean, either tracing
back to your visits

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.220
to build those
relationships, did

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.240
you feel like those
visits to build

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.850
those relationships and
those followup visits,

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.870
did it actually shape this
whole creative process

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:22.760
later on when it actually
did take on its own force?

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.080
NANCY HACHISU: Yes and no.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.374
I mean, most of that material
is going into another book,

00:35:29.374 --> 00:35:30.290
because of the photos.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.480
I mean, you always
are getting something

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.070
from those visits and
those relationships.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:48.540
They deepened my understanding
or feeling of the ingredients.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:36:01.660
But here, this ended up to
be more research-oriented,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.750
which I think a lot of
the country books are,

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.820
because the authors have
to pay for their travel.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:11.370
But I don't ever
regret the money

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.925
spent on creating relationships,
because those are continuing.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.830
And I've been introducing
those people to other people.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.050
Like, there's this
amazing potato flour

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.400
that they are making in that
town that has 3,000 people

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.780
and that was hit by the tsunami.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.760
I think there's one guy
in Japan making this.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.640
And I don't like to tell
too many people about it.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.040
And I guess I shouldn't
say it on this venue.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.440
But it's this flour.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.010
And I used it at a
dinner in San Francisco.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.630
And everybody went crazy for it.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.020
It's a flour made from potatoes
and this amazing process

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.040
of drying them outside.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.960
And you can use it for--

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.410
in the local area, they make
little manju or little dango.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.900
And they're not so
delicious or interesting.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.570
They're little flour balls.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.450
But he used it to make bÃ©chamel.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.700
And it was almost like
butterless bÃ©chamel.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.270
And it doesn't goop up.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.340
And it was the most--

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.570
and he makes a
seafood stew with it.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.660
And I was at dinner
in State Bird one day.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.060
And I was telling
Stuart about it.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.546
And then he said,
oh, I was in Padu.

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:31.500
And they make the same thing.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.850
And they do it in the Andes.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.320
And they make a
chicken stew with that.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.470
And so I am still trying to--

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.842
I don't want to share that yet.

00:37:38.842 --> 00:37:40.300
But I'll share it
in the next book.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.070
But it was going
to be in this book.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.470
And so there is a lot of--

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.460
what shaped it, I
always thought I

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:56.130
was going to separate
it by [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.160
the parts of the classic
Japanese meal and not

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.720
by regionality.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:06.020
But also, because I wrote
a section on history,

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:11.700
because Japan's got a lot
of homogeneity nowadays.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.196
And a lot of the food
here is coming from,

00:38:15.196 --> 00:38:16.660
I mean, from all over Japan.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.470
But it was very
difficult to separate.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.890
The history is pretty
amazing in that there's

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:28.950
these food cultures and
the method of making rice,

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.820
not rice cooker rice
but real rice in a pot,

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.550
and glutenous rice
that's been around

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.020
for hundreds if not
1,000 years the same way.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:44.880
And if you are American,
this is an astounding idea,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.160
because we have such
a young country.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.650
But sorry, I got off track.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.570
Yeah.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:59.330
So the shaping, it
became a much better book

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:02.990
because of the issue
about the no photos.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:08.989
So it took shape for different
reasons, as it should have.

00:39:08.989 --> 00:39:09.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.150
Thank you.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.500
I was wondering if you
can talk a bit more

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.120
about your first book.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.650
And just what was the process
for you getting a publisher

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.020
and just even getting
into the cookbook writing

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.640
industry in the first place?

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.110
NANCY HACHISU: Well, I started
probably 10 years before that.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.730
I got involved in
slow food for myself.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:34.430
But also, I live in a little
town and 15,000 people,

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.500
it's not so little, in Japan.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:42.050
And I wanted to get more
into the world of food.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.150
And through that process--

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:48.560
and every time I went out to
dinner in Italy or France,

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.470
I'd hand my card to
the-- at that time,

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.717
it was my slow food card.

00:39:53.717 --> 00:39:54.800
We were really into cards.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.140
And so I just carded
people up everywhere.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.350
And then I just
sort of went along.

00:40:03.877 --> 00:40:05.960
I became friends with some
people at Chez Panisse.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.060
So we started this exchange
with a soba chef friend,

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.590
going to do dinners
at Chez Panisse.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.570
And then it was through slow
food that I started writing.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.750
And because we
did a soba dinner,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.316
and I told my slow
food friends, do

00:40:20.316 --> 00:40:22.190
you guys want to write
an article about this?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.190
And they said, yeah.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.590
We're going to send the
photographer and the editor.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.150
But we can't afford a writer.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.630
So can you write it?

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:36.560
And so I wrote this long
thing, which was way too long.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.010
And in the process, I realized--
and then I handed it off.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.250
And then I also wrote about
the edible school yard.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.440
And I realized that they
were just going to--

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.940
it's just a pain to
translate, to actually do

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.780
a good translation.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.150
So my editor friend
just read what

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:57.080
I wrote, took all of my
ideas, and wrote his own thing

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.790
in Japanese.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.930
Like, well, that's no fun.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.050
And so that's when I started,
OK, I knew it was way too long.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.600
I knew it wasn't
the right format.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.290
And so I started doing
the online classes

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.860
through Stanford.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.540
And then somebody
said, start a blog.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.090
And so some of those stories
in "Japanese Farm Food"

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.460
I had written in a blog,
and then the blog camp.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:26.000
And then Michael Ruhlman,
who's a very prolific author,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.220
he suggested I get
involved in this IACP.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.490
And then I took my
son to Portland.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.330
We went there.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:36.190
And he ended up in
school in Portland.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.670
And I went to this--

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.610
I put myself in the position
of being in sessions

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.560
where there was an agent.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.560
And I just asked the
pointed questions

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.949
that we learn how to do
in high school and college

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:48.740
to say, look at me.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.820
I'm just so smart.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.320
So I would drop the Chez
Panisse thing and the living

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.520
in Japan thing.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.930
And so she contacted
me and said,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.200
what are these ideas you have?

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.340
And of course, card, card, card.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.740
And it's too bad
that the cards are

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.250
going on the wayside with
non-Japanese countries.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.795
But I got some cards
with me if you want.

00:42:16.795 --> 00:42:19.171
But one of the boxes
was for a chiropractor.

00:42:19.171 --> 00:42:20.670
It was like, they
sent me two boxes.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.770
And one's wrong.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:22.910
But anyway--

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:23.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.150
Yeah, I just opened it today.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.440
And then I wrote a proposal.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.590
And actually, I
got lots of passes.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.910
And then Andrews
McMeel accepted it.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.690
And then that's the way it was.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.600
But you got to write a proposal.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.184
AUDIENCE: What is Chez Panisse?

00:42:46.184 --> 00:42:47.350
NANCY HACHISU: Chez Panisse?

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:48.600
It's a restaurant in Berkeley.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.660
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:57.455
NANCY HACHISU: Probably the
mother of farm to table.

00:42:57.455 --> 00:42:59.580
AUDIENCE: One of the things
I find very interesting

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.300
is you have a foot both in
the Northern California food

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.160
scene and the Japanese scene.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.430
And you mentioned your roots
in the slow food movement

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.290
and the farm to table movement.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.390
That's obviously very big
in Northern California

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.790
and as a response to the
industrial food system.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:20.040
Can you talk a little bit about
how Japanese culture approaches

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.214
food and what the differences
are you see between the way

00:43:23.214 --> 00:43:24.630
Japanese approach
food and the way

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.360
you see it in, say,
Northern California?

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:33.120
NANCY HACHISU: Well you know
I'm not the know all for Japan.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.870
I have my take.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:45.550
So Japanese are very accepting
of the poor ingredients.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.580
Even mothers, they
don't read the back

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.360
of what's in the label.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.720
And if somebody
made it for us, it

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.730
must be good is a really
big overall feeling.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.110
And again, I don't want
to be madly generalizing.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.030
But I do have a
little preschool.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.530
And I have lived
there for 30 years.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.300
And this has been
a huge experience.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.601
That even strawberries
that are sprayed

00:44:12.601 --> 00:44:14.350
with chemicals 30
times, and they're still

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.860
giving them to the kids.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.700
I mean, I finally had to say--

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.320
occasionally we have
bento in our school.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:20.990
Mostly I cook.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.626
And I just finally
just told them,

00:44:23.626 --> 00:44:25.750
could you just please don't
give those strawberries

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:26.291
to your kids?

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.980
Like all over the world,
people are cooking less.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.620
In Japan, they went
from big farm kitchens

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:42.760
to this crappy little strip
in some corner of the house.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.770
And there's no room.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.200
It's a lot harder to cook.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.780
It's harder to
buy the materials.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.740
I ask people all the time, we
have a local soy sauce and miso

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.550
place that also makes tofu
and tofu-related products,

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:05.980
natto and some of the [? age. ?]
Whenever some media comes,

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.680
I always ask them, so on
your way home from work,

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.970
can you get good natto?

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:11.500
Or can you get good tofu?

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.784
And these are the
instant foods of Japan.

00:45:14.784 --> 00:45:17.200
I use them at the school when
I have nothing else to cook,

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.210
except for dry
pasta, which I hate.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.880
Then I can do a
tofu lunch thing.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.700
And they don't have
access to good ones,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:30.070
because those kind of
things are less and less.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:31.510
But it's resurging.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.020
And that is thanks to,
OK, the hippie movement

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.070
and then also from
you guys, actually.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.790
It's the great
thing about Japan.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:43.900
They look to the other
countries, and they'd see.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:47.260
It's the reverse
importation or exportation.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.490
I can never remember
which is the correct word.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.917
And long term foreigners,
why am I on TV?

00:45:54.917 --> 00:45:56.500
It's not because I'm
so scintillating.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.870
It's because I have
been there a long time.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.870
I make my own miso.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.040
I do these things.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.090
I live in an old house.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:09.820
But also, I can say, hey, this
katsuobushi is so amazing.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.090
And so it's like this, oh,
yeah, maybe it is cool.

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.890
And they just never
thought about it.

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.800
Most people don't even know
the difference between Kikkoman

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.770
and our soy sauce, Yamaki Jozo.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:24.160
They don't know that it's made
with Chinese non-organic beans.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.280
And this one over here
is Japanese organic

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.030
aged in cedar barrels
for a year and a half.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.840
And this has been made in a--

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.020
or actually, these
are not even Kikkoman.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.417
The cheap stuff is made
from soybean grits.

00:46:38.417 --> 00:46:39.250
It's not even beans.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.690
So people just don't know that.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.620
Even TV directors come,
and I take them to Yamaki,

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.500
and they don't even know the
difference between miso and soy

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.350
sauce.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.190
So it's starting.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:53.330
And it really helps.

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.210
Everything that you
guys do comes back.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:47:00.381
So it really helps that the
whole world is foodifying.

00:47:00.381 --> 00:47:01.880
The bad thing that
happens in Japan,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.680
unfortunately, is
everybody seems

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.430
like they're obsessive about
food, like watching, or the TV.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.500
I mean, I don't know how
many people still watch

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.960
TV, but still a lot of people.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:19.115
But what happens is I
think they get intimidated.

00:47:19.115 --> 00:47:21.880
And the katsuobushi guy
told me six years ago

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.670
that 60% of the
people who make dashi,

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:30.671
which is this simple kelp
and dried fish broth, not

00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:32.670
like chicken stock that
takes an hour and a half

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:37.120
or two hours and bones,
and 60% of the people

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.340
that actually make
it, use powdered.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.700
And I think that's because,
it's not the convenience thing,

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.644
I think it's from
intimidation of,

00:47:44.644 --> 00:47:45.810
oh, there's this Kyoto chef.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:47.105
And he's using maguro bushi.

00:47:47.105 --> 00:47:48.310
And he's doing this,
and this, and this.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:49.780
It's the most amazing
dashi in the world.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:50.530
I can't make that.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:52.510
So I better just get powder.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.670
I feel like it's like that.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:59.050
And so there's that
having to have perfection.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.410
I know my rolled egg
omelet is not as beautiful

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.400
as my husband's.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.340
I can live with that.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.370
But it's delicious, because we
have good eggs, and good soy

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:07.536
sauce, and good [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:07.536 --> 00:48:11.936
And you have to forgive
yourself I think.

00:48:11.936 --> 00:48:14.310
AUDIENCE: I know you're doing
some collaborative dinners.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.450
You've already done
some or you're going to.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.500
I think that's very
exciting for me,

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.390
because I'd like
to attend and go.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:25.200
What's it like for you, because
these are chefs in restaurants?

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.630
I mean, what's it like for you
to do a collaborative dinner?

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.180
NANCY HACHISU:
Everyone is different.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.220
And it starts with the approach.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:41.850
Mostly, nobody says
no, surprisingly maybe

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:43.992
because it was such
a direct approach.

00:48:43.992 --> 00:48:46.200
The "Japanese Farm Food"
and also the preserving book

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.080
are both really popular
with a lot of the chefs.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:55.710
And I write the menu or
don't write the menu.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:59.910
I sort of feel my way through
with each different chef,

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:03.340
and some of them I know,
especially the first time.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.136
And then sometimes they're busy.

00:49:07.136 --> 00:49:09.510
Actually, this tour I ended
up writing a lot of the menu,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.030
because there's 400.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:13.080
I kept whittling it down.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.460
OK, here's my top 100.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.519
Here's my top 50.

00:49:16.519 --> 00:49:18.560
And then, OK, can you just
write the menu, Nancy?

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.090
OK.

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:25.740
Some of them are
part of the menu.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.970
And then there's
all kinds of things.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.120
I'm in the kitchen all day.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.980
So why not?

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.260
And I just sort of feel my way.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.280
And it's harder for the
first time collabos.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.410
I bring all of the materials.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:44.550
And so this time I could
only bring 50 kilos.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.760
That was sort of my max max.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.280
And Hodo Soy, I got
hooked up with their sales

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.466
guy in Natural Expo last year
or a year and a half ago.

00:49:58.466 --> 00:50:00.090
He didn't know anything
about my books.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:02.040
But some of his
people were big fans.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.800
But he was just a fun guy.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:09.030
He's this six foot tall,
wearing shorts, ponytail guy.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.000
And so I just loved him.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.250
And so I really wanted
to promote Hodo,

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:19.430
because they're local.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.350
And I had to get over the fact
that it's not Japanese tofu.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:27.005
And so he gave me yuba to taste.

00:50:27.005 --> 00:50:31.980
And then when I came back last
fall, he gave me soy milk.

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.740
And he sent it and medium tofu.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.280
And then I found a way.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.540
The medium tofu for Hodo,
because they don't use nigari.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.200
They use a Chinese sodium
chloride or something,

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.060
some other harder--
so [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.410
But it's great for chefs if
you put it in the Robot Coupe.

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.920
And you don't have to press it.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.360
And the flavor is good.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.260
So anyway, and then the
Japanese Pantry guys donated.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.540
So it's all about the materials.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.314
And I don't want to have a--

00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:05.730
I only collaborate
with people who

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.650
have the same ideas as I do.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.830
So I typically don't collaborate
with Japanese restaurants,

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:16.110
because they have a budget.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:17.910
And they're using less than.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.992
And so here I just bring it
all and say, let's use this.

00:51:20.992 --> 00:51:22.200
And I give them their budget.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.370
And that's it.

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.050
I mean, their budgeted
amount of stuff.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.120
And there was one
other thing I forgot.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:35.550
Oh, I'll be chef at residence at
Scribe over Labor Day weekend.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:36.920
Come, come, come.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.007
And I was going to
do it last October.

00:51:39.007 --> 00:51:40.590
But because of the
fires, we canceled.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:43.840
So you guys look like
Scribe people, right?

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.340
No?

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:49.020
All the beautiful people.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.250
I'm going to be one too.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.610
Yay.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.684
Anyway, I think all the collabos
in the Bay Area are over.

00:51:55.684 --> 00:51:56.850
I'm going to be at Omnivore.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:52:00.630
But you'll just hear
the same thing as here.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.518
Not really.

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:04.559
But I'm going to New York.

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:05.350
SPEAKER: All right.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:06.890
Thank you very much, Nancy.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:07.150
NANCY HACHISU: Thank you.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.870
SPEAKER: Thank you
for being here.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:08.703
NANCY HACHISU: Yeah.

00:52:08.703 --> 00:52:10.620
