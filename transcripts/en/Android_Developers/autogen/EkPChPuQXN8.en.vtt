within the app so our question is with

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600
within the app so our question is with
 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.120
within the app so our question is with
regard to sort of what happens when hit

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130

you've navigated into the app and so

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260
you've navigated into the app and so
 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.640
you've navigated into the app and so
it's probably helpful to give an example

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650
it's probably helpful to give an example
 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.740
it's probably helpful to give an example

there a way to call the recognizer

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:36.269
there a way to call the recognizer
 

00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:38.239
there a way to call the recognizer

yeah I don't know about the recognizer
 

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:04.669
yeah I don't know about the recognizer
intent I would say if it does return

00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679

error codes probably not a way to
 

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:10.460

suppress those I suppose you could have

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.470

major ways you can do this so if you

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800
major ways you can do this so if you
 

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.720
major ways you can do this so if you
need to have a like a completely

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:40.730
need to have a like a completely
 

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:43.480
need to have a like a completely
distinct layout and then that you can

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:43.490
distinct layout and then that you can
 

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.339
distinct layout and then that you can
just provided different layout using the

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:45.349
just provided different layout using the
 

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:48.430
just provided different layout using the
resource qualify on the layout directory

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440
resource qualify on the layout directory
 

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.950
resource qualify on the layout directory
so you'd have your layout directory

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960
so you'd have your layout directory
 

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.290
so you'd have your layout directory
containing your your your layout but for

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:53.300
containing your your your layout but for
 

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.400
containing your your your layout but for
phones and then you could have a layout

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:54.410
phones and then you could have a layout
 

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:59.859
phones and then you could have a layout
dash x large or say dash SW 600 for

00:36:59.859 --> 00:36:59.869
dash x large or say dash SW 600 for
 

00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:01.300

example if you wanted to say I need a

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:01.310
example if you wanted to say I need a
 

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:04.089
example if you wanted to say I need a
minimum of six hundred DPS and so I

00:37:04.089 --> 00:37:04.099
minimum of six hundred DPS and so I
 

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:05.620

screen in order to show this large it

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.630
screen in order to show this large it
 

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.359
screen in order to show this large it
out and then you have an alternative

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:07.369
out and then you have an alternative
 

00:37:07.369 --> 00:37:09.280
out and then you have an alternative
layer and they're the same name so

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.290
layer and they're the same name so
 

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.329
layer and they're the same name so
that's one way you have a different

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:10.339
that's one way you have a different
 

00:37:10.339 --> 00:37:12.160
that's one way you have a different
layout so go and check the developer

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:12.170
layout so go and check the developer
 

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.380

doctor that and another technique which

this size we should look at the
supporting multiple screen space yeah

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:54.750
supporting multiple screen space yeah
 

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.940
supporting multiple screen space yeah
yeah she's really the supporting

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:56.950
yeah she's really the supporting
 

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:58.230
yeah she's really the supporting
multiple screens which I think that's

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240
multiple screens which I think that's
 

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.760
multiple screens which I think that's
going to be answer but before you would

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:02.770
going to be answer but before you would
 

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.100
going to be answer but before you would
have had dash X labs and then you can

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.110
have had dash X labs and then you can
 

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.300
have had dash X labs and then you can
have an epi HTTP iron etc etc and make

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:09.310
have an epi HTTP iron etc etc and make
 

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.560
have an epi HTTP iron etc etc and make
sure you get the order of those right as

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:10.570
sure you get the order of those right as
 

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:17.040
sure you get the order of those right as
well because do it is important there's

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.050
well because do it is important there's
 

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.030
well because do it is important there's
a high run and documented yes famous it

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040
a high run and documented yes famous it
 

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.820
a high run and documented yes famous it
and if you don't want to look at the

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:23.830
and if you don't want to look at the
 

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.830
and if you don't want to look at the
documentation you can just add your

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:25.840
documentation you can just add your
 

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.960
documentation you can just add your
qualifiers using the graphical tool and

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:27.970
qualifiers using the graphical tool and
 

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.200
qualifiers using the graphical tool and
the in the IDE and your clips and it'll

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.210
the in the IDE and your clips and it'll
 

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:38.320
the in the IDE and your clips and it'll
put them in the right order for you

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:38.330
 

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:42.160
well I'm just looking through the

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.170
well I'm just looking through the
 

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.050
well I'm just looking through the
different qualifiers and you can even

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.060
different qualifiers and you can even
 

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.050
different qualifiers and you can even
specify the qualifier for the country

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.060
specify the qualifier for the country
 

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.970
specify the qualifier for the country
code to the mobile country code if you

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:48.980

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.520
code to the mobile country code if you
want to have different graphics detected

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:51.530

before so i think it's definitely doable

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:31.510
before so i think it's definitely doable
 

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.420
before so i think it's definitely doable
and probably involves quite a lot of

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:34.430

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:39.669
 

00:41:39.669 --> 00:41:44.189
so the writer says is there a library um

00:41:44.189 --> 00:41:44.199
so the writer says is there a library um
 

00:41:44.199 --> 00:41:47.079
so the writer says is there a library um
no I don't think there might be some

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:47.089
no I don't think there might be some
 

00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:50.109
no I don't think there might be some
other libraries but for anything this

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119
other libraries but for anything this
