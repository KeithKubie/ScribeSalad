1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,760
[inaudible] here with Robert Krulwich
today on radio lab, an hour on the self,

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,810
how it is the debt of a trillion
chattering neurons in your brain or as the

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,380
greatest illusion of all
that you are. One thing,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,440
one self to extend this a little
bit. Uh, another step chat.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Well we spent the whole time talking
about what it is to be a one or where is

6
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:27,970
our self.

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,810
There are times when you learn that the
self is not got a Berlin Wall around it.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,590
We are porous. Our borders
are full of the leaks.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,880
Robert Sapolsky is a biologist. He
studies baboons in, in East Africa.

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,940
He wrote an essay which I read and
the essay is the story of his dad.

11
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:53,980
Robert has a dad like we all do. This.

12
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:56,470
Dad suffered from a condition
that resembles Alzheimer's,

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,740
so his father was forgetting things,
what decade it was, where he was,

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,440
but he was also beginning

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,470
to melt into the sun.

16
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:09,400
The Dad was beginning to tell
stories that really the sons stories,

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,140
there's all kinds of things.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Things like I had moved from New York to
the bay area at that point and suddenly

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,850
his stories of his immigration changed
from when we left Europe and came to

20
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:26,710
Ellis island to when we left Europe and
entered the United States to the San

21
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,010
Francisco Bay,

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,220
including his describing the first
side of the Golden Gate Bridge,

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,880
golden gate bridge, which
was built decades after he
came to the United States.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Completely confabulated but San
Diego was involved to San Diego.

25
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:44,221
I was in San Diego for a period and he
suddenly had spent long periods of time

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,540
in San Diego, in the
navy, in World War II,

27
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,680
so that he was able to have the
same opinion and share the same,

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,340
just kind of the edges of
him spilling over into me.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,910
Did that make you feel a
little claustrophobic or a
little claustrophobic and

30
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,620
being a good scientist? Of course.

31
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:03,280
What I did instantly was try to label it
and come up with diagnostic categories

32
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:08,281
and pathologize it and sort of keep it
at a safe distance and it was all fairly

33
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,124
unnerving.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,200
And what this particular essay was about
that I had written was amid all of that

35
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:18,940
sort of confident pathologizing it was
only after he died that I suddenly found

36
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,280
myself doing the same in return.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,470
[inaudible]

38
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,590
let me read you some of what Robert
Suppose you wrote about this experience.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,710
It started manageably enough how you
arrange the utensils is heated from a

40
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,300
favorite Yiddish tonight
is throughout the day.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,590
Soon I had forsaken wearing my blue
flannel shirts in order to wear the blue

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,050
sweater ones. Oh he is.

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,850
I took a shirt at his,

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,080
a flannel shirt and light back before
global warming would always wear flannel

45
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:56,081
shirts and for awhile I had to wear his
flannel shirt instead or he had heart

46
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:01,850
disease and the little
bottles of Nitroglycerin all
over the house and there was

47
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:05,560
this period where in the
immediate aftermath of his dying,

48
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,930
I took a bottle of some nitroglycerine
back with me and found I had to keep it

49
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,840
with me physically all the time.
Now you didn't have heart trouble.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,650
I had no heart trouble
and I was a 30 year old.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,110
You're walking around with this
Nitroglycerin, like it's your blankie,

52
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,440
like you don't want to give it up. No.

53
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,460
On some level I needed to
have nitroglycerin with me
handy in case like I had

54
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,670
one of his angina attacks

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,873
[inaudible]

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,340
he writes, I would make love to my wife,
workout in the gym, attend the lecture,

57
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,830
and always the bottle would be nearby

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,880
on a nightstand, in a sweat
jacket, pocket of midnight papers.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
There was a day when I
briefly misplaced it,

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,640
it everything stopped
for an anxious search.

61
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,900
It was not that I'd lost a holy relic
of his suffering and object to show my

62
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,920
children someday to teach them about a
man they hadn't known. This was urgent.

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,780
I felt vulnerable.

64
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,120
You're very hard to articulate.
But during that period also,

65
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,740
I had a large class I was doing on
the last day of a lecture. I found,

66
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:16,720
I gave this weird lecture where
essentially I was talking to them like an

67
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,650
octogenarian.

68
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,840
You don't believe it now because you're
20 you're going to get tired and you're

69
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,621
going to get tired.

70
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:26,620
You're gonna get tired and it's just
gonna get harder and harder just from the

71
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,380
tired old 30 year old. Yeah, exactly.

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,100
I was talking to them as an 80
year old and talking to them.

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,470
You wake up to that notion in the
middle of it. Did you say anything? Hey,

74
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:37,870
what am I doing? I didn't know just
how long they can't wait till evening.

75
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,410
Trying to figure out the hell was that
about instead of telling them about

76
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:46,411
what's going to be on the final telling
them you should be happy all your mother

77
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:51,130
and the second call me
as long as you're at it,

78
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,830
it could hurt you to
call now. And then, um,

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,150
and when you had finished the lecture to
the kids who had been speaking through

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,073
the voice of your dad,

81
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,760
how did you unwind this connection
or did it just fade away? Um,

82
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,170
interestingly I actually gave that lecture
wearing his shirt on and this was a

83
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:15,760
very whole challenged period with the
bottle of Nitroglycerin in my pocket cause

84
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,350
I had it in my pocket at all times.

85
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,300
And it was that night that I was able to
put away the bottle and having worn the

86
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,630
shirts sense and on some level
I was saying goodbye for him.

87
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,820
Um, and particularly appropriately
to, you know, an auditorium,

88
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,840
a wash in 520 year olds with
their world ahead of him and

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,100
Sudu saying goodbye for him

90
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,480
a year later that time
has begun to make sense.

91
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,220
I feel sure that what I went
through need not merit a diagnosis.

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,980
It's a measure of my training
as a scientist that I saw
pathology there wasn't

93
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,250
there and essentially with that whole
period was about, it was a learning.

94
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:04,070
It is, you know, a perfectly normal,

95
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:09,071
non pathological state to feel at times
of extreme emotional challenge that

96
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,030
interconnected with another person.

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,060
That in some ways the boundaries slip a
little bit. It can only come as an echo.

98
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:21,410
A hint in our armored individuated
world did a bit of confusion as to ego.

99
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:24,470
Boundaries can be an act of health,

100
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,660
of Hamas and love.

101
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,160
It can be a whisper of what it feels
like to be swaddled and cut nudity.

102
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,600
It is a lesson.

103
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,980
I mean our ever expanding array of
scientific labels on the risks of over

104
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:41,660
pathologizing most of all. It is a
lesson that it wouldn't be so bad.

105
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:42,051
In fact,

106
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:47,051
it would even be a point of pride if in
the end someone mistakes you for him.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,150
Mike, just post good questions.
Is, did you ever, um,

108
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,460
say to your dad when he was ill, um,

109
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,630
you didn't come to San Francisco. Did
you ever like correct him? Not a chance.

110
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,920
Robert Sapolsky is a biologist at
Stanford University in California.

111
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,720
He's written several
collections of essays,

112
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:20,320
but the one we're quoting here is
from the trouble with testosterone.

113
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,600
That's where you find
the story of his dad.

114
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,180
