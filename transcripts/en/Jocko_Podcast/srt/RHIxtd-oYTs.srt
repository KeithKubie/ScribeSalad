00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
This is Jocko podcast number
63 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,250
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,420
I am an American fighting man.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,240
I serve in the forces which guard
my country and our way of life.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
I am prepared to give my
life in their defense.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,710
I will never surrender
of my own free will.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,340
If in command I will
never surrender my men.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,700
While they still have the means to resist,

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,610
they find him captured.
I will continue to resist.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,010
By all means available.

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,190
I will make every effort to escape.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,810
I will accept neither parole nor
special favors from the enemy.

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,880
If I become a prisoner of war,

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,330
I will keep faith with
my fellow prisoners.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,700
I will give no information or take part
in any actions which might be harmful to

16
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,940
my comrades.
If I am senior,

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,120
I will take command.
If not,

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,310
I will obey the lawful orders of those
appointed over me and we'll back them up

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,080
in every way.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,680
When questioned,
should I become a prisoner of war,

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,110
I am bound to give only
name, rank, service number,

22
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,310
and date of birth.

23
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,230
I will evade answering further
questions to the utmost of my ability.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I will make no oral or written statements
disloyal to my country and its allies

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,750
or harmful to their cause.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
I will never forget that I am an
American fighting man responsible for my

27
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,770
actions and dedicated to the
principles which made my country free.

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,410
I will trust in God and in
the United States of America.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,873
Yeah.

30
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,973
And that

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,390
is the 1955 version of the code of
conduct for the armed forces of the United

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,533
States.

33
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,443
Okay.

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,750
And it was written in response
to the brutal treatment.

35
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:27,750
Yeah.

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,583
Right.

37
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,970
Of the 7,190 Americans captured by
the enemy during the Korean War,

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,680
prisoners who were subjected to torture,
indoctrination,

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,830
brainwashing,
and forced confessions.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,490
And that version of the code that I just
read is almost exactly the same as the

41
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:54,230
one that I learned in the military.
When I joined in 1990

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,623
they did

43
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,410
make some changes to it.

44
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,411
They changed it to include men and women
and they changed two words to give some

45
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:09,271
flexibility to increase survivability
and psychological recovery from torture.

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,290
And so the little changes that were made
at it changed from the prisoner being

47
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,570
bound to give only name,

48
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:24,571
rank and service number and date of birth
to the prisoner being required to give

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,420
name, rank, service
number and date of birth,

50
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,380
small changes.

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,820
But the spirit of the
code didn't change at all.

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,580
And that code is what we as military
fighting men and women were and are

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,480
expected to uphold should we ever be
captured and held as prisoners by the

54
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,874
enemy.

55
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,220
Code of conduct is simple and
clear and straightforward,

56
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,220
but the code of conduct gets tested on
like any other document in the world

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,780
when our American servicemen
and women are somehow captured

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,400
and as prisoners of war face
absolutely ruthless levels of torture,

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,240
pain, suffering, disease, starvation,

60
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,590
humiliation,

61
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,280
and perhaps the most
devastating hopelessness.

62
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,730
And tonight it is my absolute honor

63
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,090
to have one of these men here,

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,160
one who during almost a full year of
horror upon horror at the hands of his

65
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,030
captors and Vietnam man,

66
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:12,031
who persevered and fought with every
ounce of his soul to survive against the

67
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,620
worst possible conditions imaginable.

68
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,823
Oh man,

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
that not only learned the code of conduct,

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,193
but lived it

71
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,050
a retired army colonel
William bill reader.

72
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,370
Sir, thank you so much for being
here tonight. Thank you, Jackie. Oh,

73
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,250
it's my honor indeed to be here and
participate in this podcast as well.

74
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,143
Thank you.

75
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,190
I want to just before
we jump into the book,

76
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,560
if you could just talk a little
bit about you growing up,

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,130
what you did,
what

78
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,330
you were like, where you were. Oh boy.
Okay. I didn't know this was coming.

79
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,260
Um, yeah, it was essentially a kid
off the streets of Los Angeles.

80
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:09,410
I was born in Glendale, grew up for
a time in the San Fernando Valley,

81
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,910
which is in the opening prologue
to the, to the book. Um, yeah,

82
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:17,960
I had a tough childhood,
I guess I would say. Um,

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,740
got into some trouble as
a, as a young guy, uh,

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,970
sports helped me at least survive
to graduate from high school, uh,

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,710
left college. Uh, and I,

86
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:31,040
and I went off to college at University
of Idaho to study forestry. Uh,

87
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,610
I left college and less than the
than esteemed academic terms.

88
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,360
After only one year, uh,
worked for a time as a, uh,

89
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,270
I worked all the time as a
kid with various small jobs,

90
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:46,170
newspaper routes and selling
magazines to door to tour. Um,

91
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,980
then did some construction work in, in my
early teens roofing work. Uh, but yeah,

92
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,120
after I left college, I worked
cattle ranches for awhile. Uh,

93
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,610
worked for the US Forest Service for
a time, a ultimately as a firefighter.

94
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,740
I got laid off in the end of fire season,

95
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,180
went back home to Los Angeles and found
a job with southern California Edison in

96
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,390
Santa Monica, climbing power
lines as a apprentice Lineman,

97
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,510
and did that until the
outbreak of the Vietnam War.

98
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:16,160
And then found my real niche in life
when I walked into the army recruiter in

99
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,800
Santa Monica, California. And
the sign on the dotted line,

100
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,970
what you was at 1965.
So you know,

101
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,370
the Tonkin Gulf incident
occurred, that's where the, uh,

102
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,460
the US destroyers were attacked in 1964.

103
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,120
We put Marines ashore in
Denang and March of 1965,

104
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,190
that's when I started
talking to recruiters.

105
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,290
First I was going in the Marine Corps,
uh,

106
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:41,090
but somehow ended up enlisting in the
army, uh, in a, in August of 1965.

107
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,160
And then what was the transition
to becoming a pilot? Yeah,

108
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,030
so I started out enlisted,
uh,

109
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,060
went to basic training and advanced
individual training ait. I was 80,

110
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,920
can't Ken, Ken Kennedy Ear, a member
of a cannon crew and an artillery unit,

111
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,530
and then applied for
officer candidate school.

112
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,740
And they took those with
the highest test scores.

113
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,800
You had to pass this
through of interviews. Uh,

114
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
but they were looking for officers
and especially artillery lieutenants.

115
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,960
And so I went to artillery officer
candidate school, six months of a,

116
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:13,430
of training with some degree of harassment
and then got commissioned in August

117
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:16,970
of 1966 as a second
lieutenant and artillery.

118
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,870
And then how long did you artillery
for before he became a pilot? Yeah,

119
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,090
that was about a year. I didn't
think I was going to be able to fly.

120
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,830
And that's really why I
didn't go in the Marine Corps.

121
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,840
I wanted to be a pilot
throwing two services.

122
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,610
You could fly without a college degree.

123
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:33,380
So this college dropout had hopes in
either the Marine Corps or the army. Uh,

124
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,850
when I went and saw the marine recruiter,

125
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,910
he gave me a battery of tests
and he said, and he said, yeah,

126
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:42,380
you qualify for a flight
and we can guarantee you a
flight training. I said, okay.

127
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,820
So what do I have to do?
Is, is you just go in,

128
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,400
as long as you pass a flight physical,
you're good to go.

129
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,760
So I could sense there was
something, uh, of put here.

130
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,320
So before I went in and I went to a FAA
flight surgeon in Santa Monica said,

131
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,870
give me the same flight the military
does and tell me if I could pass it.

132
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,040
So he gave me the physical and said,
no, you wouldn't pass it. He said,

133
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,300
you're right. Eyes about 20, 25
to 2030. You have an astigmatism.

134
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,660
They require a perfect 20, 20 vision.
You couldn't pass the flight physical.

135
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,980
So I wrote off the Marine Corps. I wasn't
going to do that. And I, I went into the,

136
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,540
uh, into the army instead thinking I
would never fly after I went to officer

137
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,070
candidate school,
I get commissioned,

138
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,400
I was working in an artillery
assignment at Fort Carson,

139
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:27,630
Colorado and went in for an annual
physical. And when I got the physical,

140
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,850
it came back 20, 20, both eyes. So I was,

141
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,510
I was in like Flynn took that down to
the flight surgeon and put my application

142
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,980
in and a,
and one off to flight school.

143
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,200
Awesome. Awesome. And so I'm going to,

144
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:42,290
I'm going to jump into
the book here. You, um,

145
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,490
you spent your first tour in Vietnam,
I think as your first tour in Vietnam.

146
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:49,940
You were flying the Mohawk, right.
Okay. So first tour in Vietnam.

147
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,110
And by the way,
you know,

148
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,180
we were talking before the podcast about
how much risk you guys took in Vietnam

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,030
as pilots. It's, it's actually crazy
and we'll get into more than that.

150
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,180
But one of the things that struck me as
I'm in the beginning of your book and

151
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:08,000
you're talking about how you got shot
down on your first deployment to Vietnam

152
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,770
as a pilot. So, so here, here's
you telling that story to your,

153
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:15,530
your crew when you're going on your
second deployment that you said. Yeah,

154
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,230
the first couple of operations we've
done here, they've been pretty exciting.

155
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,420
But you know, I had some good ones
on my last deployment too by the way.

156
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,170
It got shot down and uh,
so here I'm going to go to the book here.

157
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,230
This is what happened when you
got shot down for the first time.

158
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,920
It took a 37 millimeter milometer
antiaircraft hitting the right wing,

159
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,220
attacking a fuel depot,
hit hidden under the trees,

160
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,460
classified mission in Laos
over the Ho Chi Minh trail.

161
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,560
I pulled up from a rocket run,
wham.

162
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,600
The whole right side of the
aircraft seemed to explode.

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,220
We tumbled out of control. The right wing
shattered and was on fire, worked hard,

164
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,850
got back some ability to fly,
got the fire out,

165
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,540
but we were descending fast,
could not hold out the Tude.

166
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,780
Gave the command to eject.
The Observer went out,

167
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,820
I pulled my seat handle right after
I had a very short parachute ride,

168
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,320
only got partial shoot deployment
before hitting the ground with a thud.

169
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,790
We are crashing through the tree
tops by the time I punched out. So,

170
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,490
so for those people that don't know
what all that means is right there,

171
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,400
that means you know, when you pull
an ejection handle on, uh, on, uh,

172
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,760
when you're in a plane,
it ejects you out.

173
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,930
But you're supposed to do it with
some level of altitude, right?

174
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,230
Not when you're hitting the tree tops.
So you're hitting the tree tops in that,

175
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,450
in the canopy,
not opening all the way.

176
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,200
That means that the full usage
of the parachute isn't there.

177
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:36,170
It's just sort of getting opened
and then boom, it hits the ground.

178
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,400
My way, man, took a picture of my shoot
down site and you can see the, uh,

179
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,970
the parachute is just all strung out
and I'm laying there at the end of the

180
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,520
parachute. I mean, I never
got a single isolation.

181
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,200
I got a partial shoot
deployment and hit the ground.

182
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm glad we can sit here and laugh at say,
am I offending by laughing at this?

183
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,370
I hope not. No, you're not. Because I
mean you made a comment about, you know,

184
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,580
taking the hits and I the attention
to come. And it was, it really was.

185
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,500
But there's something crazy about
young men. Uh, and uh, and uh,

186
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,490
at that point in my life I was a kid
living a dream and I got blown out of the

187
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,130
sky and my first tour. Yes, I survived it.

188
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,980
And somehow in my crazy twisted mind,

189
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,500
I couldn't wait to get back
over on his second tour,

190
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,380
Flying Cobra attack
helicopters. Hey, by the way,

191
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,680
so this is what happens once you get on
the ground. Here we go back to the book.

192
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,970
Then I was newly captured.

193
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,530
I ran through the jungle 45 minutes while
my wing man put down suppressive fire

194
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,180
that earned me the nickname.

195
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,190
Lightfoot got plucked out of the jungle
by an Air Force helicopter from the 20th

196
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,690
Special Operations Squadron
Out of Thailand called the
call side Pony Express.

197
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,310
Spent some time in the hospital there.

198
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,390
Eventually I returned to
the unit back to flight

199
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,920
duties. This is incredible. We
lost 15 airplanes at that point.

200
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,520
Out of 1830 crew members shot down.

201
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,870
Not many of them ever recovered.
I was one of the few lousy odds.

202
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,220
I was scared. Then I'll tell you,
if you don't get scared in combat,

203
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,410
you're a liar or nuts.

204
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,010
Only after tents mission is over.

205
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,850
Does the real fright come when
there's time to sit and think?

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,510
You watch it all play out in your mind
and wonder how the hell you live through

207
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:15,440
something like that.

208
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,863
Okay,

209
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,730
so again, we were talking before, before
we pressed record about the, you know,

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,510
about how protective America
is of its aircraft right now.

211
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,190
I can't even imagine.

212
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,370
You guys had 15 out of 18
airplanes that were shot down.

213
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,660
That's,
that's insane.

214
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,680
Yeah, and that was a
sophisticated, expensive aircraft
for the army at the time,

215
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,440
though. The Mohawk was pretty much
top of the line technology, arm,

216
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,840
army aircraft then.
Yeah,

217
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,170
very. Yeah. That's,

218
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,650
that's a totally different
mentality that than we have now.

219
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,810
Totally different mentality.
Yeah. And that was a special unit.

220
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:02,770
We had five Mohawk companies
in Vietnam at that time. Uh,

221
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,820
four of them were for each of the four
core tactical zones inside of south

222
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,280
Vietnam. They flew missions and
supportive of those areas. Uh,

223
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,960
we were the fifth company, the Bastard
Company. We flew out of way Phu Bai.

224
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,350
The only time we saw South Vietnam
was for take offs and landings,

225
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,430
all of our missions when it allows
her up off the coast of North Vietnam.

226
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,510
And then I had one highly classified one.

227
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:26,320
I had to deploy down to Todd snoot
at Saigon to go into Cambodia. Uh,

228
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,650
that I didn't know what
that was all about. It was
really hush hush at the time.

229
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,940
And that was in the advance of
the big Ang, Cambodia and curves.

230
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,910
And that took place in 70.

231
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,380
They developed the Mohawks for Vietnam
because it's interesting aircraft.

232
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,580
It's a side by side right in,
it's a prop plane to that twin turbo prop.

233
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,670
Others built purely for reconnaissance
and surveillance, Grumman,

234
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
Grumman aircraft.
Um,

235
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,720
but then you guys went ahead and put
missiles on them or rockets. We put,

236
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,800
we put rocks in. There were
Zuni missiles forever. Yeah,

237
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,070
we had rockets and pod mounted
machine guns. Uh, that, yeah,

238
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,130
that led to my cobra
experience because I really,

239
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,950
that was my favorite mission where
the gun missions in the Mohawk,

240
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:05,000
not all of them were armed, but I, I liked
the gun missions. Uh, when I came back,

241
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:07,910
my first tour, there was a spat
between the army and the air force.

242
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,940
And the result of the spot was we had to
take all the armament off the Mohawks.

243
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,960
So when I went back on second tour,
I wanted to go on a gunship,

244
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,340
not something without guns.
So that got me into cobras.

245
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,870
Yeah, that's weird. Those
bureaucratic spats happening,

246
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,650
decisions like that get made.
That's really disturbing.

247
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,470
So let's get into your second tour,
right?

248
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,150
And I'm going to jump into this piece
here. Back to the book. On April 14th,

249
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:36,780
we received a radio call that Firebase
Charlie was under attack by two regiments,

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,840
3000 soldiers of the 320th Nva Infantry
Division and 130 million meter artillery

251
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:48,090
shells were pounding the position.
So you guys get this call, this,

252
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,540
this friendly basis
being overrun basically.

253
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,160
And here you show up on the
scene. Now you're fine. A Cobra,

254
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,330
which for those of you that don't
know a Cobra gunship as you just said,

255
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,850
it's still in service today.

256
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:07,530
The Marine Corps stuff flies growers
like overs and very narrow skinny.

257
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,730
It's based on a Huey,
right?

258
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,950
Yeah, it was, you know,

259
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,710
the Helio was designed and went to Vietnam
and that most of our smaller with the

260
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,340
Huey, the Huey took on a gun
mission though that, that uh,

261
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,520
in Vietnam we saw the utility
had guns on our aircraft. Uh,

262
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:23,930
so the Cobra then was designed
specifically and only as
a gunship and they took

263
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:27,810
the Huey design, narrowed it down
to 36 inches pilot in the backseat,

264
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,030
copilot gunner in the front seat,
2.75 rockets on the wing stores,

265
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,710
a mini gun and 40 million or million or
grenade launcher in a movable knows to

266
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,740
it.
And it was one killing machine.

267
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,813
Okay.

268
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,730
And it's still apparently brings a giant
smile to your face when you talk about

269
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,320
that, which is lovely. And I
don't want to seem twisted. Yeah.

270
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,920
And I, I sat at the time I was a, I
was a kid living a dream and I was,

271
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,800
but I don't want to take away
from the horror of combat.

272
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:56,760
And it was scary as crap. Yeah.
On, on every single mission.

273
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,660
But there's still something about
a young guy, uh, going to war,

274
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,180
at least a certain type of young guy.
Uh,

275
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,440
and those that were in the two units
I served in, uh, that, uh, yeah, we,

276
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,670
we were dedicated what we did and I think
we did it well and I'm still smiling

277
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:12,504
about it.
Thank you.

278
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,190
So far, every guy had brought in to this
podcast has the exact same attitude.

279
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,460
So you're among friends here.
So I'm going now you guys are,

280
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,820
you guys are there, you show up with your,
when you're Cobra's back to the book,

281
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:27,130
we made several passes on enemy guns,

282
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,810
bullets stream past our cockpits as
the NVA gunners tried to bring us down.

283
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,290
Rolling in on a 51
physician is always dicey.

284
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,640
So this is a 51 caliber. It's a
dish, it's a, it's an anti aircraft,

285
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,490
aircraft machine gun. And they actually
had those when we were in Ramadi.

286
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,300
They had still had dish gets
and they use them against us.

287
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,820
Tracers come at you
and miss by a few feet.

288
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,290
You try to get rockets onto him before
he gets lucky and blast you out of the

289
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,120
sky.
We took small arms,

290
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:58,260
hits my knees vibrated
like a sewing machine,

291
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,450
but I focused on
controlling the helicopter,

292
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,530
lining up the gun sights and shooting.
I was scared, but had no time for it.

293
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Dan radioed dusty cyanide panther one
three panther one three be advised,

294
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,230
running low on fuel out of Ammo.

295
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,240
We're breaking station for
re arm refuel. Roger, one,

296
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:22,560
three, four gun crews taken
out. Good work. Hurry back.

297
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,610
So you're your to ring to the
guy on the ground. Who's there?

298
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:31,110
So there's an American advisor on the
ground with a bunch of south Vietnamese

299
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,550
soldiers. They're being overrun. You
come in, you're taking heavy fire,

300
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,530
but you're giving backfire.
You tell them, hey,

301
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:41,730
we got to go and get some more
ammunition. He's saying, good job,

302
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,710
hurry back.
And when you do show up back,

303
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,820
the NVA attack is now more intense.

304
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,410
And here's the call that you get when
you show back up panther. That's you.

305
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,960
By the way, Panther Pink Panther's
as your, as you guys want to call,

306
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,470
as your call sign is panther.
Here's the call you get panther,

307
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
the battalion commander
is dead acting commander,

308
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,330
wounded enemy broken through on
the southwest, put it there first,

309
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,710
then all around us,
but real close.

310
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,570
So for those people that don't
understand what this means,

311
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,490
when you're on the ground
calling for fire, it's, it's,

312
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:28,130
and I've talked about a lot of fracture
side and blue on blue situations. I've,

313
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,960
I had him on my deployment and it's a,

314
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,250
it's a very scary thing and it's even
scarier from the air to the ground.

315
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,750
It's, it's, it's hard for
people to understand this.
When you're in an aircraft,

316
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,030
it's very hard to see what's
happening on the ground.

317
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,030
It can be very easy to get confused and
so it's hard to bring fire very close to

318
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:53,640
your position unless you are
just in a terrible situation.

319
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,580
And so when you get a call that saying,

320
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,320
put the fire all around us as
close as you can. You know,

321
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:06,321
this is a desperate scenario
and so I'll go back to the book,

322
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,150
Roger Dusty, we've got them after
a number of Cobra attack runs,

323
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:15,810
Duffy called Panther lead. This is dusty
Sinai, so that's the guy on the ground.

324
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,160
That's his call sign.
Dusty cyanide,

325
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,850
you've broken the enemy attack for
now hundreds of bodies in the wire,

326
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,410
maybe a thousand but we cannot
hold after a short break.

327
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:30,090
He continued. We are leaving Firebase,
Charlie, now stop them from following us.

328
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,410
Whatever it takes, put your stuff
right on top of the fire base.

329
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,680
Now
and again,

330
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,320
this is something that it,
just

331
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,270
to explain what that means.

332
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:48,190
If you don't understand what that
you'd never in the military to explain,

333
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,610
you're calling for people to drop fire
onto your own position so that you can

334
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:58,660
get away. It doesn't get any, there's
nothing. It doesn't get any more intense.

335
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,280
It doesn't get any more dramatic.

336
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,400
It doesn't get any more
sketchy than that right there.

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,740
That was one hell of a fight.
And John Joseph Duffy was the adviser,

338
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,150
the American advisor on the ground.

339
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:14,740
And he is a true American hero Army
Special Forces officer had those adviser

340
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:18,310
duties. Uh, that battle, the
battle lasted for about two weeks.

341
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,880
The climax of it was a couple
days with that last night.

342
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,840
That is described in the
book, uh, out of a 470 man,

343
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,430
south Vietnamese airborne Paratroop
Battalion. At the end of that fight,

344
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,770
the next morning, uh,
the American advisor,

345
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:37,540
John Joseph Duffy and 36 of the South
Vietnamese were all that survived to be

346
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,870
picked up. Uh, when they, when
they got off of that Firebase and,

347
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,920
and John was a wounded five
times in the battle. So yeah,

348
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:49,600
470 man battalion, 36 survivors and
their, and their wounded American advisor.

349
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,730
Absolutely unbelievable.

350
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,080
And I know you wrote in here that major
Duffy was recommended for the medal of

351
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:01,081
honor and he got the distinguished
service cross for his actions,

352
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,360
which if you don't know what that is,
it's,

353
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,850
it's the second highest award
underneath the metal of honor.

354
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,810
Yeah. And you actually talk about possibly
writing about that battle. That's my,

355
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:16,970
that's my next project. And in
doing this book, and there's a, uh,

356
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:20,410
there's a statement at the beginning of
the book that I wrote this some 40 years

357
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:23,770
after I experienced
these actions. Uh, and,

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,050
and some things were still
perfectly clear in my mind.

359
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Other things were a little bit hazier
than I thought they would be when I put

360
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,600
pen to paper. Uh, so in
the process of writing,

361
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:36,601
I not only just dug down in my mind and
relived every experience as detailed as

362
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,140
I could to get everything correct.

363
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,910
I contacted those who were also
involved in and the actions to get their

364
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,220
versions of their view,
their recollections,

365
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:48,340
to be sure I had this as right as I could.
Uh,

366
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,540
John Joseph Duffy was one that I got
ahold of major Duffy. I had never met him.

367
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,810
I'd never talked to him since that
battle until I was able to track him down

368
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:59,360
with the wonders of modern
communication and Internet. Uh, and,

369
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:03,460
and in sharing the details about that
fight, uh, he dropped a couple of hints.

370
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:03,971
He said,
you know,

371
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,570
somebody really ought to write the history
of the battle of Firebase. Charlie,

372
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:10,750
this is one of the most extraordinary
fights in the entire Vietnam war.

373
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,010
So I think it was after about half a
dozen times he said, I said, okay, John,

374
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,610
I'll do it. I'll write
it. So yes, right now I'm,

375
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:20,470
I'm working on doing my research
and getting everything in order to,

376
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:24,040
to write the story of, of, of that
battle and more detail than I give on my,

377
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,800
what couple of pages are in my
book. Yeah, that's one of the,

378
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,010
one of the most interesting things for
me about doing this podcast. And we're,

379
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,810
again, another thing we were talking
about is there's so many, you know,

380
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,710
I didn't know about that battle and
I'm a pretty decent student of military

381
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,400
history.

382
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,840
I didn't know about that battle and
didn't know about major John Duffy.

383
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,070
I absolutely should.
And we

384
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
all should.

385
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,890
Any and what you realize
is that battle that man,

386
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,090
we will never be able to account
for all of these heroes. No,

387
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,320
you just can't do it.

388
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,380
So
again,

389
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,420
this is fast forwarding a little bit
through the book. And by the way,

390
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,660
I didn't mention the name of the
book yet. Oh yeah. Thank you.

391
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,200
The name of the book
is through the valley,

392
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,220
my captivity in Vietnam
by William Reader and

393
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,880
get this book.
So at this point I'm,

394
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,570
I'm jumping ahead a little bit too,

395
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,970
a situation where you've got,

396
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:37,971
and I'll go to the book tanks in the wire
at Poli cling launched now and call me

397
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,900
and wrote for their radio freak
hawks claw will get up later.

398
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,720
You'll be covering him too.
You have tail number,

399
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:48,420
zero five three and six eight to go.

400
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,020
So that right there is something bad
is happening and you got to go now.

401
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,760
And what's, what's interesting,
and I'll point this out for again,

402
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:03,310
people that aren't in the military,
by the way,

403
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,280
a lot of guys that listen to this or in
the military, a lot of law enforcement,

404
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,390
but there's a lot of civilians that don't
know everything that I'm talking about

405
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:11,590
or that word that you're talking about.

406
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,900
So what I like about this is
that what they're telling,

407
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,930
what they're telling the colonel
to do is launch your aircraft.

408
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:22,600
Just go get an aircraft and launch
and start heading in that direction.

409
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,330
We'll give you a frequency
when you get up there,

410
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:29,320
we'll tell you what's going to happen
once you get up there to go. So again,

411
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,240
this is an inextremist situation.

412
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,080
What we would do that would be similar
to this in the seal teams is we would go

413
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:39,100
on QRF missions, quick reaction
forces where they would call it there.

414
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,570
It happened to me where
they call up and say, hey,

415
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,310
something's going on here at this
location. Go and I'd say, who's the unit?

416
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,610
We don't know yet. Any frequency.
What's what radio frequency on?

417
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,770
We don't know yet. We'll
get it to you. Launch.

418
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,480
We'd get in our vehicles and launch.
Yeah.

419
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:55,840
You developed the situation and route and
then when you lay eyes on when you get

420
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:59,590
there and start talking to the folks.
Yep, exactly. Back to the book,

421
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:04,030
I stuffed a small emergency radio into
one of the pockets of my survival vest.

422
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,580
No time to perform the
normal check on the radio. I,

423
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,400
I had to include that. There's a lesson
learned there. I had to include that.

424
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,780
It's, you know, the
radio will always work.

425
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:22,460
If you test it in the water tight, you
don't test it is the one time that locker.

426
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,520
Yeah, that's the lesson. Check all
your survival, your shirts in order,

427
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,150
regardless of how hot that mission is.
Um,

428
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,180
now you're heading to a place called
the Ben hit and I'm going to the book.

429
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,120
We headed to Ben hat as we
crossed the last ridge line.

430
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,750
The entire valley before
us was filled with smoke.

431
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Tracers streamed outward from defensive
positions inside the camp enemy tracers

432
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,550
replied from outside to jet.

433
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:54,450
Fighters bombed next to the camp.
Nva rockets,

434
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,210
artillery and mortars
exploded in the camp.

435
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,460
Enemy tanks breached the perimeter one
inside and part way up the hill look like

436
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,750
it had been killed already.

437
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,900
I couldn't be sure an AC one 30 on air
force AC when 30 spectre gunship was

438
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,930
leaving.

439
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,830
He had worked the area over with 20
millimeter Volk Vulcan Gatling guns and 40

440
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:18,690
millimeter cannon cannon's
probably hitting the tank
enemy infantry move through

441
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:23,250
openings in the jungle canopy. I could
see groups assembling to join the attack.

442
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,570
Yeah, it was, it was one heck
of a heck of a battle. The,

443
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,900
this whole situation we're getting to
in the book occurred during the Easter

444
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,400
offensive of 1972 when I arrived back
in Vietnam at the end of [inaudible] 71,

445
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,200
it seemed like the war was over.
In fact,

446
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,530
I was afraid that maybe I'd missed my
chance for combat and a Cobra because

447
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:47,220
things were so quiet. Uh,
many American, in fact,

448
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:50,790
most American forces had been withdrawn
in the central part of Vietnam.

449
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,320
The central highlands
where I was operating,

450
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:54,960
there were no American
ground forces left at all.

451
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,300
It's just some special forces guys,
uh,

452
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,080
army aviation units and some
air force unit. That was it. Um,

453
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,420
how that changed as we got into the
spring of 1972 because the enemy had been

454
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:10,050
building up their divisions across
the border into Laos and Cambodia.

455
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,820
And in the spring of 72,

456
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:15,420
they launched an attack
from the demilitarized zone
and attack from Cambodia

457
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,730
towards Saigon.
And then finally in April,

458
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,950
attacks across the central
highlands where we were,

459
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,210
and there were a lot of enemy this day
at Ben Het courses is going to turn into

460
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:28,340
the the day, the day that we're
getting to here. Uh, but yeah,

461
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,050
elements of two north Vietnamese
divisions with artillery,

462
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:35,970
with anti aircraft weapons Galore.
Uh, and with, uh, with armor, uh,

463
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,660
going into the end of the camp. And there
we showed up with our two cobras to do,

464
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,400
do what we could do. Was that your
first time seeing armor enemy armor? No.

465
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,570
Uh, that, that, that
period was on the 20 foot,

466
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:52,800
cause this is the 9th of May. On the 24th
of April, the enemy attacked the, uh,

467
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,970
the 22nd Arvin that's Army Vietnam
Division headquarters at 10 can,

468
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,260
which is a little bit further to the east
from Ben hit. So on the 24th of April,

469
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:05,700
they attack Tan cannon and defeated and
overran that Nva division, uh, with a,

470
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,850
a number of tanks. So that was the
first time I saw tanks and battle.

471
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,670
Then we come out on the 9th of
May and I'm seeing tanks again.

472
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,580
Whole different ballgame for the
guys on the ground. Yes. Yeah.

473
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,680
This guerrilla war suddenly turned into
a very conventional war fighting regular

474
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,990
north Vietnamese divisions.
Now

475
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,040
it's again you,
you had some time on station,

476
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,810
you did a bunch of shooting and running
and gun and you had to go back to reload,

477
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,850
refuel, and I'm going back to the
book now. On our way back to Ben hat,

478
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,890
we could see the battle continuing
at ploy polyclinic, Holly clang,

479
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,810
Vietnamese air force a one sky
Raiders dove dropping bombs.

480
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,980
We pass close enough to see one as it
trailed smoke and flame and went into the

481
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:52,600
ground and awful explosion.

482
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,990
I saw parachute and a mayday call came
over the radio emergency radio frequency.

483
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,500
I called headquarters to tell them I
was diverting for a few minutes to help

484
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,710
cover the downed v. N a. F.

485
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,290
So the Vietnamese air force
pilot negative panther,

486
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,690
three six permission denied.
Proceed direct to Ben hat out.

487
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,270
You try it again.
Same results.

488
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
So you saw the north or a South
Vietnamese air force pilot gets shot down.

489
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,760
Right. And you call back to base and
say, I'm going to go cover for this guy.

490
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:27,460
When they try and rescue them
and they tell you no right

491
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,930
now.
So you do what you're told.

492
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,340
Yeah. Decisions have kind of bad. I mean,
and there's pluses and minuses to that.

493
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:41,180
There. There were guys on the ground at
Ben Hat in serious trouble at Ben hit.

494
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:44,120
There were two Vietnamese
ranger battalions,

495
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,650
so probably four or
500 people at the most,

496
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:53,200
probably for 400 people on the ground
at Ben hit with two American advisors.

497
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,380
There's two Americans on the ground.

498
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:57,500
They are under attack by elements
of two north Vietnamese divisions,

499
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:00,230
which means thousands of infantry
with the tanks and artillery,

500
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,350
everything attack. And so yeah,
they were in dire straights though.

501
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:07,580
I really had hoped we could briefly
stop over and help get this uh, Vietnam,

502
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,840
Vietnamese air force pilot.

503
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,830
It's picked up. Yeah, no, that's a tough
decision for command to make. Right.

504
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,790
But from my position, I
look at it like, okay,

505
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,000
the command has a better overall
view of the battlefield right now.

506
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,820
And if they're telling me to
proceed on to Ben Hat. Got It.

507
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,660
Even though you obviously,
yes,

508
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,020
you have a little good.

509
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:28,850
I'm glad you have that perspective because
I didn't know that at the time at all.

510
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,340
Yeah. Well it's easy for me
right now sitting in an air
conditioned space with my

511
00:31:32,341 --> 00:31:36,160
headset on. Yeah. Um, so
much in Vietnam, you know,

512
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:40,770
and warfare is different today and I think
things are probably much more planned

513
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,690
out and, and, and you go to a,

514
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,930
according to a set of rules and
procedures more than we did,

515
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,310
so many of these combat missions with
Cobras and Vietnam and that day and age,

516
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:54,030
we would get launched out of our base
and we'd go out and make contact with

517
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:54,361
people.

518
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:58,260
And it was pretty much up to the pilot
and command or the air mission commander,

519
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,010
uh, to decide where he would go and how
he would support and what was the hottest

520
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:06,000
fire on town that, that needed
help. Uh, so we always had,

521
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:08,430
some of it was just I guess
are pompous attitude too.

522
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:12,180
We always felt we had a better handle on
what was happening then the guys in the

523
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,530
headquarters that made some
of those decisions. Uh,

524
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,920
in fact when we first saw tanks,
uh,

525
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,610
in the area before that battle
at tank can on the 24th of April,

526
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,020
we saw tanks and reported them back
through headquarters and there was a great

527
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:28,530
deal of reluctance on the part of anybody
in the headquarter staff to do believe

528
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:31,680
that there were tanks. Uh,
there was a guy that, in fact,

529
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:34,500
this is another interesting
situation at Vietnam at that time,

530
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,690
the senior commander in two core,

531
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:39,650
that area that I was
operating in was not a guy.

532
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
There was a civilian named John Paul van
and Mr van made all the decisions now

533
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:49,130
to keep things illegal. He had a two star
army general officer working for him.

534
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,800
So all military orders came
through the army general.

535
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,560
But Mr van was making
the decisions and the,

536
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,730
and when we reported we had
seen tanks in mid to mid April.

537
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,850
Van Said, Nah, there's not tanks
that I fly out there all the time.

538
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:02,990
If there are tanks,
I'd have seen him.

539
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,420
He said what you guys saw our probably
elephants in the jungle. Uh, so that's,

540
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,360
that's what we dealt with with
uh, with our headquarters.
Yeah, that's interesting.

541
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:13,940
They're definitely was when I was in Iraq,

542
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:18,770
there is very tight control over air to
ground support, especially in the cities.

543
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:23,270
In Ramadi. It was very difficult to get
dropped, bombs dropped. But you know,

544
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:28,271
who had really good decentralized command
was the tanks and the tanks that we

545
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,800
work with,
they would,

546
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,580
they would come and they had pretty good
control over what I'm talking to tank

547
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:37,640
commander,
at least at the company command level.

548
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,380
We had some company commanders that
would just get after it and they would,

549
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,310
would make stuff happen.

550
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:47,330
So we felt really comfortable
working with the tankers and in,

551
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,710
they supported us over and over and
over again. Really, like I said,

552
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:55,490
with a lot of decentralized command, you
know, they couldn't, they had to use some,

553
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,240
they obviously use discretion,
but they had a lot of authority out there,

554
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,750
which was, which was great for us, which
we did as well, which was really good.

555
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,210
So at already, yeah, you
left me. I'm going back from,

556
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,730
we'd rearm refueled or costume.
We're heading back up,

557
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,690
were denied permission to deviate
over to Polly clang. And, uh, we're,

558
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,790
we're getting back into it.
Have been at one more time.

559
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,440
And now what you're doing when I'm
going to pick the story back up here,

560
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,300
there's a Huey that's got resupply.
So he's got, you know, bullets,

561
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:26,030
probably bullets, water and food
maybe at this point, just bullets.

562
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,440
And they need to get that gear down
to the guys on the ground. Right.

563
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:33,500
The guys on the ground, the base had
been pretty much completely overrun.

564
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,700
The friendliest had consolidated in a
command bunker complex or defensive Duggin

565
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,780
positions at the top of the hill, which
was their Firebase. Uh, they were,

566
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,240
when we got the call to cover that Huey,
uh,

567
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,680
we were told that the guys on the ground,

568
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:49,310
we're completely out of anti tank ammo
and we're almost out of small arms

569
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:53,420
ammunition and could we cover this?
You in for the resupply. So here we go.

570
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:57,500
Back to the book. The Huey came into
a low hover near the command bunker.

571
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,570
The crew kicked out the ammo boxes.

572
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,050
The helicopter did a
hovering turn and took off.

573
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,220
I began a sharp left turn
so I could continue shooting
suppressive fire for him.

574
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,820
The enemy opened up on our two Cobiz with
everything they had my view left right

575
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,520
and above and below was
filled with tracers.

576
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:22,270
Tim fired continuously and Tim was your
was him was Tim was my front seat or my

577
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:25,940
copilot gunner in the front seat working
that knows to her while I was firing

578
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:29,210
rockets. Tim fired continuously
on those firing at us.

579
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,030
We took large caliber hits
all over the aircraft.

580
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,330
50 ones like I talked about and
14.5 millimeter rounds came through.

581
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:38,244
The cockpit

582
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,050
hits from small arms,

583
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:45,000
always felt something like
Jiffy pop popcorn popping
against it's tin foil cover.

584
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,160
These seem like Jack Hammers slamming
into the aircraft beginning in the rear,

585
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,890
working up the side and
then into the cockpit.

586
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,520
The tail rotor were shot off
and the engine was shot up.

587
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,050
Every system on the helicopter was damaged
in some way without the tail rotor.

588
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,460
The aircraft began to spin.
Fuel lines ruptured and we were burning.

589
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,230
I keyed the microphone.

590
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,160
This is three six taking fire from
four o'clock taking fire everywhere,

591
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,170
taking fire, taking hits, going down,

592
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,970
panther going down the engine
quit the rotor. RPM caution.

593
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,840
Light flashed.

594
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,800
The audio warning sounded announcing
got my rotor blades were turning

595
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:23,910
dangerously slow.

596
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,980
I slammed the collective down hard to
auto rotate under optimal conditions.

597
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,030
This is a controlled emergency descent.
Under these conditions,

598
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,570
I could only hope to lessen
the severity of the crash.

599
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,680
We corkscrewed down in flames.
As I wrestled the aircraft,

600
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,170
I radioed my wing man flame,

601
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,370
you better get in here and get us
out quick. There was no answer.

602
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,410
They were fighting for their lives.

603
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,010
I learned years later that
when I called taking hits,

604
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,270
flame had banked his cobra
and fired rockets onto the
position shooting at me as

605
00:36:59,271 --> 00:36:59,571
he did.

606
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:04,571
So a big ugly 51 round came through the
cockpit and tore into his chest high on

607
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:08,450
the left side.
Bob took the controls and headed for help.

608
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:13,040
Flying from the front seat, microbrew
came down, spinning and burning.

609
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,480
It hit the ground hard,
nose low on the left side.

610
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,340
It bounced back into the air,
spun another turn and a half and crashed.

611
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,910
It's settled nearly upright,
firing Gulf, the cockpit.

612
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,703
So

613
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,620
pilots are known for maintaining
their composure. Right. And I, I've,

614
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,640
I've heard pilots do it and clearly, you
know, you're saying we're taking hits,

615
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,490
we're taking fire from everywhere. We're
going down path. They're going down.

616
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,993
Okay.

617
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,080
Are you so tracking on controlling
the aircraft that you're,

618
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:59,780
you're just completely focused on that,

619
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:04,781
that the rest of what's happening
is a little bit blocked out or what?

620
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,753
Okay.

621
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,380
Are you thinking yourself,
I've got to survive this crash?

622
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,890
Are you not worried about the fact
that when you get on the ground, hey,

623
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,740
now I'm going to,
we're going to

624
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,930
be surrounded by enemy. Yeah, no,

625
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,160
none of those thoughts are taking place.

626
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,890
As I said in an earlier
thing that you read,

627
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,840
everyone who's not totally
insane is scared and combat, uh,

628
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,740
off times. That fear, uh,

629
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,860
comes about after the missions
are over at the end of the day,

630
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:32,810
when you think back on what
she'd been through that day,

631
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,530
thank goodness we got to
drink alcohol at Vietnam.

632
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,660
I don't know how people survive
in war today. I really don't.

633
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:41,310
We've got drunk every single night and
then went back out the next day and did

634
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,570
it again.
So there's fear at the end of the day,

635
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,380
there's also fear and trepidation,
uh,

636
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,820
to a degree when you first go,

637
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,670
like when I described coming across the
hill and seeing what that battle of Ben

638
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:53,860
had looked like, tracer stuff
all over the place. I mean,

639
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,870
you get butterflies in your
stomach and you're anxious,

640
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,450
but once you go in on that
mission and start those gun runs,

641
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,670
it's all, there's,
there's, there's no time.

642
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,460
There's no mental space for
any of that other thought.

643
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:09,430
There was no mental space for that fear.
Uh,

644
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:14,320
you just focus on what you have to do
and you do it. Uh, and the pull thing,

645
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:17,530
we just ready to get in the
shot down though still. I
mean, all these years later,

646
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:21,340
I'm sitting here with a red emotional
flush and my face reliving this yet,

647
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,220
one more time. But no, I don't,

648
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:28,150
I don't recall thinking of
anything in those moments.
But, but doing that mission,

649
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,590
controlling that aircraft,

650
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:32,410
dealing with that emergency
situation as best I could and,

651
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,610
and going through the whole process,

652
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,800
I don't even think there was a thought
of life or death or who am I going to

653
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,550
make it or not make it or none of
that was even there. It was, it's,

654
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:42,670
you do what you have to do and,
and get it done.

655
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,530
And then when it all settled in and,
and, and uh, you know, hit spun,

656
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,161
settled in,

657
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:53,161
crashed smoke and flames everywhere the
thing begins exploding a then even then

658
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:56,980
there's not time for that fear factor
then because then you start dealing with,

659
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,100
okay, what do I have to do now to
survive this and get out of here?

660
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,560
And so your aircraft's on fire and I
guess you're not sitting around pondering

661
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:06,990
much when your aircraft is on fire and
you're stuck and they're trying to get

662
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:10,320
out. You get hung up while you're
getting now by the way. I did.

663
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,280
So you,

664
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,140
you do get out. You make it away
from the bird a little bit and

665
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,880
ew.
Ew.

666
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,970
Ended up getting some distance away.
You lost, you lost your wing man. Right?

667
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,150
Or he started, you lost
your, your um, yeah my,

668
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:34,940
my wing man took the 51 wing
minutes, took the 51, but Tim,

669
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:38,180
he got out of the aircraft too
and took off in another direction.

670
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:38,900
Now my front seat,

671
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,890
Tim Conroy in a Cobra, the, there's
two canopies, one for the front seat,

672
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:46,220
one for the back,
the front seat canopy opens to the left.

673
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:49,880
The backseat canopy opens to
the right. Uh, so we, we hit,

674
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,290
we had an inner calm conversation.
I said, uh, I don't know. I said,

675
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:57,650
let's get out of this thing. That's,
that's good enough for that. And he,

676
00:40:57,651 --> 00:41:02,360
Roger that call and uh, and then he
got out his way. I got out my way.

677
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,000
I Dunno if you had that little vignette
of what happened when I was hanging

678
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:05,890
upside down out there.
The

679
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,090
aircraft. Yeah. That guy was New
England to mark mark true hand.

680
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:14,440
The idea of advisor on the ground there.
I'll, I'll, I'll go ahead and if you want.

681
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah. Inside Ben hat, one
of the American advisors,

682
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:20,830
Mark True Hand Watch this get shot down
and crash. He saw Tim exit the aircraft.

683
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,730
He saw me hanging out of the side
of the Cobra head down with my feet,

684
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,980
stuck in the cockpit,
the helicopter burning.

685
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,550
He'd seen a truck driver die in agony
in a blazing semi rack years before and

686
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:34,010
it's,
he would not

687
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,210
let that happen again.

688
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,290
He raised the sight of his m 16 rifle
to my body as he began to squeeze the

689
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,460
trigger to put me out of my misery,

690
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,880
a cloud of smoke billowed
from the exploding aircraft.

691
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,370
It obscured me from his view. When
the smoke cleared, I was gone.

692
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,060
And that's something that you
found out years later? Yeah,

693
00:41:57,061 --> 00:42:00,420
he got in touch with me. I got
it. He contacted me and said,

694
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:04,260
I think it was a letter and said I was
one of the advisors on the ground had

695
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:05,370
been hit when he got shot down.

696
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:08,220
I can give you some information about
what happened if you'd like to hear it,

697
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:11,750
if you don't, I understand if you just
don't want to even go there. I said, no.

698
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,600
Tell me what you know. So he shared
that story with me on believable. Yeah.

699
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,070
Okay. So I'm going back to
the book. You're, you're,

700
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,660
this is the state you're in. The pain
in my back was intense. It was broken.

701
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,290
The fire had burned the back of my neck.
I had lesser burns on my face.

702
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:33,000
My hair was singed. I had pulled
a shell fragment out of my ankle.

703
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,030
Superficial lacerations covered my
face and forehead bleeding badly.

704
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,230
I was a mess, but I was
motivated. I wanted to get away.

705
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,660
I staggered from the crash site and
headed southeast towards contem con tomb

706
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:52,140
costume as it was getting dark.
I had not gone far.

707
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,500
When I heard helicopters approaching
cobras came in low shooting and you had

708
00:42:57,571 --> 00:43:02,070
your little a strobe and so here we go.
I held the light over my head,

709
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:04,830
pointed it toward the aircraft.
It flashed a few times.

710
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,440
The gunner in the lead Cobra opened up
on me with this mini gun. A streamer.

711
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,340
Tracers came right at me,
which is,

712
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,960
this is something we we learned in Iraq
as well. When you fire off a strobe,

713
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,590
if someone isn't expecting
or isn't looking for it,

714
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,970
it just looks like muzzle flashing.
Anybody that sees it will shoot at it.

715
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,130
We had blue covers that we put on them
that supposedly change the color of it so

716
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,410
it wouldn't look like enemy
fire. But no. In fact,

717
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:34,190
I ran into that a front
seat or that opened up on my
years later at Bentley Hill

718
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,930
and a yeah, he shared, he said, yeah,

719
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:38,660
we were out there flying that mission
and it sure look like enemy fire.

720
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:39,494
Sorry about that.

721
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,450
So here we go. Back to the booker. This
is a little bit about your attitude.

722
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:50,780
I was cocksure if anyone can survive this.
It was me.

723
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,740
I'd been a boy scout though I was one
of the trouble makers in my troop.

724
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:55,850
I've learned a lot.

725
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,110
I backpacked 65 miles
through the mountains in five
days and practice survival

726
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:04,100
skills. My troubled youth got me
suspended from school a number of times,

727
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:09,140
but it also taught me lessons. I learned
a street fight, take care of myself.

728
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,240
I had boxed, played football and
run track. I majored in forestry,

729
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,620
worked cattle ranches,
rode broncs in small Rodeos,

730
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:21,350
fought forest fires,
worked construction,

731
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,010
and was an electrical lineman
for southern California Edison.

732
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,470
I remembered a little ditty
my mother had taught me.

733
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,280
The Lord helps those who help themselves.

734
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,410
I knew I could depend on its absolute
truth to get me through this.

735
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,360
The lowered hell helps those who help
themselves. God, I'll do that. Do all,

736
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:46,320
I can muster every bit of what's
inside me. I'll do my part,

737
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,910
I'll do all I can to help myself.
So please,

738
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,360
please do yours.
I need your help.

739
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,920
I said it again to myself.
Drawing comfort and strength.

740
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,980
The Lord helps those who helps themselves.

741
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I would repeat it often as I set my
mind to doing all I must to survive.

742
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,343
Yeah.

743
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,220
This is a, this is interesting
going through this at all,

744
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,650
this detail again because when I,
when I wrote the book,

745
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:25,560
I had to revisit everything in detail.

746
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:27,810
Like I had not done
since it happened to me.

747
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,790
I had never gone to this depth of
reliving those experiences. Um,

748
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,020
yeah. And it, uh, it's tough
to think back on that. Um,

749
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,150
indeed,
when I was writing this,

750
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:42,720
I'd share some of the writing with my
wife when I come to bed late at night.

751
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,630
And after I got a few chapters into this,
I told her when I said, Melanie, what am,

752
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:49,240
what am I doing? This whole thing is
a series of unfortunate events, uh,

753
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,890
who's gonna want to read something like
this? And, uh, she told me, so bill,

754
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:55,830
I know the whole story. She said,
stick with it, finish this book.

755
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:59,160
Because I think that in it, uh,
there's, there's inspiration,

756
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:04,110
there's motivation for, for people. It's
not just your story, it can help others.

757
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,130
Uh, and so in that vein, I mean,

758
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,560
I say that because it is getting a little
emotional as we read through this and

759
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:15,330
that's fine. But I do hope that some of
this is useful and helpful for others.

760
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,440
And, uh, I grew up going
to church as a kid,

761
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:22,980
but I wasn't overly overly
religious guy. And, uh,

762
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,670
somewhere around college I could go
into church altogether and in the army,

763
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,520
the only time I can remember that I've
been going to church was from memorial

764
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,940
services for guys. And
that was about it. Uh,

765
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,020
but if you end up in a situation like
this or, or I would say any really,

766
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,920
if you think the situation in your life
is stressful and is about to overwhelm

767
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:45,790
you, uh, you need some help
beyond yourself. And, uh,
you know, no matter what you,

768
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,430
and I'm not selling any religion,

769
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,270
but I would say whatever your
religious beliefs are, uh,

770
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:55,350
you can find a lot of strength
and your God and, uh, get,

771
00:46:55,351 --> 00:46:58,110
get close to God and he'll help
you through it. And he certainly,

772
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:59,820
I couldn't have done this by myself.
I,

773
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,310
I grabbed a hold of that
duty that my mom gave me.

774
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,050
I also grabbed a hold of the 23rd psalm
and when stuff got really close to being

775
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:09,810
blown to smithereens a few
times later on in my captivity,

776
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,280
that 23rd psalm was going over and over
again in my mind too. So yeah, again,

777
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:17,280
not selling any religion, but whatever
your spirituality is your best.

778
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:20,460
Get comfortable with it if you're
going to be in dire straits like this.

779
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,460
Yeah. And it's, it's, it's interesting
that you're, you're saying, look,

780
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:30,310
I'm going to do everything I
can, but I'm need some. Yep. Yep.

781
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,750
And you know, certainly, you know, when
you, when you say that other people,

782
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,400
you know, we'll be able to find,
absolutely. I mean, just me reading this,

783
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:44,290
I've found all kinds of, not just
inspiration but practical guidance, which,

784
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,950
you know, one of the things you just
said is practical guidance on, you know,

785
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,170
someone that's been through
what you've been through.

786
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,530
There's so much that everybody else
can take away and learn from and yeah,

787
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,400
that's,
that's one of them right there.

788
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:04,170
Do what you can do everything that you
can and then have some faith on the

789
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,630
things that you can't control
are going to work out your way.

790
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,730
Yeah. And I think that's important too,
because I'm thinking now as we're talking,

791
00:48:10,731 --> 00:48:12,680
and I don't know if we're going
to get to that specific part in,

792
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,960
in the book or not. Uh,
but early on, I want to,

793
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:16,610
I think it was the first night I got beef,

794
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,700
52 strikes almost landing on top of me.

795
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,570
And I'm beginning to feel that,
am I going to survive this or not?

796
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,770
And I think the answer is I don't know.
But in that answer is,

797
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,250
I don't know. And so what I mean
that, that, that doesn't matter.

798
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:33,650
That's not important. I may
survive. I may not survive.

799
00:48:33,651 --> 00:48:35,360
I'm going to do all I can to survive.

800
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,720
So I got to the point where this fear of
being blown to smithereens kind of went

801
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:44,300
away. Uh, and I just settled into,

802
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,600
I'll either survive or I won't survive.
It's not, I can't worry about that.

803
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:52,601
All I can worry about is what can I do
to try and set the best conditions to

804
00:48:52,701 --> 00:48:55,790
make that survival possible. And,
uh, I either will or I won't.

805
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,440
Yeah. One of the similar thing that I
always felt was, you know, when I rack,

806
00:49:00,441 --> 00:49:03,940
one of the biggest threats
to us was iads and you,

807
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,060
they're random. They're going to hit
you or they're not going to hit you.

808
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,050
And when you, every time you
go outside the wire, there's,

809
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,770
there's a chance that it's your day.
And you know,

810
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:21,910
kind of what I told my guys and
the way I felt myself was, okay,

811
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,860
I know they're out there, we've done
everything we can to mitigate the risk.

812
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,610
We've done our planning, we'd done our
drills, we've gathered our intelligence,

813
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,300
there's nothing else we can do to control
it. So I'm not going to worry about it.

814
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,930
Right. And I've done everything
I can. Like you said, I've,

815
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,970
I've helped him at
myself as much as I can.

816
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,450
And then after that it's out of my hands.
And in the more you worry about it,

817
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,200
like you said, well it does.
It does. It really matter.

818
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:51,550
I can sit here and worry
about it, but doesn't matter.
Got It. Got To move forward.

819
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,563
Exactly.

820
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,090
Here's you,
you do a couple of days,

821
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:03,091
three days worth of evasion of the
enemy and now you're out hiding.

822
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,340
You hear some voices, you crouch down
your hide, you know their people.

823
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,950
And here we go back to the book.

824
00:50:11,951 --> 00:50:14,650
A lot of crashing around came
from the direction of the voices.

825
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:19,651
I looked up and saw a uniformed NVA
soldiers pointing AK 47 rifles at my head.

826
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,420
They Shriek, something in motion for
me to stand up. I did. I was captured.

827
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,400
I felt indescribably sick in the pit
of my stomach as the world fell away,

828
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,620
I'd been struggling for three days to
stay alive. I was in miserable shape,

829
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,780
but I had been free and I had options.
No more.

830
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,790
My soul was a washed with anguish.
I was no longer a free man.

831
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,860
In that instant, I'd become a captive
of the communist North Vietnamese army,

832
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,120
a prisoner of war,

833
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,560
another American POW in
the long Vietnam conflict.

834
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:03,670
I had no idea how long they might
let me live or if I was about to die.

835
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:13,410
A couple of them were shaking.
We stood in utter silence for a moment.

836
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,100
They glared at me.
I glared at them for that tense instant.

837
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,700
I didn't know if I'd be riddled
with bullets or be allowed to live.

838
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,230
One barked something at me.

839
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:25,890
I could not understand
another joint in than a third.

840
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,280
I looked right into their eyes.
I was an American.

841
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:34,320
I would show them the best
American fighting man that I could

842
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,850
in the pitiful state that
I was in. Um, you know,

843
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:46,080
that that's the best I could do
on describing capture it. It's,

844
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:51,140
it's impossible to really convey the
full feeling of losing your freedom and

845
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:56,520
being a captive. It's just
indescribable. Uh, but I, I did the,

846
00:51:56,521 --> 00:52:00,070
uh, the best that a, that I could,
I was in miserable shape. I mean,

847
00:52:00,071 --> 00:52:03,190
you read about the wounds that
I had. Uh, in addition to those,

848
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:07,660
I picked up some Leeches, uh, that
I've been plucking off on my body.

849
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,950
Uh, my, my face was covered with blood.
My three day growth, the heavy beard was,

850
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:15,310
was sticking through, uh, because
of my back injuries that a,

851
00:52:15,311 --> 00:52:19,120
I didn't even know that I got released
and I had badly broken my back. Uh,

852
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:23,020
I had no control of my bowels or bladder
for those three days, so I smelled.

853
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:27,430
I was just an awful mess. When those guys
captured me and took me up that hill,

854
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:35,460
they finally get you
to sort of like a camp,

855
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,910
sort of the first interrogation camper.
Yeah.

856
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,760
Yeah. What were the, I mean the
capture me, the jumbo so thick,

857
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:44,660
they were only a few yards away when I
stumbled upon them and then they, uh,

858
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,030
and they had been down a
stream filling canteens.

859
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:51,350
These five young guys at captured me and
they took me almost an equal distant up

860
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:54,500
a hill opposite and I
came into an open area,

861
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,610
still had the canopy of the triple canopy
jungle. Uh, but the bottom was all open.

862
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:02,570
There are hundreds of north Vietnamese
soldiers supplies defensive positions.

863
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:05,540
This was a major staging area
for this battle is taking place.

864
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,410
And as I was trying to get away from,
from the battle and get towards costume,

865
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:10,620
I stumbled right into there

866
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,553
staging area

867
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:17,050
and you start getting your,
you know,

868
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,370
start getting the soft interrogation
is what I put down here. A guy says,

869
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,800
you know, we found pictures of a pretty
later lady with your or your wallet,

870
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:29,490
obviously your family and you say,
yeah,

871
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,780
I know you miss them and are very worried
and they are very worried about you.

872
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,660
You follow the rules and
you will be home soon,

873
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,460
you'll receive humane and lenient
treatment, you will be allowed to go home.

874
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,820
And I put that in there cause that's a
refrain that we hear quite a bit humane

875
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,110
and leads.

876
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:51,450
That was, that was a refrain.
They would say it all the time.

877
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:53,870
And during my whole
captivity. Yeah, you do,

878
00:53:53,871 --> 00:53:55,640
you do what you're supposed
to do and cooperate.

879
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:59,030
You get the humane and lenient treatment.
Of course you

880
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:04,280
warrant fully cooperative at all with
them and what they're asking you.

881
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:06,680
So they're there.
They went from that idea.

882
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,170
So they start stepping it
up on you and you know,

883
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:12,560
here's an example of the things that they
say do you are a war criminal and the

884
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:17,000
Geneva Geneva agreements do not
apply to you. You have no rights.

885
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,240
But we will still give you the
deserved humane and lenient treatment.

886
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:25,230
All you have to do is cooperate with us
and acknowledge your crimes. Yep, Yep.

887
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,440
Yeah.

888
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,400
That goes back to your reading of the
code of conduct that started this off to

889
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,880
our code of conduct was
different. Uh, said we are,

890
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:39,170
we are bound to give only our name, rank,
service number and date of birth and,

891
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,870
and the, and the way that was
taught and the way we understood it,

892
00:54:41,871 --> 00:54:44,930
that was all we could give was name,
rank, service number, date of birth.

893
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:47,820
And if we gave anything
else, uh, we had uh,

894
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,580
we had caved in and we're cooperating
with the enemy. Uh, so that was my stance.

895
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,640
That was all I was going to give them
was my name, rank, service number,

896
00:54:55,641 --> 00:55:00,080
date of birth. Uh, you may get into some
of the things that that took place. Uh,

897
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:04,040
I would just like to comment that there
was nothing heroic going on at all.

898
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,720
I guess a couple things
that were going on.

899
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,980
I was trying to abide by the code of
conduct and I was in a state where I had

900
00:55:09,981 --> 00:55:13,370
been near death for days,
was very near death at that moment.

901
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,620
And was numb and just almost didn't care.

902
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,960
It's hard to understand and believe,
but almost didn't care at that point.

903
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,070
And then I got so angry and aggravated
with this son of a bitch that ended up

904
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:29,090
being my interrogator from his
initial soft sell, as you said, but,

905
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:30,650
but his first words,
he showed up,

906
00:55:30,651 --> 00:55:32,630
he was only guy had spoken
English since I was captured,

907
00:55:32,631 --> 00:55:35,960
started asked me about myself
by condition if I was hurt.

908
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,090
And so I opened up with
him about some of that.

909
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:42,830
But then when he got into what was clearly
a, an interrogation than I clammed up,

910
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,520
uh, W I would close these
comments now with, uh,

911
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:50,050
the fact that he didn't break
me in. That interrogation, uh,

912
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,530
speaks nothing to my heroism or
ability to resist interrogation.

913
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,770
Anyone can be broken. Uh, and if this
would have continued over time, uh,

914
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,650
you know, I'm, I'm sure that he could
have gotten me to do something, uh,

915
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,820
with his brutality.

916
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,580
Probably nothing that would have
given him any useful intelligence,

917
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:12,200
but he might've got made to
do, to do something. Yeah.
So I was for that. For that,

918
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,870
those moments on those days
or that initial interrogation,

919
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:19,310
I was able to stick with my name, rank,
service number, date of birth. Awesome.

920
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,150
Here,
here's an example of that is

921
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,710
back to the book here.
Please sign this.

922
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,400
He handed me one of the sheets of
paper and a pen. I looked at the paper.

923
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,130
It was typed in English.
As I began to read the words,

924
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,540
my interrogator interrupted.

925
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:38,800
This is simply a form that acknowledges
your status we needed so we can begin to

926
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:43,360
process you for release so we can send
word to your family of your status.

927
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,590
Please. Just signed. I read the words.
I could not believe what I was reading.

928
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,460
There was a blank fates place
for me to fill in my name.

929
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:55,270
The tech said that I was an American
war criminal who had been conducting an

930
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:58,990
illegal acts against the Vietnamese
people, including biocide,

931
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:03,790
genocide and eco side. I had dropped
fire bombs and chemical bombs.

932
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,880
I'd killed old men,
pregnant women and babies.

933
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:11,620
Biocide genocide, Eco
side. What a bunch of crap.

934
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,310
I raised my head and looked into his eyes.
No,

935
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,230
I will not sign this there.
I had spoken, you must.

936
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:24,370
I will not.
His agitation return now you must.

937
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:29,620
I glared at him. He got up and came at me.
He smacked me across the face. You must.

938
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,670
He turned to his sidekick
and spoke quietly and the
man got up at his direction.

939
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:39,730
Two Guards dragged me up against
a tree abroad trunk of a tree.

940
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,870
I've been bent over since the crash,
unable to stand erect.

941
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,740
They forced me up into a straight
sitting position and tied me to the tree.

942
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:52,420
It hurt like hell. I couldn't keep
my face from contorting in anguish.

943
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,800
Now you signed no more orders.

944
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,070
They pulled on the ropes to bring
my arms closer together behind me.

945
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,650
The pain in my back. Increased new pain
was introduced in my shoulder joints.

946
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,780
More demands to sign more refusals.
The ropes tightened further.

947
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,340
They move my elbows closer together.
More demands more refusals,

948
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,710
ropes ever tighter,
more pain.

949
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,340
I was uncontrollably
grimacing and cursing.

950
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,160
I would not sign.

951
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,550
I could never consider
signing anything like that.

952
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:33,010
The brutality made me angrier and
more firmly set against giving in.

953
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,000
I could have been broken and made
design eventually. There's no doubt.

954
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,980
No Man can resist forever,

955
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,240
but this interrogator would
not bring me to breaking point.

956
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,440
On that day,

957
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,970
his demands continued
and so did my refusals.

958
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,300
The ropes tightened more and
more pain scream through me.

959
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,090
My anger swelled against this asshole.

960
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,690
I began grunting in audible attack against
the agony the guards gave the ropes.

961
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:04,630
One huge last poll, which brought
my elbows together behind me.

962
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,060
I felt a pop as each shoulder.
Dislocated pain shot through my torso,

963
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,750
up my neck,
into my head and down my back,

964
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,510
through my groin and into my thighs.

965
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,980
I've never felt such pain.
My vision narrowed and I passed out.

966
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,530
Sign.
I could only grown and shake my head.

967
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,870
The interrogators scowled
angrily turned and left.

968
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,830
We're to continue on.

969
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,083
Okay,

970
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,980
this is a little bit further on and
he's saying that he's given you one last

971
00:59:52,001 --> 00:59:57,001
chance to sign this paper and
one last chance to cooperate.

972
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,733
Will you?

973
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:04,480
Going back to the book now my head hung
down partly and exhaustion and partly in

974
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:07,720
an intentional rudeness,
not paying him any attention.

975
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,580
I looked up when he finished,

976
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,230
I saw his sadistic minion standing a few
yards in front of me holding an AK 47

977
01:00:14,231 --> 01:00:17,140
at the ready.
Your last chance?

978
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:18,990
Yeah.

979
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,810
The assistant raised the
rifle and pointed it at me.

980
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,210
I stared ahead and said nothing.

981
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,780
No heroism was involved.

982
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:31,800
I was rung out at the end
of everything I had to give.

983
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,890
I had been so close to death for so long,

984
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,520
was so angry and so absolutely drained.

985
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,440
A faint spark was all I had left.
I felt numb,

986
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:47,700
detached from what was happening.
I was not resisting.

987
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,540
I was just giving into the flow
of whatever was destined to be.

988
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,990
That might be deaf.
It might not.

989
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,270
I had seen army training film at army
training film years before showing the

990
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:03,720
mock execution of a Korean War POW.

991
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,440
I remembered that scene.
The action of the trigger being pulled,

992
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:11,910
went over and over in my
mind. Click, click, Click Ben.

993
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,640
I flinched as a soldier, jerk the
trigger back, but nothing happened.

994
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,760
No shot,
no loud bang,

995
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,810
no bullet ripping my scholar chest,
nothing.

996
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,150
The soldier laughed.
My interrogator smiled.

997
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,130
I am done with you.
You will be taken away from here.

998
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,280
Yeah,
that was three days of,

999
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:41,060
yeah,

1000
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,290
there's three horrible days losing my
freedom, going through that interrogation,

1001
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,593
um,

1002
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,980
being thrown down into a pit
at night is where I stayed.

1003
01:01:50,981 --> 01:01:52,450
It was one of their old abandoned bunkers.

1004
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,950
We had about six inches of mud
and Goo in the bottom and uh,

1005
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,960
Eh, and that caused me a big psychological
issue that first night closed in that

1006
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,550
darkness that night.
Uh,

1007
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,650
I really had to fight to just keep
my cool down there with a bunch of,

1008
01:02:08,651 --> 01:02:11,890
there were centipedes and spiders
and rats and it was, it was a mess.

1009
01:02:11,891 --> 01:02:14,950
I'd spend the nights down there and
come up in the daytime for interrogation

1010
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:17,740
back down in that whole night's
backup for interrogation.

1011
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:22,741
So what we read cover to pray to three
days before he finally gave up on me and

1012
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,750
yeah, I had no idea what was
going to happen. I just, and
even thinking back on it,

1013
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:31,710
it's just going through all that
pretty much and just a numb state,

1014
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,940
um, with, with, with that treatment. Yeah.

1015
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:38,190
My shoulders today still
caused me problems.

1016
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:41,670
I had a son that ended up playing
football for University of Washington many

1017
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,520
years ago. He's going to
turn 50 years, uh, in April.

1018
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:46,410
So this was a number of years
ago. But yeah, in high school,

1019
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:49,650
like I throw about two passes and that
was it for my shoulders can't play.

1020
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,960
You can't play horseshoes or anything,
but uh,

1021
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,790
yeah.
You know,

1022
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:59,660
so it's something that
definitely I've experienced.

1023
01:02:59,661 --> 01:03:04,420
So doing these readings,
and I've talked about it before,

1024
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,770
that, you know, when I read
something in my head and it kind of,

1025
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,630
I go all of that,
that's powerful.

1026
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,490
But then when you read it aloud
and you hear it, it's just,

1027
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,530
it's even more, and it's the
same thing with, you know,

1028
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:20,860
I know I sent you Jody medics, the
podcast with Jody medical was on. Yeah.

1029
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:24,400
And he said the same thing. He, you
know, he said to me, he said, you know,

1030
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,430
when you're reading it,
it's like,

1031
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,550
it's like I'm hearing my own thoughts
or something. You know, it just, right.

1032
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,950
It just, it brought him back
and yeah, there's something,

1033
01:03:35,951 --> 01:03:39,370
there's something about that. It's
okay. It's like when it's, when it's,

1034
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,121
when you're reading it,

1035
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:45,121
it's sort of detached from reality or
it's one step further detached from

1036
01:03:45,461 --> 01:03:46,091
reality.
And,

1037
01:03:46,091 --> 01:03:50,920
and obviously sitting in
with Jodie sitting here with
you and knowing that this

1038
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:52,000
is you,
you know,

1039
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,290
one point that I make all the time
when I covered these historical books,

1040
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:00,370
I always remind people that, cause
you know, people in this day and age,

1041
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:03,220
we're used to seeing movies.
We're used to seeing, watching TV.

1042
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:06,670
And I always say that this guy that I'm
talking about, this is a person, you know,

1043
01:04:06,671 --> 01:04:10,030
this guy in World War II, this is a
person, this guy in world war one,

1044
01:04:10,031 --> 01:04:15,031
this is a man and sort of have you
sitting here knowing that this is you.

1045
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,070
It's, it's, I don't even know
what to say to describe it.

1046
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:27,260
Well thanks Jack O and this, this has
become an emotional experience for me,

1047
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:31,250
but it's important and I think this
is going to be an important podcast.

1048
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,940
I wrote that book. I finished
it. It was published last April.

1049
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:36,370
Yeah.

1050
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:40,330
I've not read that book
since it was published. Uh,

1051
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:44,410
I mean it was something to go through and
relive all that to get it written. And,

1052
01:04:44,411 --> 01:04:46,570
uh, and so it's been
almost a year. I haven't,

1053
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,950
I haven't read the book so we're going
into, into, into detail. But, uh, this is,

1054
01:04:50,951 --> 01:04:51,784
this is good.

1055
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,653
So

1056
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,210
do you get turned over to some other,
some other guards?

1057
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,570
Bright and they start
taking you on a walk.

1058
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,950
You're walking to somewhere
else in urine. I, you know,

1059
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:12,110
you talked about the conditioner.
You, by the way, you have a broken,

1060
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:13,820
crushed vertebrae at this point,

1061
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:18,250
so badly, badly broken back. Uh,
yeah. Vertebrae is about completely

1062
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,830
crush damage to two other verbiage.

1063
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,270
Your leg swollen and you got all
kinds of shoe and now you're,

1064
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,450
now you've got to walk. And so I'm
going out with know that. Yeah,

1065
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:29,290
they gave me my boots back after those
three days. Materialization, no socks,

1066
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:31,480
no laces. Boots. Bare
feet. Okay, go ahead.

1067
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,520
We had a old Vietnam seal when I got to
seal team one in 1990 and he would run

1068
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:43,900
barefoot all the time.
And you know, one day was,

1069
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:47,770
hey, hey sir, why you, you know,
why you run barefoot? And he says,

1070
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,190
the first thing that goofs do, you take
your shoes, got to have a hard feat.

1071
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:54,700
I was like, okay, I guess I'm
running barefoot now. I was thinking,

1072
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,630
because when I showed up at CLT one,
I always joke about this,

1073
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:02,230
I thought I was going to the Vietnam
War in 1991 when I got there, I thought,

1074
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,710
I'm going to Vietnam now. You
know, I was that how you were?

1075
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,840
But I was a little off,
you know, historically.

1076
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,100
So that's the situation you're in.
Going back to the book,

1077
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,560
they'd been saying a phrase.
So as you're marching with these guys,

1078
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:17,050
they've been saying a phrase for the
past two days that I couldn't understand.

1079
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:19,810
I thought it was Vietnamese Gacaca die.

1080
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,750
As we pushed up the road,

1081
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:27,220
they walked behind me poking their
rifle barrels into my kidneys,

1082
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:31,550
my ribs shouting with increasing urgency,
go cook with [inaudible].

1083
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:37,060
And then after a while, for the first
time, I understood what they were saying,

1084
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,040
go quick or die. They had been
taught one short phrase in English.

1085
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:46,000
It was all they knew and
they had pronounced it so
poorly that it took me two

1086
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:49,360
days to figure it out.
I moved as fast as I could,

1087
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,220
but I was at the end of everything I had.
I struggled on and you don't.

1088
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:55,270
I'm just noticing this.

1089
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,980
You're going to reach the end of
everything you've had. I mean,

1090
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:03,710
you already were there many times.
You're going to reach the again,

1091
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:05,660
you just reached it. It's, it's

1092
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,100
okay.

1093
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,400
Incredible.
It's an amazing thing about human beings.

1094
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,810
What we have inside that we can
dig down and grab a hold of one.

1095
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:17,270
We have two that we don't think
we ever could have done it,

1096
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:20,810
but it's there and here is
something that helps you.

1097
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,341
Back to the book.

1098
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:27,341
I found myself mentally reciting what
I could recall of the 23rd psalm.

1099
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,400
I repeated one line over
and over in my head.

1100
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,090
Yea though I walk through the
Valley of the shadow of death,

1101
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,630
I will fear no evil for thou art with me.

1102
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,960
That wasn't the only time during my
captivity that the 23rd psalm came to my

1103
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:46,670
lips.
Nope.

1104
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,693
Okay.

1105
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:55,470
After it in,

1106
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,500
please forgive me for like I already
covered three days of misery.

1107
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:05,880
Now we're talking about,
and I'm doing it in three minutes

1108
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,520
now you've walked for multiple days
suffering the whole time and I'm going to

1109
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:16,460
fast forward through it and I'm
sorry and no, it's fine. I mean,

1110
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,240
that's why people need to read
by the book. That's all there.

1111
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,550
So you arrive at a camp.
Now we arrived back to the book.

1112
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,620
We stopped in front of one
cage and the door opened.

1113
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:31,520
A guard pushed me in and I stumbled over
someone lying inside and fell tumbling

1114
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:33,380
into the ground.
Pain shot through me.

1115
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,750
The cage was about 12 feet
wide and 20 feet or so long.

1116
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,440
I could not have been
more than four feet high.

1117
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:47,210
26 prisoners were stuffed inside
all south Vietnamese soldiers.

1118
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:50,630
Heat hung in the cage,
heavy and stale.

1119
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,360
The air smelled of
filth and putrid wounds.

1120
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,210
People moaned in a constant doe rumble.

1121
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,780
The occasional whale was met with sharp
chachas and guard guarded whispers.

1122
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,340
The doorway was shut and secured.

1123
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:08,840
I lay there thankful I'd survive
the journey of the past three days.

1124
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:11,000
What would become of me now.

1125
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,860
Yeah. That was my first, that
was my first prison camp. Uh,

1126
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,990
the jungle camp was in the jumble figure
somewhere in northern Cambodia where

1127
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:27,450
the US was not operating
anymore and it was a, a camp of,

1128
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:29,980
of many cages are about
300 prisoners in that camp.

1129
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:33,460
All South Vietnamese that have been
captured in this offensive one other

1130
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:37,390
American who I would meet later. And
uh, yeah, putting one of those cages

1131
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:43,800
back to the book. My broken back
screamed every time I tried to lay down,

1132
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:49,500
try to lie down with my feet
in the stocks. So they'd
put your feet into stocks,

1133
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:53,940
wooden bamboo stocks.
There was no way I could lay on my side.

1134
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,290
I couldn't lay straight back.
So I sat upright in the dark in agony.

1135
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:04,230
I thought of my family, fought of my
day of where I'd been, where I was now,

1136
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,670
and what might lie ahead.
I heard badly still,

1137
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:13,680
I had hope I can live this way.
I can do this.

1138
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:16,620
I can survive,
I will survive.

1139
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,600
I sat there, thoughts drifting
across the landscape of my life,

1140
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,480
shaped by these
extraordinary circumstances.

1141
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,890
Eventually I fell asleep
sitting up right that night,

1142
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:33,210
dreaming of what might become of me.
I jolted awake,

1143
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,340
something scampered across my legs.
Something was on my feet, something small,

1144
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:42,000
cool and wet.
Touched my arches and souls.

1145
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,400
Little rat noses poked and sniffed
at my feet. Tiny teeth nod,

1146
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:52,050
my pulverized, raw flesh. My
arms swung without command.

1147
01:10:52,051 --> 01:10:55,440
As I batted a large rat off my lap.

1148
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:00,630
Others scurried away. I screamed
inside. Lips pressed tightly shut,

1149
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:05,250
a muffled. The Shriek of terror.
I thrashed my legs, flailed,

1150
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,300
but went nowhere.

1151
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,830
I wiggled my feet as well as I could
in the socks and got the rats off.

1152
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:14,550
They fled into the night only
to when I fell back asleep,

1153
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,650
they would return to torment me nearly
every night in that jungle prison.

1154
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,950
Yeah. I don't like rats this day. Uh,

1155
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,470
some of my kids just to mess with me.
I'll just bring up rats. As I mentioned,

1156
01:11:30,471 --> 01:11:33,290
a rat's I hate. I hate rats
from, from that experience.

1157
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:38,090
And that's not the beginning or the end
of the rat experiences and in prison.

1158
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,790
One thing that you did mention though
that I'd like to highlight is, is hope.

1159
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,090
Uh, there was a phrase in there that
I wasn't going to give up. Hope.

1160
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:52,490
Hope is such a powerful thing.
Uh, it's there for all of us. Uh,

1161
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:57,170
we just need to grab a hold
of it and hold it tightly. Uh,

1162
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,520
hope was all I had for much
of my time in captivity,

1163
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,890
a hope of, of, uh,

1164
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:08,891
of surviving a and in that survival
of getting back to my two young kids,

1165
01:12:09,321 --> 01:12:14,090
those two kids really played
such a role in having me survive.

1166
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,750
My son, when I went over there
was a four and a half years old.

1167
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,980
The over for my daughter was newborn.
Uh, but when things would get really,

1168
01:12:21,981 --> 01:12:26,780
really tough, I think of
those kids and however bad it
was, I had to endure it, uh,

1169
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,380
to do my best to survive and,
and get home to those kids.

1170
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,793
Okay.

1171
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,090
Yeah. The, the I, I definitely,

1172
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:38,720
that's one of the things that I
specifically highlighted, you know, was,

1173
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:43,700
I can live this way. I can do this.
I can survive. I will survive.

1174
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,540
I still, I had hope. Yeah,

1175
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,700
and I read it just the way you just
explained it. It hit me that hard.

1176
01:12:56,080 --> 01:13:00,010
Back to the book. We sat for a
few more hours. My cage mates,

1177
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,790
all Vietnamese soldiers
appear to rag tag crew.

1178
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:08,080
Almost everyone had been wounded,
some gravely filth covered there.

1179
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:12,310
Tattered uniforms. The whole place
stunk of sweat, blood, infection,

1180
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:16,150
feces and urine.
We were all hurting and some would dye.

1181
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,580
Some cautiously whisper to their neighbor.

1182
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:23,170
Most like me just sat and stared.
That's what I did.

1183
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:26,410
I sat and stared at them
sitting and staring at nothing.

1184
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,900
I wondered if I would go crazy here,
would I die here? What would happen first?

1185
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,820
Insanity or death.

1186
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:34,700
Yeah.

1187
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:38,120
I snapped back to what little
grasp by hat on reality.

1188
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,300
Hold it together.
Focus.

1189
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,550
Spence and Vicky will hike. We'll
play. Get back home for those kids.

1190
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,680
You can do it.
You can endure.

1191
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:50,140
Yeah.

1192
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,870
I couldn't allow my thoughts
to drift and dark directions.

1193
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:58,060
I forced myself into logical,
structured thinking.

1194
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:01,670
I began planning a hiking
trip with my family, uh,

1195
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:05,170
bactrim backing trip into the woods.
I plan the route,

1196
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:07,330
the equipment loads for each.

1197
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:12,100
They'd be Featherlite for Vicky a little
more for Spence. Amy. I'd carry most

1198
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,450
of it. We'd eat dehydrated food,
cooked around a small campfire.

1199
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,210
Delicious.
I'll tell you.

1200
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,820
Dehydrated food then sounded
awfully, awfully. Yeah, that was,

1201
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:29,050
that was a gourmet meal.
And, and I did that.

1202
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,800
I got back from my captivity.
I spent some men,

1203
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,050
maybe we'll go into this later
and I won't get all the details of

1204
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:36,730
hospitalization and medical and all that.

1205
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:40,540
But when I got released from
the hospital finally, uh,

1206
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,590
took my family on vacation and he guesses
on what the first thing I did on that

1207
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:46,750
vacation,
tell me,

1208
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:52,360
drove to the Olympic peninsula and took my
family backpacking. Uh, your heart, man.

1209
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:56,260
I love and I'm glad that I did.
I mean,

1210
01:14:56,261 --> 01:15:00,670
I always enjoyed the wilderness in the
woods and would've been a much worse

1211
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:03,850
shape in captivity if I, if I
hadn't. Uh, but since then, I've,

1212
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:07,840
I've loved the wilderness in the woods
even more. I mean, I love every day,

1213
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:11,620
every beautiful day on God's green earth,
but loved the wilderness in the woods.

1214
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:13,020
We were assigned a Panama for a time.

1215
01:15:13,021 --> 01:15:16,650
I don't know if you've been down there and
general school. And when, one thing, my,

1216
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,800
my older son, the little four and a half
year old boy was a, was an adult by then,

1217
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,840
uh, we backpacked, well,

1218
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:25,930
we did a three day journey across the
isthmus of Panama somewhere where nobody

1219
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:30,030
ever did. We just pick some place, went
from the Atlantic or the Pacific side. Uh,

1220
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,390
we did mountain bikes first,

1221
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:36,010
then we backpacked staying in the jungle
and until we got to the Rio Indio, uh,

1222
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:36,940
and it was dry season,

1223
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:40,090
winter planted very well cause we had
to hike way down the Rio Indio before

1224
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,800
there was enough water
to hire a guy in a car.

1225
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:45,160
You get canoe to take us out to
the ocean. So I, you know, even,

1226
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,670
and that was just before my retirement,
but I, I've always loved the wilderness,

1227
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:52,030
love the jungle. And, uh, yeah, I don't
know how we got on that thing, but okay.

1228
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:55,570
Back back to the book. Well
that's awesome. And one of
the things that I, again,

1229
01:15:55,571 --> 01:16:00,560
I specifically highlighted was
the fact that you know, you, you,

1230
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,720
you would be drifting in these dark
directions and you would force yourself.

1231
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,130
And I talk about that too. You know, I, I
say mind control, not mind control. Like,

1232
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,760
Hey, we're going to control your
mind. Control your own mind. Yeah.

1233
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,220
And put your own thoughts in there.
Yup.

1234
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,540
You can do that and people just need
to learn how to do it instead of we,

1235
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:19,930
you start drifting off in the wrong
direction, control your thoughts,

1236
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:20,970
get mind control.

1237
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:25,971
And I love the fact that you did that we
such with such authority and power over

1238
01:16:26,591 --> 01:16:30,460
what, over what your
brain was thinking. Yeah.

1239
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:33,580
I think that's an important message.
And I was a much overused phrase.

1240
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:38,510
Are you a half glass, half empty or
glass half full kind of guy? Uh, I,

1241
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:43,511
I really would advocate for you have
to be a glass half full kind of guy to

1242
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:47,080
survive. And I think I might
carry that argument further.

1243
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:49,120
If you want to have a
happy, full, enjoyable life,

1244
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:53,290
you'd damn well better be a half glass
full kind of person. Uh, if you're,

1245
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,960
if I mean there's enough problems
and difficulties in life,

1246
01:16:55,961 --> 01:17:00,010
if you want to go for the dark side,
it's, it's there. You can go to it. Uh,

1247
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:03,930
but there's enough positive,
wonderful things. Uh, the, yeah,

1248
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:07,720
grab that beat of hope and,
and go for it. Absolutely.

1249
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,040
Back into the

1250
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,330
camp and back to the book,

1251
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:14,540
the camp provided a miserable
existence on the edge of madness.

1252
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:18,200
All was filth and disease and suffering.

1253
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:23,540
Moans and whales of pain and anguish
cried from the enclosures as we walked by,

1254
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:28,250
I caught glimpses of sick and wounded
men inside cage after cage, their eyes,

1255
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,230
white orbs of desperation,

1256
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:35,060
peering from grimy faces through
the din of the gray world inside

1257
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,730
and now you're back in
the stocks sitting there,

1258
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:46,260
wounded in stocks and a bamboo cage and
an unknown jungle prison camp with death

1259
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:50,430
all around me. I began to wonder,
how long can I endure this?

1260
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:56,070
Then my voice said out loud.
As long as it takes.

1261
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,913
Yeah.

1262
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:02,303
Incredible.

1263
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:08,740
And here you meet that and in this
prison Cape you meet Wayne. Wayne.

1264
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:09,720
Wait, finished. Yeah.

1265
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:14,300
The other American who was held prisoner
already been captured march, April, May,

1266
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,680
a couple months before me.

1267
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:19,270
And you,
Wayne,

1268
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,890
the crew now you're going to
get put on a long march. The,

1269
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,600
they say we're going to move
you out of this prison camp.

1270
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,830
Do you know you're going to Hanoi?

1271
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:28,920
No, no. They, they, they put,

1272
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:32,370
they pulled me out of my cage and I found
myself in the center of the camp with

1273
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:37,320
a group of 25 south Vietnamese
prisoners. Uh, I think they were all,

1274
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,560
they were all officers,
uh, myself and Wayne. Uh,

1275
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:43,590
and they told us they were going
to move us to a new camp and the,

1276
01:18:43,591 --> 01:18:44,980
and the communist camp commander,

1277
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,430
it was running at the mouth and one
of the South Vietnamese officers was

1278
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:50,690
translating for us, but they're
going to move us to a new camp. Uh,

1279
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,460
work conditions would, we'd be up,
would be better. I mean, in this camp,

1280
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:57,630
people were dying almost every,
every day. Uh, conditions be better.

1281
01:18:57,631 --> 01:19:00,840
We get medical care, we'd
get letters from home. Uh,

1282
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,610
but we have very difficult journey.

1283
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:07,790
It could last for as long as 11 days
and we should try very hard to make it.

1284
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,720
That's what we were told.
Now the tribe very hard.

1285
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:13,890
The 11 days I guess was registering
in my mind that try very hard to make,

1286
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:17,550
it really didn't fully register
until we actually set out marching.

1287
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,570
By this time my ankle wound was very
infected. My leg was very swollen.

1288
01:19:21,571 --> 01:19:25,080
It was so painful just to take a step.
And you know,

1289
01:19:25,081 --> 01:19:29,250
I was having to take step after step
after step. And as I got into that March,

1290
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:31,290
I was wondering how I was going
to get through the first day.

1291
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,310
I didn't think I could do it.

1292
01:19:32,311 --> 01:19:36,990
I didn't know how I could possibly
walk for a day through the jungle. Uh,

1293
01:19:36,991 --> 01:19:39,820
they, uh, they had as
tied loosely together, uh,

1294
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,140
had our arms tied Lusa behind our backs,
no shoes as time.

1295
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:45,850
This was barefoot and off we went.
Uh,

1296
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:49,350
somehow I made it through that
first day and the day after that.

1297
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,320
Yeah.

1298
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,430
And the day after that,

1299
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:57,060
the trip turned out to be not 11 days
to a new camp somewhere in Cambodia or

1300
01:19:57,101 --> 01:20:02,050
even Laos or back into Vietnam.
That trip took over three months.

1301
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,750
Uh, and I did end up in Hanoi
at the end of that trip. Uh,

1302
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:08,220
that journey cost the lives

1303
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,840
of a, of six of the south
Vietnamese prisoners in Wayne.

1304
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:16,140
The other American died,
uh, before we got to Hanoi.

1305
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:21,060
And I damn near died a number of
times and that's all in the book.

1306
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:26,040
But by the grace of God, I survived and
made it and got all the way to Hawaii.

1307
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,370
He also

1308
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:35,610
got to know some of the Vietnamese
south Vietnamese soldiers, one of them,

1309
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:40,200
Lieutenant Dwayne Dean
Zan. Is that right? Yeah.

1310
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:43,200
That's very good son, son, son.

1311
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:47,120
And he was, you know, obviously you,

1312
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:51,150
you formed a really good relationship
with him. Yes. Here we go.

1313
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:54,870
Back to the book we charge. Yes. Let me
interject one. Let me interject one thing.

1314
01:20:54,871 --> 01:20:58,770
Cause this is fascinating to me.
It's always been why are,

1315
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:00,870
well I'll come back to it.

1316
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:02,370
Let me see where you're going
to go with the conversation.

1317
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,700
You're going to get to my relationship
with him and yeah. Okay, good. Yeah,

1318
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,593
absolutely.

1319
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,850
We trudged out of the valley
up on to a rising ridge line.

1320
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,500
There wasn't much talking. When we
began to climb up with steep long trail,

1321
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:17,670
I was already exhausted.

1322
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:21,300
I had to push hard to make every step
my swollen infected ankle throbbed with

1323
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:25,110
pain. I wondered, is anyone
else having this much trouble?

1324
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,030
How long am I be able to keep going?

1325
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:32,510
Only then did the words of the lead guard
really hit me as long as 11 days try

1326
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:37,950
very hard to make it my being revolted.

1327
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:41,280
My being revolted.
11 days of this,

1328
01:21:41,281 --> 01:21:45,360
how the hell am I going to be able to
do that in two seconds? I answered.

1329
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:51,110
Got To as long as it takes
reach down deep gotta go.

1330
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,400
Keep going. God helped
me. Wayne was stoic.

1331
01:21:56,401 --> 01:22:00,210
He was in better shape than I was,
but still it had to be tough for him.

1332
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,840
He just bore down and put out
what was needed to keep on going.

1333
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:08,340
Some of the other person's nurse did
as well. Many like me had trouble,

1334
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,840
a number of complained and a few cried.
Other prisoners paraded them.

1335
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:17,160
A couple of them fell down and whimpered
and the guards yelled at them slapping,

1336
01:22:17,161 --> 01:22:20,790
kicking and hitting them with
rifle butts until they got up.

1337
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,180
I thought this is going
to be a long 11 days

1338
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,800
and this is just continuing
way past 11 days.

1339
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:36,330
You're now just beyond that. Continuing
with the story. As the days continued,

1340
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:41,340
I became weaker and lost weight.
Fevers followed waves of shivering.

1341
01:22:41,341 --> 01:22:45,720
Chills might be malaria.
I suffered from diarrhea,

1342
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:49,980
probably dysentery.
My festering ankle wound hurt more.

1343
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:54,450
The swelling grew worse, aggravated
by the journey. Leeches plagued me,

1344
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:59,280
sucking my blood and adding infections of
their own. My right leg became a heavy,

1345
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:01,770
painful mass that I
dragged along the trail.

1346
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,070
I must've been a site though.
My Moo wounds placed me in a worst

1347
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,010
situation.
Wayne was sick and deteriorating too.

1348
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:12,640
He had some sort of jungle
fever and lost his appetite.

1349
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:17,320
He quit eating regular rice preferred
only the crispy layer that formed right

1350
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:18,970
next to the surface,
the cooking pot.

1351
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,240
What the Vietnamese called
Calm Che or Fireeye's.

1352
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:26,650
Zhan was having troubles to
injuries from his shoot down,

1353
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,810
declined from months in captivity,

1354
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:33,190
poor diet disease than the daily
toll of this horrendous marsh north.

1355
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:35,800
Every step of the way,

1356
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:40,510
our personal demons threatened our
physical ability and mental willingness to

1357
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:43,630
press on.
Everyone suffered.

1358
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,090
We look like the walking dead struggling
to survive each agonizing mile of that

1359
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:49,924
march.

1360
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:54,340
Most of us stoically face
the challenges that beset us.

1361
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:59,020
Sometimes selfishness and self
pity erupted and tempers flared.

1362
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:01,570
Pain and suffering took its toll.

1363
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:07,680
The senior ranking prisoner and our group
was Pham Van thousand a major in the

1364
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:08,910
South Vietnamese army.

1365
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:13,860
He tried his best to be a leader for
the 25 south Vietnamese officers and two

1366
01:24:13,861 --> 01:24:17,070
American helicopter pilots under
the most trying conditions.

1367
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,710
The enemy gave him no authority to lead.

1368
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,890
I had a lot of respect
for what Tom tried to do.

1369
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:28,110
I felt the frustration he had to endure.
Morale sunk lower and lower.

1370
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,820
Bickering grew rampant.
Prisoners died. Don was senior,

1371
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:36,720
but most dismissed his efforts
as they struggled to survive.

1372
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:38,400
Okay.

1373
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,740
And now there's a prisoner
that goes down on the trail.

1374
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,220
The guards yelled back
and forth at each other.

1375
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,380
They ranted at the prisoner
lying on the ground.

1376
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:50,010
They barked orders to the rest of us.
I didn't understand any of it.

1377
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,110
Zhan said softly, but earnestly to
Wayne in me. Keep walking. No stop.

1378
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,910
We continued. One guard stayed with
the prostate prisoner where he lay,

1379
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:03,960
we walked on after a short while,

1380
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:05,883
Bang,

1381
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:11,830
one shot. Sometime later,
the guard guard caught up.

1382
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,580
Adult sense of disbelief
and shock overcame me.

1383
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:18,520
I had no doubt what had just happened.

1384
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:24,820
I kept walking as I cried.
It was clear.

1385
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,640
If you could not march,

1386
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:29,963
you would die.

1387
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:36,740
Yeah. And that message really
settled into my mind at that point.

1388
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,940
And I knew if I ever got to the
point where I couldn't march anymore,

1389
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:42,620
that would probably happen to me as well.

1390
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:47,730
The aside that I wanted to
say about sung, uh, was,

1391
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,470
and it was mentioned song was a
Vietnamese air force pilot. Uh,

1392
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:57,590
he was young and strong and in my mind
he was a lot bigger than he was because

1393
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,060
he's still a short statured Vietnamese.

1394
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,200
He was the [inaudible] pilot that I saw
shot down on my way to Ben hit that I

1395
01:26:07,711 --> 01:26:10,470
asked for permission to go help rescue.
Yeah.

1396
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,940
We put that together shortly after
we started that March north of,

1397
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,240
you know what he was flying where he was
when he was shot down. I said, my God,

1398
01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:20,590
we were shot down the same day.
Yeah.

1399
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:21,530
Yeah.
And that's why,

1400
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:24,970
that's one of the reasons I included
that piece because that was such a,

1401
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:29,330
such a coincidence or
fate that you guys were,

1402
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:31,200
that was in there.
You were,

1403
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,810
and he turned out to be such a
good friend and I, oh my. Well,

1404
01:26:34,811 --> 01:26:38,050
I owe my life to several
people. Wayne Finch, uh,

1405
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:41,080
[inaudible] especially
for what he did for me,

1406
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:48,580
back to the book, the journey
was a nightmare, a horrid
soul wrenching nightmare.

1407
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,290
It grew worse.

1408
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:54,250
Others fell out and died each step
everyday racked my body with pain.

1409
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:57,790
My infections became worse.
Disease was taking me.

1410
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,530
I knew I was sliding closer to death,

1411
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:05,160
but I kept fighting as hard as
I could to keep my spirits up.

1412
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:06,480
I continually thought,

1413
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:10,230
continuously thought of my family of
things I would do with Spencer and Vicky

1414
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:14,490
when I got home. Thinking of
those two kids gave me strength,

1415
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:16,440
always bolstered my hope.

1416
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,370
My leg was now swollen
to twice its normal size.

1417
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,130
Dark colored filled with pos,

1418
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:28,490
long splits formed in the skin plus and
bloody stinking fluid oozed from the

1419
01:27:28,801 --> 01:27:32,580
cracks.
I dragged it along like a sodden club.

1420
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:34,013
Every movement,

1421
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:37,710
every movement lashed me with searing
pain that kept my face contorted.

1422
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:43,050
I shrieked a silent cry within
pain burden to black and scarred.

1423
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,880
Deep in the center of my soul.

1424
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:50,580
Gangrene set in my bloody
dysentery worsened.

1425
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,250
I had chills and fevers.

1426
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,880
I would find out later that I had
three different kinds of malaria

1427
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:01,400
each morning I fought a battle to stand

1428
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:05,180
and with all that going on,

1429
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,570
I tried to maintain a sense of humor.
It was hard,

1430
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:16,220
but it was necessary. Spirit is the
most important factor in survival.

1431
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,140
A sense of human humor,

1432
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,210
even under the worst conditions helps
maintain spirit and in spirit lives.

1433
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:27,530
Hope I was determined to survive.
Still,

1434
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,360
I owed so much to Wayne and Zam.

1435
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:33,980
They helped me during the through the
worst and we're always concerned about me.

1436
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:35,750
They did all they could to help me.

1437
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:39,170
Zhan especially helped me
remain positive to be hopeful,

1438
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,850
as bad as things ever got.
I never gave up hope.

1439
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,650
I mustered all my will
each day just to wake,

1440
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,480
stand and take a step.

1441
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:54,140
Then I fought hard for the
remainder of the day to keep going.

1442
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,550
Moving along the trail, I could
barely walk, but somehow I did.

1443
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:03,390
I survived each day to open my eyes in
the morning to the gift of one more dawn.

1444
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:09,300
The realities of my miserable world,
we're clear DEF are constant.

1445
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:10,680
Companions stalked us,

1446
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:15,000
waiting for us to give into
its relentless temptation.

1447
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,340
That would be the easy thing to do.
In normal life,

1448
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,640
you have to take some overt action to die.

1449
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:28,160
You have to kill yourself
as a prisoner of war.

1450
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:31,490
Under these circumstances
that is reversed.

1451
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,600
You have to reach deep within yourself
and struggle each day to stay alive.

1452
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,960
Dying is easy.
Just relax,

1453
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,150
do nothing,
give up and peacefully surrender,

1454
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,850
stop gagging down food, stop
struggling to walk, stop fighting,

1455
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,680
then you will die.

1456
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,853
Many did.

1457
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:08,960
So that's an incredible paradox
that you point out there.

1458
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:13,740
Yeah. But it's, it's something that
I, that I saw because it is, I mean,

1459
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:17,100
if you give up then you just die.

1460
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:18,780
You stop eating and you die.

1461
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,850
It's hard to stay alive and you need
something to motivate you to stay alive.

1462
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:28,260
And I had it. I mean, I can't talk enough
about those two kids and when they,

1463
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:31,230
when they listen to
this, uh, yeah, it's uh,

1464
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,330
it's often hard to keep from
getting very emotional, but uh,

1465
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:39,410
those two little kids are probably the
single most important reason that I,

1466
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:43,980
that I survived along with a lot of other,

1467
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,780
other things that helped you
in that little four years.

1468
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:53,700
Four and a half year old boy will
celebrate his 50th birthday in April

1469
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,950
and you'll be there with them.
I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

1470
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,553
Okay.

1471
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:04,030
I think we're getting
to the low point here.

1472
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:06,910
The worst day of my life came
a few weeks into this trip.

1473
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,000
I fought hard to continue the march,
but I faltered.

1474
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,580
I dug deep inside myself for strength.

1475
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:16,340
There was nothing there.
I dug deep.

1476
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,970
I staggered on and faltered again.
I struggled more.

1477
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,270
I reach deeper,
yet I prayed for more strength.

1478
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:26,663
There was none.

1479
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,200
Yeah,

1480
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,620
I collapsed.
I got up and stumbled along.

1481
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:35,940
I collapsed again and again and I
got up again and again. I fought,

1482
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,180
fought with all I had in my body,
heart and soul.

1483
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:46,200
I collapsed and couldn't get up.
I could not. We'll myself up.

1484
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:51,460
I was at the end of my life.
The guard looked down on me.

1485
01:31:51,461 --> 01:31:54,580
He ordered me up. He
yelled at me. I could not.

1486
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,243
It was done.

1487
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:02,230
I knew my life was here on this miserable,

1488
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:05,860
muddy jungle trail.
It was over.

1489
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:07,830
Okay.

1490
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:10,530
Would my family ever know
what had happened to me?

1491
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:16,470
Then? Zhan was there looking,
worried, bending over me.

1492
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:20,700
The guard yelled at him to stop.
Undeterred Zhan reached down to help me.

1493
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:25,110
The guard yelled louder, but zones
face was set with the termination.

1494
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:29,910
In spite of whatever threats the guard
was screaming. Zhan raised me up,

1495
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:33,090
turned and pulled me
onto his frail weak back.

1496
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,310
He wrapped my arms around his neck and
class my risk together in front of him

1497
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:44,040
the rest of the day. He pulled me along
my feet dragging on the ground behind.

1498
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,610
Part of the time he was
helped by Lieutenant Hoang,

1499
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,930
knowingly a big ambitious
brute helped briefly,

1500
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:54,870
but it was on on who
carried the burden that day.

1501
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:59,580
It was on who risked his own
life to lift me from def.

1502
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:05,810
It was on who carried me and cared for
me until we completed that long days

1503
01:33:06,841 --> 01:33:09,960
struggle had another wayside camp.

1504
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:17,280
Yeah, I definitely owe him my
life. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1505
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:25,750
You end up falling into a river as well.
Yeah.

1506
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:29,220
That's the next day when we tried to
set out and I couldn't get back up.

1507
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:34,221
I remember my ankle wound was so infected
I could barely move that leg and yeah,

1508
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:38,500
three kinds of malaria dysentery.
Then three kinds of intestinal parasites,

1509
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:42,880
malabsorption syndrome. I
was just a bad, bad way.

1510
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:45,043
Okay.

1511
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,280
You fall into this river back to the book.

1512
01:33:47,281 --> 01:33:51,690
Zohn and Wayne came off the log and
down behind Steepbank to my rescue.

1513
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:53,180
They waded into the turret,

1514
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:57,030
pulled me back onto the bank with
Wayne shouting in English and on and

1515
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:57,571
Vietnamese.

1516
01:33:57,571 --> 01:34:00,690
They pleaded for the group to stay at the
camp until I was able to travel again.

1517
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:04,140
They were ordered away.
They wouldn't leave me.

1518
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:08,490
Guards dragged them away and force
them across the log bridge at gunpoint.

1519
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:11,490
They marched off with the
rest of our prisoner group.

1520
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:14,490
Everyone believed I was left at that camp,
the die.

1521
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:20,400
So you get left by that group? I do. And

1522
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,800
you go to another camp where they
kind of let you recover a little bit?

1523
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,021
Yeah.

1524
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:29,440
Well I actually stayed in that camp and
for some reason the decision was because

1525
01:34:29,441 --> 01:34:34,330
I hadn't had any medical treatment to
that point at all for, for for months. Uh,

1526
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:37,570
and at that camp with me laid up there,

1527
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:41,770
they've got the camp medic and came
over and I got some shots of penicillin.

1528
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,300
Uh, I, I guess the only reason for this,

1529
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:49,180
the decision was we were along the trail
and head north and they wanted to get

1530
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:50,620
me to annoy if at all possible.

1531
01:34:50,621 --> 01:34:55,621
So they did give me penicillin shots for
about five days running and as soon as

1532
01:34:56,021 --> 01:35:00,030
I could stand up again and put any
weight on my leg at all, then off,

1533
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:04,100
off we went back on the trail and
now you're on the trail to be,

1534
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:05,570
you were the one guard at this point,

1535
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:09,650
1,000,001 guard going
north yet suit duties.

1536
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:13,910
You too,
and you're again,

1537
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:14,960
you're hiking again,

1538
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:19,910
challenging terrain and
going back to the book,

1539
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:24,200
we continue day after day after miserable
day, the journey was taking its toll,

1540
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,570
stretching my will to press on again.

1541
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,150
It's like you just keep getting to the
bottom and finding more unbelievable.

1542
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:35,300
Each day's trek demanded more
than I thought I had to give.

1543
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,670
I was able to go on only by scraping
up the few remaining bits of grit that

1544
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:45,260
remained in the most obscure recesses
of my heart and soul. I prayed,

1545
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,670
I commanded, I willed myself to
take step after impossible step.

1546
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:53,750
That effort itself,
fed in agony festering within me,

1547
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:57,980
which swelled and nod at my core as weak,
followed wretched week.

1548
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,420
Malaria tax and bouts of
bloody dysentery tortured me.

1549
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,570
The pain of my broken
back pierced me every day.

1550
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:10,010
The soles of my feet were mosaics
of raised welts and open bleeding,

1551
01:36:10,011 --> 01:36:14,660
dashes and punctures. Previously broken
toes throb as I broke them again.

1552
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:18,650
And as always there was
the pesky leash leeches,

1553
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:25,030
but I was still alive
and for that I thank God.

1554
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,373
Okay.

1555
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,400
And not only did you think God,

1556
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,560
you also still tried to
escape in that state?

1557
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:42,700
That was one of the stupidest things I
did in my entire captive. There'll be yes.

1558
01:36:42,701 --> 01:36:46,540
I, you know, I had that in the code
of conduct, escape, escape, escape.

1559
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:49,240
And we had planned even in
that first jungle camp, uh,

1560
01:36:49,241 --> 01:36:52,390
had planned on escape
from there with Wayne. Uh,

1561
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,790
but it was because of my poor
condition that Wayne said, let's,

1562
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:58,690
we're going gonna wait till you get some
strength or this isn't going to work.

1563
01:36:58,691 --> 01:37:01,690
And then of course I took us off on the,
on the trip that Wayne didn't survive.

1564
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:05,190
Uh, but yeah, so the day that I'd
finally did, I may have an opportunity,

1565
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:06,910
you mentioned I was with one guard.

1566
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,480
We'd often travel with groups of other
groups in north Vietnamese is going up

1567
01:37:10,481 --> 01:37:14,940
and down the trail and we were traveling
with one such group this day. And uh,

1568
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:16,990
I don't know where you're going to
pick up the stories. You can tell.

1569
01:37:16,991 --> 01:37:19,990
Just tell him. I'll tell part. So, uh,

1570
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:23,980
my guard zoo is talking to some other
North Vietnamese guy and they left and I,

1571
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,400
we're all in a big group and so they
fall behind and I'm still with the main

1572
01:37:27,401 --> 01:37:28,030
group,

1573
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:31,420
but I'm just kind of slowing down in
the group was moving away from me and I

1574
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:35,230
came around one turn in the trail,
one corner, no Jew behind me,

1575
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:39,820
no group in front of me. So just in
that instant I said, this is my chance.

1576
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:44,410
And plus I knew about where we were near
the demilitarized zone and we were only

1577
01:37:44,411 --> 01:37:47,560
several miles from the coast.
So that's in the back of my mind.

1578
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:51,880
I think I could make it so I just took
off the trail and headed up the side of a

1579
01:37:51,881 --> 01:37:56,100
hill with my great escape,
which only lasted for a very

1580
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,790
few Mo. I don't even know the
last two minutes, but a very few,

1581
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:03,240
few moments before I was recaptured.
Where are you going to read some of that?

1582
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:07,050
Yeah, this is what happened.
You do get recaptured. Here's
your thoughts. I'm dead.

1583
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,450
It's all over.
The zoo hovered over me.

1584
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,560
His Ak 47 muscles shifting from the center
of my face to the middle of my chest.

1585
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:16,950
He shrieked you. You. Why
you? His face burned red.

1586
01:38:16,951 --> 01:38:21,870
His eyes wild and rage spit sprayed
as he screamed at me. This is it.

1587
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:26,610
His fingers on the trigger.
He's going to kill me and then you,

1588
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,450
I missed the trail. I got
lost. He didn't shoot.

1589
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:34,860
He pointed his rifle away in
a solid voice. He commanded.
Get up. You do very bad.

1590
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:38,580
You have big problem now.
He was shaking it raged.

1591
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,190
He motioned down the hill and said,
go.

1592
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:42,570
Yeah.

1593
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:46,650
Nothing more than it was ever done to me.
Never heard about the incident again.

1594
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:50,030
My psychological assessment is,
uh,

1595
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:53,670
he was so embarrassed and would have been
in so much trouble. Worried, I think.

1596
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,560
Yeah. Well, how'd you lose your principal?
I was talking to some guy on emotion.

1597
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:02,220
He's just like, you know what, we're just
going to cover that one out. Yeah, he was,

1598
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:05,520
you know, out of all the guards that
I encountered, he was about the worst,

1599
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:09,750
the meanest despise me the most, I think
of almost anyone that I encountered.

1600
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:13,240
And lucky me, I get stuck with
him being my one single guard,

1601
01:39:13,241 --> 01:39:15,080
that it was moving me after I got sick.

1602
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,330
Was He with you with that original group
and then he stayed with you with your

1603
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:21,510
back? What? I've got to that first
jungle camp, living in the cages,

1604
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:26,260
he was our interrogator there.
I almost actually felt sorry for the guy.

1605
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:30,720
His alias was so bad. It was as bad as my
high school level. Spanish was. I mean,

1606
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,860
he just could barely speak
English and he's trying to,

1607
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:36,210
terra gator some propagandize
this and all this. But yeah,

1608
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:39,350
so he was the only guard, the really
spoken in English at all. So when I,

1609
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:41,250
when I had to be separated from the group,
they,

1610
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:44,610
they assigned him to be the one to
stay back with me and move me Norris.

1611
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:50,930
And now again, fast forward,

1612
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:55,700
you're now on a truck. You're,
you're now moving in vehicles. Okay.

1613
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:56,720
We got into north,

1614
01:39:56,721 --> 01:40:00,200
we have walked all the way up across the
north or to the north Vietnamese border

1615
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:04,580
on foot. So we're all the way just north
of the demilitarized zone at this point.

1616
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:08,360
Uh, and then they put us on trucks
to move us into north Vietnam.

1617
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:11,720
And inside North Vietnam we'd
some nights move and trucks,

1618
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,090
some days and nights
would, would, would march,

1619
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,970
depending on the threat
from American airstrikes.

1620
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:19,580
And of course the trucks are these
old Soviet era things with no shocks.

1621
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:21,680
And by the way,
you have a broken back at this point.

1622
01:40:21,681 --> 01:40:25,700
And it's not like the roads in north
Vietnam or in any kind of condition.

1623
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:28,730
So when we first got on the trucks,
I mean after all this death,

1624
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:33,500
March north mind my, my attitude was
haul trucks. This is wonderful. God,

1625
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:35,480
thank God.
And got on the bed of that truck.

1626
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:39,290
It took about a minute and a half of
driving down the road and that truck with

1627
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:43,210
no shocks, no springs
slam, slam slam to uh,

1628
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,620
yeah and you literally had
a broken back at this point.

1629
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:50,120
I literally had a broken back and,
and of course,

1630
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,140
as you said,

1631
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:54,820
I think you described this to your
wife as series of unfortunate events.

1632
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,170
So yes,

1633
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:00,400
now you're out there and
you see a flare in the sky.

1634
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,430
You recognize immediately, you
know what's coming. You know,

1635
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:06,460
it's in his first two are
flying Mohawks up off the coast.

1636
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,540
We would pick up targets on radar at
night of the convoys moving along highway

1637
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:14,470
one inside North Vietnam and we turn
it over to f four fighter jets from the

1638
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:19,330
four 92nd 97th,
a fighter wing out of Thailand.

1639
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:22,390
And they were called the night fighters
and they'd drop flares and then strike

1640
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:25,060
the target. So yes, I knew
exactly what was taking place.

1641
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:29,500
So you yell out air strike.
And then here we go back to the book,

1642
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:34,020
the first f four screamed
down from altitude and bombs
exploded nearby. And v I,

1643
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:34,730
N. T. O. N. V,

1644
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:39,100
a antiaircraft fire responded the
next f four screeched toward us.

1645
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,350
More bombs,
more anti aircraft.

1646
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:45,490
I began repeating the Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1647
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,520
Yea though I walk through the
Valley of the shadow of death,

1648
01:41:48,521 --> 01:41:52,600
I will fear no evil for thou art with me,
for Thou art with me.

1649
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:55,630
Good God.
The earth shook.

1650
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:00,840
Our truck banged about as if an earthquake
soldiers yelled from other trucks,

1651
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:01,810
system were hit,

1652
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,910
the world shuttered and explosions
and flames than it was done.

1653
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,250
That was our first,
yeah.

1654
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:18,420
First or second night on trucks
after we got into north Vietnam. Yes.

1655
01:42:18,421 --> 01:42:20,530
So not only did I have the
unpleasant bouncing around,

1656
01:42:20,531 --> 01:42:23,380
that was extremely painful. All,
sorry, I think I mentioned that book.

1657
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:25,360
Got a horrible case of
heartburn at night too,

1658
01:42:25,361 --> 01:42:29,800
is I got all this sour belts is going
on and a, and then we got that, uh,

1659
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:32,020
that airstrike.
And again,

1660
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:34,660
that wasn't the first or last
airstrike that I experienced,

1661
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:36,970
but that was pretty horrific.

1662
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:40,420
And they hit some of the vehicles that
we're going to do some of the Vietnamese

1663
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:44,380
soldiers now. Yeah. And I was by, at this
point when I got right to the border,

1664
01:42:44,381 --> 01:42:45,430
just pouring out of the trucks,

1665
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,790
I was married up with a second
group of South Vietnamese prisoners,

1666
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:51,040
senior officer's south
Vietnamese prisoner.

1667
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:53,800
So our group of prisoners
was on one truck. But yeah,

1668
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:57,610
other trucks in a convoy got hit and
people killed. And Luckily we didn't.

1669
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:05,670
Now you get into another camp,
and I'm going back to the book.

1670
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:10,690
The guards took us to a small hut with
posts and enough to tie our hammocks a

1671
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:14,800
fast in the door shut in place,
local militia guards outside.

1672
01:43:14,801 --> 01:43:18,040
We settled in getting comfortable
and arresting the door opened.

1673
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:22,780
A guard came in and said
something, a South Vietnamese
prisoner enter behind him.

1674
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,150
Lieutenant Hoang.
My God,

1675
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:29,380
I knew it was Wayne who
had died in this camp.

1676
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:34,390
Captain Wayne Finch. Wayne
was dead. My God hung,

1677
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:38,980
stared as if at a ghost. Astounded
to see me alive. He cried.

1678
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:44,160
I sat slump devastated at the
realization that Wayne Finch was dead.

1679
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,670
My friend Wayne, who had helped
me, cared for me. My friend Wayne,

1680
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,170
who I owed so much,
he was dead.

1681
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:53,323
Okay.

1682
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:58,460
Shocked. Disbelieving I
introduced, hung to the others.

1683
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:01,190
He told us how everyone
thought I was dead.

1684
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:05,120
How the group suffered on the
march north after they left me,

1685
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:09,560
how to tall American pilots, join them.
How Wayne continued to get sicker,

1686
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,970
lost hope, and grew week.
I fell into sadness,

1687
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:17,060
twisting it into melancholy,
self pity,

1688
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:20,600
sinking to the lowest point I had.
No.

1689
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:22,983
Okay.

1690
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,370
And that had to be to be devastating.

1691
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,560
It, it was, you know,

1692
01:44:28,561 --> 01:44:32,360
we had been separated and when I got
to this camp with the new group of,

1693
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:34,860
of South Vietnamese, uh,
when we arrived at the camp,

1694
01:44:34,861 --> 01:44:38,370
the camp commander gave a
speech and I could hear him say,

1695
01:44:38,371 --> 01:44:42,180
Finn Finn in the south, one of the South
Vietnamese officers translate for me.

1696
01:44:42,181 --> 01:44:45,840
He said, do you know of a Finn? There was
an American fin that died in this camp.

1697
01:44:45,841 --> 01:44:49,890
And I said, no, I don't know
any Finn. Uh, but what I did,

1698
01:44:49,891 --> 01:44:54,300
what I should have put together with the
bad pronunciation was finished and hung

1699
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:57,720
had been one of the guys helped drag me
through the jungle with, with the sun.

1700
01:44:58,110 --> 01:45:02,610
And as soon as I saw hung, I knew that,
uh, that it was, it was fenced. Yeah.

1701
01:45:02,611 --> 01:45:06,580
They took me to see the grave where
he was, where he was buried. And,

1702
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:10,130
and at least that rough idea of where
we were helped me when I came back to it

1703
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,280
in my debriefs to,

1704
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:14,610
to get that location to the Americans
that eventually it took a few years,

1705
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:18,060
for several years, Williams' body
was, was recovered and brought back.

1706
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:22,920
But that was, that was a low morale
point for me on the trip. That was,

1707
01:45:22,921 --> 01:45:26,280
that was devastating. You going
to go into the potato story? No.

1708
01:45:26,281 --> 01:45:27,450
Tell the potato store.
Okay.

1709
01:45:27,451 --> 01:45:29,400
I'll tell the potatoes because
this is another guy there, there,

1710
01:45:29,401 --> 01:45:31,640
there two Vietnamese.
I mean a lot of people help me

1711
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,540
all equal. I survive. Yeah. Tell him,

1712
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,110
tell him potato story and then
I'll wrap it up for you cause yeah,

1713
01:45:37,111 --> 01:45:39,570
tell the potato story. Okay. How are
we doing? How are we doing on time?

1714
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:44,530
We're just going on and on
and on. We're good. All right.
Um, song, it all, it helped

1715
01:45:44,530 --> 01:45:47,770
me as we already do described,
but in the second group of prisoners a,

1716
01:45:47,771 --> 01:45:51,840
I came to know a one, uh,
lieutenant colonel, Cane Yam, uh,

1717
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:55,960
who today lives in San Jose, California.
Still a dear friend. But Kay,

1718
01:45:55,961 --> 01:46:00,170
when he was captured a had a gold
cross pen, I mean, real goals.

1719
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:03,960
It was a very valuable pin. When he was
captured, he hit it in the lining of his,

1720
01:46:03,961 --> 01:46:07,210
of his uniform and he was going to trade
it for something for his own benefit.

1721
01:46:07,211 --> 01:46:09,610
When, when he got to wherever
he was going to get to.

1722
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,110
So I'm in the state that you've described.
I'm just physically a wreck now.

1723
01:46:14,111 --> 01:46:18,220
Emotionally, mentally in a low,
uh, were being held at a, at a hut.

1724
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:22,060
There's a local militia guy guarding
it outside. K goes to the wall,

1725
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:26,890
a thatched wall and talks to the guy and
I see him hand his pen out to the guy

1726
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:29,290
and the guy disappears.
Couple hours later,

1727
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:34,291
the guy returns with a small bag and
passes it in the bag were six potatoes.

1728
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,850
So Kay had traded his valuable crop.

1729
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:40,390
Gold cross pen for six potatoes,

1730
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:45,010
had a potato cooked each day
for the next six days for me.

1731
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:47,590
And I ate it.K wouldn't take any potatoes.

1732
01:46:47,591 --> 01:46:51,120
None of the other Vietnamese senior
officers would take any of the potato.

1733
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,430
They were from me. And just, I mean,

1734
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:58,260
both the physical strength the potatoes
gave me, but even more importantly,

1735
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:00,270
just the mental lift that,

1736
01:47:00,271 --> 01:47:04,590
that his sacrifice a gay from a
really brought me out of my, uh,

1737
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:08,280
out of my doldrums there. And, and,
and gave me the spirit to go on.

1738
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:10,470
Unbelievable.

1739
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:14,350
The, uh, one more thing that
happens with Kay. You're,

1740
01:47:14,351 --> 01:47:17,360
you're getting ready to leave the
camp to go to a new camp, right?

1741
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:19,520
And K tap my arm.
Look,

1742
01:47:19,521 --> 01:47:23,480
he said the curious militia guard had
been so interested in learning about South

1743
01:47:23,481 --> 01:47:26,120
Vietnam and America.
Who'd fetched my potatoes?

1744
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:29,810
Stood there looking like
a kid with a new puppy.

1745
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:34,250
He came close to the truck and I
lean against the state. Decide,

1746
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,320
okay,

1747
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,830
goodbye. He said, grinning is simple.

1748
01:47:38,831 --> 01:47:42,190
Humanity made me smile and I said goodbye.

1749
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:47,950
Case on my astonishment. He wants to learn
to say goodbye to you when you leave.

1750
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:52,450
I teach him. He good man. Yes. I thought,

1751
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:53,370
okay.

1752
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:58,350
No doubt he is. There are good men
everywhere. It's the governments,

1753
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:02,370
the systems, the leaders that are
bad. It's communism. That sucks.

1754
01:48:02,371 --> 01:48:07,000
Not The people of North Vietnam.
They are not so different from the south.

1755
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,670
Not so different from me.

1756
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:19,130
I learned a lot of lessons on this trip.
Um,

1757
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:24,770
I learned a lot of lessons about humanity
and people and I do honestly believe

1758
01:48:26,371 --> 01:48:30,090
we are all God's children.
Know you.

1759
01:48:30,091 --> 01:48:33,780
And I had the good fortune to be born
where we were born in this wonderful

1760
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:35,730
country of ours.
Uh,

1761
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:40,880
others have had the not so good fortune
a bi came across good people in,

1762
01:48:42,711 --> 01:48:47,160
in Vietnam. Uh, and he though
he was my enemy, uh, was,

1763
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:49,800
was one.
Sometimes people ask me if I,

1764
01:48:49,801 --> 01:48:52,980
if I have any hatred for those guys and
the treatment that I got and I, and I,

1765
01:48:52,981 --> 01:48:57,410
and I don't, uh, I don't, uh,
I think they were human beings,

1766
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:01,320
not so different than you
and me. Uh, they had their,

1767
01:49:01,321 --> 01:49:04,020
their news controlled by their government,
their propaganda.

1768
01:49:04,021 --> 01:49:05,940
Plus they were suffering
airstrikes and everything else.

1769
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:08,310
They behave the way that they,
they behaved.

1770
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,490
I guess the one guy is still don't
care much for it. Was it sue?

1771
01:49:11,491 --> 01:49:15,630
But we'd probably get over it if I ever,
if I ever met the guy. Uh, so no, I don't,

1772
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:18,910
I don't have any hatred. They're, uh,
they're just people like, like uni.

1773
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:20,630
And there was even times,
I mean,

1774
01:49:20,631 --> 01:49:25,520
where you're walking through a village
and now you're in north Vietnam where

1775
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:27,500
what you're just talking about,
they'd been bombed.

1776
01:49:27,501 --> 01:49:31,220
They lost their sons and they're trying
to basically attack you to throw rocks

1777
01:49:31,221 --> 01:49:34,010
at you. Right. And the guys
that are guarding you actually,

1778
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,900
I don't think they shot at them,

1779
01:49:35,901 --> 01:49:39,440
but they fired me over there and shot
over their heads to to protect you all.

1780
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,240
Yes.
Which I've found to be.

1781
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,990
Yeah.
My south Vietnamese friends,

1782
01:49:42,991 --> 01:49:45,800
I mean you'll talk to people who have
experienced in the Vietnam war and you get

1783
01:49:45,801 --> 01:49:50,440
all kinds of different opinions of the
South Vietnamese and good, worthless,

1784
01:49:50,441 --> 01:49:54,160
whatever. And, and they have are
all all varieties like we are,

1785
01:49:54,161 --> 01:49:57,850
there are some that fought
valiantly bravely like the
guys at Firebase, Charlie,

1786
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:02,500
uh, the people that I was
with is a prisoner of war.
War were great human beings.

1787
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:05,830
And when we get attacked, yeah, the
first thing they put me at, they've,

1788
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:07,090
that the communist guards,

1789
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:10,010
it's took me in the middle but then the
south Vietnamese willingly with foreign

1790
01:50:10,011 --> 01:50:14,230
perimeters around me and then the guards
are on the outside firing is necessary.

1791
01:50:14,231 --> 01:50:14,740
Alta

1792
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,573
to protect me.

1793
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:23,500
One time going back to book, the
Guard starts screaming, be nom.

1794
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:27,570
Hey, be nom hey and bottom line,
bottom high, bottom high them,

1795
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:31,910
which leads me is Bobby
numb five high too.

1796
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,130
And for those of you that don't
translate that real quick,

1797
01:50:34,131 --> 01:50:37,700
that's be 52 the bombs dropped.

1798
01:50:37,701 --> 01:50:40,610
Hundreds of bombs fell are all around us.

1799
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,920
Big bombs nearly on top of us.

1800
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:45,980
I knew there was little chance
of living through a B 52 struck,

1801
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:49,250
but by the grace of God,
no bombs fell in our creator.

1802
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:52,820
The earth trembled at shook.
It ruptured and heaved.

1803
01:50:53,120 --> 01:50:57,590
Waves of crushing pressure blasted through
a squeezing, hurting my head and ears.

1804
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:00,860
The suffocating pressure was
painful, awful, frightening.

1805
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:06,200
It stopped all was cry
it. I was dead. I knew it.

1806
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:09,590
I felt ringing in my years,
throbbing in my head.

1807
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:14,990
I must be alive next to me. The
officer's sat up unholstered his pistol.

1808
01:51:14,991 --> 01:51:17,980
By the way, you'd be the guy drawn
his pistol and held it to your head.

1809
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,800
You made sure he does rescue
during the beef. 52 straight. Yeah.

1810
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:26,280
Kay was moving. Oh, there's began sitting
up days but alive. No one could hear,

1811
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:31,710
no one spoke. We crawled out of the
hole and started walking and direction.

1812
01:51:31,711 --> 01:51:32,544
We'd been traveling.

1813
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:35,350
Yeah, this was in, in north Vietnam.

1814
01:51:35,351 --> 01:51:38,350
We'd come upon an area of a lot of bomb
craters had been bombed frequently.

1815
01:51:38,351 --> 01:51:42,040
And then, uh, the enemy shot
to anti aircraft rounds.

1816
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:45,390
That seemed to be their signal. Two
rounds was a, uh, was an airstrike.

1817
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,930
And then the other started shouting bottom
high and all hell broke loose upon us.

1818
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,700
Now you get to Hanoi,
right?

1819
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,600
And you get a bed. A board. Okay. Board.

1820
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:02,500
There's a blanket though.
There was a blanket.

1821
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:05,380
It gets cold in heaven and French bread.

1822
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:11,880
Is that a style you called it [inaudible]
it's like a small piece of French

1823
01:52:12,311 --> 01:52:14,410
bread is what it looked like.
But it was just,

1824
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:19,270
I mean it was kind of half rotten and
pieces of rock and stick and in it was,

1825
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:22,750
it's funny even in the book because when
you first talk about the French bread,

1826
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:25,620
French bread and did a club
run tears to my eyes, a couple,

1827
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:27,790
a couple of paragraphs or
maybe a couple of pages later,

1828
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:31,840
you're saying there was bugs in,
but when you first got that French bread,

1829
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:33,760
the first I was put in
solitary confinement,

1830
01:52:33,761 --> 01:52:35,560
my first prison and I was brought a meal.

1831
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:38,170
And now the whole time I was
captured down in the jungle,

1832
01:52:38,171 --> 01:52:40,950
we got a ball of grapefruit, grapefruit
size, ball of rice in the morning,

1833
01:52:40,951 --> 01:52:43,240
a grapefruit size ball of rice
in the evening for our food.

1834
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:46,940
That's what we got hiking up
the Hotel Minh trail. We would,

1835
01:52:46,941 --> 01:52:50,420
in the evenings they would cook rice.
The communist would,

1836
01:52:50,421 --> 01:52:53,390
and we would get about that same
equivalent about a ball size of rice.

1837
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:56,690
And then we would roll up a
ball to eat during the, uh,

1838
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:58,280
the journey on the next morning.

1839
01:52:58,281 --> 01:53:01,370
So it was the same thing to
grapefruit sized balls or rice a day.

1840
01:53:01,371 --> 01:53:05,630
And that's all that I had with
an occasional piece of Manuk.

1841
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:10,190
Uh, yeah. And maybe some, uh, oh,
what the heck do they call it?

1842
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:14,810
Bamboo shoot occasionally, but
mostly just rice. So I get to Hanoi,

1843
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:19,400
I'm in solitary confinement. They
bring me a meal. It's a plate of a,

1844
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:23,510
of a bean sprouts for a plate of bean
sprouts with this piece of French bread on

1845
01:53:23,511 --> 01:53:26,530
the side. And I'm sitting there
for a lot of reasons. I mean, I,

1846
01:53:26,531 --> 01:53:27,770
I knew that I was in Hanoi.

1847
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:32,771
I knew that this horrible trip of walking
every single day and not knowing how I

1848
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:36,800
was going to survive through the day. All
that was over. I'm here, I'm in Hanoi. Oh.

1849
01:53:36,801 --> 01:53:40,670
Plus they'd given me a bath and gave
me a prison uniform and shaved me.

1850
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:45,020
Uh, I mean, I had not shaved the whole
time, so I've been a prisoner for months.

1851
01:53:45,021 --> 01:53:49,460
I have this huge beard. Um,
and I sat there and they
brought that food and I did,

1852
01:53:49,461 --> 01:53:51,500
I cried.
Tears rolled down my cheeks.

1853
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:55,970
I knew for the first time
since I was shot down,

1854
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:59,090
there was no doubt in my mind.
I was going to survive.

1855
01:53:59,091 --> 01:54:02,410
That was no longer a question I had to
do was gut out those last however long it

1856
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:03,860
was going to be in Hanoi.

1857
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:07,910
They had given me this wonderful food
of bean sprouts and this piece of crappy

1858
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:09,780
French bread.
But it was,

1859
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:14,340
it was wonderful. That's, yeah. Beautiful.

1860
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:18,930
And here's,
uh,

1861
01:54:19,050 --> 01:54:21,780
as this continues here in Illinois,
I'm going back to the book.

1862
01:54:21,781 --> 01:54:24,690
I stood in the cell about 12
feet wide and 25 feet long.

1863
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:29,720
Six bunks lined up to my right head
and against the wall to others lay

1864
01:54:30,091 --> 01:54:31,680
lengthwise against the wall.
To my left.

1865
01:54:31,681 --> 01:54:36,150
The bunks were three by six foot pieces
of wood resting on saw horses of the

1866
01:54:36,151 --> 01:54:38,610
same width.
Each was covered with a bamboo mat.

1867
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:42,120
A blanket neatly folded on one
end between the bunks on my left,

1868
01:54:42,121 --> 01:54:45,720
I saw two buckets just like the one
in my ones in my solitary cells.

1869
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:50,160
A row of three small windows slits,
six by 18 inches,

1870
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:54,000
opened high at the back,
at the top of the back wall.

1871
01:54:54,930 --> 01:54:57,300
Seven sets of eyes fixed on me.

1872
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,040
One approached and put out his hand.
I'm John Murphy.

1873
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,290
Captain Air Force,

1874
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:07,860
how you doin Americans?

1875
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:12,180
A room full of Americans.
Whoa,

1876
01:55:12,181 --> 01:55:16,230
God bless you.
Then that's your,

1877
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,560
you're with these other prisoners.
And

1878
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:21,650
I hadn't seen another American since.

1879
01:55:21,651 --> 01:55:25,070
I split up from that group all
that time ago on the trail.

1880
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:28,820
It was a glorious moment to come out
of solitary confinement and be put in a

1881
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:31,340
room with seven other guys.
And

1882
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:34,890
this is one of the things that I talked
about you as we were getting ready to

1883
01:55:34,891 --> 01:55:37,650
record, I said, look,

1884
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:42,910
I want to read your entire book on
this podcast because it's so good and

1885
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:44,100
nobody's going to

1886
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,130
want to go by the book. Now.
They just heard the whole,
the whole book read to it.

1887
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,360
And in one of the decisions that I made
was one of the things that you do in

1888
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,300
here is this is a book about you,

1889
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:59,540
but you do a wonderful and a beautiful
job of describing and telling the stories

1890
01:56:01,051 --> 01:56:05,670
of all these other heroes that
you're with. And as a matter of fact,

1891
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:10,140
you call this chapter chapter 12 in the
company of heroes with all these other

1892
01:56:10,141 --> 01:56:10,971
Americans that you know,
you,

1893
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:14,350
you told me on the way over here and you
talk about it in the book you'd been in,

1894
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,970
you were there for, at this point, what,
six months were you there at this point?

1895
01:56:17,971 --> 01:56:21,180
Seven months? Yeah, something like that.

1896
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:26,270
Some of these guys had been
in captivity for three years,

1897
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:30,280
five years, seven years, seven years.
The one guy talk about another,

1898
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:32,630
Jim Thompson had been a
prisoner for nine years. I,

1899
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:35,610
I felt I needed to do that in this book.

1900
01:56:35,611 --> 01:56:38,550
I've had some real mixed
feelings about writing this book.

1901
01:56:38,551 --> 01:56:41,520
I didn't want to do a book focused,
you know,

1902
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:45,150
this happened to me story and I did all
this great stuff. I know I suffered,

1903
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:49,240
but there were so many other prisoners
from the southern experience,

1904
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:50,640
and that's a story I wanted to tell this,

1905
01:56:50,641 --> 01:56:53,850
this different southern experience is
different than the prisoners were shot

1906
01:56:53,851 --> 01:56:57,210
down and captured in the north.
So many of these guys, many,

1907
01:56:57,211 --> 01:56:59,700
many of these guys suffered
so much more than I did,

1908
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:02,480
spent so much more time in
captivity than I did. Uh,

1909
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:06,930
so I do share those stories of
those guys in the company of heroes.

1910
01:57:06,931 --> 01:57:10,260
When I got the Hanoi,
got into the prison of plantation gardens,

1911
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:15,360
I met these other guys and they had
the truly incredible heroic stories to

1912
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:15,960
share.

1913
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:20,880
And you do a phenomenal
job in the book of,

1914
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:25,380
of describing, you know them, who they
were or what they've been through.

1915
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:28,860
Bill gone. Al Krol. Boff Yup.

1916
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,300
John Parr cells. Bill Thomas,
Bill Henderson, Dave Mott,

1917
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:37,810
just you go through the guys know those
were the guys in my cell and I don't

1918
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,390
know, I don't know if you caught in
there. Out of the eight guys in the self,

1919
01:57:40,391 --> 01:57:43,260
four of us were named bill.
That's just crazy.

1920
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:48,600
Eight Americans in a cell and four of
his name bill. So I became new bill.

1921
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:53,400
Uh, there was a bill gap was an air
force pilot, but six, four, six, five,

1922
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:54,510
he was big bill.

1923
01:57:54,870 --> 01:57:58,470
There was a marine warrant officer who
is some prehistoric elderly gentleman.

1924
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:03,030
The poor guy was 36 years old. We
couldn't believe he'd survived. Uh,

1925
01:58:03,031 --> 01:58:05,880
but he was old bill. And then
we had a, a an air force,

1926
01:58:05,881 --> 01:58:10,050
a ob 10 pilot who became young bills.
So we had four bills out of the,

1927
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:13,770
out of the eight guys. But yeah,
then then the, the others and they,

1928
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:17,940
those guys had all suffered too. But
then there were other guys in the camp,

1929
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:21,760
uh, shoot, uh, Dennis Thompson and,

1930
01:58:21,890 --> 01:58:24,600
and Harvey, uh, brand, uh,

1931
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:29,430
two special forces guys capture along way
their experiences. Uh, so many others,

1932
01:58:29,431 --> 01:58:34,170
five, five guys, but TV station in
way who are captured and tet, I mean,

1933
01:58:34,171 --> 01:58:38,670
who would think that a TV, radio station,
TV station crew would get captured,

1934
01:58:38,671 --> 01:58:42,190
but they had all of their and
their trials and, and then,

1935
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:43,440
yeah, the most was, uh,

1936
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:47,260
was Jim Thompson and his nine years
of suffering as a prisoner of war.

1937
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:51,820
And one of the guys I do want
to highlight is Colonel Ted guy,

1938
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:55,960
someone to go to the book who are senior
or senior ranking officer. Yep. Please.

1939
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,010
And someone's briefing, you kind
of telling you what's going on and,

1940
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:03,160
and here's what, um, here's what
Dave says. Dave Mott, he says,

1941
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:08,250
the SRO that's the senior ranking
officer for the camp is Colonel Ted guy.

1942
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:11,200
He's in the shed up on top of the camp.

1943
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:15,430
That's where they've segregated the
senior officers in NCO is from the rest of

1944
01:59:15,431 --> 01:59:15,910
us.

1945
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:19,390
He's an air force lieutenant colonel who
must've been promoted to full bird by

1946
01:59:19,391 --> 01:59:23,380
now. He went down over
Laos and an f four in 1968.

1947
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:27,520
He's a good leader and a real hard ass.
He runs a tight ship,

1948
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,700
doesn't allow making any
propaganda statements.

1949
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:35,920
No one can accept early release.
We live by the code of conduct.

1950
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:41,140
He's taken a lot of beatings and
torture for us. We call him the hawk.

1951
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,780
Al Crow. Both jumped in immediately.
Yeah. And we're hawks heroes,

1952
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:50,980
just like Hogan's heroes on the TV
show only. We don't have as much fun.

1953
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:55,390
He had a shit eating grin on his face.
He also looked like crap.

1954
01:59:57,790 --> 02:00:02,420
So that's why I thought it was. Um,
that's one of the, you know, you,

1955
02:00:02,421 --> 02:00:03,071
you again,

1956
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:07,150
you go through all these guys and what
they've done and you also talk about,

1957
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:09,610
you talk about some of those heroes that,

1958
02:00:09,611 --> 02:00:14,611
that held the line and you also talk
about another group who I'll go to here.

1959
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:15,400
Okay.

1960
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:18,520
Sometimes I could hear a lot of noise
from the other side of the wall separating

1961
02:00:18,521 --> 02:00:21,700
our road cells from those on
the further end of our building,

1962
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:28,050
I could see the top of a basketball hoop
and occasional volleyball arched high

1963
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:32,560
over an out of sight net.
What's up with that? I asked,

1964
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:36,490
that's the peace committee came the
answer. What's the peace committee?

1965
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:41,770
Eight guys who collaborate with the enemy.
They've been ordered to stop,

1966
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:45,730
but they won't. They studied
communism. Do propaganda,

1967
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,440
make radio broadcasts,

1968
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:52,360
even rat on other Americans for that.
They get packages,

1969
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:56,470
get to write letters and can go outside
whenever they want and play games.

1970
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:00,310
We call them the ducks because
of the way they followed,

1971
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:05,110
followed the guards around and do
their bidding. They'll rot in hell.

1972
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:09,340
I said that they will.
The collaborators were,

1973
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:12,520
but a small but significant
minority among us.

1974
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:15,820
There were 107 prisoners
that plantation gardens.

1975
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,720
And except for the eight in the
peace committee, all we're patriotic,

1976
02:01:19,721 --> 02:01:22,540
loyal Americans who resisted
enemy interrogations,

1977
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:27,070
propaganda and pressure to sign
statements and make rock radio broadcasts.

1978
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:29,740
We resisted with everything we had.

1979
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:37,060
And then, you know, you've got more time
tying those guys back to Colonel Guy.

1980
02:01:37,061 --> 02:01:40,490
I can't say enough about Colonel Guy
and he's passed away several years ago

1981
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:45,040
now. Uh, but what, uh,
what a strong leader in,

1982
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,620
you know,

1983
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:49,250
we talk about military discipline and
the requirement for it and officer's

1984
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:54,251
dissonance is that whatever in prison
camp that discipline was so essential and

1985
02:01:54,621 --> 02:01:56,990
so sought after by everyone.

1986
02:01:57,350 --> 02:02:02,020
And we were lucky to have a colonel
guy as our senior ranking officer.

1987
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,970
He was so tough and,
and,

1988
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:07,400
and by the rules and the
code and thank goodness,

1989
02:02:07,401 --> 02:02:10,040
cause that's what we all
needed to hear. Uh, and to,

1990
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:13,740
and to have that standard to
a, to live by, uh, just a,

1991
02:02:13,741 --> 02:02:18,440
a great and wonderful human being.
When we got back, uh, you know,

1992
02:02:18,441 --> 02:02:21,710
there were several who would've strangled
some of those peace committee guys,

1993
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:25,060
especially some of our special forces
guys were captured with us. Uh,

1994
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:28,850
but colonel guy put out an order
and he said, this is a direct order.

1995
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,720
Everyone stay away from the peace
committee. I'm going to take care of this.

1996
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:35,300
I got it.
Don't you do anything?

1997
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:40,130
And Colonel Guy Press charges against
the peace committee again and again was

1998
02:02:40,131 --> 02:02:42,350
overwritten charges were
never brought against them.

1999
02:02:42,351 --> 02:02:44,630
But what did happen is
colonel guys career was,

2000
02:02:44,631 --> 02:02:47,900
was curtailed Farber short
before it should have been.

2001
02:02:47,901 --> 02:02:52,820
But I have the deepest respect for him
as our, as our senior officer. Yeah.

2002
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:55,630
Yeah. And again, I'm going to,
I'm going to say this again.

2003
02:02:56,410 --> 02:02:58,840
You go through these stories of,

2004
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:01,600
of some of the other
heroes you just mentioned,

2005
02:03:01,601 --> 02:03:06,040
Dennis Thomas Harps and right
there at Thompson Harvey brand,

2006
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:08,590
Bill Murray.
I mean you just,

2007
02:03:08,591 --> 02:03:13,090
you go through these stories and then
they're just all phenomenal and you do

2008
02:03:13,091 --> 02:03:17,980
them such, such an honor
telling their stories. So,

2009
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:21,730
uh, buy this book so that
you can read these stories.

2010
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:24,070
Cause I don't have time to go
through them all here. Right.

2011
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:29,140
The Oh the one thing I want to point
out though is going back to the book,

2012
02:03:29,141 --> 02:03:32,530
we also tried to keep our humor
going within the cell and Alan,

2013
02:03:32,531 --> 02:03:37,330
me as the central culprits telling
disgustingly bad jokes back and forth.

2014
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:42,040
Owl was getting a lot better. His nausea
was subsiding cause he was really sick.

2015
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,140
His naughty with subsiding
in his boils healing.

2016
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:48,670
Some of the guys exercised to fight
the deterioration of their bodies.

2017
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:52,870
I couldn't even lie on my back,
let alone trying to do sit ups.

2018
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:54,430
What I could do was get,

2019
02:03:54,700 --> 02:03:58,300
was try to get into a
position to try pushups.

2020
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,070
I tried once in the jungle and failed.
I couldn't raise myself up off the ground.

2021
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:07,240
Now I was able to push all the way
up once and halfway through a second.

2022
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:12,490
Pretty sad for a guy who
could do a hundred pushups
before I kept at fruit added

2023
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:16,900
for weeks until I was able to do
several as part of my daily routine.

2024
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:21,130
And the reason I point that out
is because I always say, you know,

2025
02:04:21,131 --> 02:04:25,600
cause people get injured. People come
with sickness. Do what you can. Yes, yes.

2026
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:29,910
And do what you can. And that's
exactly what you are doing. So,

2027
02:04:30,070 --> 02:04:31,030
so important.

2028
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,150
December 8th ninth or December,
1972 after many weeks of quiet,

2029
02:04:39,151 --> 02:04:43,140
we got bombed like none of us had ever
been bombed before. Air Raid, sirens,

2030
02:04:43,141 --> 02:04:47,010
wailed, barrages of Sam's
fired and bombs poured down.

2031
02:04:47,011 --> 02:04:50,020
American be 52 is that arrived
in forest over underway.

2032
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:54,810
Bombs fell close and plantation
gardens shook. We lay on our bunks,

2033
02:04:54,811 --> 02:04:58,170
hoping our bombers knew
where our camp was. Still,

2034
02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:02,370
we fell back into a mindset
we'd all developed in captivity.

2035
02:05:02,850 --> 02:05:03,810
What will be,

2036
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:08,870
will be no sense in worrying about
something you absolutely have no control

2037
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:12,780
over, which is going to stop
above from landing on her head.

2038
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:14,471
Yeah.

2039
02:05:14,471 --> 02:05:19,420
That was the Christmas bombing in 1972
that Nixon ordered to finally bring the

2040
02:05:19,421 --> 02:05:21,640
communist to conclude.
Yeah.

2041
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:26,330
Yeah. And I, I, I had to
put this part in here.

2042
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:29,510
I had to read it. Go. So after those,

2043
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:33,950
after that massive bombing repercussion.
So there's a guard that you,

2044
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:36,380
that you had nicknamed repercussion,
repercussion,

2045
02:05:36,410 --> 02:05:40,340
a guard so named because of his violent
outbursts and threats against prisoners

2046
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:44,270
stood against the wall.
As we milled around the water trough,

2047
02:05:44,540 --> 02:05:48,430
he spoke some English old Bill
Thomas walked over to them,

2048
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:51,890
him and said,
you think those air strikes were bad?

2049
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:55,910
What the guard asked you think those
airstrikes were bad last night,

2050
02:05:55,911 --> 02:06:00,890
bill set again. Yes. Bad bombing.
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

2051
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:04,700
Wait till they drop a
bomb on your fucking ass.

2052
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:10,820
I gasped and smiled. Old Bill, proud
marine. He'd been pretty quiet guy,

2053
02:06:10,821 --> 02:06:14,150
but not anymore.
We all glowed inside after the bombing.

2054
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:17,840
It was a huge morale boost.
The bombings went on night after night,

2055
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:21,110
not without impunity be 50
two's got shot down there.

2056
02:06:21,111 --> 02:06:24,440
Ghastly giant carcasses
burning, falling. We wondered,

2057
02:06:24,441 --> 02:06:26,060
sadly about the fate of the crews.

2058
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:31,100
We lost an aircraft yet they kept
coming quietly. We cheered them on.

2059
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:32,100
Yeah,

2060
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,670
that that was a huge morale
boost and Bill Thomas, boy,

2061
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:37,620
bless his heart because he was
always kind of a quiet guy,

2062
02:06:37,621 --> 02:06:39,340
but he just let it let it all out there.
Yeah.

2063
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:43,580
That's so awesome.
Okay,

2064
02:06:43,581 --> 02:06:47,510
now we're wearing them in the
Hondo Hilton. The infamous,

2065
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:50,210
yeah, they moved us in the middle
of all that bombing attacks.

2066
02:06:50,211 --> 02:06:53,930
They loaded us up one night on trucks
at the plantation gardens, drove around,

2067
02:06:53,931 --> 02:06:55,430
I don't know,
it seemed like for a couple hours.

2068
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:56,760
I think they're just
trying to disorganize.

2069
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:58,940
We thought their tickets down in
the country because of the bombings.

2070
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:02,930
Then they came to a stop and we got out
of the trucks and found out we were only

2071
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:06,860
a few Blauer several blocks from
where we started at the Hanoi Hilton

2072
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:13,010
and now they set up like a little movie
night for you guys. Oh yeah. For the,

2073
02:07:13,011 --> 02:07:16,650
at the Hanoi Hilton,
a little movie night and they,

2074
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:18,560
they set you down for the movie night.

2075
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,390
You guys are making fun of the projector
operator and finally they tell you

2076
02:07:23,391 --> 02:07:26,750
quiet, no talk. And then the
movie starts back to the book.

2077
02:07:26,751 --> 02:07:30,230
The film was of Jane Fonda
visiting North Vietnam.

2078
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:35,920
We saw an American cavorting among
the enemy leadership supporting cause

2079
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:42,150
scenes appeared of her climbing into the
governor's seat on an Nva antiaircraft

2080
02:07:42,670 --> 02:07:47,020
gun wearing a clean white blouse,
smiling broadly,

2081
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:47,980
laughing,

2082
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:53,220
dawning and north Vietnamese army helmet
with live ammunition at or feet that

2083
02:07:53,381 --> 02:07:57,790
would later shoot down American planes.
In the film,

2084
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:02,500
she sent a message to American
servicemen calling US war criminals.

2085
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,780
She said we were following the orders of
other war criminals that were like the

2086
02:08:07,781 --> 02:08:12,520
leaders of Germany and Japan in World
War Two who were executed for their

2087
02:08:12,521 --> 02:08:13,354
crimes.

2088
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:15,450
Yeah,

2089
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:18,900
I was stunned.
We didn't dare speak out loud,

2090
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:23,910
but we had plenty to say to each other
when we got back inside our cell days

2091
02:08:23,911 --> 02:08:27,510
later, they showed us some news clippings
from American newspapers and magazines.

2092
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:30,420
They all had news of war protests.

2093
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,960
One one was former US attorney general
Ramsey Clark demanding that American

2094
02:08:37,261 --> 02:08:39,960
stopped bombing north Vietnamese dykes.

2095
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:44,400
He had been attorney general under
President Johnson during the buildup of

2096
02:08:44,401 --> 02:08:45,960
American forces in Vietnam.

2097
02:08:46,110 --> 02:08:50,610
Now he was making statements from annoyed
that it was inhumane to bomb dykes and

2098
02:08:50,611 --> 02:08:52,050
that we should never do it again.

2099
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:56,790
A photo showed him standing beside
a dyke with a single bomb crater.

2100
02:08:57,630 --> 02:09:00,960
I knew we did not have an air
campaign to destroy the dikes.

2101
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,520
This was an errant bomb.

2102
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:08,310
The war protesters at home
never bothered me. In fact,

2103
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:13,550
I took pride in fighting communism in
this far corner of the earth so Americans

2104
02:09:13,771 --> 02:09:16,440
could have the right to
protest in the streets.

2105
02:09:17,370 --> 02:09:22,370
It was a sacred honor to defend the right
of other Americans to disagree with me

2106
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:26,820
or anything within our
American system of government.

2107
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:30,233
Okay?

2108
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:34,070
Yeah. And I, I do believe
that so strongly. They're,

2109
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:39,090
the core of our democracy is not that
we all get in line and March 4th,

2110
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:42,140
uh, I'll take us to 1984. Uh,

2111
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:45,480
the strength of our American democracy
as we can have different views and people

2112
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:49,500
disagree in the health of the democracy
is when those disagreements can be

2113
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:54,240
argued and discussed, and then
you reach a solution, a demo,

2114
02:09:54,270 --> 02:09:58,440
or a democratic solution and you go
forward. That's the beauty of our system.

2115
02:09:58,441 --> 02:10:01,230
So yeah, it never bothered me. Even during
the war I'd come up, people say, God,

2116
02:10:01,231 --> 02:10:05,280
isn't this horrible at these guys?
Know exactly what I said there.

2117
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,690
I am fighting as an American soldier
to defend the American way of life,

2118
02:10:09,691 --> 02:10:14,130
which is democratic disagreement, an
argument, so they have added guys,

2119
02:10:14,131 --> 02:10:16,020
you want to protest?
Go protest.

2120
02:10:17,010 --> 02:10:17,280
Yeah.

2121
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:20,160
Beautiful.
Now you,

2122
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,350
I'm good.
I'm just going to go to the book.

2123
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,260
We joined the wrist rest of our cell mates

2124
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:33,980
and pressed clothes to Jose,
Angela Dewa,

2125
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,410
Anzel Dewa autonomy rose marine,

2126
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:41,470
a tall marine corporal captured a couple
of years before he quietly related what

2127
02:10:41,511 --> 02:10:45,290
he'd gathered from the broadcast, so he
was a translator. He was eavesdropping,

2128
02:10:45,291 --> 02:10:46,380
listen to the radio translated.

2129
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,400
One of the guards was out in the courtyard
playing a radio, which they never did.

2130
02:10:49,401 --> 02:10:50,001
I never heard them,

2131
02:10:50,001 --> 02:10:53,570
but obviously there was some important
news coming says guard head is at a radio

2132
02:10:53,571 --> 02:10:56,810
out in the courtyard listing and Jose
heard what was said on the radio and he

2133
02:10:56,811 --> 02:11:01,550
says it sounded like a peace agreement
was signed in. The war has ended and

2134
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:06,110
you kind of get that confirmed
back to the book. That afternoon.

2135
02:11:06,111 --> 02:11:09,770
We were taken in the court yard with our
fellow plantation garden prisoners from

2136
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:10,640
the cell.
Next door.

2137
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:15,740
Film crews stood behind a couple of big
old funky cameras set up on tripods.

2138
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:18,200
We stood in rows as instructed,

2139
02:11:18,201 --> 02:11:22,190
waiting for whatever might come
and order passed through the ranks.

2140
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:26,480
Hawk says if it's good news,
no reaction, no smiles,

2141
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:30,680
no shouting, nothing for
propaganda. Yup. I love that.

2142
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:35,240
He's just hard to the end
and then doc,

2143
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:40,220
who's the comp command, the
camp commander, he, he says,

2144
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:44,330
he looks up and says the peace
agreement assigned. You all go home.

2145
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:49,820
He waited for us to cheer
nothing. He looked apologetically
at the film director,

2146
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:53,840
then back to us with a hint of the
scow and he goes through the whole,

2147
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:56,350
the whole points of,

2148
02:11:56,351 --> 02:12:01,351
of what the peace accord has in it right
in as he read the remaining highlights

2149
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:06,680
all faded into adult drone.
I'd heard the most important one to me.

2150
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:10,670
The war's over. We're going
home within 60 days. I made it.

2151
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:15,050
Thank you God.
We went back to ourselves.

2152
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:21,590
Yeah, that that was, it was a
manageable Angie. We'll do it.

2153
02:12:21,591 --> 02:12:24,920
Getting the heads up and
then we confronted the guards
and the next morning and

2154
02:12:24,921 --> 02:12:27,050
they denied no, no, no,
no, and and put, yeah.

2155
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:30,110
Then that afternoon we got let out in
the courtyard and got the agreements read

2156
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:32,810
to us what a,
what a tremendous feeling,

2157
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:37,811
but it was a tremendous feeling and
then stop just short there because we

2158
02:12:38,271 --> 02:12:39,420
weren't home yet.
Right?

2159
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:42,680
We weren't going to believe it until
it happened and you still had 60 days,

2160
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:47,590
60 days and they actually consolidate
other prisoners now. Right.

2161
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:51,410
They started doing releases earlier on
or was supposed to be the longest held

2162
02:12:51,411 --> 02:12:52,940
and most seriously injured.

2163
02:12:52,941 --> 02:12:56,060
The got out first and then the releases
were going to be spaced out in several

2164
02:12:56,061 --> 02:12:59,990
groups over a period of 60 days.
Back to the book here,

2165
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:02,120
after the new group joined us,

2166
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,730
we'd hear Godawful shrieks
in the middle of the night.

2167
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:07,100
I thought it might be Ted Gustus,

2168
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:12,580
an intelligence officer captured in an
ad hoc way in 1968 he'd been hung from

2169
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:16,400
ropes, denied water, severely
beaten for extended periods,

2170
02:13:16,610 --> 02:13:20,330
bashed in the head with
an AK 47 and kicked in the
stomach and an effort to gain

2171
02:13:20,331 --> 02:13:21,380
valuable intelligence.

2172
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:26,410
He never revealed goddess was now a
physical wreck who'd been driven to the

2173
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:30,800
precipice of insanity,
sometimes dangling dangerously over its.

2174
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,530
But it wasn't Ted who is
screaming in the night.

2175
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:36,373
Okay.

2176
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:40,620
It was Jim Thompson.
Jim Kept to himself.

2177
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:42,510
He was hard to get to know.

2178
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:47,430
But in time he began to open up to me
and share some things about himself.

2179
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,360
He was only 39 years old and God,
he looked like hell.

2180
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:56,840
He'd been through more shit for a longer
time than any other American soldier in

2181
02:13:58,501 --> 02:13:59,334
history

2182
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:05,190
in nine years.

2183
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:10,250
And you do a beautiful job of
recounting the story that he told you.

2184
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:15,210
So this is the first person,

2185
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:22,290
the first person report of,
of what happened. And again,

2186
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:24,180
it's an incredible,

2187
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:29,780
incredibly horrifying and heroic story
that everybody needs to read about.

2188
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:37,320
And when he finishes telling
you the story of, of, of how,

2189
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:41,280
what he'd been through up to
that point of going back to book,

2190
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:44,850
I looked into his eyes
and saw troubled soul.

2191
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:50,600
He'd survived captivity for nearly nine
years longer than any other American

2192
02:14:50,971 --> 02:14:55,230
soldier in history.
It had taken a lot from him.

2193
02:14:56,490 --> 02:14:58,800
My God, Jim, that's incredible.

2194
02:14:58,801 --> 02:15:01,980
I said he smiled weakly and looked down.

2195
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:05,880
Prisoner releases began a few days later.

2196
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:07,920
Okay.

2197
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,620
Yeah.
Jim Is truly an unsung American hero.

2198
02:15:10,621 --> 02:15:14,310
Most Americans don't even know of him.
Uh,

2199
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:17,640
the longest held American
prisoner military,

2200
02:15:17,641 --> 02:15:22,410
prisoner of war in history.
Uh, those, I mean, most people,

2201
02:15:22,411 --> 02:15:24,600
they don't know much about
the Vietnam war anyway.

2202
02:15:24,660 --> 02:15:27,630
There's not very much taught in,
in our history books or classes.

2203
02:15:27,631 --> 02:15:30,150
But those who do know something
about the Vietnam War,

2204
02:15:30,690 --> 02:15:33,720
if you ask them who the longest held
prisoner was, they will respond.

2205
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:36,030
Navy lieutenant of Alvarez,

2206
02:15:36,990 --> 02:15:41,990
Lieutenant Alvarez was the longest held
prisoner shot down over north Vietnam.

2207
02:15:42,810 --> 02:15:46,440
He was not the longest held
prisoner from the Vietnam War. Uh,

2208
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:49,910
Jim Thompson has several months,
uh,

2209
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:52,540
more time in captivity
then than have Alvarez.

2210
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,170
So I don't want to take anything
away from, from Alvarez,

2211
02:15:55,590 --> 02:15:59,490
but Jim never got the recognition really.

2212
02:15:59,491 --> 02:16:00,660
I mean it's been mentioned here and there,

2213
02:16:00,661 --> 02:16:05,661
but as far as people realizing and giving
him the honor that he deserved a never

2214
02:16:06,031 --> 02:16:10,950
received that as being the longest held
American military prisoner in history

2215
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:12,990
and he's passed away now.
I regret it.

2216
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:17,800
Well we will do our our best to spread
that word on here and I've actually

2217
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:22,240
ordered a book about
him. Good. And I will,

2218
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:25,990
I will make sure I spread the word to
the best of my ability about his service

2219
02:16:25,991 --> 02:16:27,790
and sacrifice and heroism

2220
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:30,993
and

2221
02:16:31,730 --> 02:16:34,910
the way you do it in here as an incredible
tribute to what he went through as

2222
02:16:34,911 --> 02:16:35,744
well.

2223
02:16:37,650 --> 02:16:38,483
Now

2224
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:43,840
the days go by, they finally pack,
get you to pack up your gear,

2225
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:48,880
give you some new clothes,
put you on a bus and take you out.

2226
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:52,810
And here we go. Back to the book,

2227
02:16:52,811 --> 02:16:55,630
we milled around for half an hour
talking wants to ourselves and getting no

2228
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:57,100
information from the guards.

2229
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:01,510
The staff car returned and
we were soon back on the bus,

2230
02:17:01,810 --> 02:17:03,670
afraid we were heading back to the Hilton,

2231
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:06,790
but when we came to a
row of derelict hangers,

2232
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:10,900
we knew we must be on Hanoi's Guy Lamb,

2233
02:17:10,970 --> 02:17:15,730
no GLM Jhelum airport used
by enemy Mig fighters, jets.

2234
02:17:15,731 --> 02:17:16,564
Throughout the war,

2235
02:17:17,410 --> 02:17:21,610
the bus turned at a shabby hanger with
a Rickety control tower at its side.

2236
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,161
I be held,

2237
02:17:24,161 --> 02:17:29,161
one of the most wondrous sites I'd
ever seen before us was a big shiny,

2238
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:34,090
beautiful. See One 41 medevac
plane parked on the ramp.

2239
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:38,260
The American flag and a Red Cross
were painted high on its tail.

2240
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:43,980
The words US Air Force were printed
boldly on the fuselage just behind the

2241
02:17:44,441 --> 02:17:48,820
cockpit. I cannot describe
the emotion that filled me.

2242
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:56,420
I can't even imagine.
And you guys load up.

2243
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:01,550
Take off pen. Here we
go. Back to the book.

2244
02:18:01,551 --> 02:18:05,030
I was happy yet anxious as the
big jet rolled down the runway.

2245
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:09,800
Once airborne, we remained
silent, absorbed in our thoughts.

2246
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:12,200
We seem to be waiting for something,

2247
02:18:12,860 --> 02:18:17,630
but none of us knew quite what it was
until the pilot came on the intercom.

2248
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:23,390
Thought you would all like to know that
we have just passed beyond Sam missile

2249
02:18:23,391 --> 02:18:27,410
range.
We erupted in a spontaneous cheer.

2250
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:31,670
I was overwhelmed with joy.
It was real.

2251
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:35,780
We were free.
We were going home.

2252
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,380
Nothing could stop that now.

2253
02:18:41,010 --> 02:18:41,810
Yeah.

2254
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:46,010
Yeah. We really, even though we didn't
consciously know it or talk about it,

2255
02:18:46,011 --> 02:18:51,011
we didn't have the feeling that we were
home free until that moment when the

2256
02:18:52,971 --> 02:18:56,480
pilot came on and said, cause yeah, we're
the missiles couldn't shoot us down.

2257
02:18:56,481 --> 02:18:59,090
We were on our,
on our way headed to the Philippines.

2258
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:00,663
Okay.

2259
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:06,110
I'm going to again skip through.
We're almost,

2260
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,910
we're running a little long on time and,

2261
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:13,440
but one of the things I wanted to
point out in here is that you got back,

2262
02:19:13,441 --> 02:19:14,820
you're going through,
you're in the hospital,

2263
02:19:14,821 --> 02:19:19,821
you're going through some of your recovery
and you get asked to talk a bunch.

2264
02:19:20,341 --> 02:19:22,440
Hey, can you come talk to this group,
talk to that group and you're saying, no,

2265
02:19:22,441 --> 02:19:24,120
I don't want to talk to you.
You don't want to talk to anybody,

2266
02:19:24,121 --> 02:19:28,190
don't want to talk to anybody.
And finally you get asked

2267
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,510
one more time and I'll go to the book.

2268
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:32,420
I just want to ask you please
to consider one last time.

2269
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:38,120
This group is the Baton
Corregidor Survivors'
association and they really want

2270
02:19:38,121 --> 02:19:43,100
one of the returned Vietnam
Pow [inaudible] to talk
to them at their gathering

2271
02:19:43,101 --> 02:19:47,690
tonight. You're the only one still
here. I was blown away. Wait a minute.

2272
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:52,100
These are POW survived the Bataan death
march in World War II and they want to

2273
02:19:52,101 --> 02:19:56,360
hear about me after what
they've been through it.

2274
02:19:56,361 --> 02:19:59,840
Of course you agreed to do it and
this is the part that I wanted,

2275
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,390
especially the vets because
a lot of vets listen to this

2276
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:06,940
by giving me an opportunity
I couldn't refuse.

2277
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,380
They made me come out of
my shell and speak publicly
about what I'd been through.

2278
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:16,720
They opened the door to what would become
the greatest therapy possible to help

2279
02:20:16,721 --> 02:20:18,490
me deal with all that had happened to me.

2280
02:20:19,180 --> 02:20:24,100
Many of my friends who have not been
able to talk about what happened to them

2281
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:25,990
have not readjusted.
Well,

2282
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:30,310
several still have major
psychological issues, haunting them.

2283
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:35,080
A couple of days later, I
got an invitation to speak
to a high school assembly,

2284
02:20:35,081 --> 02:20:39,490
which I accepted and the weeks and months
ahead I'd be asked to talk to various

2285
02:20:39,491 --> 02:20:42,790
groups and I agreed to
do as many as I could.

2286
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:47,530
I strongly believe that the opportunity
to share my experience has been one of

2287
02:20:47,531 --> 02:20:51,820
the principal reasons I've been able to
readjust and deal with life as well as I

2288
02:20:51,821 --> 02:20:54,940
have.
That coupled with my faith in God,

2289
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:59,560
love of family and my
inherently optimistic nature.

2290
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:04,940
Yes, yes, yes. I can't,

2291
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:10,060
that is probably the greatest bit of
advice that comes out of this book.

2292
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:14,630
I mean, I came up, I didn't
want to talk to anybody.

2293
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:18,650
I didn't think anybody could
understand what I, what I had to say.

2294
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:23,450
And I think many vets have
the same feeling, uh, you
know, just leave me alone.

2295
02:21:23,451 --> 02:21:27,260
I will get through this and
plus you don't know what I,

2296
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:30,320
what I've experienced and you can't
understand if I try to tell you about it.

2297
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:34,120
First of all,
they can understand to a degree,

2298
02:21:34,121 --> 02:21:36,910
no one will ever be able to understand
everything that you've been through.

2299
02:21:36,911 --> 02:21:39,970
But they can't understand or degree
and they do want the listen. Okay.

2300
02:21:39,971 --> 02:21:41,140
That's the receiving end.

2301
02:21:41,650 --> 02:21:46,650
For you to be able to share
your experience or for me
over the years to share my

2302
02:21:46,991 --> 02:21:51,991
experience again and again and
again and even to write this book.

2303
02:21:52,901 --> 02:21:57,460
As painful as that process was
a is a therapeutic process.

2304
02:21:57,490 --> 02:22:01,870
It's a healing process to be able to
talk about what you've experienced and if

2305
02:22:01,871 --> 02:22:06,150
you think you have demons in your mind,
share those demons to talk about it.

2306
02:22:06,190 --> 02:22:11,050
It certainly has helped me. I, I'm, I'm
doing well. I've been through a lot.

2307
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:15,290
I'm doing well and I think a
huge part of that reason is,

2308
02:22:15,310 --> 02:22:20,310
is thank you survivors of
Bataan and Corregidor because
I couldn't say no to you

2309
02:22:20,740 --> 02:22:24,820
and by doing that it got me started
talking about my experience.

2310
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,100
Totally agree.

2311
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,220
I totally agree.
It's a beautiful advice

2312
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:35,130
and to close out the story here,

2313
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:39,870
you saying the book that you
greet your children at the time,

2314
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:44,370
you greet your children every day with
good morning. It's a beautiful day

2315
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:50,990
and you explain why you
do that in the book.

2316
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:53,553
In a quote,

2317
02:22:53,950 --> 02:22:58,950
I truly believe that every day God has
given me on this earth since I came home

2318
02:23:00,341 --> 02:23:03,400
from captivity is a beautiful day.

2319
02:23:04,900 --> 02:23:09,250
It doesn't matter if it's raining
or snowing, windy or calm,

2320
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:12,760
hot or cold,
sunny or overcast.

2321
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:16,710
Every day is a gift.

2322
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:20,860
Every day is beautiful

2323
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:29,070
and that is certainly something
that I learned in war.

2324
02:23:29,130 --> 02:23:32,460
Not as vividly as you did by any stretch,

2325
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:37,080
but definitely something
that I know to be true.

2326
02:23:37,081 --> 02:23:39,480
And it's something that I
talk about all the time here,

2327
02:23:40,490 --> 02:23:41,323
that

2328
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:45,440
when you see that darkness,

2329
02:23:47,330 --> 02:23:52,190
the light is much more beautiful.
It is.

2330
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:53,723
Okay.

2331
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:58,170
And you know, you put
together in this book, um,

2332
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,780
some eight that you call the eight
steps to survival in a pow camp.

2333
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:07,980
And those I wrote right after
or shortly after I got back,

2334
02:24:07,981 --> 02:24:10,860
I mean the book was written just in
the last several years with those eight

2335
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:14,130
steps for survival. I put those two
papers shortly after I returned.

2336
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:17,730
And what I love about these is as,
as I read through them here,

2337
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:23,420
they're not just for survival in a pow
camp there for life there for life.

2338
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:28,800
They've been tested in the absolute
harshest of conditions in a pow camp,

2339
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:32,280
but they can be applied to life.
And,

2340
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:35,580
and it's actually things
I talk about all the time.

2341
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:39,600
And it's amazing that that
day or so much alignment,

2342
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:45,450
number one, eat. It
sounds simple, doesn't it?

2343
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:50,010
But when you've got to force down nothing
but plain boiled rice, day after day,

2344
02:24:50,011 --> 02:24:52,440
month after month,
eating becomes a difficult chore.

2345
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:57,360
Some found death easier.
Now,

2346
02:24:57,361 --> 02:25:00,720
how does that apply to life for me?
Eat,

2347
02:25:01,410 --> 02:25:05,370
eat the right foods, eat
healthy foods, boom, done.

2348
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:11,100
You want to stay healthy.
Next one,

2349
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:14,250
practice personal hygiene.
When you are sick and starving,

2350
02:25:14,251 --> 02:25:17,940
it's hard to motivate yourself to
keep your body and surroundings clean.

2351
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:20,520
Do the best you can with what you have.

2352
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:25,780
Phil to disease and
disease leads to death.

2353
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,353
And

2354
02:25:29,880 --> 02:25:34,530
again, for me to apply this to
life, this is about discipline.

2355
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:39,140
And this is about routine.
And this is about pride and,

2356
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:43,230
and maintaining those
things. And even, you know,

2357
02:25:43,231 --> 02:25:45,830
we've talked at one of those stories
I talk about on here is the, uh,

2358
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:48,540
the Russians fighting the Chechens.

2359
02:25:48,541 --> 02:25:52,410
And one of the things that in the
debriefs into post operational debriefs,

2360
02:25:52,411 --> 02:25:55,950
when they lost that first push
down there, they said, you know,

2361
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:58,740
once the guy stopped shaving,
right,

2362
02:25:58,770 --> 02:26:01,050
then they stopped taking care of the
weapons that go. Everything goes downhill.

2363
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:04,260
So what, to me, one of the things
that this applies to, I mean,

2364
02:26:04,261 --> 02:26:08,830
you're talking about it from also from a
pure health perspective, obviously. Yeah.

2365
02:26:08,831 --> 02:26:12,000
But it's also a psychological
factor of yes, yes.

2366
02:26:13,650 --> 02:26:15,390
Number three,
exercise.

2367
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:20,760
Set up a daily exercise period.
Do something.

2368
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:24,570
Even if you are in stocks and chains,

2369
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:29,010
you can at least flex a few muscles
and do some deep breathing. Okay?

2370
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:36,150
There is no more excuses ever,
ever, for not working out,

2371
02:26:36,151 --> 02:26:40,020
for not doing something physical.
Even if you're in stock,

2372
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:42,630
AIDS and chains.

2373
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:44,393
Okay?

2374
02:26:45,980 --> 02:26:50,540
Yeah. Not in a recliner
with a TV on. Unbelievable.

2375
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:55,010
Do not give up.
The fight to stay alive is number four.

2376
02:26:55,011 --> 02:26:58,700
Do not give up this fight to stay alive.
No matter how sick you are,

2377
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:02,030
how serious your wounds or
how hopeless the situation is,

2378
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:03,800
there's always a chance you can make it.

2379
02:27:03,890 --> 02:27:08,330
Take that chance with your
deepest courage. Fight for it.

2380
02:27:09,450 --> 02:27:10,283
Okay.

2381
02:27:10,390 --> 02:27:13,870
Made again. You apply this every day.
Look at the opportunities you have.

2382
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:17,410
I mean the opportunities
that a normal person has,

2383
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:20,410
we don't even take advantage of
those opportunities that we have.

2384
02:27:20,980 --> 02:27:24,040
We don't even fight for those.
Fight for those.

2385
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:30,160
Number five, established
communications with other prisoners.

2386
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:34,810
Use Your initiative and imagination to
make contact with others and then develop

2387
02:27:34,811 --> 02:27:35,644
a chain of command.

2388
02:27:36,170 --> 02:27:37,003
Okay.

2389
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:42,830
Build relationships with people. Yeah.
Just build relationships with people.

2390
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:48,710
Number six,
follow the code of conduct.

2391
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:52,550
You must know the code before you
find yourself in a prison camp.

2392
02:27:52,910 --> 02:27:56,930
Then you should adhere to the
articles as strictly as possible.

2393
02:27:58,670 --> 02:27:58,960
Yeah,

2394
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:03,010
and that doesn't mean it here perfectly.
No one could adhere perfectly,

2395
02:28:03,011 --> 02:28:07,390
but adhere as close as possible.
If you waver, come back to it.

2396
02:28:07,391 --> 02:28:09,850
Don't waiver and think that you've,
uh,

2397
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:13,060
you've failed and then just
cave in and give in. Yeah,

2398
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:16,450
and that's one of the things, again,
we were talking on the way over here.

2399
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:21,010
That was one of the changes after the
experiences that you all had is what

2400
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:25,640
initiated those changes in the code of
conduct to give it some flexibility,

2401
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:29,810
right? So that so that people could bounce
back from and say, oh I Bro, you know,

2402
02:28:29,811 --> 02:28:32,700
yesterday didn't make it.
Today is a new day. Exactly.

2403
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:37,010
And I think that attitude is
perfect for everyday life.

2404
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:41,180
You fall off the wagon on something.
Okay, that doesn't do it. Get back on it.

2405
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:42,733
Okay.

2406
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:48,250
Number seven, keep the
faith. Faith in your family,

2407
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:53,020
your religion and your country.
Maybe all that keeps you alive.

2408
02:28:53,080 --> 02:28:57,940
Insane. Hang in there.
You are not forgotten.

2409
02:28:58,950 --> 02:28:59,783
Okay.

2410
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:03,950
That needs no explanation.
Right?

2411
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:11,240
And number eight,
maintain a sense of humor.

2412
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:16,160
This is difficult,
but both possible and necessary.

2413
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:22,310
A bit of humor helps keep
away fits of total depression.

2414
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:26,030
And remember,
depression can kill.

2415
02:29:27,890 --> 02:29:28,723
So yes,

2416
02:29:31,170 --> 02:29:34,760
practice what I preached by my poor
family and close friends. Know My,

2417
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:37,400
my very crazy sick sense of humor.
But a,

2418
02:29:37,401 --> 02:29:41,120
I do have one and I did throughout and
I give a couple examples in the book

2419
02:29:41,121 --> 02:29:46,010
where some very dire times I would come
up with a stupid humor, but I get it.

2420
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:52,160
Well I've talked about that as well and
why we would be in the worst situations

2421
02:29:52,161 --> 02:29:54,900
possible and always someone would
be laughing about something. Yeah.

2422
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:59,510
And that's what like you said,
that's what keeps the spirit going and,

2423
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:04,110
and keeps you on the, on the same side
of things is to have fun with it. Yeah.

2424
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:08,770
Is there anything that, any points that
I missed? I mean, again, I, I don't,

2425
02:30:08,771 --> 02:30:13,370
I miss a lot of points. Anything else
that, that, that you would recommend

2426
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:17,500
man or that you wanted one to bring up?
I don't think you missed anything, Jocko.

2427
02:30:17,501 --> 02:30:21,330
You covered the book very
thoroughly. Uh, you know, the, the,

2428
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:24,250
the title is through the valley,
my captivity in Vietnam.

2429
02:30:24,251 --> 02:30:29,251
And I'm saying that because I hope that
this book will be of benefit and value

2430
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:35,240
to others and that's really what
drove me to finish the book.

2431
02:30:35,241 --> 02:30:37,910
I started it and I was
wondering why I was writing it.

2432
02:30:37,911 --> 02:30:40,420
But I think when the whole
thing is put together, it's,

2433
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:45,550
it's a story of hope and the power of
hope and how anyone can face very adverse

2434
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:48,950
conditions,
challenges in life,

2435
02:30:48,980 --> 02:30:53,970
be be the guys coming back with
PTSD from, from, from combat. Uh,

2436
02:30:53,980 --> 02:30:58,070
be it just a single mother somewhere. W
with problems, others with difficulties.

2437
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:03,340
I think in reading this book you can
come out of it with hope and a and

2438
02:31:03,831 --> 02:31:08,810
hopefully with motivation to, uh, to
overcome those difficulties and a,

2439
02:31:08,811 --> 02:31:11,000
and have a,
have a full,

2440
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:15,750
wonderful and beautiful life
because it is a beautiful thing if,

2441
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:20,130
if we'll just grab a hold of that
beauty and, and go for it and not on

2442
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:24,060
whatever negative aspects there
might be there. There's no doubt.

2443
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:27,930
And even though I did a may
have done a thorough job,

2444
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,580
I read less than 10%,
much less than 10%.

2445
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:37,410
There's so much more that you went
through that he experienced and the other

2446
02:31:37,411 --> 02:31:41,370
people that you talk about who went
through what they went through.

2447
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:45,780
It's a phenomenal book.
It's a phenomenal book through the valley.

2448
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:50,160
My captivity in Vietnam,
there'll be a link for it. Yes.

2449
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:55,170
So you can go to go to the website
and get right and get it ordered. Um,

2450
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,680
you guys know the deal. Do it
quick. So you get a copy of this.

2451
02:31:58,681 --> 02:32:02,010
I should add one thing because we talked
about a lot of the negative stuff in

2452
02:32:02,011 --> 02:32:04,740
the book. It does have a
happy ending. Happy ending.

2453
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:09,240
At the end of this book is Melanie
Ross reader, my wife. Uh, and,

2454
02:32:09,241 --> 02:32:14,070
and that little love story is in there
and how we came together. Uh, but she,

2455
02:32:14,071 --> 02:32:17,340
and then the two younger kids, we
talked about Spencer and Vicky, but uh,

2456
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:21,020
also a chat and a, and Chelsea, uh,

2457
02:32:21,030 --> 02:32:24,420
have brought such joy to my life
and brought this whole journey to a,

2458
02:32:24,421 --> 02:32:26,200
to a conclusion. So, uh,

2459
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:30,240
there's the power of hope and there's
also the power of love that comes out at

2460
02:32:30,241 --> 02:32:35,070
the end of this. It's absolutely
a, it's beautiful. It's a great,

2461
02:32:35,130 --> 02:32:35,963
is a great book.

2462
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:37,623
And

2463
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:44,420
I can't even begin to express
how appreciative that we
are for you coming here

2464
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:48,000
and sharing the story with us,

2465
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:50,430
your determination and your heroism.

2466
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:54,780
I could literally sit here and
listen to you indefinitely.

2467
02:32:56,220 --> 02:32:58,680
And so thank you.

2468
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:03,390
I know you have work to attend to and I
dragged you out here when you're already

2469
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:07,380
working hard.
Uh thanks to you.

2470
02:33:07,381 --> 02:33:10,230
Thanks to your cousin
Ryan Summers who actually

2471
02:33:10,790 --> 02:33:11,623
okay.

2472
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:15,340
Contacted us through the interwebs
and linked us up together.

2473
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:19,510
So thanks to Ryan for doing that.
Appreciate it. And Actually Echo,

2474
02:33:19,511 --> 02:33:20,920
speaking of the interwebs,

2475
02:33:22,550 --> 02:33:25,460
if anybody wants to support this podcast,

2476
02:33:25,461 --> 02:33:29,060
is there any way that they could
do that? Yes, a little bit.

2477
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:31,820
Actually one question real quick.
What part of your back was broken?

2478
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:33,170
Like your lower back.

2479
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:38,330
T l one t 12 l two all in there.

2480
02:33:38,331 --> 02:33:39,370
I'm fuse.
I had just,

2481
02:33:39,371 --> 02:33:41,960
well we didn't get it all my
surgeries after him back but I'm,

2482
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:44,980
I'm all fused together and
wire together on my back. Yeah,

2483
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:47,021
I was going to ask what,

2484
02:33:47,021 --> 02:33:50,600
what did you eat the whole time but this
rice on the whole time while till I got

2485
02:33:50,601 --> 02:33:53,360
to Hanoi and then why I said the bean
sprouts was raped. But what I found,

2486
02:33:53,361 --> 02:33:56,200
what I found is the keep that
diet for about three weeks run.

2487
02:33:56,201 --> 02:33:58,900
And so I had nothing but bean sprouts
couple times a week for three weeks.

2488
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,470
Then we get pumpkin soup,

2489
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:04,720
cabbage soup Kohlrabi and yeah,
and corroborate.

2490
02:34:04,721 --> 02:34:07,230
Is there anything I don't really care
for us and it's, I can't go love right.

2491
02:34:07,231 --> 02:34:09,710
It's actually, but that was partly
psychological cause I had to eat it.

2492
02:34:09,711 --> 02:34:11,870
So I do truly love rice today.

2493
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:18,010
That's kind of vegetarian diet or
less, right? Yeah. Yeah. My was very

2494
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:22,600
low one. Dang. Okay. Um,

2495
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:24,640
yes,
inner webs.

2496
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:29,950
So let we talk about on its
supplementation real quick. Um,

2497
02:34:31,810 --> 02:34:33,400
best supplements in the world on it.

2498
02:34:33,550 --> 02:34:38,550
You want 10% off on it.com/jocko if your
joints are killing you or if they're,

2499
02:34:40,830 --> 02:34:43,030
you know,
degenerating whatever Krill oil.

2500
02:34:43,031 --> 02:34:47,890
I recommend also a bunch of performance
stuff, which is, um, like I said before,

2501
02:34:47,891 --> 02:34:52,840
supplements a lot of the time can
be junk. These ones, you know, 100%.

2502

2503
02:34:57,400 --> 02:35:00,520
Another good way to support is
the Amazon Click through that.

2504
02:35:00,521 --> 02:35:04,210
We always talk about, it's basically
before you do your Amazon shopping,

2505
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:07,540
click through the website,
there's a little Amazon shop banner.

2506
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:10,480
You Click through there and then do
your shopping and then you know that it

2507
02:35:10,481 --> 02:35:14,770
supports that way. Real good
on a subscribe on iTunes
if you haven't already.

2508

of you not having subscribed already,

2509

didn't know that. Uh, I post some,

2511
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:33,340

mcnuggets little excerpts of the,

2512
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:35,990

2514
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:42,730

short, short little nuggets if you will.

2515

Anyway, other inspirational videos, put
some music to them, you know. Anyway,

2516

check out that stuff. It's Jocko,

2520
02:36:03,041 --> 02:36:07,210

efficient of a process now with that.

2521

So basically you get something now,
it gets you way quicker.

2522
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:16,300
Long story, but it's, it's
solid now. So, um, yeah,

2523
02:36:16,330 --> 02:36:20,440
it'll be a good experience. Not that
it wasn't a good experience before,

2524
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:23,980
but it'd be a better experience.
We'll say quicker. How about that?

2525
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:28,210
Maybe not necessarily better or worse than
queer anyway, Jocko, store.com see ya.

2526
02:36:28,211 --> 02:36:30,340
If you like any of these shirts or
whatever, you don't get one of those.

2527
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:33,060
You can support that way.
There's some women's stuff on there.

2528

There's some patches, rash
guards, hoodies, you know,

02:39:40,910 --> 02:39:45,650
thank you for your service
to this great nation.

2577
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:51,520
Thank you for stepping up and going

2578

Thank you for your incredible
determination and discipline

02:40:04,370 --> 02:40:05,203
will.

Okay.

2581
02:40:06,510 --> 02:40:08,370
Not only to survive,

2582
02:40:08,371 --> 02:40:12,870
but to do so with honor and with

2583
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:19,290
and with humility.
And finally,

2584
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:22,830
thank you for giving all of us,

2585
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,580
all of us an example to follow

2586
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:32,380
and for reaffirming to us

2587
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:35,233
that

2588
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:40,730
despite the darkness and
the evil in the world,

2589
02:40:40,731 --> 02:40:45,731
and despite the discomfort
and the hardships we face
and the challenges that all

2590
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:51,290
people must confront,
despite all that,

2591
02:40:54,530 --> 02:40:58,940
thank you for making
sure that we remember.

2592
02:41:00,290 --> 02:41:01,580
Without question

2593
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:07,740
that it doesn't matter if
it's raining or snowing.

2594
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:12,000
When do your calm,
sunny or overcast?

2595
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:17,180
Every day is a gift.

2596
02:41:19,570 --> 02:41:20,403
Every day.

2597
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:22,310
Yeah,

2598
02:41:22,310 --> 02:41:26,820
it's beautiful.
Every day

2599
02:41:29,010 --> 02:41:33,670
is beautiful
and we will remember that.

2600
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:40,800
And so until next time,

2601
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:44,910
this is Colonel William reader,

2602
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:51,780
