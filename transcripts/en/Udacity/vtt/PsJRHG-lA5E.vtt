00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] And the correct answer is that there would be no error. It would still be fair.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Each permutation of the deck would occur with equal probability,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it would take N divided by N - 1 times longer--just a tiny bit longer.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can see that what's happening here is if you remember what our deck looked like,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when we got to the second to last element,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we swapped the second to last element with a random selection from the last 2,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so that's up to N - 1.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If we changed the range to go all the way to N, then we would do 1 more step

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
where we would swap the last element with an item in the range of just the last element.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So swapping the last element with itself--that would be the only choice--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that wouldn't really do anything effective.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It wouldn't hurt. It would just take a little bit longer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so to avoid that redundant operation, we'd use N - 1 rather than N.
