00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.380
It's really hard to see three billion letters

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.810
stretched out and running across the screen or

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.850
in books, but you can very easily see

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.450
all the DNA packed into a cell, because it's

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.350
organized into these neat structures called chromosomes. This is a picture

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.590
actual chromosomes from a cell that was dividing. Inside each cell

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.490
you have a total human genome inside, and it's organized into chromatin,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.490
which is organized even further into these chromosomes

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.240
structures that you see here. Now I want you

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.980
to see if you can do, is tell me how many chromosomes do you think you see

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.650
here? See if you can count the total

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.880
number of chromosomes and enter that number into the

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.150
box here. If you have trouble counting, don't

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.770
get frustrated. Just move on to the solution video.
