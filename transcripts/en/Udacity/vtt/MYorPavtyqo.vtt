00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
And of course, once you've gone through the proof,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.720
this was a rather easy quiz just for relaxation

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.930
after all of these Boolean formulas and satisfiabilities.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.060
So of course, this formula has polynomial size,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.300
because when you constructed it,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.690
we took care of that.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.230
It can encode any algorithm.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.370
We did not make any special assumptions or restrictions on this algorithm here.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.040
It can also encode any input, because that basically just means

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.110
whatever we're given, we encode it into memory and we know we can do that,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.350
and finally, of course, that was the purpose of the construction,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.600
this Boolean formula up here is only satisfiable

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.310
if solving this problem for this input returns a yes;

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.840
otherwise, if it's a no, you can not satisfy this formula.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.570
And this of course is the whole purpose of the construction,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.090
because what we have now shown is

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.600
that solving SAT on this Boolean formula

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.990
is the same as solving this problem

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.960
for this input here,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.390
and what that means, of course also is

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.130
if you can solve SAT on this Boolean formula here

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.280
in polynomial time,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.460
then you have a polynomial time simulation of this algorithm here

00:01:11.460 --> 99:59:59.000
running on this input.
