00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.050
Let's say that we want to
take 14 and divide it by 70.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.175
So clearly this is going
to be a number less than 1.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.250
14 is clearly less than
70, but let's try to do it.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.847
So immediately we say, OK,
70 goes into 1 zero times,

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.180
so that's not going to work out.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.810
70 goes into 14-- well, it
doesn't go into 14 any time.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.270
So we're going to have to
add some decimal places.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.390
So let's do that.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.780
Let's add a decimal
place right over here.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.900
Make sure we put the
decimal right over there.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.620
But now we can think of it as
70 goes into 140 how many times.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.880
Well, 70 goes into 14 two times.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.390
And 2 times 70 is 140.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.510
And you subtract, and you
are left with no remainder.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.150
So you're done.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:53.370
You can write that 14 divided
by 70 is exactly equal to 0.2.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.750
Let's do a slightly more
involved example, like this.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.312
So let's say I wanted to
divide-- oh, I don't know.

00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:06.770
Let's do a little
more interesting.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.070
Let's divide 16.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's divide 16
by-- I don't know.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.640
Let's divide it by 25
and see what we get.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.620
So initially we say, OK,
25 doesn't go into 1.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.120
It doesn't go into 16.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.840
We're going to have to add
some decimals right over here.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.610
How many times does
25 go into 160?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.160
And make sure we put
the decimal above it.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.796
So let's see, 25 times 4 is 100.

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:36.470
25 times 6 is 150,
so that looks right.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.120
So it goes six times.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.630
6 times 25 is 120
plus 30, which is 150.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.530
And now we can subtract.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.910
And 160 minus 150 is 10.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.694
And now we just bring
down one more 0.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:52.860
We add one more place value.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.359
Notice we're not
changing the value.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.730
16 is the same thing as
16.0, which is the same thing

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.580
as 16.00.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.290
So now you bring down
this 0 right over here.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.270
And how many times
does 25 go into 100?

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.890
Well, we know it goes
exactly four times.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.610
4 times 25 is 100,
and we are done.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.580
We have nothing left
to keep dividing with,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.470
so we can say that 16 divided
by 25 is equal to 0.64.
