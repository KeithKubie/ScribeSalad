yesterday was very clear call to action

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330
yesterday was very clear call to action
 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.080
yesterday was very clear call to action
around a fundamental challenge that we

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090
around a fundamental challenge that we
 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.330
around a fundamental challenge that we
have in a learning space which is that

now here's an interesting thing and we
can argue about this point but I would

so what do we need when you take all

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:47.470
so what do we need when you take all
 

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.990
so what do we need when you take all
that together what kind of

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000
that together what kind of
 

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.460
that together what kind of
infrastructure do we need to create very

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:50.470
infrastructure do we need to create very
 

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.930

the knowledge to the four to close the
 

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.260
the knowledge to the four to close the
gap so now is that we have to do the

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:55.270
gap so now is that we have to do the
 

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.490
gap so now is that we have to do the
kind of design and engineering that

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:56.500
kind of design and engineering that
 

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.290
kind of design and engineering that
needs to happen and turn those into

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.300
needs to happen and turn those into
 

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.700
needs to happen and turn those into
products and solutions that actually can

products and solutions that actually can
 

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.370
products and solutions that actually can
go to market and go to scale now we can

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.380
go to market and go to scale now we can
 

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.720
go to market and go to scale now we can
talk more about the demand side but I

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.730
talk more about the demand side but I
 

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.300
talk more about the demand side but I
want to talk about the supply side

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.310

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160
so the question is can we build that
 

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:43.150
so the question is can we build that
infrastructure now here's the challenge

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160
 
 

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.380
 
this is an old chart but it hasn't

the 98th percentile we know we can do
 

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.520
the 98th percentile we know we can do
that we know exactly how to do that but

that we know exactly how to do that but
we allow ourselves not to do that

we allow ourselves not to do that
 

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:41.799
we allow ourselves not to do that

there is a seismic shift is taking place
in learning and education what are some

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:56.870
in learning and education what are some
 

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.750

to investments from the private sector
 

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:09.310
to investments from the private sector
sure and so there's lots of ways for us

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320
sure and so there's lots of ways for us
 

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.289
sure and so there's lots of ways for us
to lower risk out to stick with

00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:11.299
to lower risk out to stick with
 

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:12.370
to lower risk out to stick with
especially cuz been talking a lot about

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:12.380
especially cuz been talking a lot about
 

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.350
especially cuz been talking a lot about

particular in this base so one of the
 

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.980
particular in this base so one of the
ways that you see it is through things

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:17.990
ways that you see it is through things
 

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.389
ways that you see it is through things
like the connected initiative that the

00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399
like the connected initiative that the
 

00:29:19.399 --> 00:29:20.649
like the connected initiative that the
president launched to make sure every

00:29:20.649 --> 00:29:20.659
president launched to make sure every
 

00:29:20.659 --> 00:29:22.269
president launched to make sure every
school in the country actually has the

00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279
school in the country actually has the
 

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:24.549
school in the country actually has the
infrastructure so you get connectivity

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559
infrastructure so you get connectivity
 

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.840
infrastructure so you get connectivity
to the schools you work with the private

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:25.850

a much lower cost for many systems

00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:30.289
a much lower cost for many systems

making the transformation in making the

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:31.909
making the transformation in making the
 

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:34.180
making the transformation in making the
initial acquisition is just a matter of

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:34.190
initial acquisition is just a matter of
 

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.850

for resources but being able to

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:38.690
for resources but being able to
 

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.180
for resources but being able to
aggregate that in a way that lets them

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:40.190
aggregate that in a way that lets them
 

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.919

get in the game like if you don't have

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:41.929
get in the game like if you don't have

the infrastructure everything else gets

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:43.789
the infrastructure everything else gets
 

00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:45.700
the infrastructure everything else gets
much harder the other thing is that

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:45.710
much harder the other thing is that
 

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.409
much harder the other thing is that
we've seen this happen in other sectors

00:29:47.409 --> 00:29:47.419
we've seen this happen in other sectors
 

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:50.110
we've seen this happen in other sectors
is we can actually create demand before

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120
is we can actually create demand before
 

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.310
is we can actually create demand before
the kind of solutions that we want to

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320
the kind of solutions that we want to
 

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.659
the kind of solutions that we want to
see and invest in the research and

00:29:52.659 --> 00:29:52.669
see and invest in the research and
 

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:54.730
see and invest in the research and
development and/or cause of research and

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:54.740
development and/or cause of research and
 

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.260
development and/or cause of research and
development to be invested and so here's

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.270
development to be invested and so here's
 

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.570
development to be invested and so here's
what I mean by that what we know is that

00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:58.580
what I mean by that what we know is that
 

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.310
what I mean by that what we know is that
we've seen advanced market commitments

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320
we've seen advanced market commitments
 

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.659
we've seen advanced market commitments
and other things work in other sectors

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:01.669

is very tricky we should be

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860
is very tricky we should be
 

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.160
is very tricky we should be
to do that and frankly using the

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.170
to do that and frankly using the
 

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.200
to do that and frankly using the
military and others I think we can do

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.210
military and others I think we can do
 

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.610
military and others I think we can do
that especially if we pay attention to

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620
that especially if we pay attention to
 

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.169
that especially if we pay attention to
these adjacencies there are things that

we can where we have real control take
 

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.450
we can where we have real control take
advantage of it and then use it for the

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460
advantage of it and then use it for the
 

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.710
advantage of it and then use it for the
things that where we have less control

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720
things that where we have less control
 

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.570

can convince ourselves that we need
 

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.049
can convince ourselves that we need
better learning solutions any thoughts

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059
better learning solutions any thoughts
 

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:46.370
better learning solutions any thoughts
on that yeah I have a few thoughts on it

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380
on that yeah I have a few thoughts on it
 

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.980

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700
they are illogical they kind of know
 

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.419
they are illogical they kind of know
just you don't want to believe that and

00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:14.429
just you don't want to believe that and
 

00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:15.440

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.680
persons I think a lot about districts in
the k-12 space but I also think about

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:54.690
the k-12 space but I also think about
 

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.960
the k-12 space but I also think about
and so the large ones are easy to think

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:56.970
and so the large ones are easy to think
 

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.100
and so the large ones are easy to think
about because you usually have a

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.110
about because you usually have a
 

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.440
about because you usually have a
research institution etc also think

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:00.450
research institution etc also think
 

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.750
research institution etc also think
about clusters of you can even think

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760
about clusters of you can even think
 

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.150
about clusters of you can even think
about service areas in rural context so

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160
about service areas in rural context so
 

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.650
about service areas in rural context so
you're able to aggregate many rural

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660
you're able to aggregate many rural
 

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.260
you're able to aggregate many rural
districts so that you can get enough and

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:09.270
districts so that you can get enough and
 

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.510
districts so that you can get enough and
get enough critical mass there to both

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520
get enough critical mass there to both
 

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.520
get enough critical mass there to both
be able to do a reasonable size study

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:13.530
be able to do a reasonable size study
 

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.930
be able to do a reasonable size study
and also to understand what some of the

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940
and also to understand what some of the
 

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.900
and also to understand what some of the
differences are the key though is that

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:17.910
differences are the key though is that
 

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.660
differences are the key though is that
you can actually have large and small

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:20.670
you can actually have large and small
 

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.800
you can actually have large and small
clusters if you have the network because

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:24.810
clusters if you have the network because
 

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.920
clusters if you have the network because
then you have a shared data shared

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:27.930
then you have a shared data shared
 

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.570
then you have a shared data shared
infrastructure that lowers the cost for

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:29.580
infrastructure that lowers the cost for
 

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.670
infrastructure that lowers the cost for
everyone at participating so that you

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680
everyone at participating so that you
 

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.130
everyone at participating so that you
can get smaller players into the game

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:33.140
can get smaller players into the game
 

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.620
can get smaller players into the game
