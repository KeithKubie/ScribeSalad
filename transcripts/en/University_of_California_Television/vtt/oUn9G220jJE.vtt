00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.010
- Holistic and specialized
care for children with

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.010
Down syndrome at Children's
Hospital Oakland,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.033
also known as BCHO.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.170
And Renee Howard, who will be joining her

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.010
and following her talking about

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.440
skin problems with Down syndrome.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.343
So welcome Doctor Spinazzi.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.219
(applause)

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.590
- Good morning.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.853
I will be your energy
producer this morning.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.290
I think it's fitting that I get to talk

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.130
about Down syndrome as the
first talk of the morning.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.230
Yesterday we started
with war and I always say

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.980
that if we all had Down
syndrome I doubt we'd have wars

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.320
in our world.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.703
So we'll be switching gears a little bit.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.760
I have nothing to disclose
other than my incredible

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.640
passion for this topic that you should

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.813
hopefully feel throughout this talk.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.610
We have a few learning objectives.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.100
I'd like to start by just
discussing why we should

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.810
have specialized clinic when it comes to

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.080
children with complex healthcare needs.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.270
And then I'd like to tell you what we do

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.620
at our specialized Down syndrome clinic.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.000
And then I'd like to focus on a few issues

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.570
that we've taken up at Charlie's Clinic

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.110
as specialized projects
that I think warrant

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.310
more attention that
they're currently given.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.663
And that's the same
thing in different words.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:54.964
So a study in 2014 by
Cohen &amp; al. showed that

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.420
in the United States 5% of patients are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.400
responsible for half of
our healthcare costs.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.980
And they described six
different subpopulation

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.450
of patients who drive this high need,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.340
and one of them is children
with complex needs,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.600
which is described as a severe

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.280
impairment in at least four categories

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.500
including learning and mental functions,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.823
communication, motor
skills, and self care,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
as well as need in at least
two categories in terms of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.620
enteral or parenteral
feeding, ventilatory support,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.620
really the need for more
than a couple subspecialists

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.340
that are involved long
term in the child's care.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.010
When I went to a talk on
complex healthcare needs

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.360
given by Doctor Antonelli from Boston,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.900
I think he's at MGH or Boston Children's,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.380
he showed this healthcare map.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.080
And this feels so overwhelming and it is.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.400
And it is an example of the healthcare map

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.860
for a child with complex healthcare needs,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.730
and it shows how there's certainly

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.080
the doctor and the doctors,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.800
so subspecialists,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.490
as well as therapists,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.150
as well as school,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.180
as well as other potential involvement.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.320
Social work related, legal
related, financial related.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.690
And one can see how
completely overwhelming

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.350
and largely confusing this can feel,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.660
especially to a family that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.250
doesn't have prior experience

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.590
in taking care of a child
with complex healthcare needs,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.303
which is the majority of families.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.843
So this is a study from Figueroa &amp; al.,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.510
also published recently it's from 2018,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.800
that discussed features of successful

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.130
care models in high-needs patients.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.210
And it highlights four areas,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.437
focus on service settings,

00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:10.770
tailoring the service to a specific

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.220
population with a set of needs,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.460
care model attributes
specifically matching

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.180
the needs of the child with practices that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.620
understand the full spectrum
of the patient needs.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.210
Care delivery features
which include extensive

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.780
outreach mechanisms to
patient's communities and home.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.500
And an overall organizational
cultures that can

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.920
adapt and customize care based on the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.930
changing needs of the patient.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.290
And at Charlie's Clinic we take these

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.343
four core principles to heart.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.160
So how does this apply to
individuals with Down syndrome?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.080
There's approximately 250,000 individuals

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.410
with Down syndrome in the United States

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.020
as of this latest study from 2012.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.460
And as many of us know they're predisposed

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.090
to a number of medical conditions.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.540
And thankfully over the years that both

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.380
the American Academy of Pediatrics

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.550
and the Down Syndrome
Medical Interest Group

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.190
have put their heads together to develop

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.290
healthcare guidelines that can help us

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.300
tailor our care to the individual needs

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.410
and commonly occurring conditions

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.530
for individuals with Down syndrome.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.900
However, even with these
beautiful documents

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.690
that tell us exactly what to do,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.330
there are a lot of challenges for

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.370
all primary care doctors to coordinate

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.210
this comprehensive medical care.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.500
Starting with, let's be
real, the 15 minute visit.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.720
It's just not possible
to address all medical

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.170
and developmental concerns,
it's a huge topic.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.330
Belief that we can do it and do it well.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.670
There's evolving knowledge
and recommendations.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.530
I subscribe on Google alert to articles

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.370
that come out on Down syndrome

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.510
and I get an email everyday with about

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.300
10 articles that have to
do with Down syndrome,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.050
and not all of them are
clinically relevant to me,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.030
but that's still a lot of
knowledge to keep up with

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.880
for just one of a myriad
of genetic conditions

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.920
that we heard all about
yesterday from Doctor Curry.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.640
And then most pediatricians
have only a couple of patients

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.250
with Down syndrome so
there's limited comparison,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.790
and if medicine is all
about pattern recognition

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.770
and recognizing what
deviates from the patterns,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.530
that if your N is small then it's gonna be

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.903
harder to notice those differences.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.100
I spoke about the guidelines,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.330
so these are freely available online,

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.200
they're published by the

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.550
American Academy of Pediatrics
about every 10 years,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.683
and it's a summary of
best practice guidelines.

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:50.360
This talk is about Charlie's
Clinic and yet I feel that you

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.230
should all know about these guidelines,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.980
I won't be spending any
time talking about them

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.410
however I put a summary of the guidelines

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.410
at the end of this talk and
they're on your syllabus.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.410
And these guidelines are
updated about every 10 years

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.880
and the groups are meeting starting DSMIC

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.710
this year in June to
update these guidelines.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.380
Doctor Marilyn Bull is the most prominent

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.330
doctor is known for these guidelines,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.630
but there's many others
that are contributing.

00:07:22.245 --> 00:07:26.170
So this was a study by Brian
Skotko and his team at MGH,

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.700
speaking of big researchers
in Down syndrome,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.510
follow Doctor Brian Skotko if you

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.300
like kids with Down syndrome,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.130
he is driving the research and
the knowledge in this field.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.830
And they looked at their
patients coming into

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.060
this big Down syndrome clinic at MGH

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.520
and what they saw is
that coming in only 16.7%

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.280
of patients were actually
up to date with guidelines.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.500
And again this is no
fault of their doctors,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.530
this is incredibly
overwhelming to keep up with.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.180
And then if you look at DSMIC guidelines,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.500
which are a little bit more
intense than the AAP guidelines,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.723
only 9.8% were meeting
those guidelines as well.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.251
Another study by Ferguson &amp;
al. in Oklahoma and Nebraska,

00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:12.690
less than 15% of individuals were found

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.440
to be up to date on thyroid
screening guidelines,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.110
and this is huge because the
incidence of thyroid problems

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.700
in individuals with Down
syndrome is really high,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.890
and especially in children,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.660
especially in young children,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.210
missing hypothyroidism is huge.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.000
I have a patient that I now follow

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.660
who was transferred from another clinic

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.410
and when I met her, her TSH was 400,

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.410
and it's been gone unrecognized
for a really long time

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.100
and it was probably causing her headaches,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.910
and she poked her eyes so
much that she's now blind.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.930
And she has cretinism too and
this is something that was

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.293
completely preventable had
it only been recognized.

00:08:47.515 --> 00:08:51.210
A study from Jensen et al.
less than 50% of adults

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.020
followed at U Michigan were
evaluated for sleep apnea,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.820
atlantoaxial instability,
hearing loss and vision loss,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.620
all important healthcare conditions to

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.970
keep in mind in individuals
with Down syndrome.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.620
So what I'm trying to point out is

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.010
there's a need for Down syndrome clinics,

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.030
and I hope I'm starting
to convince you of this.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.470
So cue in Doctor Bert Lubin, my hero,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.523
also Santa,

00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:18.250
and Doctor Lubin has a
son with Down syndrome

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.800
and I can tell you that
'cause he'll tell you that.

00:09:21.817 --> 00:09:25.420
And his dream for his whole career was to

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.880
have a Down syndrome clinic
at Children's Oakland

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.120
and here comes this loud, boisterous,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.000
young, young, young, young,
out of residency doctor

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.600
who doesn't know anything
but wants to do something,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.620
and he provided the angel
funding to get this started

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.450
and the ongoing moral support as well as

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.923
academic guidance to make this happen.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.720
So what is Charlie's Clinic?

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.940
Charlie's Clinic is a
multidisciplinary effort.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.020
I am the physician for
Down syndrome clinic.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.680
In the audience today is Marybeth Finch

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.400
who's our infant development specialist,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.890
her time is covered by a grant,

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.340
and I cannot say enough
about what an incredible

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.720
thought partner and
teacher she's been to me,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.230
so thank her if you see her today.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.240
Leticia Gomez has just joined us,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.020
she's our social worker also
covered through a grant,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.020
she's bilingual and she's
starting to help us a lot

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.670
with what are the incredible
social needs of our families.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.370
And then, and this is
what I'm most proud of,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.570
Annika Miller who's our intern
and she has Down syndrome

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.770
and I'll talk a little bit more about her,

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.023
as well as Chanel Brisbane,
her Best Buddies job coach.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.620
What do we do at Charlie's Clinic?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.030
We do a lot.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.060
We provide a comprehensive review of each

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.120
child's physical and mental health.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.310
We compare what has been
done with the AAP guidelines

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.820
and provide recommendations
on how to catch up.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.080
And we potentially identify
and recognize conditions,

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.310
and I would say that that happens
in the majority of visits,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.850
it's rare for us to say

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.611
you're doing a great job, keep it up,

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:11.210
without having any homework to give

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.810
to families and the providers.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.810
We focus a lot on development
with a giant focus on

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.910
independence with
activities of daily living.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.280
Unlike other clinics we
don't yet have the formal

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.030
PT evaluation, OT evaluation,
speech evaluation,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.890
and certainly that's a
dream to have those formal

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.830
evaluations but I think
that there's also an

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.020
advantage to having this
be more of a conversation,

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.610
because it gives us a chance
to give advice in the moment

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.850
and give feedback in the moment
about where the child is.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.030
I steer away from any
table that tells families

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.670
when their child is supposed
to sit or crawl or stand,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.010
'cause the truth is
development is individual

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.230
and I focus more on the quality

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.673
of the milestones rather
than the timing of it.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.100
We talk a whole bunch about independence

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.890
because independent children
are independent adults

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.403
who work and live independently hopefully.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.390
We provide developmental resources,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:18.150
be it handouts, apps, websites,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.130
guidance on how to create
visual task analysis.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.410
We often, almost all the time,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.280
reach out to regional
center case managers,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.050
schools and other providers who are

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.793
interacting with our families.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.420
We screen for a dual diagnosis

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.170
of Down syndrome and autism
and I'll spend a few slides

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.698
talking about why that's important.

00:12:40.698 --> 00:12:43.910
We talk about behavioral
concerns, if there are any,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.610
and give guidance to families about

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.540
how to address them and when appropriate,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.840
refer for more intensive
behavioral support.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:55.577
Often times we also broach the
conversation of medication,

00:12:55.577 --> 00:12:59.744
which for some families has
already been on their minds

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:02.460
and for other families it is a really

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.960
new conversation to grapple with.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.330
Whenever possible we look at
the IEP and whenever possible,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.430
and I get real excited up when I get them,

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.290
we look at the triennials because there's

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.230
so much data and information out there

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.370
about our children and what's missing

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.880
is someone looking at all of it together

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.293
to get this whole child
picture of what's going on.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.585
And then we do a lot of community building

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:33.270
and including warm handoffs
to other providers,

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.150
we put on a lot of trainings
and I'll talk about that,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.973
and we create community.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.740
So we've been around for
two and a half years,

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.123
but we've already given
a lot of trainings,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.540
and I just put them all up here

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.430
to just show the
diversity of the training,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.510
so some of them have been
grand rounds at our hospital,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.130
some have been medical student lectures,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.580
some of them have been lectures

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.930
to residents in family medicine practices

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.970
or other pediatric
practices around the area.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.900
Some of them have been community trainings

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.220
available to not just
doctors but also nurses,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.230
nurse practitioners,
social workers, therapists.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.947
And then parent trainings as
well through our local Down

00:14:16.947 --> 00:14:20.700
syndrome support organizations
as well as help us.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.980
So we're trying to get the information

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.940
out in as diverse ways as possible.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.340
So far we've done trainings
on supporting communication

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.790
in children with Down syndrome,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.360
talking about puberty,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.650
I'll be giving a talk
on puberty in Spanish

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.690
in June at the National
Down Syndrome Congress,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.940
wish me luck, that's
not my primary language.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.549
We talk about primary care.

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:48.910
We've given talks about
the trauma informed care

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.650
of children with special needs,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.730
something I don't think
we spend as much time

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.870
thinking about but just
the trauma that comes

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.030
with learning that your
child will have special needs

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.250
and most importantly the
trauma that comes with

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.800
interfacing with all
the service providers,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.810
because while everybody who's sitting

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.840
in this room does the conversation right,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.730
what we know for a fact is that
not everybody out there uses

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.000
respectful language when
talking about our kids.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.860
And then as of today we're gonna

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.360
be talking about the skin too.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.770
And if you haven't guessed
it from my way of talking,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:28.443
I'm a pretty excited person
and so when we find a problem,

00:15:28.443 --> 00:15:31.960
I have a saying no deficiency,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.800
so we immediately take it up as a project

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.450
and there's been a few issues that

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.550
we've kind of taken up as important areas.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.470
One is a communication toolkit project,

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.190
so developing tools to help families

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.000
support their children's
communication development.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.300
A transition toolkit project to develop

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.550
Down syndrome specific transition tools

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.000
for our teens transitioning to adult care.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.884
A Down syndrome autism
dual diagnosis project

00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:07.030
which is actually a
multicenter effort that's both

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.230
research based as well
as recommendation based.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.980
And then just a lot of advocacy about ABA,

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.740
and as many of you may
know, as of July 1st, 2018,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.080
ABA is now a benefit that's avaialble

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.440
to children who don't
have an autism diagnosis

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.910
as long as they have Medi-Cal,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.066
and hopefully that will ripple
on to private insurance,

00:16:30.066 --> 00:16:32.900
but we don't have providers, right?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.710
The wait time is nine to 12 months

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.330
and that's absurd and that's illegal

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.830
and that's against our
federal entitlements

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.830
and so we've been working
really hard to change this.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.932
Which is why I asked that
question yesterday about

00:16:48.932 --> 00:16:52.030
increasing rates for
regional centers for example,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.610
because until we increase
funding for these services

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.320
then we're gonna be stuck
with the scarcity of providers

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.563
who can't move to the Bay
Area to provide services.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.688
A word about the communication project.

00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:07.413
This is the love of my life.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.933
The boy and the communication,
I'm a big talker.

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.070
So words certainly help
us verbalize our needs,

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.540
our interests, our emotions,
our knowledge about the world,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.300
but it doesn't stop there,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.740
we don't just use words
to talk to each other,

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.740
we also use words to think,
to learn, to memorize

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.240
for executive function, right?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.540
Today, when I was really
nervous I was like

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.750
alright Noemi you gotta chill out,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.460
you gotta chill out, you
can't just freak out.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.420
So right? Behavioral regulation.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.780
You cannot hit your chest like this,

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.083
people are looking at you.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.790
So we need words for a lot of things.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.731
And in our children with Down syndrome

00:17:49.731 --> 00:17:52.320
verbal communication will be delayed.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.770
I describe it as trying to talk

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.050
with a big s'mores marshmallow
in your mouth, right?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.960
Big tongue, small oral
cavity, low tone, real hard.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.800
But the desire to
communicate won't be delayed,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.210
and that's so frustrating, right?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.750
We worry so much about individuals

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.370
with locked in syndrome but

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.330
how different is wanting to say something

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.040
and not having the tools to do it?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.870
And the Regional Center of the East Bay

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.400
which is the main regional
center I interact with

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.333
will look at language ongoing
through the IFSPs and the

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.230
regular evaluations
but won't be able to do

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.700
a speech evaluation until
the child is 18 months,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.560
because that's when it's thought that

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.190
kids can start really
being delayed for speech,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.736
and so speech therapy
services specifically

00:18:43.736 --> 00:18:47.110
won't be put in place at
least until 18 months,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.260
often later because it's
the same issue as ABA,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.300
there aren't enough providers and

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.260
that's no fault to the regional center,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.443
they're underfunded,

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.090
but it's just the way it is.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.970
And when it comes to speech
therapy through insurance,

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.680
the wait time right now
is one to three years,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.000
and that's just wrong.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So we've been working on a
communication collaborative

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.210
with a couple of speech
therapists in our area,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.460
Bettina Larroude, who has
worked with individuals

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.170
with Down syndrome for more than 20 years

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.223
even though she looks like she's 30,

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.920
and has done research, she's bilingual.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.140
Susie Schonberg, who works in one of

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.350
our local school districts
as a AAC specialist,

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.910
augmentative and
alternative communication,

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.150
but she's also a speech therapist

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.240
and has an invaluable experience.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.110
And then Raquel Ramos,
who's a nurse here at UCSF

00:19:48.204 --> 00:19:53.204
and volunteers her time to
us and she's just incredible.

00:19:55.773 --> 00:19:58.870
And our vision is based on science,

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.050
it's based on evidence
that being exposed to sign

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.960
and picture exchange communication system

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.620
enhances total communication
and communication efficacy

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.630
and also speeds up verbal
language acquisition.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.703
It leads to having longer
sentences and a larger vocabulary,

00:20:19.946 --> 00:20:22.123
and as well as regulates behavior.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.590
So our goal is to create
toolkits that we can hand

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.080
to families that include
signs in batches, right?

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.590
'Cause what I have found is that when I go

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.910
and tell families start
learning some sign,

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.270
that feels real overwhelming,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.860
go on learn a new language, go ahead,

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.610
as you're juggling all the other things.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.880
But if you say learn five signs for me

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.800
before the next time we see each other,

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.790
and those five signs have been thought of

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.830
as the right five signs
for your level right now,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.310
and then when you come back and

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.710
you've learned these five signs,

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.770
and if you haven't learned that

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.690
by the next time, no problem, right?

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.510
We'll keep working, we'll keep doing this,

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.050
then I'll give you five more signs,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.890
and then I'll give you five more signs.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.290
And then all of a sudden I feel

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.090
real efficacious in using sign.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.300
And the love of my life
that I showed you earlier

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.710
is the prime example of
someone if once someone

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.430
evaluated him just on his verbal language

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.320
would appear to be profoundly
profoundly delayed,

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.540
but when you take into account his signs,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.520
all of a sudden he's doing much better

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.843
than one would have previously thought.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.860
I wanna spend a couple of
minutes on the dual diagnosis of

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.134
Down syndrome and autism spectrum,

00:21:32.134 --> 00:21:35.240
because it's really common
and it used to be thought

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.310
up until the 80s that
kids with Down syndrome

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.610
couldn't have autism, right?

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.450
They're so friendly.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.290
However, it turns out that Down syndrome

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.560
is a genetic risk factor
for having autism,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.450
and rates of autism in
individuals with Down syndrome

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.140
are higher than those in
the general population.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.980
At least 10% of individuals with

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.780
Down syndrome also have
an autism diagnosis,

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.823
some other studies suggest
a much higher incidence.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.110
And it's a challenging diagnosis.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.140
There's diagnostic overshadowing,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.930
are you stimming 'cause
you have Down syndrome

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.960
or are you stimming 'cause
you're autistic too?

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.620
Are you language delayed because

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.380
you have Down syndrome
and we expect it of you?

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.740
Or do you also have autism?

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.410
Are you really really sick because

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.470
you have a G-tube and a trach and all

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.730
of these other things are going on?

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.730
And that's really obscuring,

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.610
obfuscating the developmental picture.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.100
But recognition is imperative
that when you talk to

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.230
the Down syndrome autism connection

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.480
they'll tell you you've
got to treat the autism

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.583
before you start talking about
supporting Down syndrome.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.980
So what is the profile of
someone with the dual diagnosis?

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.760
Markedly there's a lack
of joint attention,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.700
and if you know kids with Down syndrome

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.279
then you know that they wanna
know what you're up to, right?

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.110
What's going on, what's going on?

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.110
I wanna be in your business.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.190
And that's missing often in
kids with a dual diagnosis,

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.020
but not missing completely, right?

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.620
They might come and look
at what you're doing

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.960
and then be incredibly happy doing

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.290
their own thing for the rest of the time.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:10.470
And the majority of their
play is more self directed.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.260
I'll be over here
playing my favorite game,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.780
you do your thing, I might
look at you and check you out,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.523
but mostly I'll be doing my thing.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.150
Lack of nonverbal communication,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.000
so that's why I love sign, right?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.280
Because when I am following families

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.430
and I ask them what new
words have you learned?

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.590
What about new signs,
what about new gestures?

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.224
How is your child
indicating this and that?

00:23:32.224 --> 00:23:35.130
What often emerges as kids are growing

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.160
is that rather than at least pointing,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.760
shrugging, doing all
kinds of Italian gestures,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.396
hand movements to express themselves,

00:23:44.396 --> 00:23:49.396
there seems to be less
of a communicative drive.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.080
And it doesn't mean that they
don't want to communicate,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.113
but that's autism in a nutshell, right?

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.210
Saying a lot without saying anything,

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.280
that's what I'm talking about when

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.253
I'm talking about kids with
Down syndrome without autism.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.680
A lot of sensory issues,

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.960
and all of our kids can have
sensory issues but they are

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.830
really prominent in our
kids with dual diagnosis,

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.793
especially around food, clothing, diapers,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.683
textures of terrain.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.700
Some kids are more hypoactive,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.060
some kids are more hyperactive.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.410
They'll look at you in the
eyes for a minute and then

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.500
they'll go back to looking
at whatever they're looking,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.320
there's less of that
communicative eye contact,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.360
it's more like are you still there?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.310
Alright, cool. Still there? Okay, cool.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.370
Motor mannerisms, again,
stimming I call it,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.310
the Kardashians of developmental
disabilities, right?

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.650
You come home, you don't
wanna think about anything,

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.570
so you turn on trash TV and
you just watch it, right?

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.600
And how's that different from
rocking or flapping, right?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.070
It's about the same thing.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.380
But if someone would rather do this

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.410
than engage in anything
else and they don't do this

00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.990
just for a minute when they're tired,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.540
but they do it as their
favorite thing to do,

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.300
then I start to get more
concerned about a dual diagnosis.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.130
But here's the kicker.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.490
The sociability is often retained,

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.930
and that's what I see in a lot

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.520
of my kids with a dual diagnosis

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.061
is that I walk in the
room and they're like ah!

00:25:16.061 --> 00:25:17.930
And they come and hug you and then

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.500
they go and do their own thing, right?

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.100
And they're still loving
and that thing that the

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.510
moms of kids with autism alone
feel they struggle with a lot

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.970
more is that lack of
effusive demonstrations

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.610
is often retained in our
kids with Down syndrome,

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.870
and I think that that's real tricky.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.760
So we look for all of these things

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.070
and when we suspect a dual diagnosis

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.950
we don't have the staff
to do an ADOS or an AIR

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.020
or a social emotional questionnaire

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.780
or an aberrant behavior
checklist right in our clinic,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.120
but we do refer out or
recommend an evaluation.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.030
And we focus on the idea
that this doesn't change

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.000
anything about who your kid is,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.153
it just informs us on how
to best educate your child.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.150
There's clearly disparities
in access to healthcare

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.340
transitions in individuals
with Down syndrome,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.620
as published by this group in 2018.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.170
Individuals with Down
syndrome are less likely

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.780
to be encouraged to take ownership

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.740
of their own care than other individuals

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.240
with special healthcare needs.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:29.020
And after adjusting for
all kinds of other factors,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.460
adolescents with Down
syndrome had four times

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.883
the odd of not meeting the
transition core outcomes.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.070
And especially again not be encouraged to

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.990
take responsibility of their own care.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.905
So that's another project of ours

00:26:43.905 --> 00:26:46.270
is developing a transition toolkit

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.620
that focuses on healthcare transition,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.930
and we want it to be
specific because a lot

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.770
of the families that we serve don't speak

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.090
English as a first language or are

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.250
socioeconomically underserved as well

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.180
and it feels really
overwhelming to go and say

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.420
go find a doctor who likes individuals

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.170
with developmental disabilities,

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.640
it feels a lot more empowering to say

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.330
call these clinics and
ask for these doctors,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.640
and that's the research
that we're trying to do is

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.740
who in our community is good
at doing this kind of work.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.190
Also as a side note,

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.210
all those trainings to
medical students, et cetera?

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.020
Is to get them really excited about

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.760
adult care of individuals
with Down syndrome.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.250
But also other aspects besides healthcare,

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.183
like legal decision making,

00:27:31.183 --> 00:27:33.980
who can help you get Power of Attorney,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.560
guardianship, limited
conservatorship or conservatorship

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.450
if someone really needs
to be fully conserved.

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.670
Financial planning,

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.973
having a child with a
disability is expensive.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.440
ABLE accounts are finally
available in California,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.920
we tell all our families
about ABLE accounts.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.270
Special needs trusts,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:58.670
SSI, everybody gets denied
for SSI the first time around,

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.470
we encourage families
to appeal and reapply.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.120
We look at the IEP and encourage ITPs.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.850
In California the law says you must

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.190
start talking about transition at 16,

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.660
but there's nowhere that says that

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.860
we cannot start talking about this sooner,

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.923
and we encourage families to do so.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.840
Nothing about us without us.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.500
So I told you I'd talk a
little bit more about Annika.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.470
She is employed through
Global Down Syndrome

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.900
Foundation Grant and this
is in partnership with the

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.180
Down Syndrome Connection of the Bay Area.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.393
Job coaching is provided by Best Buddies.

00:28:33.393 --> 00:28:35.618
I always feel like I'm an octopus that's

00:28:35.618 --> 00:28:38.770
grabbing people and
bringing them together to me

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.390
so that we can do this work together.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.240
I call our clinic strength in numbers

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.540
and I hope the warriors
hear this and fund us.

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:48.249
(laughter)

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.130
She makes folders for all of our

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.070
families with important information.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.890
She's our laminating queen
and has other clerical duties,

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.500
and she actually brings
the folders to the families

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.340
at the end of the appointments,

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.200
and I always comment on
how amazing it is that

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.110
inevitably the child
with Down syndrome makes

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.110
a beeline to Annika and hugs her and it's

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.300
incredible.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.670
And we also build community,
again strength in numbers.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:19.280
We have had our 3rd annual
holiday party this year,

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.083
and we make it bigger every year.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.477
And this could not happen
without the UC Berkeley

00:29:26.477 --> 00:29:28.580
volunteers that we work with,

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.740
they actually created a Down
syndrome group on campus

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.150
and next Thursday on
World Down Syndrome Day

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.910
they'll be handing out stickers.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.730
One of my first volunteers
is in the audience today

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.920
and it's just so incredible to see

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.760
people get inspired about serving

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.263
individuals with disabilities,

00:29:46.896 --> 00:29:49.180
and they also do a whole lotta work.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.240
We connect families,

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.490
I always ask families is it
okay if I connect you with

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.660
another family so that
you can give them support?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.100
And all families inevitably say yes,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.400
please please I wanna help.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.820
We're gonna have our
first annual spring fling,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.900
a collaboration with the East
Bay Regional Parks on May 4th.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.520
It's gonna be superhero themed and

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.010
there's gonna be incredible things.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.540
And starting in April
we're gonna have monthly

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.000
developmental groups in
collaboration with the

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.050
Down Syndrome Connection of the Bay Area.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.083
We cannot do this just
by ourselves as doctors.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.730
Formal shout out to the Down Syndrome

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.010
Connection of the Bay Area,

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.040
stop by their desk if
you have a chance today,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.610
they're outstanding.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.630
The Silicon Valley Down Syndrome Network

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.760
'cause we are expanding serving kids all

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.530
the way from Fresno to Humboldt,

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.250
we also have to expand our
support network relationships.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:47.023
And they've also been incredible
in supporting our efforts.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.733
If you have a child that you wanna refer,

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.713
some referrals comes from birth hospitals,

00:30:55.713 --> 00:30:57.940
it's a mixed model of primary care

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.540
and consultative services.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.700
So I'm the primary care physician for

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.700
about 60 kids with Down syndrome

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.140
and then we provide consultative services

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.840
so far for about 60 more kids.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.623
So we've grown a lot in
two and a half years.

00:31:13.311 --> 00:31:15.476
And because I'm a pediatrician,

00:31:15.476 --> 00:31:19.870
PMD, taking consults for
other primary care doctors,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.427
insurances minds are blown and

00:31:21.427 --> 00:31:24.350
sometimes we do get a
little bit of pushback

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.780
but there's real exciting
movements so that

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.640
soon we'll also be in the
genetics department at UCSF

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.453
and able to take more patients.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.510
And this is my plea to you.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.730
If you wanna work with
me I wanna work with you.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.480
If you wanna help I want your help,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.430
I never say no to help.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.640
Contact me and we'll take
questions after the next talk,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.693
which is me again.
