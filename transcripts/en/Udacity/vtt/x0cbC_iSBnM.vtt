00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.740
Hi, I'm with Nier again.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.430
In your book,
you talk about manipulation metrics.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.050
Could you explain about that?

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.590
So, ethics is something
I care about deeply.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.610
And, a question I often get is
aren't you teaching people how

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.820
to make the bomb, right?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.420
Aren't you giving people the tools
to use our deeper psychology to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700
manipulate people's
day-to-day behaviors?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.260
And the answer is yes.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.500
That, in fact, these tools can
be used for nefarious purposes.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.390
The reason I wrote this book was
because I worked in the advertising and

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.900
gaming industry and I'm trying to bring
these techniques that advertisers and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.320
gamers have known for
quite some time, but

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.560
to bring these techniques
to the larger community.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.970
To help people build products and
services, not just in gaming and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.810
advertising, but in health care and
in education and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.050
in all sorts of industries where we
can use the power of habits for good.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.190
And so that's really why,
the first reason I wrote this book.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.570
But there's still this test that I
give to someone who's concerned,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.750
hey how do I make sure that I'm using
these habit-forming techniques?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.410
for good.
And so I provide this two-part test

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.750
in the form of what I call, what you
mentioned, the Manipulation Matrix.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.720
The Manipulation Matrix is this
four quadrant matrices where

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.120
on one axis you have,
do you believe that the product or

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.880
service that you're working on is
materially improving people's lives?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.770
Yes or No.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.250
That's the first criteria on the Y axis.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.880
Do you believe what you're working on
is materially improving people's lives,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.860
yes or no.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.540
And only you can answer this question,
right?

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.110
This isn't a test for you to judge other
people or for other people to judge you.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.990
It's sincerely for
this question of, hey,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.340
how do I make sure that I'm using
my limited time on earth, right?

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.250
How do I allocate my human
capital towards something

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.870
that can serve a higher purpose,
that can do some good in the world.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.380
So that's the first question.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.770
But that's not good enough.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.370
Because there's another question
that I think is critical.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.530
Which is, am I the user?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.200
Am I the user?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.280
So there's this two part test.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.180
Now, why do I make people
answer that question?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.430
And, that's what's on the X axis.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.690
If, yes I'm the user or
no I'm not the user.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.740
Do you happen to know the first
rule of drug dealing?

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.038
&gt;&gt; Never use?

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:09.639
&gt;&gt; Close, yeah.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.700
Never get high on your own supply,
very good.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100
I don't want to ask about
your background, but

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.230
let's just go with that, right?

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's the first rule

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.400
of drug dealing,
never get high on your own supply.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.000
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.400
&gt;&gt; So, what I'm doing by asking makers
to consider this question of, number

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.750
one, do I believe what I'm working on
is materially improving people's lives?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.790
And the number two, am I their user
I'm making them break that rule

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.120
because if there are any negative
effects to overusing this product,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.980
if this product is potentially addictive
as opposed to just habit-forming,

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.610
guess who's going to be
the first person to realize it.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.530
So that two part test, I think, puts
you not only in a good moral position

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.110
because you are the user of the product,
interestingly enough,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.420
it actually increases your odds of
success from a business perspective.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.260
You become what I call a facilitator.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.910
If you can answer in the affirmative
to these two questions,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.210
you're a facilitator.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.020
And it turns out that the companies
that we talked about earlier,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.150
Facebook and Google and
Instagram and WhatsApp and Slack and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.070
SnapChat, all of these companies turns
out were started by a facilitator.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.710
Doesn't mean you can't make money or

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.530
have a good business in any of those
other four quadrants, it's just that I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.890
think your highest odds of success, and
you're also in a good moral position,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.480
if you can answer yes
to those two questions.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.570
&gt;&gt; You probably also feel very
passionate if you're the user, right?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.560
&gt;&gt; Right, right, and
you just build better products, right?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.740
The advantage of knowing your user,
right?

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.180
Because, you've got
the user right there,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.730
you've got your customer
in you is a huge advantage.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.450
And, we don't always
have that opportunity.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.590
If you're working at an agency, or
working at a company where maybe it's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.340
servicing somebody who is not you,
as the user.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.120
We don't always have that luxury.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.490
But then again, we always do.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.620
We could always choose what we work on,
and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.700
what we're going to spend our time on.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.750
And so
I think that's the best place to be.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.860
&gt;&gt; Can you give us an example of
how you can use hooks for good?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.210
&gt;&gt; Sure, so a big reason why I wrote
this book is because I want people to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.970
use the psychology of
habits to help people live

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.250
&gt;&gt; better lives, and so

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.610
I actually do a bit of angel
investing when I see these hooks

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.820
in products that I think can actually
improve people's well being.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.100
So, there's several
companies that come to mind,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.130
one company that I'm a big fan
of is called Pantrylabs, and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.140
Pantrylabs is trying to take on this
obesity epidemic, and what the,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.340
the company founders realized is that
&gt;&gt; People were eating unhealthy food,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.340
because let's face it, unhealthy food
is very convenient, it's cheap, and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.760
it's delicious.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.590
So how do we compete with a vending
machine full of refined sugars that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.490
are bad for us, that we know cause
obesity and all kinds of other problems,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.070
and that's the entire vending machine So
here comes Pantry lab and says look,

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.590
we're going to take a refrigerator,
with a door on it.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.390
And we're going to attach like a kind of
like an iPad like device to the front

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.820
and you can open the machine,
the refrigerator whenever you like.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.120
But as soon as you take
something out of that machine,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.570
that happens to be stocked
with fresh delivered food.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.380
Everyday the food is delivered fresh,
full of salads,

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.100
full of fresh ingredients that
are very nutritious and healthy for

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.060
you As soon as you take out
the food from the machine, it has

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.240
a RFID chip attached to it and your
credit card is automatically charged.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.960
So know for the first time,
healthy food,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.460
in an office building is as convenient
to acquire as unhealthy food.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.430
And they're really changing people's
lives, their day to day habits,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.090
it turns out, That losing weight
doesn't have to be about willpower.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.580
It's not your lack of character that
you can't resist these temptations.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.680
It's just that if we make the behavior
easier to do, which is a big part of

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.640
what I described in the book in
the action phase of the hook.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.200
If we make that behavior easier
to do and we build a habit

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.990
out of eating healthy food by making
it as accessible as unhealthy food.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.140
That's all we gotta do, right?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.760
We don't have to expend will power.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.120
We don't have to do this hard work.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.330
And that's really what's so beautiful
about using habits to change behaviors

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.530
is that, when we use habits,
we off load the will power.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.400
It doesn't have to become
a struggle anymore.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.000
It's something that we do day in and day
out with little or no conscious thought.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.750
&gt;&gt; So people will do the right
thing if you make it easier.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.040
&gt;&gt; Right.
Easier, and make it a habit.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.740
Right.
So part of what makes using Pantry Lab

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.390
so easy is I put in my credit card,
that's the investment phase of the hook.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.020
And then I tell it my preferences and so

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.310
more of that food gets
delivered to me in the future.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.700
So this refrigerator that's
just a vending machine,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.130
essentially, gets smarter and
smarter over time the more I use it.
