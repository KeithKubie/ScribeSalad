when looking at how we could reduce app

when looking at how we could reduce app
 

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:45.100
when looking at how we could reduce app
size we started by looking at what takes

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.110
size we started by looking at what takes
 

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.160
size we started by looking at what takes
up the most space inside an apk so we

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.170
up the most space inside an apk so we
 

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.689
up the most space inside an apk so we
analyzed all the apps in the Play Store

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:49.699
analyzed all the apps in the Play Store
 

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.730
analyzed all the apps in the Play Store
and looked at the proportion of space

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:51.740
and looked at the proportion of space
 

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.859
and looked at the proportion of space
taken up by each file type inside the

what you can see is that the top

now if we look inside some a/b case we

now if we look inside some a/b case we
 

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.560
now if we look inside some a/b case we
can see why these file types take up so

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:19.570
can see why these file types take up so
 

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.620
can see why these file types take up so

then for an mdpi device we will only
 

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.090
then for an mdpi device we will only
keep the mdpi resource in the apk that

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:10.100
keep the mdpi resource in the apk that
 

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.510
keep the mdpi resource in the apk that
we deliver to that device and then after

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:13.520
we deliver to that device and then after
 

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.640
we deliver to that device and then after
removing these drawables we modify the

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:15.650
removing these drawables we modify the
 

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.950
removing these drawables we modify the
resource table accordingly to lo longer

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:17.960
resource table accordingly to lo longer
 

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.100
resource table accordingly to lo longer
reference these removed files now

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.110
reference these removed files now
 

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:22.840
reference these removed files now
because we only removed the native

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:22.850
because we only removed the native
 

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.520
because we only removed the native
libraries and resources that would not

have been loaded on that device in the

have been loaded on that device in the
 

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.840
have been loaded on that device in the
first place and keep the ones that would

have been loaded by that device you

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:30.530
have been loaded by that device you
 

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.930
have been loaded by that device you
should see no difference in the behavior

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:31.940
should see no difference in the behavior
 

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.210

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.550
of your app except of course that it
will be smaller

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.560
will be smaller
 

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.470

now we call these apks that we generate

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480
now we call these apks that we generate
 

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.020
now we call these apks that we generate
derived apks as they are derived from

the or uploaded apk each of these
 

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.310
the or uploaded apk each of these
derived apts will have the same version

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.710
code as the version code in the uploaded

in order to distinguish them so then

smaller saving users bandwidth and just
based on disk it also means that if you

the past tell us they don't want to add
 

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.800
the past tell us they don't want to add
support for 64-bit architectures because

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:29.810
support for 64-bit architectures because
 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.020
support for 64-bit architectures because
it will result in a significant increase

it will result in a significant increase
 

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.320
it will result in a significant increase
in their apk size but now since we will

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:35.330
in their apk size but now since we will
 

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.390
in their apk size but now since we will
only include the necessary architectures

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400
only include the necessary architectures

you can add support for new

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160
you can add support for new
 

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.250
you can add support for new

don't need to do that now you can just

don't need to do that now you can just
 

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.690
don't need to do that now you can just
upload a single Universal apk and Google

about some of the results we've seen
 

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.940
about some of the results we've seen
with some of our early partners so

things a lot better so we're just

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200
things a lot better so we're just
 

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.260
things a lot better so we're just
getting started exploring this area and

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:34.270
getting started exploring this area and
 

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.450
getting started exploring this area and
it's really early but we tried it out

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.460
it's really early but we tried it out
 

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.370
it's really early but we tried it out
with some apps that are in our early

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:38.380
with some apps that are in our early
 

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.279
with some apps that are in our early
access program and we expect the average
