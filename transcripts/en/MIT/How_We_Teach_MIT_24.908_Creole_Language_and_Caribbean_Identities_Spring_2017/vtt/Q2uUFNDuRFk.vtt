MICHEL DEGRAFF: So it
was very, I would say,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.330
crucial for me to do this
interview in both English

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.252
and Creole, because I
see Creole languages,

00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:18.335
even in the case of Haiti--
especially in the case

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:19.370
of Haiti--

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.430
as a particularly revealing
and clear test tube or case

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.460
study to really
show how language

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.080
can be such a powerful
tool either for domination

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.350
or for resistance, either for
oppression or for development.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.510
So I would love teachers
who are watching this video

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.090
and will look at
the course to see

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.250
how they can adapt
the content in order

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.330
to address similar issues
in their own community,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.380
because I think that
what you see happening

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.920
in the case of Creole languages
also happens in the US,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.570
happens in Europe,
in Latin America,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900
in Africa, where
language is often

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.640
used as this technology for
domination or resistance.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.530
And I think this course gives
some basic analytical tools

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.080
to be able to analyze
these patterns.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.750
And for me, it's
also very important

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.360
that teachers in Haiti
and students in Haiti,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
including, say, future
leaders or policymakers,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.550
get to understand this
course and the readings

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.100
and to understand that
Haiti could do so much

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.670
better if teachers,
students, leaders

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.540
had this awareness of how
our attitudes towards Creole

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.956
versus French have played
over centuries in keeping

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:41.080
the country underdeveloped.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.260
And if they could get a
better sense of the importance

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.869
of language in
education development,

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.910
then I think the country
would do so much better.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.300
For me, it's a key
bottleneck that we

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.860
have to go past
in order to really

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.110
be able to develop
a nation, is to be

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.470
able to understand the
history and the nature

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.670
of your ancestral
language and to be

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.342
able to use it in a more
systematic and productive way.

00:02:07.342 --> 00:02:09.800
If you cannot do that, there
is no way that you can develop

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.760
a whole nation that
speaks that language.
