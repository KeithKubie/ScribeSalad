00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
There’s nothing quite like a quiet night on the
couch, digging into a tub of delicious ice cream.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.920
Like so much else, engineering has a lot to
contribute when it comes to crafting that
perfect scoop.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.280
In fact, the ice cream-making process has
many of the same challenges as other food
production.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.040
Getting ingredients from the field to your
fork might seem pretty straightforward.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.900
But there’s actually a whole discipline
dedicated to production, sanitation, transportation,
and, of course, how it all tastes.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.500
It’s called food engineering.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.720
And the methods and techniques are every
bit as high tech as fields like aerospace or
nanomaterial engineering!

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.380
So there’s some food for thought.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:43.380
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.400
It’s no surprise that a lot of effort goes
into maintaining the systems that make food,
because everyone needs to eat.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.340
This is a place where engineers can make a big
impact, and it’s only going to become more important
as the human population continues to grow.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
Whether it’s ice cream or something else,
engineering what we eat comes with a unique
set of challenges.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.000
Unlike a steel beam or a semiconductor, food
tends to be perishable – in other words, it spoils!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.440
And while people tend to be picky about what
they eat, microbes like bacteria are much less fussy.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.100
They might already be in food, or they can
easily find their way in through contaminated
surfaces or the air.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.280
And lots of those microbes love eating what
we love eating.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.880
That’s not always bad thing.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.780
Foods like blue cheese are purposely
cultivated with certain kinds of bacteria to
produce their distinctive flavor.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.600
But most of the time, bacteria or viruses
in your food are not good news.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.200
If the wrong kinds of microbes are growing
on last week’s pizza, odds are good that it will
have a pretty nasty effect on your stomach.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.920
It could even lead to food poisoning!

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040
If food sits around longer, contamination
becomes more likely.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.560
So time is of the essence in food engineering!

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.860
From the time the ingredients are harvested to
the moment the final product ends up in your bowl,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.120
there are lots of ways for contaminants to get
into the mix and start causing problems.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.030
Exposing food to too much air, light, or the
wrong temperature can also have adverse effects.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.260
A container of milk left on your porch in
the sun too long will probably end up tasting
strange.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.680
So engineers have to carefully control these
aspects of food production that affect how easily
bacteria can survive and how the food tastes.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.600
Accomplishing all this requires some of the
other fields of engineering we’ve explored so far.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.780
Especially in the case of ice cream, our old
friend thermodynamics comes into play.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.220
To create cream in the first place, you have
to separate it from raw milk.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.120
One way of doing this is with a centrifuge.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.640
Because of the difference in density between cream
and the rest of the milk, the cream ends up farther from
the axis of rotation in a spinning vessel,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.020
much like how swinging a pendulum in
circles draws the heavier bit outwards.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.520
That cream can then be channeled away and
collected.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.640
Of course, other flavor-specific ingredients
might require completely different production
techniques.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.740
Consider the raisins you’d need for a batch
of rum and raisin ice cream.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.510
As far back as ancient Rome, food production
techniques took advantage of sunlight and
wind to dry out fruits.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.240
Less water meant the fruits wouldn’t spoil
as quickly.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.879
Thousands of years later, the process hasn’t
changed an awful lot!

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.320
Since the Sun is a readily available source
of heat, many raisins are still produced by
leaving grapes out to dry.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.640
And since the sugar stays behind as they lose
water, raisins are sweet.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.220
No matter what ingredients you need for an
ice cream flavor, though, you need to mix
them in large batches.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.160
Process control plays an important role in governing the
ratio of the ingredients and maintaining the machinery
that transports them from one place to another.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.260
You’ll also need fluid mechanics, since
the ingredients of mixtures like ice cream
or cake batter are often in liquid form.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.380
You can use some of the same tools that might
transport other liquids like petrol, but, again,
everything needs to be sterile.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.840
And you also need to consider the materials
your equipment is made of.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.520
For example, microbes don’t grow well on
copper surfaces, so you might think that would
be great for preparing food.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.880
But running a creamy mixture through a copper
pipe might introduce bits of metal into the mixture.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.820
At best, it just ruins the taste.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.660
But at worst, it could lead to heavy metal
poisoning!

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.160
Stainless steel, on the other hand, is particularly
resistant to corrosion and doesn’t lose a lot of
material to the mixture.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.060
So say you have safe equipment to move your
ingredients around.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.360
Next, the ice cream mixture, as well as flavor-specific
ingredients like raisins or vanilla, will probably need
sugar and emulsifiers to give it just the right texture.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.320
In the ice cream production process, everything
is combined in a tank, but it doesn’t automatically
mix evenly.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.900
To do that, you need to pass everything through
what’s called a homogenizer.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.990
A homogenizer forces a fluid under high pressure
through a small opening.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.920
That squeezing breaks down large chunks into
smaller particles that are spread out more
evenly for a smoother mixture.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.880
This mix of different ingredients makes the
ice cream more viscous than cream alone.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.650
And since the fluid is thicker, heat will
flow through it rather differently than before.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.940
That’s quite important for what comes next:
pasteurization.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.260
Pasteurization was invented by French biologist
Louis Pasteur.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.000
It involves heating foods, such as dairy
products, and then quickly cooling them to kill
off some of the bacteria.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.600
The resulting products then stay fresher for
longer.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.780
Because pasteurization involves a transfer
of heat to the mixture,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.920
the ice cream’s viscosity has to be taken into
consideration when designing the machinery
that efficiently heats it up.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.500
In the case of ice cream, you have two different
options.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.340
One way is to apply a high amount of heat
for about half a minute.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.880
Or sometimes, large tanks can be heated at
a lower temperature for a longer period of time.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.160
That changes the chemical nature of some of the
ingredients, like caramelizing the sugar for example.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.620
It’s up to the manufacturer whether or not
they want that change in taste!

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.680
Once pasteurization is done, you need to bring
the ice cream’s temperature back down.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.320
And, crucially, you have to find a way to
store it at that colder temperature.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.700
Storage is a vital part of food engineering.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.320
Because of the shelf life of most foods, maintaining
supply chains, which transport food between producers
and retailers, is a tricky business.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.640
The clock is always ticking!

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.040
But the way you package it can buy time, which
changes depending on the food.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.800
Bread has to be sealed in bags to avoid going
stale, while foods like chopped tomatoes are
best preserved in cans.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.400
And the storage environment at every step
of the supply chain can also prolong the shelf life.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.840
After pasteurisation, the best choice for your
ice cream is to quickly move it from one freezer
to the next until it’s ready to be eaten.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.160
If it’s going into a soft-serve machine, it passes
through a single stage of refrigeration before filling
the tank of the machine as a thick, cold liquid.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.960
Or you might want individual scoops in paper
cups, pint sized tubs for those long nights in, or
the five-gallon plastic bins used in restaurants.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.280
Whatever you decide, once you’ve transferred
the product to its final packaging, it needs some
serious freezing.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.800
For ice cream, there are two stages that take
place.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.900
The first is to harden it and the second is
for storing it.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.840
You might think anywhere below 0°C would
be fine.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.400
After all, water freezes at that temperature,
so surely that’s enough to stop any food
from going off?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.240
Unfortunately that’s not the case!

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.100
Depending on how soon it’s going to be
consumed, frozen foods need to be kept at
a particular temperature.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.580
Frozen fruits, such as strawberries, can
have a different shelf life depending on the
temperature they’re frozen at.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:51.520
-5°C might allow them to keep for a month,
but storing them at -25°C keeps them edible
for two and a half years!

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.800
As for ice cream, it needs to be kept
at a chilly -40° in storage.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.880
Any trucks that transport it and the storage
facilities at the grocery store need to have 
a similar freezing capacity.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.200
Blast freezers can achieve this by blowing cold air
over the contents inside the freezer, carrying away
even more heat than the kind you have at home.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.740
But after all that, you can head to the store and pick
up a tub of your favorite ice cream flavor to store in
your own freezer, ready to comfort you when needed.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.280
It really makes you appreciate the amount of work
that goes into that spoonful of cherry garcia.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.980
Of course, food engineering is about more
than making desserts.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:29.340
The world’s population is growing fast,
and the demand for healthy, nutritious food
will grow along with it.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.780
Equipment such as freezers, mixing vats, and
packaging machines all need to be specially 
designed for handling different products.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.300
The equipment needed for ice cream is
different than the stuff for packaging fresh
fruit, or dried foods like rice.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.300
Not to mention the engineering efforts that
go into agriculture and supply chains.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.620
To create and provide the foods we love, engineers will
have to find ways to scale up delivery and production.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.660
All while ensuring that it remains free from
bacteria and still tastes delicious!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:00.040
With a problem this big, even small improvements
can result in vast savings of time, money, and energy.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.920
And that’s a vital step towards a happy
and well-fed world.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.380
Your Nana would be proud.

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:06.700
In this episode, we looked at food engineering.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:12.040
We explored how food’s capacity to spoil
makes it a unique challenge from an engineering
viewpoint.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.180
We saw how many branches of engineering come
into play to process ingredients, ensure safety
for consumers, and package food,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.580
as well as how thermodynamics is involved
in the different stages of food production.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.580
I’ll see you next week when we explore the
world of geotechnical engineering.
