00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:11.110
A 360 degree Panoramic Dome Microwave, and
Air-In Shower technology uses 35% less water

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.840
by putting tiny air bubbles inside each droplet
of water.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.750
Vsauce, Kevin here.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.650
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.900
Ghent University in Belgium has developed
a contact lens that displays text.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.590
The transparent lens can modulate the transmitted
light using LCD technology, and the image

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.000
is visible to other people- not the wearer.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.540
But, they are currently researching ways to
display text to the person wearing the lens

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.710
and hope to create a way for road directions,
text messages, and emails to be on your eyes

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.710
within five years.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760
DARPA is developing a foam to help wounded
soldiers and mitigate damage from internal

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760
hemorrhaging.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.489
The Wound Stasis Technology is designed to
be administered on the battlefield and works

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.780
with two liquid phases, injected internally,
that mix to become foam which molds around

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.860
the organs, compressing internal wounds until
the patient can be safely transported to a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.280
surgeon, who the easily removes the foam and
treats the injury.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.380
Kenshiro is a humanoid robot that copies your
muscles and bones.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.690
It's the closest to a human form so far and
mimics the body of the average japanese 12-year-old

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.740
male with the same weight ratios.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.570
It has 160 pulley-like muscles, does squats,
and features aluminum bones.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.840
Newly discovered loris?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840
Check.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840
Brand new species?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840
Check.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.840
Extremely cute?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
Check.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
Venomous teeth?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
CHECK.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.430
GravityLight is an alternative to kerosene
lamps that harnesses the power of gravity.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.119
The LED lanterns cost less than $10 to buy
with no running costs, and the 3 seconds it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.299
takes to lift the weight made up of a bag
filled with rocks or dirt powers the light

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.330
for half an hour.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.580
It has no batteries, is specifically for third
world countries without reliable access to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.549
mains electricity, and you can find out more
over at their website.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.380
University of Bath researchers are claiming
that vector-based video will lead to the death

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.619
of the pixel within the next five years.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.190
Digital pictures are made up of a rectangular
grid of colored cells or pixels.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.329
The smaller and closer together, the higher
the quality and amount of data that needs

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.329
to be compressed.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.200
But, vectors present contoured colors presenting
the highest visual quality without a bunch

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.709
of pixels needing to be compressed, and they
say this will revolutionize the way visual

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.060
media is produced.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.450
"Yo, you got Sneaker Speakers?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.069
Yeah, alright..."

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.209
Neuroscientists and software engineers at
the University of Waterloo in Canada have

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.669
built the most complex artificial brain ever.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:43.290
Spaun isn't just a super computer- it mimics
the structure of a real brain, and has 2.5

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.439
million simulated neurons constructed to pattern
the brain's cranial subsystems.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:54.189
It also has a digital eye for visual input,
a robot arm to draw responses, and can pass

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.150
very basic IQ tests.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.109
Finally, Further Up Yonder is a time-lapse
from the International Space Station put together

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:28.620
by Giacomo Sardelli.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.819
I'm gonna leave you with a radar sequence
of an asteroid that's over 4 million miles

00:03:33.819 --> 00:04:20.099
away from Earth and, as always, thanks for
watching.
