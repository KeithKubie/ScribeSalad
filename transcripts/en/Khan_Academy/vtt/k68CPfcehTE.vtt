00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's try to
calculate 3 times 32.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.380
And I like to rewrite it, and
this is one way of doing it.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.390
I like to rewrite it where I
have a larger number on top.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.180
So in this case it's 32.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.202
And I write the smaller
number right below it.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.160
And since the smaller
number is only one digit,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.670
it's only a ones digit, I
put that below the ones place

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.550
on the larger number.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.440
So I'll put the 3
right over here.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.950
And of course, we can't forget
our multiplication symbol.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.490
And this is essentially a
way of saying the same thing.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.650
You could read
this as 32 times 3.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.600
But 32 times 3 is the exact
same value as 3 times 32.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.200
It doesn't matter what
order you multiply in.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.419
Now let's try to compute it.

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.460
And once again, this is
only one way of doing it.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.750
There's many ways of doing it.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890
And I want you to think
about why this works.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.790
We'll start with
this 3 down here,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.730
and we're going to multiply it
times each of the digits in 32.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.510
So we'll start with 3 times 2.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.627
Well, 3 times 2 from our
multiplication tables,

00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:56.460
and you can figure it
out even if you didn't

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.660
know your multiplication
tables, is 6.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.400
So 3 times 2, I'll write 6 right
over here in the ones place.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.130
Now we're going to figure
out what 3 times 3 is.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.170
Well, once again, we
know that 3 times 3 is 9.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.100
And since I'm multiplying times
the tens place right over here,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.160
I'm going to put it in the
tens place right like this.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.810
So we're done.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.150
We got 32 times 3 is 96.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.800
And I really encourage you to
think about why this worked.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.942
And I'll give you a
little bit of a hint here.

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:28.400
I'll give you a little bit of
a hint about why this worked.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.120
Remember, 3 times 32 is the
same thing as 3 times 30

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.657
plus 3 times 2.

00:01:38.657 --> 00:01:40.240
And if you look at
it that way, that's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.100
essentially what
this process did.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.180
We did 3 times 2 is 6.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.670
3 times 30 is 90.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.380
You add them together,
you get 90 plus 6 is 96.
