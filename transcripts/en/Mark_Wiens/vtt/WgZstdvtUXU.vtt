Hey everyone, this is Mark Wiens with Eating
Thai Food dot com.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.840
Today I'm at one of the ultimate vegetarian
food courts in Bangkok, it's called Baan Suan

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.290
Pai, also known as Banana Family Park.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.630
Of course, if you're vegetarian or vegan you're
going to absolutely love this place, but the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.730
food is so good here, you'll want to eat here
even if you're a carnivore.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.050
To get to Baan Suan Pai take the BTS to Ari
station, take exit number one and go down

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.500
the stairs to your left, walk along Phahon
Yothin road for about one hundred meters until

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.260
you reach a sign that says welcome to banana
family park.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.100
Turn right into the small cafe alley way,
walk all the way to the back past a few coffee

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.490
shops and a few stores until you can smell
the delicious vegetarian food.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.750
It's like a food court style, so you order
your food here and then you go sit at a table.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.270
As you can see, I went a little crazy, but
the food all looked so good that you can easily

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.190
accumulate a bunch of different things.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:14.049
I'm going to go through the food right now
and show you exactly what I ordered.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.860
I got a dish, it's a curry made with pumpkin.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.470
Bitterness is an excellent flavor but it does
take a little getting used to.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.170
Ohh, I love that.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.320
This is called puak tod, and this is taro
ground up and then it's fried on the outside

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.770
into a loaf.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.189
Add some of this sauce.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.890
Got a quick dish here called kuay teow lui
suan, it's like a noodle wrapper filled with

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.799
lettuce, some herbs, I think there's some
tofu and mushrooms in that.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.850
It's very fresh, the sweet and sour and spicy
sauce is fantastic.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.800
This is probably my favorite thing at this
whole restaurant, these beautiful skewers

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.700
of steak.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.200
No they're not steak actually, they are mushrooms.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.920
I just wanted to mention the vegetarian Thai
food guide.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.849
It's an eighty page ebook stuffed with useful
information and tips about how you can order

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.800
and eat tastiest vegetarian and vegan food
that Thailand has to offer.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.230
If you're vegetarian, if you're vegan, or
even if you just want to start eating healthy

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.900
delicious Thai food, make sure you get your
own copy of the vegetarian Thai food guide,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.050
so you can take advantage of this awesome
food, it's just incredible.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.200
Anyways, as you can see, I still have a bunch
of food left on the table, I'm about to dig

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.190
in and finish it all.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.739
I finished off all of the food except for
this last bite which is the last remaining

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:12.630
piece of het hom ping, the absolute sirloin
kobe beef of all mushrooms and it's fully

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.010
vegetarian.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:25.940
It just melts in your mouth, it's juicy, it's
tender, that will put a smile on your face

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.940
any day.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.379
