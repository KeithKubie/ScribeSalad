00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
just begins with hey it's gonna happen
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850
just begins with hey it's gonna happen
really soon just like all the other

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
really soon just like all the other
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.130

purge films you meet your heroes the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
purge films you meet your heroes the
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.749
purge films you meet your heroes the
people you're supposed to care about and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
people you're supposed to care about and
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.819
people you're supposed to care about and
then the purge starts and really the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
then the purge starts and really the
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740
then the purge starts and really the
only major difference with the purge

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
only major difference with the purge
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.920
only major difference with the purge
sequences is that less people are killed

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
sequences is that less people are killed
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810
sequences is that less people are killed
because people are still kind of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
because people are still kind of
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480
because people are still kind of
uncomfortable with it so there's less

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
uncomfortable with it so there's less
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149
uncomfortable with it so there's less
carnage and less death and so I feel

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
carnage and less death and so I feel
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.370
carnage and less death and so I feel
like fans of this franchise aren't going

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
like fans of this franchise aren't going
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050
like fans of this franchise aren't going
to be happy with that because this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
to be happy with that because this
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.389
to be happy with that because this
franchise tries to be very political and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
franchise tries to be very political and
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490
franchise tries to be very political and
it tries to have a social message but in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
it tries to have a social message but in
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469
it tries to have a social message but in
the long run the people who go to see

that's the only reason these movies make
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.930
that's the only reason these movies make
their budget back because they're very

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
their budget back because they're very
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999
