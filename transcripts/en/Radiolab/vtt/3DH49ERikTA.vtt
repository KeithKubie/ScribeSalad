1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.460
Egg. This is Jad. Before we get started on the podcast, just two things. First,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.390
the MailChimp challenge we did a little while back. Uh, we did it.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.733
You guys did it.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.430
I mean the deal was if a certain number of you became sustaining members,

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:19.170
MailChimp would pitch in with some money. It happened and we're super grateful.

6
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:22.560
So thank you. We forget did it. Okay. Number two,

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.740
I want to let you know that toward the end of this podcast,

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:30.610
it's about to happen. Hey, yeah, we haven't even said it yet. Wait, wait, wait.

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.210
We're excited. Yeah, we're happy to be here.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.750
You guys love to hang out until the the end. Is that cool? Why?

11
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:40.410
Why do we have to be at the end? That was, can we just be up top?

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
But that was the deal. We talked, this is my rosa parks moment.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.010
I met them in front of this episode.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.510
And you know why we can say that is because we are black. Yeah,

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740
you're putting me in a box. [inaudible].

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.090
So what I was gonna say is if we're going to, at the end of this podcast,

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.030
we're going to come back and I'm going to introduce you guys listening to two

18
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.970
very funny people who you just heard Phoebe Robinson, Jessica Williams,

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.750
they're starting a podcast here at w NYC studios. It's called two dope queens.

20
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
It's awesome. We'll talk about it. All right. So you guys all hang out?

21
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.530
Yeah. Alright, cool.

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.090
<v 1>Oh wait, you're listening,</v>

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.180
<v 2>listening to radio lab radio from W N Y s e</v>

24
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.520
Jad Robert Radiolab.

25
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.660
So I'm going to just tell you the story just very briefly.

26
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:37.110
I'm going to tell you the story of three enormous mysteries,

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.280
two of which you know very well,

28
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.820
and one of which I bet you've never heard of ever. Hmm. Okay.

29
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.390
Mystery number one. This is the one I know, or the one that is the one,

30
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.960
you know. All right. So about 4 billion years ago,

31
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.350
the earth is one huge,

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.360
mostly ocean of lifeless chemicals. [inaudible]. And then for some reason,

33
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.870
which we have never really been able to understand lifeless chemicals,

34
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.871
suddenly Printemps a pulse and you get life.

35
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.320
Hello? Yes, I have just arrived now. Hey, wonderful. Like nick for example,

36
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.200
<v 0>Nick Lane. I am a professor of evolutionary biochemistry,</v>

37
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.870
a University College in London. Nick

38
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.850
<v 2>is the main guy in the story I'm about to tell you,</v>

39
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:21.550
but just to continue this set up, that was mystery number one.

40
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:23.560
Where does life come from next?

41
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.330
Mystery number three to make it more interesting. What about the two?

42
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.910
Two is going to be the subject of the stories and more important.

43
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:34.210
The middle blend is the deep surprise because you've never heard of it,

44
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.770
so I thought I would skip over to to remind you how familiar you are with one in

45
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:43.450
three fine, go to three and then come back to t three. All right.

46
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.680
Consciousness. For some reason, for some reason,

47
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.150
one animal on the planet and only one that we can notice seems to spring into

48
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:57.100
this very elaborate sense of self awareness. We don't know why it happened.

49
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:59.920
We don't know how it happened. It just right.

50
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 3>I'm familiar with one and three. You are now. Here's number two.</v>

51
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.490
That's the one that keeps nick up at night. Yeah. Because those are kind of a,

52
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:09.071
a gap,

53
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.270
a black hole where everything important in biology happened and we have very

54
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:18.250
little insight into what, what it was black hole and biology. I like that.

55
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.840
So you want to know what it is? This black hole? Yes you do.

56
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.550
You do. You know you do. Okay. Yes. Mystery number two,

57
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.250
pay. We're a little bit past one way before three,

58
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.050
4 billion years ago. We got life. It's just floating around, you know,

59
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.800
little specks in the ocean, you know, very simple cells.

60
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.880
Probably pretty much like a a bacterium as we know them today.

61
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.560
This is very small for a start.

62
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.870
If you're looking at the period at the end of a sentence,

63
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:52.230
say is it about that size or smaller than a much smaller,

64
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.580
much smaller than that. A couple of thousandths of a millimeter long.

65
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.860
So tiny, tiny things.

66
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000
They all look the same in the size and shape and they don't seem to be doing

67
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:05.320
anything. Very interesting. Well, you know,

68
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.870
they were having babies and they were using energy and they were feeling a lot

69
00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:12.800
of things out. But if you look inside one of these little things,

70
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.600
not much going on. S inspiration, eat is often described as a bag of chemicals.

71
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.950
They're not complex, they're not complex, simple, simple as can be,

72
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.600
and it goes on like this for millions of years and then tens of millions of

73
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:31.130
years and hundreds of millions of years. Well, really 2 billion years or so,

74
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.170
2 billion years if not longer. You just have tiny, tiny, simple,

75
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.760
tiny, simple popping, bopping, sitting, drifting in the water, bopping, bopping,

76
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.840
pupping, bopping, nothing. Nothing, nothing. No. Come on. No, I look,

77
00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:47.330
I'm telling you this for us for a good reason. There is,

78
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.380
you should know there is no rule which says life has to get bigger.

79
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.450
We could've stayed infinitely small, 400 billion years,

80
00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.660
you know, forever. Really? Really? Yes, really. But then Chad,

81
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.180
something happened

82
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.750
as they say about 2 billion years ago. All of a sudden, practically overnight,

83
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.620
a new kind of life shows up a new sound and it's

84
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.220
a lot bigger than what was before. And these first ones, the,

85
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:27.030
the actual volume went out around about 10,000 times bigger. Well,

86
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.840
massive increase in size. It's like we just jumped from specs

87
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.660
to battle ships and inside these massive pieces of complex machinery and it

88
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:42.540
becomes bigger and bigger and more complex.

89
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:47.541
And it ultimately leads to jellyfish giant redwood trees,

90
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.410
Beluga whales, Beluga Caviar, which is baby whale.

91
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.880
It's not [inaudible]. Well, nevermind Sherri. Trees hurdles.

92
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.270
Librarians are range

93
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.110
<v 2>chillers, orangutans, elephants, teradeck titles. There's your second mystery.</v>

94
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.640
Like how did life for such an enormously long time say so simple,

95
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.120
so dull and so tiny, and then boom,

96
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:15.680
you get these big life forms like what happened and why did it not happen for

97
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.180
such a long time?

98
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.343
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

99
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.120
<v 2>Well, are you going to enlighten me with some attempts at answers? Yes,</v>

100
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.220
but I want to remind you, this is a few that we've got here. Just, you know,

101
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.490
we're making an hypothesis. I mean, who,

102
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.720
who knows really exactly what happens. I mean, we're never going to get,

103
00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:38.340
we're never gonna find like found footage of that moment, right? We can,

104
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.060
we can only imagine and we can only use the evidence that we've got now.

105
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.720
That is ed young. I'm a science writer. At the Atlantic.

106
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.770
It's the guy who introduced me to nick or Nick's work and this theory,

107
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.730
and he says, here's the important thing to know. I mean,

108
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.080
I think during those 2 billion years when nothing much happened,

109
00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.480
it wasn't that life didn't get complicated.

110
00:06:57.481 --> 00:07:02.190
It's the life couldn't get complicated. There is a barrier.

111
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.220
There is an energetic canyon that simple cells find themselves trapped in

112
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.390
what it means. It's, it's a huge deal to try to get big.

113
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.430
Think about what it takes to get bigger or it takes bigger soul balls.

114
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.820
It takes more surface, more openings, let things in, push things out,

115
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:21.260
more power, more moving parts,

116
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.240
and then they make the whole thing fit and work together.

117
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.640
You got to have a bigger design planets, your DNA,

118
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:30.641
so you're going to need more DNA and all that DNA needs to be copied.

119
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.450
You're gonna need some DNA copiers.

120
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:35.480
You then need to read the information that's encoded within it,

121
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.370
some DNA meters and you need to use that information to build protein and some

122
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.550
builders and that last bit is especially costly. In other words,

123
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.030
you don't get bigger for free. Every new step takes extra energy.

124
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.730
Just like if you're going to, um, you know,

125
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:52.850
if you're going to increase the size of your company by a thousand times,

126
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:54.890
if you're going to have a thousand times more employees,

127
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.540
you're going to need to pay them all. Where are you going to get the money?

128
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.240
I mean, you and I, we might be able to go to a bank,

129
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.720
but if you're a teeny little thing, you don't have any place to go.

130
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:07.270
So how do you get bigger? I mean,

131
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:11.770
can't you just eat more food than you normally eat so that you get more energy

132
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.920
so that slowly over time you get bigger? No, no. I mean, well,

133
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:18.640
you could do that, but suppose you don't have the stomach to absorb the food.

134
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.530
Uh, you make a stomach somehow way, I don't know. In order to make the stomach,

135
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.130
you gotta eat more food to build a stomach, but in order to eat more food,

136
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:28.270
you gotta have the stomach.

137
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:31.240
But you can't really have the stomach unless you eat the food and you can't eat

138
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.320
the food. And that you have the stomach, you're stuck in a whole kind of,

139
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.160
it's like a, it's a catch 22 kind of a thing.

140
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.520
You're stuck in what Ed Calls Er in Energetic Canyon and to climb over the walls

141
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:46.210
of that canyon and to start experimenting with complexity,

142
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.430
you need something improbable to happen. You need something very special,

143
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.440
so special and so improbable that according to theory,

144
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.630
over the course of all of our planet's history,

145
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.880
that has only happened successfully once. What? What happened? Well,

146
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:03.714
here's the theory,

147
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.450
<v 3>here's life bopping along and it's boring, boring, boring way.</v>

148
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:12.450
Everything is very tiny, very simple. And then one day,

149
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.560
two single celled creatures start

150
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.780
<v 2>drift towards one another.</v>

151
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.520
One of them is an Oken little blob and one of them is a bacteria,

152
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.560
another little blob, but smaller.

153
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.670
They belonged to the two great houses of simple things in the Montague's and

154
00:09:32.411 --> 00:09:35.540
Capulets of 2 billion BC. Anyways,

155
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.220
these two little cells start to get near each other slowly.

156
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.420
<v 3>Yeah. What each cell wants is what the other one has to offer.</v>

157
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.860
Nikki imagines that, I don't know,

158
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:48.200
maybe the little one was expelling some kind of chemical. Let,

159
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.850
let's say some something like hydrogen gas, just for the sake of an argument.

160
00:09:51.851 --> 00:09:53.260
Let's say the big one likes hydrogen.

161
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.120
That's what he wants and maybe the big one spits out nitrogen,

162
00:09:58.121 --> 00:09:59.320
which is what the little one wants.

163
00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:02.500
So they kind of come together and they snuggle up.

164
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.030
Totally ordinary thing. It happens all the time with cells, he said,

165
00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:08.650
but in this case,

166
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.920
that snuggling gets closer and closer until somehow those two cells meet and

167
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.420
they merge. They just squished together. How did they merge? Uh, you know,

168
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.920
membranes, fuse cell walls don't always form. Maybe the big,

169
00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.670
<v 2>when it had a hole in its wall and a little one just fell through the hole.</v>

170
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.780
I don't really know what the mechanism is, but we do know as possible.

171
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.150
The point is somehow this little guy gets in,

172
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.480
the bacterium finds itself inside the Arcane.

173
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.750
So that's the first thing that happens. One little guy gets inside,

174
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.340
another little guy. Okay,

175
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.800
<v 3>I got to tell you, this is, this is, this is extremely rare. For the most part,</v>

176
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.180
sells don't get inside other cells and when they do get inside of the cells,

177
00:10:54.181 --> 00:10:56.520
for the most part, it doesn't work out.

178
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.490
Because if you're this little guy on the inside and now you're trapped,

179
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.200
you can't get to the things you want to eat.

180
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.230
It's cutoff from the outside world and chances are

181
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.940
<v 2>it will die, which is what happens. You know,</v>

182
00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:09.550
99.999% of the time,

183
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.040
but not this time.

184
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.750
<v 3>If, if the, if the swallower is capable of,</v>

185
00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:20.670
of bringing in that outside world and feeding it, spoon feeding it to us,

186
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:23.130
swallow he, if you like, then then it will work.

187
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.470
And maybe that's what happened here. Says an equity,

188
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.820
maybe the big sell had some kind of mutation that allowed it to keep feeding the

189
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:30.900
little cell in its belly.

190
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:35.160
So the little self survives and thrives because the second thing that happens

191
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:40.020
here is the little cell of the inside starts to devise.

192
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:41.310
So now you have, you know,

193
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.090
a cell with two cells inside it and maybe then four cells inside it,

194
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.020
which if you're a big cell, it's normally not a great situation.

195
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.410
You find yourself with weak guests inside.

196
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:55.030
You imagine having a house party in [inaudible],

197
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:58.810
the guests won't go away damning into cost among themselves. If you like.

198
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.070
I'm producing more guests.

199
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.370
There's going to be a riot and that was going to be a mudder or something.

200
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.510
<v 2>The point is says neck. When you get to this point, it really shouldn't work,</v>

201
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.760
but somehow it did. Like not only did one cell get in another,

202
00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:15.720
which is rare,

203
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.890
and then that so survive even rare and then divided without creating a riot.

204
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.970
Even rare,

205
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:25.170
but then somehow this big cell finds ways over and over taking care of holes,

206
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.370
little new house guests

207
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.470
<v 5>and they, they're, they're, they're all stages of their life cycle.</v>

208
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.470
You've got some old folk in there and you've got some babies in there and how

209
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:34.150
are you going to do it? Well, you'll probably need to,

210
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.870
let's put it in a maternity ward. First of all, to look after the babies. Let's,

211
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.800
uh, you know, let's, let's, let's put in some kind of clinic for end of life.

212
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:44.020
For the, for the, for the geriatrics

213
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.063
<v 2>sauna. Oh,</v>

214
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.070
this big sell is able to construct all this new machinery inside itself to keep

215
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:55.220
this extraordinarily various group of house guests happy. Wait,

216
00:12:55.221 --> 00:12:59.410
why, why would it bother? I mean like what is the, I mean,

217
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.520
what is the sell get in return? And you,

218
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.390
you said that it didn't have enough energy to build itself bigger.

219
00:13:05.391 --> 00:13:07.590
So how is it even doing this? Well now,

220
00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:09.800
now you're getting to the real nub of the story.

221
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.680
The key here says nick is those little house guests.

222
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.250
They're living now in the big sale. Yeah. They're not ordinary house guests.

223
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.080
They are a very specific kind of bacteria that we now call Mitochondria.

224
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.650
And if you look at the descendants of those little guys who live in us right

225
00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:25.010
now,

226
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:30.010
they have an amazingly strong electrical charge that sort of radiates across the

227
00:13:33.321 --> 00:13:34.670
membrane on their outside.

228
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.680
<v 5>And that electrical charge is, you know, it's, it's tiny.</v>

229
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.610
It's a 150 millivolts. Um,

230
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.680
but if you shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule,

231
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.910
uh, and feel the strength of the electric field right next to that membrane,

232
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.120
it's actually 30 million volts per meter, which is equivalent to a,

233
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.240
<v 3>a bolt of lightning. Whoa.</v>

234
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.040
This is what the big sale gets back because it's return gift

235
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.683
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

236
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.730
<v 3>and it's this new electricity that gets it,</v>

237
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.140
that helps it fund all these new adventures and construction projects.

238
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.890
Now they can support enormously larger genomes.

239
00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:34.970
So you can have where bacteria may have one or two copies of a gene,

240
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.120
you can now have pinboard genes or 20 or 30 or maybe 50.

241
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.710
There's no penalty for doing so.

242
00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:40.990
And what and what that gives you as a [inaudible]

243
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.630
<v 5>I never redundancy that allows different genes to do slightly different jobs or</v>

244
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.490
too diverged to, you know, you've got the scope to experiment to try things out.

245
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.100
So you have one group going

246
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.820
<v 3>off to become algae and plants and another group becoming animals and another</v>

247
00:14:55.821 --> 00:14:59.750
group becoming the funky and so on. The, the, the descendants did so well.

248
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.900
They've taken over the world and they all came from that one single coming

249
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:06.830
together. That one union. Yes.

250
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.920
It comes down to one merger between two cells that made one cell and then

251
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:14.060
everything comes from that

252
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.560
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

253
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.410
<v 2>you mean the redwood tree or the hummingbird?</v>

254
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.230
A fungus piece of algae growing in a pond.

255
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.150
Every type form of life that we can see with our naked eyes and many that we

256
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.590
can't come from that single cell

257
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.220
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

258
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.700
<v 2>and what the spawns says nick is.</v>

259
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.710
This is how we get the great tree of life that we see all around us after eons

260
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:43.520
and eons of Sameness.

261
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.710
Suddenly we get this many splendor thing that is nature and it starts right

262
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:52.490
here. What we're looking at is truly the second genesis.

263
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.420
<v 3>Wait. Okay. Hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on.</v>

264
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.220
How do we know any of this actually happened? Like all the,

265
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.200
that all of the life that we can see comes from one cell.

266
00:16:04.201 --> 00:16:06.030
How would we possibly know that? Well,

267
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.750
I'm starting with us through the same ones in in, if you,

268
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.750
if you go in and look at the genetic material inside our cells,

269
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.950
about half of our genes, a little bit less than half. Um,

270
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.330
we find them in bacteria or Okeh Nixon.

271
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:23.970
As you can see very clearly that the original DNA of those two cells,

272
00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:27.030
those two cells that merged into one, they're insiders,

273
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:32.010
so there's the sequence and their structure has remained kind of almost intact

274
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.120
for 2 billion years and just the structure of your cells alone provides an

275
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:38.970
important clue. If you look at the sales of all of those things,

276
00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:39.421
if you look at it,

277
00:16:39.421 --> 00:16:44.421
if I take one of your cells and one cell from that fungus or from the spruce or

278
00:16:45.811 --> 00:16:49.710
from the whale, unless you were a, unless you were an expert,

279
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.090
unless you've been trained in this stuff,

280
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.350
it will be very hard to tell the difference between those. In other words,

281
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.890
all of ourselves, and this is across animals, plants, fungi,

282
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.030
they all look something like those original cells, very, very similar.

283
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.400
They will have that nucleus, that internal skeleton,

284
00:17:05.401 --> 00:17:08.580
they would have mitochondria. Those are the lightening bolts,

285
00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:11.610
the descendants of that first little guy that got swallowed. You know,

286
00:17:11.611 --> 00:17:15.570
we have 40 trillion cells and each of those has got,

287
00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:17.900
let's say on average a thousand Mitochondria. So that,

288
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.510
that's a tremendous number of mitochondria in one human being.

289
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.190
And the giant redwood tree has a lot more than that. And so does the worm.

290
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.220
And so from that point of view, just biomass,

291
00:17:29.221 --> 00:17:33.420
we are about 40% mitochondria. So just from biomass,

292
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.830
they are possibly the single most, um,

293
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.970
prolific lifeform that ever existed. Okay. You got me.

294
00:17:41.971 --> 00:17:45.960
I do like this idea of like trillions of little lightning bolts in your belly.

295
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.590
I mean, it is also like, you know, it's a little bit like, it's our producer,

296
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.130
Soren Wheeler,

297
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.640
<v 0>who, who chimed in as we were working on this. You remember our guy,</v>

298
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.770
what was his name from the floppy ears?

299
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.010
The kind of Richard Wrangham is that rich Richard Wrangham? Yeah.

300
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.720
<v 2>Consists of finding energy. That's him.</v>

301
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.440
<v 0>He had that thing about, he wrote a book as all a long time ago,</v>

302
00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:07.810
but it was all about a, actually talked to him at the time.

303
00:18:07.811 --> 00:18:11.920
Human ancestors are going along doing their thing and they're eating raw leaves

304
00:18:11.921 --> 00:18:15.580
in the forest. Same way that chimps do now. But then once they learned to cook,

305
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.870
once you start cooking,

306
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.640
those are terrific advantaged cooking would break things down and then once the,

307
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.800
then you don't have to break things down inside you,

308
00:18:23.801 --> 00:18:27.610
which means that you're putting less energy into your food but getting more out

309
00:18:27.611 --> 00:18:28.050
of it,

310
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.170
maybe it increases the amount of energy that you can get from your food by 25 30

311
00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:33.910
40 50% maybe more.

312
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.060
And his theory is that that that is when we got smart because we were in again

313
00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:42.940
an energy canyon where there was just given what was around you and how much

314
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:45.310
work it took to break it down to the parts that you need.

315
00:18:45.311 --> 00:18:50.080
You couldn't do much until you light a fire underneath it and you like a

316
00:18:50.081 --> 00:18:53.980
lightning bolt and you break it down so that you don't have to do that work.

317
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.210
Cause now the fire's doing that work,

318
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.540
then you put it in your tummy and you get all the goods with half the work and

319
00:18:58.541 --> 00:18:59.374
now,

320
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.700
now you have time and energy to make a brain that can think about it about

321
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.240
<v 2>itself.</v>

322
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.240
That is when the genus homo humans in the first full flowering of the sense of

323
00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:14.920
that word emerged. Wow, that's interesting.

324
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.130
So the Energy Canyon leaping theory might actually touch on mystery number 32

325
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:22.870
the consciousness one. Yeah,

326
00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:27.100
but don't you think that cooking is an act that's intentional? I mean I,

327
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:30.190
you know, when you decide to light the fire and cook the meat,

328
00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:32.470
then you're doing something that you intend to do,

329
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.970
but really gets to me is when you go back to the original pairing,

330
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.420
I mean that was just pure accident and that so much would flow from something

331
00:19:42.641 --> 00:19:47.080
completely cosmically accidental. That's the,

332
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.240
that's what would really,

333
00:19:49.241 --> 00:19:52.270
really kind of freaks me out actually.

334
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.670
That merger and the, the,

335
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.700
the harmonious continuance of that merger was so breathtakingly improbable that

336
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.580
only once did it take,

337
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
nick says it only happened once 2 billion years ago.

338
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.480
And there's no evidence to suggest that it has happened since.

339
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:15.570
So there is no trajectory towards necessary complex life for universe is not

340
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.370
pregnant with the idea of us.

341
00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:23.371
There's nothing about the way that evolution has worked on earth to suggest that

342
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.840
complex life is in an inevitable outcome. And if this hadn't happened,

343
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.950
would the earth just be still rich with, with little, I don't know,

344
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.070
life forms that are smaller than a, than a grain of rice?

345
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:38.980
That's all we'd ever get. I think that's the idea.

346
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:44.070
Does that mean that you have to have this incident on planet Zan Tar and planet

347
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.460
Xanterra 36 and planted Zane? That's, that's really interesting, right?

348
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:53.410
So I think, um, when we think about finding the prospect to finding alien life,

349
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.820
we think the universe,

350
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.870
the universe is so vast that we cannot be alone,

351
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:00.760
that there must be life on other worlds.

352
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.790
But I think what this tells us is that we will probably find life elsewhere,

353
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.400
but it will probably be microbial. Um, it w you know, the,

354
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:13.540
the odds of the odds of finding something that you know,

355
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.380
like the aliens that you would, you would expect, right. So the,

356
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.950
the odds of finding your Stolz Cantina are significantly reduced.

357
00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.060
The odds of finding like a bacterium somewhere probably reasonable.

358
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.140
<v 6>Okay.</v>

359
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.800
<v 2>You might find life. Um, but maybe it's going to be boring.</v>

360
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.740
<v 6>We can leave it right there.</v>

361
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.680
<v 2>Um, but you know, you probably won't get killed by them over, so that's,</v>

362
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.870
that's a good thing. That's true.

363
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.283
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

364
00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.260
<v 7>Nick Lane's book on this theory is called the vital question.</v>

397
00:24:01.151 --> 00:24:05.590
so I'll just say things like totes and like early taunts and you just have to

398
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.490
roll with this. Go with it. Yeah, I'll nod like I know what you're saying. Okay,

399
00:24:09.491 --> 00:24:12.700
great. Jed here as promised at the top of the show,

400
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.410
I want to introduce you to a new project that comes from uh,

401
00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.840
two very funny people.

402
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.870
My name is Phoebe Robinson and I am Michael Fassbender's feature baby Mama.

403
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.400
My name is Jessica Williams and I plan to be the maid of honor and Phoebe and

404
00:24:29.651 --> 00:24:30.880
Michael Fassbender's wedding.

405
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.810
<v 11>Yay.</v>

406
00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.220
<v 0>You're okay with that? I literally just put myself in your fake wedding.</v>

407
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.220
Obviously you're in the wedding. All right.

408
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.860
So Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson are two people who were obsessed with

409
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:44.890
Michael Fassbender. I don't even think he's that hot now.

410
00:24:44.891 --> 00:24:48.010
That's so controversial. And they are both comedians and writers.

411
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.700
A Phoebe has worked for MTV and Comedy Central, a Jessica Williams,

412
00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:55.390
you might know from the daily show where she's a corresponded and the two of

413
00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:59.020
them you have teamed up to make a podcast called a,

414
00:24:59.021 --> 00:25:02.320
it's debut and today it's called two dope queens. And my bet is it,

415
00:25:02.321 --> 00:25:05.560
if you like Radiolab, you will also like this podcast. Yeah. All right.

416
00:25:05.561 --> 00:25:09.280
Can I be old white for a second? There's nothing else for you to be yeah.

417
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.500
So dope people still use the word dope. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But you know,

418
00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:17.500
even if they don't like all it takes is like two black people to make something

419
00:25:17.501 --> 00:25:19.330
cool. Yeah. That's the rule.

420
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.140
We came and we walked down the street tomorrow and we had our shoes on the wrong

421
00:25:23.141 --> 00:25:27.730
foot and as long as it's two black people doing mean hello Chris Cross.

422
00:25:27.731 --> 00:25:31.860
When they did the, the jeans, it was just two of them. They were females nation.

423
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.980
How did you guys meet? Uh, we met, uh,

424
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.300
almost two years ago.

425
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:42.250
I was doing a background on a black hair in the military piece that she was

426
00:25:42.251 --> 00:25:45.910
doing for the daily show story. As Jessica was doing this segment,

427
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.230
Phoebe was part of the segment.

428
00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:50.380
One thing leads to another and Phoebe and Vice Jessica to cohost is comedy,

429
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.010
thinks she was doing like a live thing and she says the moment they got up there

430
00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:57.070
on stage, we murdered homicide.

431
00:25:57.071 --> 00:26:01.870
First degree murder law and order baby. This is all good things,

432
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:06.670
right? Yeah. Yes, yes. On stage. I was like, this feels really good. She's like,

433
00:26:06.671 --> 00:26:10.150
yeah, and I was like, we should do this more often. And so we're like, oh well,

434
00:26:10.151 --> 00:26:12.370
you know, like kind of like we start dating. You're like, oh yeah,

435
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.080
well we'll go to a movie or like, Oh yeah,

436
00:26:14.081 --> 00:26:17.950
we'll go to the mat and we'll just keep seeing how things go at the end of the

437
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.810
day and then after a while it's,

438
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.260
it morphed into something that is our baby and we made a baby. Yeah.

439
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:24.094
We made a baby

440
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:34.480
favorite white lady customer service thing is never in my life.

441
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.673
<v 11>It is</v>

442
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.210
<v 0>two dope queens is a live comedy show that happens at Union Hall here in</v>

443
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:43.590
Brooklyn. Generally what happens is, and Jessica,

444
00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:46.110
they get up on stage and you just kind of riff for a few minutes.

445
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.550
I think if you're in the audience,

446
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:50.670
we really want it to feel like you're hanging out with us. So they get up there,

447
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:52.080
they sort of go back and forth for awhile.

448
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.310
Then we have some of our favorite friends who are stand ups come and do sets in

449
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:58.170
between us talking and hanging out.

450
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.670
I wanted to share this thing that my girlfriend and I have been doing,

451
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:06.440
like this comedian that Phoebe and I both love and named Gary Goldman. Um,

452
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.530
we've, we role play.

453
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.070
<v 11>Okay.</v>

454
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.780
<v 12>The other night we were playing secretary of Housing and Urban Development</v>

455
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.610
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

456
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.960
<v 12>but here's the, here's the twist.</v>

457
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:20.120
She was secretary of Housing and urban development.

458
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.660
I was deputy secretary of housing urban development. So there was that,

459
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.390
there was that status thing. She was my boss and I,

460
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.470
I didn't feel she was pushing her agenda hard enough. I was like,

461
00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.000
did we come to Washington to make friends?

462
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.220
<v 11>Okay.</v>

463
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.420
<v 12>We came to make changes.</v>

464
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.303
<v 11>Okay</v>

465
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:40.630
<v 0>then,</v>

466
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:45.150
then we have people like Michelle Bhutto who's really funny and she does stuff

467
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.710
for comedy central a lot of places.

468
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:49.970
So here's a clip of comedian Michelle Bhutto, uh,

469
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.630
telling a story about how she met this guy

470
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.190
<v 13>when I was like, oh my God, this is the one,</v>

471
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:55.980
like we're going to move in together, we're going to live by the mall.

472
00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.130
And he came to visit me in New York one time about the cell phones were on the

473
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:02.850
bed and they were exactly alike and it rang and I picked it up and this girl was

474
00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:07.110
on the other end. She goes, is Eric there? And I go, who it is?

475
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.790
And she go, who it is? And I go,

476
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.470
who did

477
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.190
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

478
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.160
<v 13>this went on for a real long time.</v>

479
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.370
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

480
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.203
<v 14>cause we knew who to call.</v>

481
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.760
<v 0>This was, okay. So you up the next clip and the the Naomi clip? Yes.</v>

482
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:35.720
Like who is Naomi? Who is Naomi? EQ. Paragon. She's a younger woman,

483
00:28:35.721 --> 00:28:38.150
but she is practically an old lady.

484
00:28:38.151 --> 00:28:42.200
Like all she wants to do is she says in her standup is like sit at home with a

485
00:28:42.201 --> 00:28:46.070
blanket and play with her cats. As you can imagine. I love to watch procedural.

486
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.230
<v 14>I love it. Okay. I love me. Criminal minds is my number one.</v>

487
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:55.430
I do like classic law and order, but I do prefer a special victim, you know?

488
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.530
Yes. I just love it. I love it. I love it. It's,

489
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.460
it's amazing how every episode is involved with white women in peril.

490
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.700
You know? It's like a white woman's in peril. That's how we get people to care,

491
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.790
you know? And it's just nonsense.

492
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.550
But if there's one thing that I feel like we should be taking away,

493
00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:18.530
is it like what ladies? Okay, Megan's. Sarah's. Becky's.

494
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.393
Okay.

495
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.820
<v 11>Okay.</v>

496
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.820
<v 14>You guys have got to stop with the jogging at dawn and dusk.</v>

497
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.730
I hate to go Jesse Jackson, but if the light is low, you should not go.

498
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:42.280
Are you following me? Are you following me?

499
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.510
If you're jogging at those hours, you got to up shit. Okay?

500
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.140
You're either going to find a dead body or become a dead body.

501
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.340
Stop it with a joking.

502
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.240
<v 0>You always like to have women represented doing stand up or story telling on our</v>

503
00:29:58.241 --> 00:30:01.660
show. We make sure that that's in every episode and people,

504
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:06.570
different orientations, people of color, like it's really, really fun. Yeah,

505
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.880
and I, I hope that, like if you come to see the show,

506
00:30:09.881 --> 00:30:11.770

507
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.220
that you'll see that we really love doing it. You just want a hilarious show.

508
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.760
Yep. And I think we really do deliver on that. Yeah.
