[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.460
SPEAKER 1: Before
I invite Gina up,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.590
I'd like to tell you a little
bit about her experience.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.380
She has over 20 years
of experience working

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.400
with children and families and
is the current parent trainer

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.730
for the Early Support
Program for Autism

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.450
and for DRTP Research Program.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.570
In the past, she was the
director of the Easterseals Bay

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.450
Area Autism Program,
as well as the director

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.900
of the Pacific Autism
Center for Education

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.690
in Early Intervention.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.710
And she has also
completed trainings

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.980
with multiple
developmental-based approaches

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.140
and has trained
and supported teams

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.960
of developmental therapists,
behavioral interventionists,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.300
and teachers to develop
successful programs

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.240
for children on the
autism spectrum.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.655
Join me in welcoming
Gina up to the stage.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.505
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:00.820
GINA BALDI: Thank you.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.630
I'm happy to be here.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.040
Thank you all for attending
and all those remotely.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.390
So I have packets here today.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330
And I'm just going to
point out a few things.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.610
What I'm currently doing is
the Early Support Program

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.270
for Autism.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.691
It's called ESPA.

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.440
And I want to point
this out ahead of time

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.610
because I certainly will
go through some resources

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.630
at the end.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.700
However, you could call ESPA--

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.490
it's completely
free-- at any time

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.590
and ask questions
and get resources.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.560
And this is a collaboration
between Stanford and Children's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.760
Health Council.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.650
You'll talk to Christina.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.840
It's done in
English and Spanish.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.830
It's 100% free.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.210
There's no boundaries when it
comes to where you're located,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.850
the age of the individual
you're calling about,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.990
or what resources.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.000
We've had infants come
through with parent concerns

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.240
up to adults calling for
themselves to get resources.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.890
They may not always get directed
to me for the parent training

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.790
piece.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.060
However, we do find resources.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.410
In fact, we had a
parent call from Florida

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.150
for resources for
her daughter who

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.610
attends Stanford as a sophomore
who is on the autism spectrum.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.030
And so whatever calls
we get, Christina

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.250
will seek out information.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.030
And then she'll also tell
you about any research going

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.010
on if you're interested
in research programs

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.250
at Stanford or
elsewhere and also

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.290
if you're interested in
this parent training.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.960
It's a one on one
parent training with me.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.150
It's done over four sessions.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.340
There's no time
constraints to this.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.300
You could do it
remotely or in person.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.990
And again, it's 100% free.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.030
And because it's one on one,
we talk about your child

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.970
and techniques to help in any
given situation with your child

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.160
and your family as a whole unit.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.280
And then there's other
resources in here

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.880
about additional free
classes that CHC offers.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.360
And Christina can even speak
on those if you any questions.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.180
So I'm going to get
into this PowerPoint.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.180
And typically it takes
me more than an hour.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.490
And so if I don't get
through every slide,

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.760
don't worry about it because
there is overlap in this.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.690
And I don't typically
stick to the slides anyway.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.420
So this is just a lot of
information about Children's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.740
Health Council.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.359
And you can look at that
at your convenience.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.900
We're going to talk
about a child's success

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.030
and looking at it from a
developmental approach.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.680
And we will look,
in particular, at

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.360
the interactive
environment-- how

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.930
to create a successful
environment for both you

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.470
and your child to connect
and stretch their skills

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.510
and then creating
opportunities and finding

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.130
those teachable moments.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.770
And for parents especially,
it's about finding those moments

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.550
throughout the flow of the day.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.490
Where when you have
programs set up,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.142
they'll do more intensive stuff.

00:04:57.142 --> 00:04:58.850
But certainly these
techniques are really

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.390
important to know and
to hold everyone working

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.500
with their child to a
high standard of getting

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.390
these opportunities
to teach and teaching.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.290
So when we talk about creating
an interactive environment,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.440
it's really pivotal.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.320
If we want success, we set
a child up for success.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.030
And success does build success.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.850
So the more
opportunities they have

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.140
to be successful-- sometimes we
call it the preemptive strike.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.140
We're going to call it
success before it is.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.150
We create that confidence.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.190
And we can keep building on it.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.650
But in setting up the
environment for success, again,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.820
for both you and your child--

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.790
and so we look at the yes items.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.700
And those are the
teachable items.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.500
The no items are
conversation stoppers.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.250
They stop an interaction.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.090
And so yes items
are redirection.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.980
It's our items that we can
say yes to and then teach.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.490
We work with parents to
find these in everything.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.300
And so for-- if I'm working
with a child in a room,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.560
the child doesn't know me.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.140
And sometimes will
go to the door.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.850
And you'll see this
later in the slide.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.510
I really want to
be a good audience

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.350
to receive all of the
child's communication.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.260
And when they don't
have the language,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.520
I put the language to it.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.770
However, I'm going to put
all my energy and excitement

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.090
into my yes item.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.970
So if they try to open the
door, and I said, oh, not time.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.470
flat affect, flat tone--

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.780
I say, not time to
open the door yet.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.130
But we can open bubbles.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.240
We can open Play-Doh.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.020
And all my energy
goes to my yes.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.010
And my excitement
goes to my yes.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.714
I'm not going to spend a lot
of time explaining a no away--

00:06:44.714 --> 00:06:45.630
like don't touch that.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.963
No, it's not time to go outside.

00:06:46.963 --> 00:06:48.060
We could do that later.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.760
Because what happens is--

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.400
even as an adult, when we hear
no, it's a bit of a sting.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.650
And we're listening
a little less, right?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.650
For kids, they almost
grab onto that--

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.940
what they were working towards,
that no item-- a little harder.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.470
And that's where
we see the fits.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.080
Or that's where
we see not really

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.904
interacting with you so much.

00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:10.570
Especially if we're
constantly-- oh, no.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.220
Don't do that.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.600
Oh, no.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.510
Take that out of your mouth.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.009
Oh, no.

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:13.950
Don't touch that.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.350
Well, we're not
really interactive.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.740
We're the no person.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.540
So we want to find the
yeses in as much as

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.950
possible in these situations.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.400
I do teach no.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.460
But typically it's
in an interaction.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.810
It's in a game.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.820
If I say, is the ball
over on the chair?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.690
And I say, no,
with huge gestures

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.290
and a big response,
really obvious gestures

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.540
of point and everything else.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.620
And then by a third
time, I always find it.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.760
It's my yes, yes.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.010
So we really want
to find those yeses

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.660
and keep away from the nos.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.140
If it is no, flat
affect, flat tone.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.350
We don't want to give a
lot of energy towards a no.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.340
With kids in general, whether
there's a diagnoses or not,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.240
that energy gets a response.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.030
So if it's a exciting no or an
exciting yes, doesn't matter.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.620
So we want the yeses to
be where excitement goes.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.920
Providing interactive
items-- so we

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.250
want to look for items
that create back and forth.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.490
Because the teaching comes
through connection and then

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.144
those social loops
of interaction.

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:31.449
Teaching in isolated
ways does work.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:32.865
We don't always
see it generalized

00:08:32.865 --> 00:08:37.650
into other environments
or with other people.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.970
And so this approach that
I'll talk about today,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.260
it's really looking at
everything being taught

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.650
through loops of interaction.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.240
Because the ultimate goal
is for this individual

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.000
I'm working with to go and share
these tools with their peers--

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.190
not with me or not
with other what

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.670
we call manageable, predictable,
and their control adults.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.000
That will be in the slide too.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.560
So interactive items--
and I know I'm at Google.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.720
However, we stay away from
tech as much as possible.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.630
I can't be as exciting
as tech, right?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.700
Everything I'll
ask you to be today

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.320
is what kids get
from what they're

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.340
watching on YouTube or
in video or the songs

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.190
and dance and all
that colorful stuff.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.000
Certainly there's things we
can teach to that, especially

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.540
if we're watching
as well and doing

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:43.230
some pausing and kind of acting
it out or asking questions.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.995
But it is limited.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.450
We get rid of our competition.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.990
So tech would be my competition.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.890
I want items that I
can bring the fun to.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.120
The object is there
to support the play.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.020
However, the person
is the primary focus.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.955
That object is not fun
without me involved.

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:09.480
So you're looking
for items that don't

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.160
have the bells and whistles,
the lights and the noises,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.830
the battery items.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:21.095
So ideally, really basic toys.

00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:23.410
I like items like
what's called--

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.620
I call them a pole tube.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.790
And you just pull it long.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.870
And you can spin it.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.560
You can do all kinds of stuff.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.710
So thinking of
items that you can

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.170
get a child excited to
look your way more often

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.270
and want you to do
it again and again

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.860
to promote functional language.

00:10:41.534 --> 00:10:42.950
Create an interactive
environment.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.890
Again, be a good
sensory detective.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.380
So typically when
I do this talk,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.900
I do this kind of experimental--

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.640
I try to give you some type
of taste of what sensory

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.350
may be going on with the child.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.400
And we're always doing a best
guess because we cannot say

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.870
what effects a child.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.800
We can observe.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.170
And we can make best guesses.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.860
However, when we're talking
about young kids in general,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.909
we know that their sensory
system is immature.

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:13.700
When we're talking
about a child who is not

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.090
hitting all those milestones
the way we expect them to,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.350
we're going to kind
of guess that there

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.400
are some interruptions in
their sensory development.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.320
And so being a good
sensory detective

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.170
is investigating
the environment.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.270
Setting, again, the
environment up for success

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.030
is getting rid of items that
are going to be an issue.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.950
So I work with a
little boy now who will

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.600
mouth a lot of soft plastics.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.450
I don't bring soft
plastics into the session.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.400
I'll bring hard plastic toys.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.680
I bring items that I
can create interaction.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.383
But I am not going to spend
time taking things out

00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:50.180
of their mouth.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.300
I also will make sure there's
a replacement for items

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.260
like that.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.290
So if a child is
mouthing, if we're

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.230
being a sensory
detective, I view

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.480
that as there's a need there.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.910
And as a responsible
adult, I need

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.700
to help that child
meet that need

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.030
so they don't have to keep
seeking out items to meet it

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.390
themselves.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.850
And so replacement yes
items is really important.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.820
If you work with an
occupational therapist,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.120
many times they'll
use a tube, a chewy.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.490
And some kids do well with that.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.540
Some don't.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.874
Or they get bored after a while.

00:12:27.874 --> 00:12:29.289
So they'll do it
for a little bit,

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:30.950
but they'll still
grab the other items.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.995
Having other items that
might provide more input--

00:12:36.608 --> 00:12:39.150
a wash cloth, a
dry wash cloth does

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.030
that because they can
get it back into areas

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.110
that a chewy doesn't get.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.000
And then it's more malleable.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.940
It gets wet, and then you can
move it around a lot more.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.640
It's an acceptable item.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.820
I know parents who have
done handkerchiefs.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.290
So they're always
accessible that way.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.210
So looking for, again, yes
items-- even teething rings.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.960
I mean, when they come
out of the freezer,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.275
sometimes that can give a nice
relief for whatever's going on.

00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:12.200
And also trying lots of
different pressure in areas,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.540
which, if you work with a
good occupational therapist,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.700
they work a lot on the
sensory system too.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.990
And they'll put a child on what
they call a sensory diet, which

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.580
is deep input--

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.360
different type of
movements for development.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.430
You also want to make
changes to the environment.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.430
Again, if a child--

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.850
get rid of the no items.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.560
But also if-- and you
have great lights here.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.100
In fact, part of my experiment
I do is shaking the lights,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.460
and off and on, and shaking
a bag, making lots of noise.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.080
And it drives most
parents crazy.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.420
And you can't focus.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.900
And I say, that's a little
taste of what may be going on,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.730
that what you're asking
out of your child,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:58.280
they're filtering through all
those layers of sensory issues.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.110
So yeah, it takes
time to process.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.470
If they could do it easily,
they would be doing it easily.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.990
And so to acknowledge
that it is hard.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.770
And so we need to set up
that environment to give them

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.980
as much success as possible.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.080
So having access to a
trampoline or bean bag

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.300
or even cushions
for deep pressure

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.260
or being able to jump on
the bed, doing tight--

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.780
rolling a child up in a
blanket tightly and back out,

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.400
which we call a burrito--

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.240
and kids love it.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.550
And we get lots and
lots of language

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.890
out of activities like that.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.640
Because number one, they
can't do it themselves.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.720
We have to be a part of it.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.700
And number two, it
relaxes their body

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.350
and gives them a
lot of nice input.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.580
And so they do
want more and more.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.210
So I keep stretching
as we continue, and I

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.650
get them more engaged and
excited about the activity.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.040
So you want to remove
items that are an issue.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.130
Support sensory regulation.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.190
If you look at
activities online,

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.890
you just want to try
different things to really

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.870
have a nice array of sensory
movement, sensory input

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.610
activities.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.445
And it depends on what the child
either seeks out or avoids.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.330
Again, there's a lot of
good occupational therapists

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.830
out there.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.490
And if you're not
working with one,

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.710
their websites will give
you a lot of tips as well.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.830
You can also search, which
I've done many times,

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.290
to get ideas is brain gym.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.530
And then I'll just look at
the images under brain gym.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.980
And it'll give me ideas of
helping a child move their body

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.480
in different ways
so they are what

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.360
they call crossing the
midpoint and working

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.262
both sides of the brain.

00:15:47.262 --> 00:15:48.970
Things that when we
don't do for a while,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.390
and then you try to do
it, you realize it's

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.202
not as easy as you thought
like jumping jacks.

00:15:55.202 --> 00:15:56.160
And I'll try to do one.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.770
I'm like, oh, I think I forgot
how to do a jumping jack.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.850
Or jumping rope,
skipping, right?

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.200
Sounds like no big deal.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.330
If you haven't done it
for a while, try it.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.850
You'll realize your brain's
lost a little of that.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.090
You can get it back.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.810
But it takes practice.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.490
And really paying attention
to the child's ongoing needs.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.420
One of the things you want to be
as a good sensory detective is

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.010
just step back and observe.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.930
And observe the finer details
of what your child is doing--

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.040
that you may want to
look for ways to support.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.130
Because if we can be
a partner in this,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.880
we can play a role in the
need to open and shut a door.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.320
And all of a sudden, it's our
idea instead of us stopping

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.020
them constantly from doing it.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.880
They're going to turn
more and more to you

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.250
as a partner instead
of somebody--

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.690
the no person in that.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.780
Position yourself
for eye contact.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.400
If you want eye contact,
make it really easy.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.380
Be at his or her
eye level or lower.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.609
And then capture it.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:06.917
You'll see it later.

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:08.250
Again, I jump around the slides.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.959
But reinforce it.

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.291
Everything you want to see
out of that child more often,

00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:11.900
reinforce.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.160
Oh, good looking.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.380
And do it with that nice energy.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.160
But if you're
working or you have

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.910
a child who doesn't have nice
eye contact and you want it,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.589
set them up for success.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.609
Make it really easy.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.349
Take all the
obstacles out of it,

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.990
and then reinforce it
each and every time.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.630
And I know sometimes it's quick.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.370
But, I mean, I will capture it--

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.860
if I'm working on it,
I'll get it each time,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.190
even if it's in moving.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.190
And then I get to slow
it down a little bit more

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.010
and a little bit more.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.660
Promote reciprocal interaction.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.440
Again, everything we teach
through loops of interaction.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.720
And so you'll see it
later in the slide,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.550
but that pause is
really important.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.350
[GASP] And for that
anticipation of I know I'm

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.360
going to get something
back, and I'm

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.690
available to receive it back.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:08.340
And many times, I'll work in
a room with no distractions

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.030
and where I don't have to
run after a child a lot

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.530
to get eye contact.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.870
And so that way, we
can do a lot more

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.760
of the back and forth
reciprocal interaction.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.150
She might look at
space like that.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.030
And make it a space that
a child wants to stay in

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.200
because it's so much fun.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.800
Because you bring the fun to it.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.910
Offer visual steps when
necessary and schedules.

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.360
So it's more impactful
of a learning opportunity

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.620
if we see it, we hear,
and we experience it.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.010
I have a better chance of
taking that skill with me.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.540
So visuals are really
important, whether I

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.510
have an actual item, icon,
a picture of an item,

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.670
or I do it in gestures-- like
do you want pizza or chicken?

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.260
And there's nothing
there, but it

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.060
helps with visualization,
which helps

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.820
with when kids do get into
chapter books and things

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.320
like that.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.630
You have to be-- it's the
same as social comprehension.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.640
You have to be, for
reading comprehension,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.550
able to visualize
the characters,

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.000
visualize the environment, and
then start making predictions

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.160
of what could happen.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.730
And that's the same
for that social piece.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.730
That's why it's so hard.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.580
There's all those
unwritten rules

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.940
of what it means to
socialize and be successful.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.410
And so you want to
make it really obvious.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.210
And schedules sometimes help.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.450
Visual steps help.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.075
One of the things
you are be careful of

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:38.760
is to do too many schedules.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.840
And then you get a
more rigid individual.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.730
Right?

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.030
We want flexibility
within those schedules.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.310
So if I have a
schedule planned out,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.210
well, I might have a
special activity in that.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.170
If you drive a child
to school every day

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.990
and you have options
to go multiple routes,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.120
you want to take a
left turn next time

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.680
instead of a right turn.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.890
When you go on walks, you
want to explore, be curious,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.390
and go different directions.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.550
We can do a lot of
flexible demonstrations

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.400
even with our speech.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.150
So if I say, go shut
the door, I can also

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.890
say, go close the door.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.090
It means the same thing.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.190
And people say it differently.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.280
And so you want to vary your
language for nice flexibility

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:24.780
as well.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.540
When we're creating
opportunities-- and some

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.800
of this I'll go through
in more detail--

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.425
you want to be
manageable, predictable,

00:20:34.425 --> 00:20:36.990
and a child's control.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.440
The social world-- a lot of
things in an individual's life

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.540
are not manageable,
predictable, in their control.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.970
And so it's scary--

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.500
and especially if there
are sensory issues.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.800
And so that's where you see a
child run off or bite or hit,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.080
wanting to get out of what's
a very scary situation.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.060
And so as adults,
we can be that.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.960
Within that, we will
expect focus ability.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.926
And we'll challenge a
child in a healthy manner.

00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:10.510
And we'll go in
that in more detail.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.850
Be irresistible, right?

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.370
Be the fun of the play.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:20.890
And make it obvious
what it looks like.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.430
Invite your child to
take healthy risk.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.890
That's really
important for them.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.777
It's a little scary.

00:21:28.777 --> 00:21:31.110
But if I can be manageable,
predictable, and in control,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.510
and give little
pieces of a risk--

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.630
and risk is very different
for different kids.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.670
I had a beanbag
one time in a room

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.530
where a child does a lot of
really more academic work

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.540
and not the social piece.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.980
And he sat in the beanbag.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.475
And I thought, oh, I'm going
to do a sensory social activity

00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:53.270
is what we call it.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.420
And so I went and I
picked the beanbag up.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.850
And I kind of gave pressure,
and I just picked it up.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.960
I said, up, up, up--
just to my knees.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.490
And he was scared.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.800
And so I went, down, down, down.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.630
And I did not let
go because I knew he

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.160
would be out of that beanbag.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.860
And I know he'll
enjoy it if he can

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.560
see that it is manageable,
predictable, and is controlled.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.922
That it is safe.

00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:16.630
So I do it again.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.926
Up, up, up.

00:22:17.926 --> 00:22:21.950
[GASP] Down, down, down.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.380
And later in the slide--

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.290
always comes up for--

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.060
I have a very clear beginning,
middle, and end to my routine.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.520
And I'm going to do it
at least three times--

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.690
the rule of three.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.535
If a child needs it
more because I think,

00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:34.930
oh, he still needs
a little more.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.300
He looked scared, but
he's starting to relax.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.230
And I'll do it more.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.970
But typically, three
does it for me.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.844
And I'll do it again.

00:22:40.844 --> 00:22:41.650
Up, up, up.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.500
[GASP] Ah, down, down, down.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.030
And I put him down again.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.470
And then I let go.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.820
And he stayed in.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.250
And he actually
said, up, up, up.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.030
Right?

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.990
So I do it again.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.540
Up, up, up.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.270
But this time, I
go all the way up.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.380
And I go down.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.060
And we did it a few more times.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.260
And he tells me, up,
up, up, for more.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.500
I said, more, because
what I really want now

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.020
is for him to
say-- it's got him.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.070
I've captured him
into this activity.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.900
But now up, up, up isn't
really appropriate.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.380
You can tell me more.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.830
That would be more appropriate.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.540
So I say, more.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.180
And I do up, up, up.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.730
And then I add something to it.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.720
I add the spin.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.400
And if I spin a child one way, I
always spin them the other way.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.650
Again, it's more
impactful for a child.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.960
So if a child is running
around a lot or spinning,

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.530
get them to rotate--

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.030
reverse.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.080
I say, reverse,
go the other way.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.290
So I start teaching those
words by defining them

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.890
at the same time
we're doing them.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.710
And they won't need
as much spinning.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.340
Some kids can spin
constantly and not get dizzy.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.080
Spin them one way, and
spin them the other way.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.860
Their bodies are impacted
in a more satisfactory way,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.500
and they won't need as much
spinning and stuff or running

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.380
around.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:55.970
It's hard too.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.094
If a child is running in
a circle and you say stop,

00:23:58.094 --> 00:24:01.850
reverse, I mean, they're
in this momentum.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.320
Even a child with
diagnoses, they

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.840
have trouble then
going the other way.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.320
And I hold them to it.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.530
Anything I ask of a
child, I hold them to it.

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.630
Whether I help them or
not, whether they do

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.120
it independently or not
doesn't matter to me.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.800
But I do hold them
to the expectation.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.020
So they know that I'm
always going to hold you

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.650
to these expectations.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.150
Those expectations-- if this
is where their skill level is,

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.530
I'm doing the next step.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.450
I'm not leaping.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.760
We're not doing
brain surgery now.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.965
I want success, and so
it's that next step.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.910
So this is a very
healthy risk for a child.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.550
And I know he's
going to love it.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.250
And so I keep adding
on to this activity.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.260
And I start teaching no
yes in this activity.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.380
Because if you
give him a choice--

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.405
or if I say, do you
want to go down?

00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:53.040
He'll say, go down.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.580
He just repeats, right,
the last couple words.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.320
And so I want him
to say yes or no.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.950
So I start teaching yes and no
in this activity-- going up,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.180
doing some spins.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.150
And it was in a playful way
of instead of putting him

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.750
on the floor, I'd say, down,
down, down on the counter?

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.020
And that was a no.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.610
And so I would have,
again, by three

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.320
I was on down on the floor.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.180
Yes, yes.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.080
And then next time, I'd say,
down, down like on the chair?

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.380
And I'd wait for
him to answer, no.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.020
After I'd demonstrated
a few times.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.800
And he would start to go, no.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.350
I'm like, no.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.990
And then get to the yes item.

00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:40.010
By doing these things, again,
being manageable, predictable,

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.660
and in control, we're a really
much more interactive partner

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.770
in this.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.950
And be responsive, which
is that thank yous.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.510
And you'll see that
in another slide.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.645
So being manageable-- these
are some nice questions

00:25:51.645 --> 00:25:54.870
to ask yourself.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.640
Grabbing things out of a
child's hands is not manageable.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.180
Moving too quickly-- you
want that slow approach.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.490
You want those
pauses and [GASP]..

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.220
And sounds-- add sounds
to your activities.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.720
They know it's coming.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.534
Again, with a child
with a diagnoses--

00:26:11.534 --> 00:26:13.200
they're not my child,
their other child,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.075
doesn't matter to me.

00:26:14.075 --> 00:26:16.770
I always do these
type of techniques.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.190
And you get a more
of a buy in by doing

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.030
these type of techniques.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.600
So even if I'm about to
just tickle or something,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.560
you know it's coming.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.480
Because tickling is
one of those things

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.690
that there's a little bit
of fun to it, but mostly

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.580
it's not a fun activity.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.150
Because you get kids cracking
up, but you keep doing it.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:41.670
And they've already passed that
enjoyable kind of fine line.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.030
But they're laughing
still, so you keep at it.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.310
And so being really
manageable, predictable,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.150
and their control
for stuff like that.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.770
So you always-- I always show
a child my approach like here

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.560
come tickles.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.990
So you know it's coming.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.880
They're cracking up
from the anticipation

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.240
because it's much funnier
than the actual tickles.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.570
And I'll say, ah,
tickle, tickle, tickle.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.290
And I'm right back up.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.610
But I'm not too far where my
approach is way over there.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:08.960
It's not so much fun.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.940
Or if I'm too close,
it's a little scary.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.490
It's really manageable.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.370
And that anticipation
is really important

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.930
for social anticipation.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.330
Being able to read
something, anticipate what's

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.180
going to happen by
reading the environment,

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.610
the body language,
the facial affect,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:31.790
the movements is so
important for social success.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.650
And we can teach that
early on with those pauses.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.020
[GASP] Ah-uh-ah.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.999
And have that sound to it.

00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:40.040
I'll even do [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.756
Ah, ah, ah.

00:27:41.756 --> 00:27:44.730
And kids think it's much
funnier than if I just went

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:45.900
in and started tickling.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.380
Plus you get a child
looking more and tracking.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.930
So they're attending instead
of just getting their needs met

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.000
and then being gone.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.850
Being really careful
with removing things

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.600
from a kid's hand.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.360
If a child's playing
with a car or something,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.210
I'm going to join them
exactly what they're doing.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.756
However, I'm going
to have my own car.

00:28:05.756 --> 00:28:07.255
I mean, it won't
personally be mine.

00:28:07.255 --> 00:28:10.380
It'll probably be another
one of his or hers.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.310
But still, I don't ever take
the child's item from them,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.040
even if I'm trying
to demonstrate.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.310
I do it by joining them and
then offer something in addition

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:25.620
to what they're already finding
mastery and pleasure from.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.730
Being careful about
standing behind or above.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.320
I mean, none of us like
somebody too close behind us.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.030
It's uncomfortable.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.530
If I am behind a
child and I'm going

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.863
to help them with something,
I put my hands out in front

00:28:36.863 --> 00:28:39.000
and say, here are my hands.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.134
I'm going to help.

00:28:40.134 --> 00:28:41.550
And then I might
help them do hand

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.350
over hand or
something like that.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.869
Picking up a child, same thing.

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:46.410
Mine or not, it
doesn't matter to me.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.090
I'll say, I'm going
to pick you up.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.860
And I don't wait
for a yes or no.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.910
I might tell him why.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.493
I'm like, we're going to cross
the big street and pick you up.

00:28:53.493 --> 00:28:55.050
And then I pick up.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.660
Or there's a car, so you
have to hold my hand.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.650
And then I take hand.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.780
But I let them know
what's going to happen.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.430
I make myself
available, and then I

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.660
have follow through to that.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.180
Being predictable--
again, helping them

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.340
anticipate what's coming.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.540
And you do that with the pauses.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.820
Make sure they know
what their role is

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.690
and what your role is in that.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.835
So sometimes it's
explicitly saying that.

00:29:21.835 --> 00:29:25.520
And as parents, I
think we all do this,

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.060
is we put things in a
question instead of a comment.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.540
And I know better to
do that, and I still

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.040
seem to throw a
question at the end.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.190
I'll say, time for bed, OK?

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.530
And I think, why
am I doing that OK?

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.250
I'm not asking.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.160
I'm stating.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.360
And so if you're not
asking, don't put it

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.610
in a question form.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:50.150
When you say, oh, do you want
to play or can I play with you,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.860
I wouldn't ask.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.410
Because you're probably
going to get a no.

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.366
Unless you're going to accept
that no and walk away--

00:29:57.366 --> 00:29:59.240
or let's try it, you
want to try it this way?

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.700
And it's like, no.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.300
Well, then I would join
exactly what they're doing.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.430
And it's, oh, I'm going
to try it like this.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.810
And then you demonstrate
what you're going to try.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:12.830
But you want to make
it clear what's--

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.330
no one can step up
to an expectation

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.940
if they don't know what it is.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.010
And so making that
very clear what

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:25.190
is expected with little
language and gestures, right?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.440
Put in.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.600
You don't have to
explain things away.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.310
What you want is
that follow through.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.810
And the more they can
follow nonverbal gestures,

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.990
the more they're watching
And the more you're

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.030
helping increase
their observation

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.600
skills for observing peers.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.030
Learning how to
know what's going

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.730
on in that social setting,
which will help them

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.586
know how to join and maintain
the social interaction.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.060
And giving that time.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.990
Again, with the sensory
issues that may be going on,

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.180
processing time is
really important.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.730
So if I say, oh,
do you want water?

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:18.470
And they don't answer, I'm like,
water, do you want the water?

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.380
Do you want a drink of water?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:26.710
Each time I speak, it's
like starting all over.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.110
So I ask, and then they start
processing the information.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.030
And then I ask
again, it's like, OK.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.070
I start processing again.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.089
Then you ask different ways too.

00:31:35.089 --> 00:31:35.880
Sometimes we touch.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.320
Look at me, which is
very overwhelming, right?

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.810
Skin is our largest organ
taking in stimulation.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:45.100
And so then I've got to
process that in addition

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.370
to you talking, in addition
to maybe some demand you're

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:53.830
putting on me, in addition to
lights, uncomfortable chairs,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.600
temperature, whatever else
is going on, hearing a fan.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.210
We can all sit here and ignore
many things and tune in.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.360
I wouldn't assume your
child can do that.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.080
And I wouldn't assume
your child knows

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.274
what's expected out of them.

00:32:10.274 --> 00:32:12.190
I was working with a
little boy the other day,

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.980
and he said something
about soccer.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.650
So I'm like, oh, I have an idea.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.130
And so I said-- we
had a ball, and I say,

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.130
well, let's play soccer.

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.650
You're going to kick the
ball, and I'm the goalie.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.430
And I have to stop it.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.320
And he couldn't
act on any of it.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:34.480
And so I kind of made it really
obvious of what it looked like.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.690
And so his mom later told me
he has no idea what soccer is

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.530
or anything else you just said.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:44.050
Well, he's the one who brought
it up, so I assumed he knew.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:46.740
And for all of these--
especially social activities,

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.060
even things like tag--

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.060
it seems like a
pretty simple game.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.920
But unless you play
with your child,

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.060
and you see that he or she knows
all the roles in it-- that you

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.970
don't just keep running,
that you actually tag.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.870
And then you run away and
try not to be tagged again.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.890
Who's it, who's not
it, what the rules are.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.640
And they've gotten a
lot more complicated.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.080
Kids aren't just playing tag.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.454
If you're at a
playground, you'll

00:33:12.454 --> 00:33:15.310
hear them make up a
lot of thematic play,

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.350
pretend play around tag.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.880
They'll say like if you
touch the ground, it's lava.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.090
And you're blah blah.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.800
And it's all these
rules now that

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.020
make it really complicated.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.870
So as you're playing games
like this with your child,

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.280
you want to start to put kind
of themes around it-- stories

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.090
around it.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.270
Make it more
complicated in a way

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.730
that's manageable,
predictable, in their control.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.640
And again, being a
good partner, making

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.050
it really obvious what their
role is and what your role is.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.930
Making sure they feel in control
doesn't mean they get control.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:00.760
However, helping
them manage this--

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.850
the scariness of it all-- and
giving them a sense of control.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.240
So whatever they're
motivated by,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.290
that's where we start when
we're connecting with a child.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.590
And then we can add more
things to it that maybe are not

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:19.690
where they're motivated or maybe
is not a preferred activity.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.590
I can go in that direction.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:26.650
So as I work with kids,
it's certainly child-led.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.210
So it's their agenda.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.409
I have my goals.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.550
And I never get rid of my goals.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.280
However, I start at their
skill level, their interests.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.650
And then my steps to the
goal is in that direction.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.947
And it's constantly stretching.

00:34:38.947 --> 00:34:40.780
And it's really layered
learning because I'm

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.530
getting eye contact.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.300
I'm demonstrating lots of nice
facial expression, nice tone

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.320
of voice, whatever
skill I'm working

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.679
with-- if it's a concept,
if it's expanding on play.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.100
And I'm getting
loops of interaction.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.500
So it's not just me.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.210
It's not just me meeting needs.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.110
It's back and forth.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.460
Being really-- and that's
the whole sensory detective

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.356
is responding to
their body language.

00:35:14.356 --> 00:35:16.230
What is the child telling
you, but especially

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.630
around that nonverbal language?

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.570
So if a child pushes away--

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.240
I'm about to tickle and they
turn their body, I'll say,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.240
all done tickle or no tickle.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.530
And as they come back, yes
tickle or more or whatever.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.250
But I'm very responsive
to body language

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:36.750
and what that's telling me.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:41.490
And I put functional language
to that body language.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:46.030
The toys, again, not taking
the toys away, not withholding.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.230
You'll see it later.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.440
You don't want to
withhold items.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.200
If a child's saying
buh for banana,

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.082
I can work and go in the
direction of the word banana.

00:35:55.082 --> 00:35:56.790
But I'm not going to
withhold that banana

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:01.320
until they say banana because
I'm not a good partner here.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.510
I'm not user friendly.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.880
They're going to walk away
way before we get there.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.030
And so being responsive is being
that user friendly partner.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.460
Not to stop or interrupt play.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.960
When play is going on, we just
want to keep expanding on it,

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.920
expanding on it.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.670
And again, nos will stop it.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.580
Certain items being
taken away stop it.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.170
Being irresistible--
the big expressions--

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.190
you draw attention
in their face.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.810
These are things to be
socially successful.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.800
And with social success,
we see learners.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.839
Because they're observing,
they read the situation,

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:40.880
and then they'll imitate.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.200
They'll learn from
what they're seeing--

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.950
things we want them to imitate.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.870
And they start to
learn from their peers

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.510
instead of having to
be taught directly.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:54.230
And so we, again, want to make
it really obvious early on.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.430
[GASP] with the
exaggerated expressions--

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.970
letting them see your
face pausing, exaggerating

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.790
your movements.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.140
If they're working on
point or whatever else,

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.290
make it really obvious
what that looks like.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.040
I mean, again, you
think it's no big deal.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.670
But to learn to isolate this
finger amongst all the rest--

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.760
it takes a lot of brain power.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.970
The messages have got to get
through our bodies to isolate

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.940
these motor movements.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.640
And sure, we do it all the time.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:30.750
But if the messages aren't going
through your body to the brain

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.570
and then back in a timely
manner, you're not seeing this.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.000
And so you want
to make it really

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.970
obvious of what it looks like.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:46.220
Demonstrate it so that there's
no question of what's expected.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.660
Sound draws him in.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.330
Even with bubbles--
if I say, oh, bubbles.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.090
Ah, pop.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.290
Stuff like that, right?

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:56.110
If all I do is this, a
child's not going to watch.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.700
I want him tracking.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.130
I want him invested
in this activity.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.230
I want them making
sounds, because sound

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.990
leads to language.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.860
And what kids-- young
kids especially-- do

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.440
is they put sound to play.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.030
And so getting all those
sounds going in different ways,

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:15.250
whether it's jumping on
the bed or running around--

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.060
and a lot of times for kids,
if they don't have language

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.850
and I put sounds to it,
they're able to initiate play

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.040
with me with the sound.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.800
Because they can't say, oh, I
want you to do bubbles for me

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.980
again.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.000
They'll just say, ah.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.556
And I'll say, bubbles.

00:38:30.556 --> 00:38:33.670
And I give, again, give back
the functional word for it.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.830
But I accept the
language they're

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.400
able to give me at that moment.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.590
And make that activity much more
fun with you than without you.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.230
And that means being manageable,
predictable, in their control.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.540
Because when you're not,
it's not fun for them.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.330
You're taking away
from their activity

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.950
the way they have to
do it in that moment.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.910
And we join exactly
what they have to do,

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.140
and then I can stretch it.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.570
But if I go and just
decide a child who's maybe

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.189
spinning wheels,
and I go and say,

00:39:03.189 --> 00:39:04.730
oh, that's not how
you play with car.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.840
You take the car and you go ah.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.100
Even if I make it
fun, it won't matter.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.120
This is where he is.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.190
He's mastered this.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.820
It fulfills him in some way.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.030
And I need to respect that.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.260
And so I join in exactly that.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.320
And then I add to this.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.540
And I go fast or slow.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.830
I do some concept.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.040
And I do the rule of three with
a beginning, middle and an end.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.320
I'll say, Gina's wheels
are going to go fast.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.200
Ready, set, go.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.512
Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

00:39:35.512 --> 00:39:36.470
Make it really obvious.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.430
And I go back to
joining at his pace.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.770
And I go, OK, Gina's wheels
are going fast again.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.330
And I'll do that the same
way at least three times.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.710
And if he keeps looking,
I know he's interested.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.390
And then I want more out of him.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:51.910
What I really want is imitation.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.969
With the little boy I'm
actually thinking of,

00:39:53.969 --> 00:39:56.260
he didn't give me imitation,
so I went back to joining.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.866
He kept looking over,
and I'm still here.

00:39:58.866 --> 00:40:00.240
And I would just
keep doing this.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.750
And finally he said, muh.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.460
And he didn't have language.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.210
He had a few approximations.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.350
That's it.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.890
And lots of sensory
issues, low body tone.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:12.375
And so I'm actually on my
stomach to be lower than him.

00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:14.140
And I'm doing exactly
what he's doing.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.361
I say, more.

00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:17.370
Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.530
And so I give him
exactly what he wants,

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.630
but only when he
gives me something.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.576
I don't keep giving.

00:40:23.576 --> 00:40:24.700
And then I go back to this.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.255
And then he looks up, and he
tells me again, more, more.

00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:29.260
Fast, fast, fast,
fast, fast, fast.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.180
And after a couple
times like that,

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.700
I start to decrease my
party and give more words.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.440
He'll say, more.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.980
And I'll say, you
really like fast.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.985
OK, here's more.

00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:42.250
Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.600
And I give him more.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.130
And at some point,
I did prompt him.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.710
And this is only
really within minutes.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:50.130
This was happening
first time meeting him.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.960
And I say, Johnny, do fast.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.870
And he's doing this.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.460
And it was really at the same
pace, but a preemptive strike.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.880
I say, good fast, fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.700
More fast.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.930
And he started doing fast.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.960
In that same-- it was
a two hour session--

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.110
and within that same two
hour session, we ran fast.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.280
We jumped fast.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.890
So we took the concept
of fast and we did it

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.240
in multiple activities
for mastery.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.940
And then at some point, we
added slow to activities

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.649
where they were appropriate.

00:41:20.649 --> 00:41:21.690
You don't want it to be--

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.840
I still make it fun.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.849
And so if I do slow for certain
things, it's not so much fun.

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:28.390
So that he could
start discriminating

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.420
between these things.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:37.400
Be responsive-- that's
that thanking him.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.730
Everything you want
to see out of a child,

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.000
you want it to be
clear what's expected.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.100
We can put that in our
response, our thank yous.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.110
And varying your
language, again,

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.240
make it-- you want to
keep that value to it.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.450
So if I say, oh, thank
you for cleaning up.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.810
Thank you for eating.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.440
Oh, thank you for sharing.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.420
I'm going to be specific
and say exactly what I

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.340
want to see more often.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.470
Because if a child gives me
something, I say, thank you,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:06.590
I can assume he knows.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.380
But I don't want to assume.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.980
What I'm really saying
is do that more often.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.970
Just like the kid who
really didn't do fast,

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.150
but I said, good fast, right?

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.870
I'm telling him it's
fast before it is.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.500
But what I'm really saying is
faster, faster, more, more,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.960
more.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.490
But I'm building
that confidence.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.370
And I'm showing that
we're a team in this.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.440
And so I can say thank you with
good energy and be specific,

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.460
but it loses its
value after a while.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.786
Thank you all the time
is kind of boring.

00:42:36.786 --> 00:42:38.660
And you want to keep
that value and that kind

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.620
of connection of
doing things like,

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.940
oh, there's those pretty eyes.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.630
Get excited about that stuff.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.070
It also brings more energy
as you're doing these.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.110
When you think how long
do I do the eye thing?

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.300
Shouldn't he be giving
me eye contact by now?

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.560
If he's not, we
keep reinforcing it.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.306
And we keep the party
high when needed.

00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:01.430
It's like when a child
first starts walking, right?

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.346
We get really excited.

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:03.500
You can do it.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.720
We're kind of that
big cheerleader there.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.277
And now that they
have owned walking,

00:43:08.277 --> 00:43:10.110
we don't have to say
anything more about it.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.350
We move on from those things.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.020
But we have to be
that cheerleader

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.100
in that development of whatever
skill you're looking at.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.265
And the thing about
eye contact is--

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.640
because there's
a lot of kids who

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.190
don't have to look to
take the information in.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.200
However, at some
point, they're going

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.750
to be missing the
more complicated stuff

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.160
because they're not watching.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.480
So we do need eye contact.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.790
We want certainly that
receptive language

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.950
that follows that was
very, very important.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.900
But I'd hold them to
the eye contact as well.

00:43:46.204 --> 00:43:48.100
Let's see.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.080
So finding teachable moments--

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.940
those are just
kind of some ideas.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:56.310
I'm going to move on for this,
just to get to the next slide.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.190
Model functional language.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.577
Again, be that good audience.

00:44:00.577 --> 00:44:02.035
The more you receive
communication,

00:44:02.035 --> 00:44:04.120
whether it's verbal
or nonverbal,

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.435
especially the non-verbal, to
be able to say back things--

00:44:07.435 --> 00:44:10.010
even if a child looks a little
nervous about something--

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.580
I know it's a little scary,
but I'm going to help you.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.990
You could do it.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:17.792
Or hating haircuts, hating
to get their hair washed,

00:44:17.792 --> 00:44:19.000
brushing teeth, or whatever--

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.041
I know you don't like it.

00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:21.147
It's OK.

00:44:21.147 --> 00:44:21.730
You can do it.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:28.420
And you kind of let them know
first, top teeth, bottom teeth,

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.130
then all done or something.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.660
I'll do the washing hair.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.270
And I'll say, five cups of
water and then all done.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.130
So I let them know.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.750
I estimate what
it's going to take.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.450
And then I get it through.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:44.150
And it's not fun for the child.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:45.405
However, they survive it.

00:44:45.405 --> 00:44:47.280
And for some things,
that's what we're doing.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.270
We don't want to tiptoe
around anxiety provoking

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.060
activities or scary activities.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.620
We want to help them through it.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.840
We want to be a partner and
say, it's a little scary,

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.200
but I'll help you.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.720
We're going to do it together.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.495
And then you give
them some success.

00:45:04.495 --> 00:45:06.520
You did it.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.137
And then we move on to the next.

00:45:08.137 --> 00:45:09.970
We don't have to spend,
again, a lot of time

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.870
explaining why
they had to do it.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:18.910
We just want to help them
be successful in any given

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.400
activity.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.980
And what happens
too is, over time,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.220
it gets easier and easier.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.790
Do less for the child
to create openings.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:35.050
And, again, especially for
help, if a child needs help

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:38.164
and it's obvious to
me, I am available.

00:45:38.164 --> 00:45:39.580
And I'll put my
hands out and say,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.399
I'm right here if you want help.

00:45:41.399 --> 00:45:43.690
And I'll punch out whatever
word they should be saying,

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.500
but I don't automatically do.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.470
I'm right there.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:52.450
I'm anticipating them giving
me something or asking me

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.260
for help.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.834
But they do have to give to get.

00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:56.500
And so for kids who
don't have language,

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.958
they might put the
item in my hand.

00:45:57.958 --> 00:45:59.430
I'll say, yes, help.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.310
Help.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:00.940
And I help.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.700
For other kids, they might
give me language to help.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.740
Or for some, I'm
ready, but they want

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.566
to work on it a little longer.

00:46:07.566 --> 00:46:09.940
And I might give a little
reinforcement for that and say,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.400
you're working really hard.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.850
Again, just
reinforcing the actions

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:19.720
they are demonstrating to
me with functional language,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.110
but keeping it really simple.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.190
No matter how much
language a child has,

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.580
I do a lot more gestures
than expansive language.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:31.660
Pause often.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.360
You've seen me do that.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.870
It allows a child
to give to get.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.774
It also allows them
to read the situation.

00:46:40.774 --> 00:46:43.190
Because at some point, you
want to be able to say, Johnny.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.245
And he looks.

00:46:46.245 --> 00:46:48.250
And for follow through
of things like that.

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.650
That's much more
complicated than me

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.570
to say, Johnny, come over here.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:53.380
Have a seat.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.400
I mean, that's how
I'll first teach it.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.840
But across a room, you want
to be able to go like this.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.770
That's more subtle
social language

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.200
that we all have to read.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.750
Demonstrate nice social
emotional language and problem

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.160
solving skills.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.750
It's really
important for a child

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.030
early on to have social
emotional language.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.045
And so we teach that
by giving it to them.

00:47:16.045 --> 00:47:17.170
I know it's a little scary.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.310
They're sad or whatever.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.450
And be that yourself.

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.420
You don't always want
to do things perfectly.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.410
Have accidents.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.210
I'll have a little
water in a cup,

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.820
and I'll purposely
have it spilled.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.080
Depending on the child
I'm working with, ah!

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.880
Oh well, I'll clean it up.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.380
Right?

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.520
Accidents happen.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.510
But for some kids, their
social emotional response

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.430
is over the top.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:48.110
And so you want to have a
little bit of a reaction,

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:49.465
but then solve the problem.

00:47:49.465 --> 00:47:51.590
You don't always want to
go to solving the problem.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.990
I mean, think about
it in your own life.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.660
If you came home to
your partner and said,

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.030
oh, the traffic was so bad.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.710
I can't stand 101.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.700
It's always packed.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.830
And they're like,
why do you take 101?

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:07.640
Every time, I tell you to
go blah instead of 101.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.580
You don't want a--

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.846
you don't want solution
to that problem.

00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:13.220
You're aggravated, and you
want someone to meet you there

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.210
in that aggravation.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.010
And then you can let it go.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.710
But if someone's always
solving your problems,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:20.990
you're not going to really
talk to them about problems

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.070
so much, right?

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:24.755
You just want to be matched.

00:48:24.755 --> 00:48:25.880
And then you can come down.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.310
And so even for kids who
do have big responses--

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.710
I guess you all have
experiences before--

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:31.940
I'll match them in that.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.380
But then I can bring them down.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.750
If it's frustration, I
know it's so frustrating.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.010
I have an idea, let's try this.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:39.510
Right?

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.800
But if I don't match them
there, then I typically

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.400
can't lead them out of there.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.180
So again, depending
on what you work on.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.220
So have your own accidents.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.740
Try something and
make it not work.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:57.000
Doing household-- fixing
things around your house-- kids

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.240
love to try and do
screwdrivers or whatever.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.617
Act like you can't do it
and ask for their help.

00:49:02.617 --> 00:49:03.700
And make it really simple.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.920
Or opening a water bottle--

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.350
I'll purposely have it loose.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.620
Ugh, can you?

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.340
And I'll ask for
them to help me.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.730
And then they're able to--
oh, I love when you help me.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:13.230
Right?

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.610
Well, I already loosened it up.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:19.530
But still, I make it so that
I can't solve everything.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.790
I can't do everything.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.570
So that they can step in too.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.790
We all need those moments.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.410
Pair gestures with your words.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.970
Visuals, gestures--
they're so important.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:35.760
And so if you're not
an expressive person,

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.175
you want to turn it
on for those moments.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.490
Be a mindful teacher.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.670
You want to think about
what you're teaching

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.674
and promote that
especially imitation

00:49:47.674 --> 00:49:48.590
through demonstration.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.790
When we look at imitation--

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.040
I don't think that's in there.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:57.670
But we're looking at facial,
vocal, gestural action

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.350
with objects.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:03.220
And you want to think
about how they're doing.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.780
As your child is
developing that language,

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.250
is there a nice tone of voice?

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.060
Are they owning that language?

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.690
Are they able to not
only read come here,

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.887
but they too will do, come here?

00:50:16.887 --> 00:50:18.470
And you can especially
teach that when

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.700
there's a couple of you.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.440
Daddy, come here.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.810
Oh, you have to show him.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:22.310
Do this.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.450
And you could even
do a little hand.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.033
I'll help you.

00:50:24.033 --> 00:50:26.130
And you do come here, Daddy.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.470
And then Daddy responds.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.330
Oh, thanks for showing me.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.360
So again, you thank
them for whatever you

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.290
want the skill to improve on.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.020
So if language is already
there and you want the gesture,

00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:43.610
reinforce that gesture
by the showing.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.100
Make expectations clear.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.524
Have that beginning, middle
and end to everything

00:50:48.524 --> 00:50:49.190
you're teaching.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.590
And stick with it
for a few rounds

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.960
until they're able to read it.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.280
For some kids, it's getting
them to buy in, making it fun.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.140
And I have to sell that fun.

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.810
And so I keep doing
it that same way.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.645
And that makes it really
clear what it looks like.

00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:08.270
And for some other kids,
it's important for them

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:12.740
to observe it multiple times so
they know what their role is.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.580
If I want a child to do
fast, what does it look like?

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.580
What does it sound like?

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.790
I'm defining that word
even as I say it, right?

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:19.910
Fast, fast, fast, fast.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.570
And probably my speed
isn't really fast.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.300
It may not even
change that much.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.970
But I'm calling it fast.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.640
And the way I'm
saying it is fast.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.970
And so I'm selling
the fast concept.

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:35.310
And so it's really important
to make those expectations.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:37.400
I know you've seen that
on a few slides already.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.950
But we want them to step up.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:44.910
And make sure it's clear and
to support the follow through.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:48.140
So the same little boy,
he would have a bag.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.150
And I would ask him
to-- and heavy work

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.240
is really good
for most kids too.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.187
And so I would have him
bring the bag inside.

00:51:55.187 --> 00:51:57.770
And he would take the bag, but
he would take a couple of steps

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.290
and let it kind of
slip off his arm.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.425
And I'd do a
playful obstruction.

00:52:02.425 --> 00:52:03.710
I'd say, wait.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:04.994
To the door.

00:52:04.994 --> 00:52:06.410
But I already made
the expectation

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.080
clear to bring it to the door.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.450
So whether it's
groceries or whatever,

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.670
where do they have
to carry it to?

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.920
To the table, to
the door, whatever.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.617
I have it very clear.

00:52:17.617 --> 00:52:18.950
And so I put it back on his arm.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.820
And I actually held his arm
up, and said, I'll help you.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.140
And we go to the door with it.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:29.090
And I say, good carrying
or good listening.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.040
And then he started
to do it himself

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.200
after a couple of times
of me holding it to him.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.220
Because I couldn't-- it wasn't
an activity that I could,

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.700
in that short amount of
time, repeat over and over.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.200
He was getting
there, and I just was

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.450
having it carried to the door.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:46.160
So after a few
visits of that, he

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.857
knew that I was going
to hold him to it.

00:52:47.857 --> 00:52:49.190
And he started doing it himself.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.210
If needed, allow for
sensory input breaks.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:57.710
So if a kid's doing a
homework or whatever,

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:00.020
and you see them
moving a little more,

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:01.306
again, put language to that.

00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:02.930
Oh, I notice you're
moving in your seat

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.030
or your work's getting sloppy.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.730
How about we jump three
times and then try again?

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.700
But don't let him go watch TV
or do something that they're not

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.090
coming back from.

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:16.490
It's that sensory input.

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:17.910
It's that movement.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.750
An article came out
a few years ago now,

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:24.920
and it was research showing that
kids who sit on a bouncy ball

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.880
are much more
successful in school--

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.880
get higher grades doing
homework on a bouncy ball.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:36.500
And so having that movement can
really help with focus work.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.490
Be animated.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:38.780
You've seen that.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.190
And there's your summary.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.770
So sorry if I sped
through that last part,

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.220
but it's to get to questions.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:50.190
Oh, you should just go right--

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.290
oh, there are some resources
at the end, by the way.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.980
Including-- all these
resources you can additionally

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.990
get through ESPA.

00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:01.470
And these Yahoo chat groups
for parents only, they

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.510
vet it well as parents only.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.779
You do not have to be on
the Peninsula or Kaiser.

00:54:05.779 --> 00:54:08.070
Parents from all over different
insurances are on both.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:12.840
And they're strong advocate
parents who run those groups.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.010
SPEAKER 1: OK, we do have
some time for questions.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.380
And we'll take audience
questions first.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.190
And we do have a microphone
that we'll pass around

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:25.010
for those questions.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.420
Any audience questions?

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.070
OK.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.850
GINA BALDI: I gave
too much information.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.502
SPEAKER 1: I'll go to the Dory.

00:54:34.502 --> 00:54:35.446
Thank you.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:40.590
OK, so the first
question on the Dory

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.650
is what would you recommend
as effective methods

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:47.130
for disciplining
children with autism?

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.130
GINA BALDI: It depends
on the child, certainly.

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.910
You want to teach and
get to those yes items

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.780
as much as possible.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.970
And so certainly for some
kids, time out works--

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.560
giving a break.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.650
But having them try again
is very, very important.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:10.560
So if it's a child
who pulls hair--

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.650
I used to run a
center based program.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.581
And we had a little
boy who really wanted

00:55:15.581 --> 00:55:16.830
to play with these other kids.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.690
And he'd pull the
little girl's hair.

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:21.230
And so teaching gentle hands.

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:22.650
Oh, you can say, hi.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.490
You can pat.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.350
And so we were
right there to teach

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:29.850
what he could do with his hands
to get that interaction that we

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.890
knew he wanted.

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:37.500
So what is the purpose
of that behavior and then

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.450
looking for the replacements.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.100
What are the yes in those?

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.140
Because the no is pulling hair.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.925
Explaining that to a child-- why
they can't pull hair and that

00:55:45.925 --> 00:55:48.300
the friend won't want to play
with them and all of this--

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.310
for most kids, that's not going
to teach what should I do.

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:56.440
And so teaching the what should
they do-- if you do a time out,

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.840
you can say, OK, we're
going to take a break

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.030
and then try again.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:03.570
Give them that opportunity
to try again if it's at home.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:08.820
But then help them be
successful as they try again.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.760
SPEAKER 1: OK, one
other Dory question.

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.280
Are there any resources
that you would recommend

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.170
for parents of
older children who

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:18.180
may not have the
skill sets initially

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.650
to live on their own--

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:23.310
specifically about job, life
skill training, and resources

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:26.310
as well as possible
options such as group homes

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:29.200
or assisted living for adults?

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.080
GINA BALDI: So if you haven't
contacted the Bay Autism

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:40.790
Center in San Francisco
run by Jill Escher--

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:45.210
and she does a lot
of workshops as well.

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:50.190
Jill Escher is putting a lot
of time and effort, resources

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:54.690
into older children,
individuals.

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:57.030
You can also call ESPA.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.430
And ESPA can give you
a lot more resources.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.530
If you want anything
specific, they

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:08.250
can give you contacts and
any information around groups

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.200
and all of that.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.430
There's a lot of apps out there
that I know are being used.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.470
Again, if you call
ESPA, she can kind of

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:21.590
go over some of those
for work stuff as well.

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:26.350
SPEAKER 1: Any other audience
questions before we end?

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.796
The microphone's coming to you.

00:57:32.189 --> 00:57:33.730
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any suggestions

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:36.790
if your child is
extremely food limiting,

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:37.990
as far as their choices--

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:40.510
as far as things to kind
of get them to open up

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:43.630
to new foods and things?

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:46.420
GINA BALDI: So that is
certainly a hard one

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.560
because we get so scared of
our kids not eating that we

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.780
many times will give over.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.440
I mean, and I know the
specialists out there

00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.520
that work with food issues
have long wait lists.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.900
But a lot of--

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.150
and certainly,
you can call ESPA.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.600
And Christina can give
you some information

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.450
and contact you
with other people.

00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:11.860
There would be no cost to it.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.930
We recently did a--

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:18.640
for ESPA, I do parent
groups as well.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.550
If you ever want information on
that, they're free to attend.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:24.130
And you can do
remote and in person.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:25.330
And one was on food.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.845
And one of the tips that
this specialist gave,

00:58:27.845 --> 00:58:29.470
which I thought was
really interesting,

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:33.500
is if your child,
say, is eating bread,

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.850
well, you want to add just one
thing that complements bread

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.160
that you think will be
acceptable like butter.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.550
You don't want to then say,
OK, here's spinach, right?

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.250
Whatever they are
eating, you want

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.980
something that actually
goes with that item

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.610
to just get a different
taste on their palate--

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.470
to just stretch them
with different texture,

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:55.210
different flavor.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:58.930
That would be acceptable
for them to try.

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.076
But if you--

00:59:01.076 --> 00:59:03.220
I don't know if my
email is on here.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.590
I can send you the presentation
this individual did.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.290
They had a lot of
nice tips in that too.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:09.410
I'll give you my
email as we leave.

00:59:14.622 --> 00:59:16.670
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any recommendations

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:19.340
for when the kids
start to act silly,

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.215
especially when they're not
comfortable with the situation?

00:59:22.215 --> 00:59:24.986
They start acting very silly--

00:59:24.986 --> 00:59:26.232
very, very silly.

00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:26.940
GINA BALDI: Yeah.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:30.830
And a lot of that is
some underlying anxiety--

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:33.350
we see that as, or even
being overstimulated.

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:36.350
So deep pressure
helps with that.

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.320
I would put language to it.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.810
Start to help them discriminate
when that's appropriate

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:43.490
and when it's not.

00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:45.600
If it doesn't feel
like a connection,

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:48.740
it probably is
overstimulation, right?

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.000
So depending on where you are,
sometimes holding some item

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.476
that they can give pressure,
squeeze those balls

00:59:56.476 --> 00:59:56.975
or whatever.

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.930
We used to put weight--

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:05.030
the ankle weights-- you
open those up and put it

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.900
on a child's lap.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.722
And that will ground
them a little bit.

01:00:07.722 --> 01:00:09.680
Their feet should always
be touching the ground

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.744
to be grounded.

01:00:10.744 --> 01:00:12.160
If they're sitting
in a chair, you

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.940
don't want their feet dangling.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.550
Because then they'd have no
way of grounding themselves.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:22.520
And they can kind of start
to get out of control.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.196
If it's somewhere
where you're sitting

01:00:25.196 --> 01:00:26.570
and you can put
them on their lap

01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:29.200
and give them some deep
pressure, that can help.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.930
Just that even weight
pressure on the shoulders

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.900
to relax their body
and ground them.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.130
But you want to hold in kind
of a firm hold and with--

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:43.890
not grab squeeze, because that
can work them up even higher.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.980
But just like squeeze and hold.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.997
I won't break contact.

01:00:48.997 --> 01:00:50.330
And I will do the rule of three.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:52.163
So if I'm giving a hug
or something, right--

01:00:52.163 --> 01:00:54.260
for a child-- then I'll say, ah.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.600
And there is my beginning.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.320
Hug.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.640
And I give this nice deep hug.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.910
And then I will let up.

01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.605
But I don't break contact.

01:01:00.605 --> 01:01:01.990
And I'll do it
the rule of three.

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.640
Ah, hug.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:05.720
And I do it again.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.819
And then I'll open up.

01:01:06.819 --> 01:01:08.360
And some kids will
push back into me.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.120
I'll say, more hugs.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.630
And it's just to
relax their body

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:15.690
so that then we can
have more focused work.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:18.560
And I can move on
to something else.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.830
Deep squeezes in the
hand really help.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:23.990
And, I mean, I give
nice firm squeal.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.090
And again, I'll say, squeeze.

01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:29.460
And so that's a time where I
won't be [GASP]---- you know.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.100
When we talk about
bringing the energy,

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.200
it's not being obnoxious.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:34.990
Right?

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:39.150
Because I can do it with no
words like, I have an idea or.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:41.510
But for a child who's
kind of overstimulated,

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:44.760
then yes, it's kind of
lowering it and giving

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.025
that deep pressure.

01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:49.250
Kind of a whisper and
kind of like ready?

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.380
Let's try squeezes.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.014
And I'm always just trying.

01:01:52.014 --> 01:01:53.430
I don't know what's
going to work.

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.630
I'm taking best guess.

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:56.820
[GASP] Squeeze.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:59.070
And then I'm just
relaxing their body.

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:01.190
And then we try again,
whatever situation is.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:05.480
OK, now let's try to watch
or focus or whatever it is.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.780
And I use the word focus quite
a bit because we want focus

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.596
during certain activities.

01:02:11.596 --> 01:02:12.096
Yeah.

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:15.760
SPEAKER 1: OK.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.300
Thank you so much, Gina.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.860
Thank you, everyone,
for attending.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:22.210
[APPLAUSE]
