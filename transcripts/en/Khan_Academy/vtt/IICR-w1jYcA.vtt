00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:01.782
- [Voiceover] Let's think
about another scenario

00:00:01.782 --> 00:00:03.849
that we can model with the
differential equations.

00:00:04.452 --> 00:00:07.271
This is a scenario where we take an object

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:10.996
that is hotter or cooler than
the ambient room temperature,

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:15.871
and we want to model how
fast it cools or heats up.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.507
And the way that we'll think about it is

00:00:18.507 --> 00:00:20.206
the way that Newton thought about it.

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:25.206
And it is described as
Newton's Law of Cooling.

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:30.778
And in a lot of ways, it's common sense.

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:34.902
It states that the rate
of change of temperature

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:38.126
should be proportional
to the difference between

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.139
the temperature of the object
and the ambient temperature.

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:44.272
So let me write that
in mathematical terms.

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:46.064
So Newton's Law of Cooling tells us,

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:48.119
that the rate of change of temperature,

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.157
I'll use that with a capital T,

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:53.851
with respect to time, lower case t,

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.809
should be proportional to the difference

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.795
between the temperature of the object

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:02.053
and the ambient temperature.

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:04.197
So that is a mathematical
description of it.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.318
And once again, it's common sense.

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:08.209
If something is much, much hotter

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.216
than the ambient temperature,
the rate of change

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:11.753
should be pretty steep, it should be

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:13.499
declining in temperature quickly.

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.786
If something is much, much cooler,

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.427
it should be increasing
in temperature quickly.

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:22.743
And if something is
close, if these two things

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:24.747
are pretty close, well
maybe this rate of change

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.329
shouldn't be so big.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.683
Now I know one thing that you're thinking.

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:32.683
You're like, okay, if
the temperature is hotter

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.184
than the ambient temperature,
then I should be cooling.

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:38.969
My temperature should be decreasing.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.117
And a decreasing temperature would imply

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:43.764
a negative instantaneous change.

00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:46.920
So how will this be a negative value

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:48.693
in the case where our
temperature of our object is

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.716
greater than our ambient temperature?

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.167
And the way that that would happen is,

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.225
you would have to have a negative k.

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:57.830
If you don't like thinking
in terms of a negative k,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.089
you can just put a
negative right over here

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.861
and now you would have a positive k.

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:04.258
Now it makes sense.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:07.075
If our thing is hotter, if
it has a higher temperature

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:10.139
than the ambient temperature,
so this is a positive,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.792
then our rate of change will be negative,

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:12.740
will be getting cooler.

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:14.307
If it was the other way around, if our

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:16.881
temperature of our
object is cooler than our

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:18.557
ambient temperature, then this thing

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:21.132
is going to be a negative,
and then the negative of that

00:02:21.132 --> 00:02:23.915
is going to be a positive,
we're assuming a positive k,

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:26.847
and our temperature will be increasing.

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:30.204
So hopefully, this makes
some intuitive sense.

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:32.470
And our constant k could depend on

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.103
the specific heat of the
object, how much surface area

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:37.276
is exposed to it, or whatever else.

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:40.080
But now I'm given this,
let's see if we can solve

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.344
this differential equation
for a general solution.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.487
And I encourage you to pause
this video and do that,

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:46.196
and I will give you a clue.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:49.879
This is a separable differential equation.

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:53.295
So I assume you've had a go at it,

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:55.327
so let's now work through it together.

00:02:55.327 --> 00:02:59.602
So, we just have to
algebraically manipulate this

00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:03.387
so all my Ts and dTs are on one side.

00:03:03.387 --> 00:03:07.566
I should say, so all my capital
Ts and dTs are on one side,

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.222
this is going to be a
little bit more confusing

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.293
because I have a capital
T and a lower case t.

00:03:10.932 --> 00:03:13.316
Capital T for temperature,
lower case t for time.

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:14.743
But hopefully we'll be
able to work through it.

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.251
And then I'm going to have
all my time differentials

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.423
and time variables on the other side.

00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:21.357
So one thing I could is
I could divide both sides

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:25.513
by T minus ambient
temperature, minus T sub a.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:26.538
Remember this is just
going to be a constant

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:28.098
based on what our ambient temperature is.

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:29.165
We're going to assume
our ambient temperature

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:30.838
doesn't change as a function of time,

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.623
it's just such a big
room that our cup of tea

00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:36.635
is not going to actually warm up the room.

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:38.030
So that's just one of these assumptions

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:39.327
that we're going to make.

00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:42.083
So if we do that, if we
divide both sides by this,

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.744
we are going to have...

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:45.159
So I'm going to divide both sides,

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.491
I'm going to do this in a new color.

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:51.491
If I divide both sides
by that, I get one over T

00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:55.739
minus T sub a, and let
me multiply both sides

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.750
times the time differential.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.849
So I'm going to have, that dT,
our temperature differential.

00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:10.299
Times our temperature differential,
is going to be equal to

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:15.073
negative k times our time differential.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.147
So once again, to separate the variables,

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:22.011
all I did was divide both sides by this,

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:25.330
and multiply both sides by that.

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:27.980
Now I can integrate both sides,

00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:29.406
we've seen this show before.

00:04:30.288 --> 00:04:33.785
So I can integrate both sides.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:37.300
And the integral of this is going to be

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:39.824
the natural log of the absolute value

00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.606
of what we have in the denominator.

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.515
And you can do u substitution if you want.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.531
If we said u is equal to T minus T sub a,

00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:49.687
then du is just going to be one dT,

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:52.434
and so this is essentially,
you could say the integral

00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:54.899
of one over u du, and so
it would be the natural log

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.135
of the absolute value of u,

00:04:56.135 --> 00:04:58.378
and this right over here is u.

00:04:58.378 --> 00:05:02.279
So this is the natural
log of the absolute value

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.155
of T minus T sub a, is equal to,

00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:08.814
and once again I could
put a constant here,

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:09.678
but I'm going to end up with a constant

00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:12.175
on the right hand side too so
I'm just going to merge them

00:05:12.175 --> 00:05:14.618
into the constant on the right hand side.

00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:18.782
So that is going to be equal to, now here,

00:05:18.782 --> 00:05:23.136
this is going to be negative kt,

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:26.797
and once again we have plus C.

00:05:26.797 --> 00:05:31.370
And now we can raise e
to both of these powers,

00:05:31.037 --> 00:05:32.413
or another way of interpreting this

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:36.119
is if e to this thing is
going to be the same as that.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.841
So we can write this
as, the absolute value,

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:43.035
let me do that in that same blue color.

00:05:43.496 --> 00:05:47.345
We can write this as the
absolute value of T minus T sub a

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:51.256
is equal to e, something about e I always

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.104
think of the color green.

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:58.104
e to the negative kt plus C.

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.260
This of course is the same thing as,

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:07.311
this is equal to e to the negative kt,

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.213
we've done this multiple times before.

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:14.213
Negative kt times e to the C power.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:24.709
And we could just call this
another arbitrary constant.

00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:28.993
If we called this C1,
then we could just call

00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:30.405
this whole thing C.

00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:35.405
So this we could say is
Ce to the negative kt.

00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:40.698
So at least it's starting
to resemble what we did

00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:41.726
when we were modelling population.

00:06:41.978 --> 00:06:43.074
We'll see it's a little bit different.

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:44.937
Instead of just temperature
on this left hand side,

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:48.190
we have temperature minus
our ambient temperature.

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:51.164
And so, we can do a couple of things.

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:55.048
If, in a world, say we were
dealing with a hot cup of tea,

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.974
something that's hotter than
the ambient temperature.

00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:02.768
So we could imagine a world where T is

00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:05.623
greater than or equal to
our ambient temperature.

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:09.570
So that means this is hot, or it's hotter,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:10.080
I guess we could say.

00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:10.095
So if we're dealing with something

00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:12.306
hotter than the ambient temperature,

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:15.072
then this absolute value
is going to be positive

00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:17.081
or the thing inside the absolute value

00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:17.956
is going to be positive.

00:07:17.956 --> 00:07:19.861
So we don't need the absolute value.

00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:20.943
Or the absolute value of it is going to be

00:07:20.943 --> 00:07:22.482
the same thing as it.

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:26.163
And then we can just add
T sub a to both sides,

00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:28.740
and then we would have our temperature,

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:30.840
and I can even write this
as a function of time,

00:07:31.506 --> 00:07:33.549
is going to be equal to this business,

00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:38.936
is going to be equal to Ce, let me do that

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:40.562
in that same color.

00:07:40.562 --> 00:07:45.562
Ce to the negative kt plus T sub a.

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:52.431
All I did is I'm assuming that this

00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.670
inside the absolute value
is going to be positive,

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:56.124
so the absolute value is not
going to change the value.

00:07:57.024 --> 00:08:00.591
And I added T sub a to
both sides to get this.

00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:04.508
So this right over here is going
to be our general solution,

00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:09.508
in the case where we start
with something that is hotter

00:08:09.744 --> 00:08:11.450
than the ambient room temperature.

00:08:11.045 --> 00:08:13.259
And if we want to look at the
case where something is cooler

00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:15.122
than the ambient room temperature,

00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:17.399
so that's the situation,
let's say T is less than

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.050
our ambient room temperature.

00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:21.602
Then the absolute value of
T, then this thing over here

00:08:21.647 --> 00:08:24.221
is going to be negative, and
so the absolute value of it's

00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:25.843
going to be the negative of that.

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:30.843
So then this up here
results in T sub a minus T,

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:33.198
that's going to be the same
thing as the absolute value,

00:08:33.198 --> 00:08:35.481
it's going to be the
negative of the negative.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:40.481
So then that is going to be
equal to e to the negative k

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:52.671
plus, actually let me just do it...

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:59.013
T sub a minus T is going to be equal to Ce

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:04.991
to the negative kt, so
this is equal to that.

00:09:04.991 --> 00:09:07.623
I'm just assuming that
T is less than T sub a.

00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:12.623
And so then, to solve for T,
you could add T to both sides

00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:15.195
and subtract this from both sides.

00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:19.951
You would have T as a function
of t is going to be equal to,

00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.598
let's see, if this went onto that side

00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:25.894
and this goes over here,
you would have T sub a

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:31.479
minus Ce to the negative kt.

00:09:31.907 --> 00:09:33.265
Did I do that right?

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:34.886
So yep, that looks right.

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:38.912
So this is the situation where
you have something that is

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:43.355
cooler than the ambient temperature.

00:09:43.355 --> 00:09:45.831
So this right over
here, based on the logic

00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:50.831
of Newton's Law of Cooling,
these are the general solutions

00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:52.935
to that differential equation.

00:09:53.484 --> 00:09:54.492
In the next video we can actually apply it

00:09:55.284 --> 00:09:59.962
to model how quickly something
might cool or heat up.
