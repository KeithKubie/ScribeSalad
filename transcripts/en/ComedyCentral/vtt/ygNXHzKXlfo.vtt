I think you took
more notes than I did.

Do you have anything pertinent
to the case, you think?

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:17.617
Yeah, I have a couple circles
and a couple squiggly lines,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.519
which kind of just capture the
emotional trauma of the whole...

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:23.423
Oh, so you just were doodling
the whole time.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.358
Yeah. Plus,
there's some lines here, too.

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.392 align:start size:38% position:63%
Okay.

Have you heard
a better demo tape?

Now, I'm not talking
about the quality of the music.

Yeah, yeah.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.731
I'm talking about the quality
of the recording.

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.933 align:start size:81% position:19%
She clearly paid big bucks

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.602 size:84% position:58%
to have a pipe being banged
in the background

dur-- during this music.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.406
Well, I mean, that's straight
out of the CocoRosie playbook.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start size:38% position:63% line:85%
Oh, okay.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start position:0%
I mean, it sounds --

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.875 align:start position:0%
It sounds really like

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.844 align:end size:66% position:66%
they're in a kitchen
with pots and pans.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:46.779 size:63% position:31%

a high-traffic area.

I didn't even know if there was
music associated to it.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.618 align:end size:63% position:63%
I think there was.
I can't remember.

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.555
It was kind of more like whining
or some just --

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.924 size:88% position:56%
You know, the sound the wind
makes when it's...

Yeah.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.358 align:start size:41% position:59%
...trapped.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.462 align:start position:0%
Yeah, maybe she just had
a bottle in the wind.

[ Imitating wind blowing

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.033 size:66% position:67%
She had a confidence,
and she was --

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.468 size:72% position:64%
Like,
she didn't seem like --

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.103 size:78% position:61%
It seemed like I could be
very insulting,

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.405 align:end position:100%
and she'd just smile
and laugh it off, and...

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start size:91% position:9% line:92%
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.574 align:start size:47% position:53%
...do this.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.075 size:78% position:61%
She was doing this a lot,
you know?

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.710 size:81% position:41%
Yeah, it's kind of like...

"Oh, really?
Oh, I didn't know.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.848 size:63% position:69%

I'm doing it right now?"

what that adds to..."

I don't know
what the tie was for.

The tie was very small.

What was the tie for?

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.071 size:81% position:41%
It was just, like, someone
hit him with a shrink ray

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
before he went out.

It was like, "Beew!"

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.175 align:start position:0%
It was like this big,

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:51.644
and he was being really rushed,
and they hit the shrink ray,

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:52.812 size:88% position:44%
but it, like,
went a little bit too small,

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:54.013 align:start position:0%
but there was no time.
