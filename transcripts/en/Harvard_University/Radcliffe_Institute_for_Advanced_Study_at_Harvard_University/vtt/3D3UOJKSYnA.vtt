00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.010
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.619
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:08.910
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.990
and I am so pleased to welcome
you to this year's Julia S.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.290
Phelps Lecture in the
Arts and Humanities.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.110
Here at Radcliffe, we
have a twofold mission--

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.700
to support pathbreaking research
and creative endeavors across

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.480
all disciplines, and to share
that work with the public

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
through a full calendar
of events like today's.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.290
Today, we are gathered for
the annual Phelps lecture

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.020
in honor of Julia S. Phelps.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.660
Julia was a Radcliffe
College graduate

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.630
who worked as an art
historian, a curator,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.550
and a devoted teacher.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
Recent Phelps lectures have
featured cultural historian

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
and Boston Globe classical
music critic, Jeremy Eichler;

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.460
choreographer Karole Armitage;
and author ZZ Packer.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.310
We are grateful to
Julia's family, friends,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.470
and colleagues for
their generosity

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.690
and their support
in honor of Julia.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
And let me offer a special
welcome to Julia's daughter

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.490
and son-in-law, Susan Napier
and Steven [? Coit, ?]

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.974
who are here in the
audience with us today.

00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:14.938
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.180
This year's Phelps lecturer,
Marilynne Robinson,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.250
is one of the most
distinctive voices

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.010
in contemporary
American literature.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.800
She is in the midst of
a week here at Radcliffe

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.170
as a visiting
scholar, interacting

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
with students and faculty
across the university.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.230
And this afternoon, Marilynne
will be in conversation

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.910
with another member
of the Harvard

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.960
community, the distinguished
literary critic, James Wood.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.660
To have Marilynne and
James here together

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.080
is a fitting culmination to
a semester during which we

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.420
have enjoyed a feast
of brilliant writers,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.460
including Viet Thanh Nguyen,
Gish Jen, Claudia Rankine,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.570
Jhumpa Lahiri, and Celeste Ng.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.560
And all of those events are
available through our website

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.720
if you'd like to
watch the videos.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.430
At a time when our society is
preoccupied with what is real

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.780
and what is fake, when the
very notions of truth and fact

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.800
are under threat, it might
seem strange to celebrate

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.200
the virtues of fiction.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.300
But I don't think it is.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.440
Fiction has a remarkable
power to illuminate complexity

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.350
in action, motivation,
sensibility,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.740
and emotion that we
might otherwise struggle

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.470
to understand or to articulate.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.130
In fact, at a time when
supposedly objective observers

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.020
openly promote what
they know to be

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.040
false with the explicit
intention of misleading,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.030
great fiction can help
to ground us in the real.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.730
In today's world,
fiction can indeed

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.790
be stranger than
so-called truth.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.040
Marilynne Robinson's
particular approach

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.510
to truth-telling through
fiction is especially powerful.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.700
Reviewers of Marilynne's
work have all but

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.000
exhausted the range of
laudatory superlatives.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.590
Her debut novel, Housekeeping,
is widely considered a classic

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.950
and has earned a place on The
Guardian's list of the 100

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.830
greatest novels of all time.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.830
Marilynne's writing
is also so distinct

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.290
that critics have
struggled to pinpoint

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.690
its literary antecedents.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.670
The well-known
sportswriter Allen Barra

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.400
stepped outside of
his typical milieu

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.880
to write a glowing review in The
Atlantic, in which he described

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.300
Marilynne as, and I quote,
"an American original."

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.880
He continued, and I quote
him, "Though Robinson

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.150
may share certain sensibilities
with other writers,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.720
it's difficult to detect
more than a faint association

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.190
between her work and that
of any previous author."

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.560
James Wood, Marilynne's
conversation partner

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.460
who's here with us today, has
identified some of those shared

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.750
sensibilities, including a
familiar American simplicity

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.420
with its origins in
puritanism, as well as

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.970
echoes of Emerson and Melville.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.210
But he, too, notes that the
final composition is unique,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.480
especially among those
authors whose work

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.970
resonates with modern readers.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.339
As James put it,
referring specifically

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.430
to Marilynne's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel Gilead,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.390
and I quote, "The result is
one of the most unconventional,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.410
conventionally popular
novels of recent times."

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.900
Although Marilynne is best
known for her fiction,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.660
she also writes
meticulously-researched

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
nonfiction on an incredible
range of subjects.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.430
As a result, her body of
work resists our inclination

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.750
to pigeon-hole.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.240
How do you sum up an
oeuvre that includes

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.720
both entrancingly quiet
literary novels like Gilead,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.650
as well as a notable polemic
on nuclear waste entitled

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.790
Mother Country--

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.400
Britain, the Welfare State
and Nuclear Pollution?

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.840
Much of Marilynne's work in
both fiction and nonfiction

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.310
explores complex existential
and epistemological themes.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.920
Religion-- in particular,
Marilynne's own Protestant

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.090
Christian faith--

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.640
figures prominently,
and it is treated

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.460
with a level of
grace and nuance that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.390
is extremely uncommon in
broadly-read contemporary

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.740
literature.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.570
Marilynne's writing
also challenges

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.110
us to reconsider
notions so embedded

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.990
in our collective
consciousness that we might not

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.420
be aware of them at all.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.640
In her most recent
collection of essays

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.100
titled What Are We Doing
Here?, Marilyn writes,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.190
and I quote, "In
essential ways, we

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.090
share false assumptions
and flawed conclusions that

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.990
are never effectively examined
because they are indeed

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.490
shared."

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.040
More sardonically,
Marilyn once observed

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.040
that "unread books
may govern the world,"

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.220
referring here to our
failure to critically assess

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.970
the fundamental texts on which
so much of modern culture

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.620
is based.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.960
Some of Marilynne's
fictional characters

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.960
seem to embody the kind
of rigorous thought

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.060
that she demands of her readers.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.550
For instance, the
Reverend John Ames,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.130
who is the compelling
narrator of Gilead,

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.180
demonstrates a Christian faith
that is deeply held but still

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.760
questioning in important ways.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.870
He is keenly aware of what
he doesn't fully understand.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.960
At one point, Reverend
Ames writes to his son,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.380
alluding to a passage in the
Gospel of Mark, and I quote,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.250
"You can know a thing to death
and be, for all purposes,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.770
completely ignorant of it."

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.180
In short, Marilynne pushes us
to think carefully about what we

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.210
know and believe
and what we don't.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.290
In her essays, she does that
directly by boldly reassessing

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.380
the likes of John Calvin
and Charles Darwin,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.870
or by examining the
contemporary topics

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.330
like tribalism,
cynicism, and the state

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.220
of American democracy.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.150
But even more remarkable is
the way her novels grapple,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.890
at least tangentially, with many
of the same intellectual issues

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.570
while engaging readers on both
cerebral and emotional levels.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.560
And these novels do it
without seeming pedantic

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.000
or pedagogical.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.360
That is the power
of great fiction.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.250
Marilynne has spent
the bulk of her career

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.770
at the University of
Iowa's Writers' Workshop,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.200
where she is now
professor emeritus.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.750
In addition to the titles
I already mentioned,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.700
Marilynne has written
two other novels--

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.550
Home, which won the
Orange prize; and Lila,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.300
winner of the National
Book Critics Circle Award.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.070
In nonfiction,
besides Mother Country

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.200
and What Are We Doing
Here?, Marilynne

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.100
is the author of The Death
of Adam, Absence of Mind,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.840
When I Was a Child I Read Books,
and The Giveness of Things.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.750
Among her honors, which are
too many to name here now,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.020
Marilynne won the
Library of Congress Prize

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.170
for American Fiction in 2016.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:06.720
She also received the 2012
National Humanities Medal,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.300
awarded by President
Barack Obama for,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.370
and I quote, "her grace and
intelligence in writing."

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.420
Now, it should be said
that this was not just

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.320
a matter of her turn coming up.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.800
Rather, President Obama is
one of her greatest fans.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.180
When Marilynne retired from the
Iowa Writers' Workshop in 2016,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.630
President Obama recorded
a touching video message

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.809
to thank her for, and
I quote, "uncovering

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.809
what is most meaningful
when the rest of us

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.450
can't find the words."

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.240
James Wood is an ideal
conversation partner

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.820
for Marilynne, and I am
delighted to have him

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.070
here with us today as well.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.940
James is one of the most admired
literary critics working today

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.460
and an author in his own right.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.560
He has also been
called, and I quote,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.130
"the foremost literary
enthusiast of our time."

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.440
James is a powerful
advocate for fiction

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.490
that is both aesthetically
beautiful and real.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.550
He alludes to this commitment
in the title of his most

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.980
recent collection
of essays on fiction

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.790
which borrows its title from
a George Eliot quotation,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.760
"Art is the nearest
thing to life."

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.940
James is professor of the
practice of literary criticism

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.010
here in the English
department at Harvard,

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.550
as well as a staff writer and
book critic at the New Yorker,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.830
and a member of the
editorial board of the London

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.390
Review of Books.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.960
James was previously a senior
editor at The New Republic

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.660
and chief literary
critic at The Guardian.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.690
In addition to his collections
of critical essays,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.830
James has published a novel
entitled The Book Against God

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.710
and a book-length study
of literary fiction called

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.690
How Fiction Works.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.460
We are very
fortunate today to be

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.690
able to listen in as these
two stellar writers converse

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.370
with each other.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.810
Before I invite them
up to the stage,

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.560
let me just tell you how
the afternoon will work.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.660
Following the conversation
that they will have,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.560
there will be time for
a Q&amp;A when you, too,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.210
can join the discussion.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.250
We'll place a microphone
in this center aisle.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.170
Please, if you have a question,
line up, introduce yourself

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.760
before you ask your question.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.690
And afterwards, I invite you
all to a reception next door

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:22.800
at Fay House.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.070
Now please join me in giving
a warm welcome to Marilynne

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.630
Robinson and James Wood.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.109
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.520
- Thank you very much for
coming, and thank you to Liz

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.170
for that wonderful introduction.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.380
I think the last thing you want
to do on a Tuesday afternoon

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.870
is hear two introductions.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.000
So that's not going to happen.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.840
I think we should go
straight into our discussion.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.250
And I want it to
be free-flowing.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.650
I think there were certain
things I might come back to--

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.760
obviously, fiction.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.490
I think there might be some
interesting relationship

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:38.450
between us, perhaps even
tension at some point

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.350
because I had a very
religious upbringing

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.040
and I sort of came out the
other side from Marilynne

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.670
in some ways.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:54.270
But we overlap in a
mutual respect, I think.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.120
And of course, I have
an intense respect

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.110
for her writing, her
essays, and her fiction.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.670
In addition to
the novels, I hope

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.070
that we will talk a little
bit, too, about her latest

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.000
book, a book of lectures,
as I was saying to Marilynne

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.120
earlier, an astonishing
book in itself

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.300
given how many lectures
she's written in the last two

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.220
or three years and how
superbly they maintain

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.450
the style of her essay.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.950
So most of us, lectures
are hopeless things

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.030
full of oral clatter, let's say.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.980
And there's none of that
in Marilynne's lectures.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.400
So I thought, if you
wouldn't mind, Marilynne--

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.480
and of course you
should feel free exactly

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.800
to answer as little or
as much as you want to.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.170
But I thought, if
you wouldn't mind,

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.710
we could just start
at the beginning

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.310
with your childhood in Idaho.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.340
You've talked a lot about the
importance of public education

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.190
and of libraries.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.880
But I actually wanted to
ask you about the sort

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.780
of religious atmosphere
you were brought up in

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.450
and the development
of that sensibility

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.460
as you got into your teens.

00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:19.560
- My family was not
particularly churchy.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.720
Let's put it that way.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.610
I never doubted that
they were religious.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.760
I felt as if--

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.630
I mean, I didn't talk
about my religious thinking

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.695
either until I was, what,
through college, probably.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.060
I've never felt inhibited
or urged or coerced

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.700
or anything like that.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.200
I had a very quiet family, and
I was a quiet participant in it.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.040
And we were living
in a glorious place.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.970
And I read whatever
interested me.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.020
And I wouldn't change
any of it, you know?

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.460
- Yeah.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.470
- I was at a religious college
a few days ago, Wheaton College.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.600
And they pointed out
that I had said somewhere

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.460
that it was not
my family's habit

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.930
to say grace before meals.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:13.050
You have to be careful what
you confide to an interviewer.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.042
I felt suddenly rebuked.

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:17.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.000
- Was there a moment where--

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.149
I mean, given that background--

00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:27.690
and I don't want to
reduce everything

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.910
to some sort of 19th
century religious dilemma.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.530
But it seems, given
that background,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.470
you could, as it were,
have gone either way.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.150
Did you have a sense in
your late teens or 20s

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.850
of adding to whatever
religious inheritance you had,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.840
of being unfolded
in a way that was

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.170
more intense than your parents?

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.480
- I was interested,
in the first place,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.675
in religion as a metaphysics.

00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:06.660
I was interested in
it as a worldview.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.965
I don't know when this began.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.930
Religious thought never seemed
to me separate from thought

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.710
itself.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.560
And it was a very
natural path for me

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.700
to follow farther and farther
into for exactly those reasons.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.390
It always felt to me as if
there were a soundness to it

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.780
and, at the same time,
an openness to it.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.410
I think, often, people
who are brought up

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.510
in religious
atmospheres, they often

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.690
feel constrained by what
they have been taught.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.250
But to me, it always
seemed like it

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.000
raised absolutely the largest
questions, the most interesting

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.410
questions.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:52.630
And so I was propelled
autonomously, in effect,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.210
in the direction that
was very natural to me.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.260
- Yeah.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.800
You've said, I think, about
your novel Housekeeping,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.040
which, by my
calculation, is taught

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.100
on at least four
courses here at Harvard,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.150
which is fairly astonishing.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.120
It used to be a fair bet that
you could say that the only two

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.400
novels that any of the
students will have read

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.050
were Lolita and
To the Lighthouse

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.832
because they were all taught
on overlapping courses.

00:16:16.832 --> 00:16:19.040
But now, I think we have to
add Housekeeping to that.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.830
I teach Housekeeping.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.990
I love that book.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.730
And I know you've
described it as being,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:34.690
in some way, an accounting
for and a summation

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.970
of the kind of--

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.520
that you wanted to work
with the materials that

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.960
were available to you as a
child growing up in Idaho.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.570
That's to say, the kind of
things you would have learnt

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.470
at school, the
natural resources.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.000
And of course, that's a
beautiful element in the book.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.380
In some ways, I
think the book is

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.980
about the construction
of a religion out

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.420
of the available
bits and pieces,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.900
including school textbooks and,
quite literally, twigs and soil

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.500
and water.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.459
Can I ask you, when you
were writing Housekeeping,

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:24.050
when you wrote it and how you
went about writing that novel?

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:31.100
- Well, I wrote a
dissertation on Shakespeare.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.870
And when I was
doing that, people

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.300
told me that if you
wrote that sort of thing,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.290
you would not also
write a novel.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.460
We're here to contest that view.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:47.840
But in any case, so as I
was writing my dissertation,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.690
I was writing
extended metaphors.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.020
And my interest in
extended metaphors

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.810
came directly from 19th
century American literature.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.730
So I think you can see
the allusions that I'm

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.270
making in Housekeeping.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.610
But I wrote these things,
and they were in a stack.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:09.280
And I realized that I actually
had made the core of something

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.080
or the beginning of something.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.540
And then I went
to France to teach

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.100
in an exchange for a year.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:23.140
And while I was there, the
university went on strike.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.710
What could I do?

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.970
The building was locked.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.000
What can I say?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.300
But in any case, so I
was living in this house

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.660
out in the French countryside.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.260
And I was considered a novelty.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.260
And so the little kids that
lived in the neighborhood

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.866
would come over and pound on
my windows to see me move.

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:49.760
I mean, that was literally it.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.540
We would wave.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.030
So I went into a back
room in that house,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.400
and I closed those big shutters.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.415
And that made the
room absolutely dark.

00:19:00.415 --> 00:19:04.130
And I had a little, wobbly
bedside lamp, and a spiral

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.670
notebook, and a black pen.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:14.430
And I began writing, continuing
what I had done before.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.960
And it was very interesting
and valuable to me

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.260
because I was in what
amounted to a sort

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.950
of sensory deprivation
environment.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.711
And I was--

00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:28.460
I've already told this
story this morning.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.880
But anyone who heard
it before, forgive me.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.820
I would be plunging
around in my memory,

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.580
trying to remember Idaho.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:45.410
I hadn't lived there
for, like, 17 years.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:51.200
I found that I had, over
time, an extraordinary success

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.090
remembering Idaho.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.910
And this acquainted
me with the fact

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.440
that my mind was much larger
than my customary access to it

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.810
would let me know, that my
memory was very, very much

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.300
fuller and more precise
than anything that I

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.090
would have imagined.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.970
I'm pleased.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.360
Sometimes-- there are all
these mountain systems there--

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.360
Bitterroot, and bannock and all
these kinds of [? cabinet ?]

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.670
and so on, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:25.100
And people would write to me and
say, which mountains, asking--

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.200
they had had an argument
about which mountains

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.530
I was referring to, which
pleased me very much.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:37.280
But in any case, I found my way
into that novel in that way.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.900
And over time, I
wrote it, as it were,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.790
long story short, as they say.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:52.660
But when I came back to
America, a friend of mine

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.490
had written and
published a novel.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.390
And he asked if he could see
my novel, and I gave it to him.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:04.280
And he sent it to his
agent, didn't tell me.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.850
So out of a blue sky, I
got a letter from an agent

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:12.040
saying she would like
to represent my book.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.880
She's still my agent.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.110
But people ask me how to
enter the literary world.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.060
I have no idea.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.580
- Fantastic.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.960
It feels to me like a different
novel from your later books.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.267
And obviously, there
can be reasons for that.

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:34.850
One would be that
there was a long gap

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.060
between the next three.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.620
Another is that the next three
belong together in some way.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.800
But the prose also
seems different.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.270
And I understand when you say
that the first book came out

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.990
of a thing of writing,
experimenting, in a way,

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.130
with long metaphors.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.290
I mean, you can see that
in the book, of course.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.550
It's absolutely part
of the fabric of it.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.370
When you came to fiction again--

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.560
it's rather assuming that
you hadn't in between.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.160
But as it were, when you were
next writing fiction, whenever

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.974
that was, was it the
same kind of prose?

00:22:14.974 --> 00:22:16.640
Did it feel like the
same kind of prose,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.860
or did you feel, OK, that was
a particular pinnacle that I

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.349
reached and a
different kind of place

00:22:24.349 --> 00:22:26.390
that I want to be now in
terms of just the style?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.710
- Well, when I was working on
Housekeeping, one of the things

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.110
that bothered me is
that a great deal

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.207
of contemporary
literature, things

00:22:38.207 --> 00:22:40.040
that I read about in
the newspaper and so on

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.370
at that time, seemed to me to
be incredibly conventional--

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.380
thin characters
and tired language.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.890
And so I thought, well, I can
retreat into my own enclave.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.610
Nobody has written about
my little part of Idaho.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.480
And so I had the
whole thing to myself,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.130
whatever kind of language
and association and so on I

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.950
wanted to explore.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.780
But then 24 years passed.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:10.550
And then I was out on the
cape, waiting for my sons

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.670
to join me for Christmas
in an empty hotel.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:18.560
And John Ames
spoke into my mind.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.600
I don't know what that means.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:27.080
I got-- the first sentences of
Gilead simply occurred to me.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.450
They had the heft of
a novel behind them.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.950
And so I wrote on from there.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.759
Voice is what
determines my style.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:36.300
I don't know.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.520
I couldn't go back to
the character of Ruth

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.620
or the problems of Ruth, so I
couldn't go back to her prose

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.920
either.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.904
- Right, that makes
a lot of sense.

00:23:46.904 --> 00:23:49.320
Is there another way, though,
in which that first novel is

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.570
different from the later ones?

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.030
Or maybe I'm just
trying to find things

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.275
that I'm determined to find.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.360
But it seems to me that if
we could say of the trilogy--

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.150
I mean, you're never an
orthodox writer, religiously.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.087
But if we can say of the Gilead
trilogy, that it's more--

00:24:10.087 --> 00:24:11.670
I think one could
fairly say that it's

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:19.290
more obviously located in a
set of recognizable Christian

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.690
traditions, should we say.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.730
What's very striking
about Housekeeping

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:29.890
is this flood-like
paganism that seems

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.430
to be about to inundate
everything and sweep away

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.930
everything.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.050
Or put it another way,
what's remarkable to me

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.730
when I reread it,
when I teach it,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.440
is what you call the
resurrection of the ordinary.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.930
The spring, just walking
through a forest and spring

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:55.350
about to happen or
happening, is a strong rival

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.550
to any orthodox religious
spiritual resurrection

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.950
that there might be in the
novel, such a strong rival

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:07.540
that it might even outdo
it, if that makes any sense.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.870
In other words, I feel
that novel is really--

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.060
when I said earlier that
it's about the construction

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.360
of a religion, I meant that
in the sense of with all

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:23.880
the possible heresies and
impurities, as it were,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.100
that might happen
when you just decide

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.200
to construct a religion
out of what's at hand.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.170
When you look back,
does it feel different

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.420
in that theological sense?

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.770
- I think of it
as an exploration

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.400
of what is called natural
religion, the sort of chapter

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.375
1 of Romans, you know?

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.170
- Yeah.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.900
- I mean, in a way, I
recapitulate my childhood

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.020
because I did, in a sense,
put my religious consciousness

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:04.640
together out of experience
rather than out of instruction

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.320
and ideas like resurrection.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.740
And so I remember
how strange, how

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.590
almost daunting, or something,
those ideas seemed to me when

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.945
I was a child to the extent--

00:26:14.945 --> 00:26:17.540
I mean, you hear of the
word, and you sort of

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.010
have the image in mind.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:30.190
But I'm interested in the
theology of the uninstructed.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.540
Ruth is one example,
and Lila's another.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.890
I think that a
great deal of what

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:41.120
one could describe as
religious understanding

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.600
is sensitivity to
what is implicit.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.400
- Yeah, yeah.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.200
Can I just talk to you for
a second about resurrection?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.780
I think it's your great
abiding obsession.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.690
You have a few, but that's
a really powerful one.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.510
It's there in all the books.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:13.100
Sometimes, it's figured as
home and the return to home.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.470
Often, as justice--
and you're equally

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:21.460
interested in political justice,
the restoration of the healing

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.770
and restoration that's
necessary on earth as much as it

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.400
is in heaven.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:34.170
But this is a constant
element in your writing,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.042
what you beautifully call
the lore of completion.

00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:39.750
In Housekeeping, you
say where everything

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.360
will be made comprehensible.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.550
What are all these fragments for
if not to be knit up finally?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.950
And then some of you might
remember, in Gilead, there's

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:56.880
this fabulous thing that I often
return to that John Ames says

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.460
about the famous
verses from Revelation

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:05.672
about how, when we reach
heaven, God will wipe away

00:28:05.672 --> 00:28:07.380
all our tears, and
there shall be no more

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.710
death, neither crying
or sorrow, verses

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.200
which obsessed another
heaven-obsessed writer,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.820
Dostoevsky.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.290
John Ames, glossing
those verses,

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.100
writes, "It takes nothing from
the loveliness of the verse

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.760
to say that is exactly
what will be required."

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.090
So there is a great
deal of suffering,

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:38.070
and a great deal of healing will
be needed to make up for that,

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:42.120
compensate for that suffering.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.530
As you can probably tell, I'm
fairly obsessed with this too.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.064
The problem is I
can't believe it.

00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:51.480
And what I love
about your work is

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.960
that it's also
full of people who

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.460
they believe it more
than I do, and they want

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.890
to believe it more than I do.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.700
But in your writing,
it's also hedged around

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.410
with a great deal of
necessary doubt and anxiety.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.820
And I respond to that very much
as the kind of reader I am.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.837
And I really just wanted
to talk to you about that.

00:29:16.837 --> 00:29:18.170
That's a little vague, isn't it?

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.180
All right, let me just
ask you about this lovely

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.380
"It takes nothing from the
loveliness of the verse

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:32.770
to say that is exactly
what will be required."

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.510
- Well, as far as
resurrection is concerned,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.990
just to back away from
the question for a moment,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.400
I think of it in terms
of there being what I

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.420
think of as a human over plus.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:51.710
I think of people as being much
too profound, much too complex,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:58.540
much too open to the extremes
of experience to simply live

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:02.050
fourscore years and die.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.890
I mean, in that sense,
just on humanist grounds,

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:11.110
it seems almost inevitable to
think that there is more to us

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.680
than perishes in this world.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.720
This has been very
important to me

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.790
from the point of view
of characterisation,

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.280
just to be technical
about it, but you know.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.240
So often characters, seem
almost thrown away in fiction.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.050
They seem dismissed.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.030
And I feel as though that's
always, always inappropriate,

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:35.830
that it is simply
authorial neglect.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.920
I think that--

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.470
I mean, on that
basis, I don't come

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.270
at resurrection doctrinally.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.730
I come at resurrection
like, that certainly

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.645
seems right to me.

00:30:52.165 --> 00:30:58.260
I think that if there's a
reality that is humane enough

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:06.270
to super-induce life from
us, I think it would also

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.690
be attentive to our tears.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.110
And it would reflect
the existence of a God

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.370
who is attentive to them who
would make the very tender

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.180
fatherly gesture.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.110
- Unfortunately,
as you know well--

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.780
and you write about this,
and you imply it often

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.960
in your essays.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.980
The promise of a
spiritual restoration

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:43.170
can get in the way of actual
material political restoration.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:47.970
That is to say, it can
be one of the curses,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:58.260
I think, of a certain
kind of religious charity,

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.340
is that instead of the
here and now, there

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.410
is an emphasis on the
then and the future.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.080
Is that fair?

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.830
Am I characterizing--

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.220
- I think that can be true.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.160
I am a Calvinist
because I read Calvin,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.360
and he persuaded
me of many things.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.620
But one of the things
he said is that if God

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.360
wanted us to know
anything about heaven,

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.090
we'd know something about it.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.900
The fact that we don't
know anything about it

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.570
means we have to pay
attention to what we can know,

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.350
which is this world, this life.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.840
And so I don't--

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.810
I mean, I have a
religious resistance,

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.330
that he named for
me, to imagining

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.070
a life beyond this one.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:51.150
I'm very happy to concede the
possibility or the likelihood.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.590
But in terms of the specifics,
I expect to be surprised.

00:32:58.569 --> 00:33:00.360
- Of course, your
fiction is full of people

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.100
who are imagining,
in often quite

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.390
hilarious, practical
physical detail,

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.840
going right back to the
beginning of Housekeeping,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.260
or right through, I
think, to your last novel,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.470
and indeed, to that
wonderful essay, I think,

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.670
where you talk--

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.170
I can read the very
beginning of it.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.870
Where is it now?

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.940
It's the one about
hope where you

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.820
talk about someone who was at
church with you who suddenly

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.520
said, if heaven
exists, she would

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.082
like to go up and take the
hand of her grandmother,

00:33:39.082 --> 00:33:40.040
or something like that.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.590
It's very nice.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.960
I've got to try and find it.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.970
But yeah, going right
back to Housekeeping

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.930
when I think Ruth's
grandmother is

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:54.850
said to expect that heaven will
look quite a lot like Idaho.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:03.465
And of course, these are
ordinary human desires.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.500
You're brilliant at
writing about them.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.920
Do you have them yourself?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.510
I mean, do you fall
prey to them yourself?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.010
I mean, you said
just now, you feel

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.550
you shouldn't be imagining
heaven as anything

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.560
just as more than a surprise.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.239
But do you actually
do the same things

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.115
that your characters
do, which is think, oh,

00:34:27.115 --> 00:34:28.989
that's where I'll see
my mother, that's where

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:31.150
I'll see my father, and
they'll look like this,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:34.210
and the room will
be such and such?

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.429
- I can't really--

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.510
my imagination stops at the
point of whom I would encounter

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.565
and under what circumstances.

00:34:42.565 --> 00:34:44.800
I mean, the great--

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.239
it's like the
question that Jesus

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:50.770
has asked of somebody who
has seven husbands, who's

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.909
wife is she.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:57.190
And we are so entangled
with one another that--

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.680
I mean, I might want
to see my mother,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.151
but then her sisters
might have a prior claim.

00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:02.650
I mean--

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.295 --> 00:35:08.270
I take it to be unfathomable.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.180
And to the extent
that I talk about it,

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.320
I'm usually sort of
literalizing assumptions

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.420
that I would not directly share.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.130
I assume it would be wonderful.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.350
That's certainly its reputation.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:20.850
But I--

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.960
Beyond that, I just hesitate--
you know what I mean?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.300
I find the image problematical.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.550
I do always have
people walking out

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.160
of the lake and all
that sort of thing.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.210
But that's only her
saying, how can we

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.440
imagine the life that has
fallen into this lake,

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.490
and how can we imagine
its [? purdurability? ?]

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.450
- Yeah, yeah.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.400
The thing from
your essay, "Hope,"

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.480
is, "In church, a
lady so tiny with age

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.990
that when she stood up, her hat
was just visible above the pew,

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.650
said, 'The first thing I'll
do when I get to heaven,

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.040
I'll run and find my grandma.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.720
She loved me so much.'

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.330
Her small voice crackled
with anticipation."

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.480
But it's a very humane
vision you have, I think,

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.170
because you see that--

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:20.532
I mean, what I love
about it is when

00:36:20.532 --> 00:36:21.990
I was trying to
work this stuff out

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:28.680
to my satisfaction as a
teenager and in my early 20s,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.550
I abstractly, I
suppose, abstractly came

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:39.722
to a number of decisions about
the impossibility of heaven,

00:36:39.722 --> 00:36:41.180
beginning with the
idea that heaven

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.020
was the great problem
for [? theolocy, ?] not

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.160
the solution to
it, but containing

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.330
such questions as
precisely the ones you deal

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.280
with humanely in your fiction.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.020
That's to say, continuity.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.390
It can't be just
like it is on earth.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.970
If it were, we'd all be
doing exactly, up there,

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.340
what we do here, which
would mean, of course,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.430
that it's like Eden.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.140
We would be spoiling it with
error and sin and freedom.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.530
So it can't be the same
as it is down here.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.990
But so that's continuity.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.040
But difference is
also the problem.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.400
Because if it's
too different, it

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.640
doesn't seem to have any of the
pleasures that life here has,

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.200
and we can't imagine it.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.120
And the unimaginability is,
I think, part of the problem.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.757
And then adequacy, which goes
back to the beautiful John Ames

00:37:34.757 --> 00:37:36.590
thing, "It takes nothing
from the loveliness

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:40.620
of the verse to say that is
exactly what will be required."

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:46.850
Adequacy, how does salvation,
healing, restitution,

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.070
the law of completion,
how could it ever

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:57.720
compensate adequately for
the suffering that many of us

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.510
have to put up with on earth?

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.280
- Well, one can
only assume it can.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:10.960
I mean that it is
of a kind that does.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.060
I think that a long life, in
retrospect, seems very brief,

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.030
she said, speaking
as one who knows.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:26.830
I'm sure that in the
temporal scale of the cosmos,

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.430
all of our lives will
seem extraordinarily

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.170
brief to the point
of disappearance

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:39.470
from assuming any
kind of other life.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.910
There is no way to--

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:47.870
I mean, if you remove the
idea of an embracing God

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:52.530
who nevertheless presides over
a world in which suffering

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.330
is very, very common
and always has

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.850
been-- god bless our ancestors.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.970
But if you remove that,
then what you have

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:07.050
is simply suffering, about
which nothing can be made.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.590
You can't even say, then,
what a terrible thing it

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.700
is that a human being
should live so briefly

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.820
or live so painfully.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:20.330
Because then, we lack the
sanctifying definition

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:25.779
that makes our suffering
matter in the universe.

00:39:25.779 --> 00:39:27.070
And we have to believe it does.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:27.819
- Yeah, I suppose.

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:30.140
Well, one could
argue that what you

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:35.000
have without the promise
is just the suffering, yes,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.080
without the false
promise, shall we

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.050
say, of restoration, which
would then force you,

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:50.010
one, to concentrate on
the restoration here

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.290
and now, I suppose.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.290
But again, what I like
about your fiction

00:39:55.290 --> 00:40:00.630
is the way in which it's
alive to these doubts

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.320
and uncertainties, the
tendency to overliteralized.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.600
And it's also alive to the
fact that if one idea of heaven

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.430
is going home, Eden,
going back to the place

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.480
that you came from, your
characters don't really

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.680
want to be there.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.640
I mean, if you think
of Ruth and Sylvia

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.920
at the end of Housekeeping,
they're wanderers.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:34.200
Jack Boughton comes home, is the
prodigal son, but leaves home.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.050
And the constant-- what
I love about [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.700
is that she's always
about to take off, right?

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.450
You're not sure at
the end of the novel

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.680
whether she's even
going to stay,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.138
even though you know from the
earlier novels that she must.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.800
I like that a lot.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.382
I think that you're
wonderfully alive to that.

00:40:52.382 --> 00:40:54.090
And I suppose this is
a way of asking you

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.100
whether you feel that--

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.410
I suppose it must be the case--

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:03.540
that writing fiction helps
you to dramatize, stage,

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.900
work certain things out in a
way that, say, writing an essay

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.680
might not.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.042
- Well, that's certainly true.

00:41:10.042 --> 00:41:11.850
That is certainly true.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.850
Writing fiction is
another way of thinking

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.380
that is satisfying to me.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:21.160
Also, the feeling of following
a thought to its conclusion--

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.500
it's just in another
dialect, in effect.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.260
Well, it's quite other.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.110
But when you talk about the
improbability of heaven,

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.230
how improbable is this life?

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:40.400
It's 99% anti-matter,
100% matter,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.530
emerged from the
Big Bang, right?

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.000
That's the theory.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.110
We exist because there is that
tiny failure of equivalence

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.591
between these two things.

00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:51.950
I mean, you can go through--

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.700
I'm not using an argument
from design or anything.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:01.070
I'm just saying that this
world in this universe

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.980
is such an improbable thing.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.820
And if you were
back at moment one

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.980
and someone said, well,
here are some protons

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.740
and here are some neutrons,
put a world together

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:17.200
to be populated by creatures
that love poetry, you know?

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.570
- That's absolutely true.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.361
I can't deny that.

00:42:25.361 --> 00:42:26.343
Nevertheless--

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.307
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:38.370
Nevertheless, if you look
at the very narrative arc

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:46.700
that we are given as Christians,
say, from the Hebrew Bible,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.530
it would suggest surely that--

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.510
and your own fiction
rather plays into this--

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:55.260
that home isn't the
place we return to.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.610
Home is the place
we always leave,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.520
right-- that there may
be an Eden somewhere.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.870
But if we get to it,
we'll almost as soon

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:06.240
have to leave it,
that we're always

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.900
leaving rather than going back.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.860
That, as it were, to adapt
that terrifying Kafka

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.370
line about there is infinite
hope, but not for us,

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:21.940
there is a law of
completion, but not for us.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.652
- Well, you'd have to prove it.

00:43:23.652 --> 00:43:26.910
- [LAUGHS] Well, that remains
to be seen, doesn't it?

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:27.600
- Yes, it does.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.710
- Neither of us will know.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.534
- We're all
interested observers.

00:43:31.534 --> 00:43:32.950
- Let me ask you
another question.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:37.440
We're on this thing of doubt or
whatever we're talking about.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.560
You do talk about doubt, and
you have done in your essays.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.870
And of course, I love the
dynamic in your essays,

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:55.260
that on the one
hand, you're quite

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.710
good at bringing the hammer down
when it needs to come down--

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.660
say, defending Calvin
or Jonathan Edwards

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.620
or something like that.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.350
And it's good work.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:09.580
And it's an
instruction to read it.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.540
And you're also very
good at giving space

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:18.150
to your liberal Christianity,
which is liberal in this also

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.070
sense of having doubt.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.050
So I suppose a question, which
is an impertinent one, perhaps,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:27.080
but one I would like to
ask you is, when you doubt,

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.830
what do you doubt?

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:39.120
- Well, I'd say
here, again, I think

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.490
I'm a Calvinist because
my family were Calvinists,

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.210
but they'd forgotten it already.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.400
But I have always
considered doubt

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.070
to be a dielectric with faith.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.880
He says that, that you slip back
because your assumptions are

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.520
too narrow.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.110
And then being
instructed, I doubt

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:05.130
you'd make another experiment of
thought or belief or whatever.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:10.200
So I have not ever dealt with
doubt as being a problem.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.960
I've always seen it as--

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.891
I mean, sometimes you--

00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:17.700
I don't know.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.740
I haven't doubted in
quite a long time.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.280
I'll tell you the truth.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:28.080
I consider my life
to be completely

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.110
unanticipateble by me.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.600
I wrote a book I thought
would never be published,

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.520
and I get a letter in
the email from an agent.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.660
I mean, that's sort of
the image of my existence.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.030
I find it fantastic.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:48.585
I'm supposed to be one of the
hundred most influential people

00:45:48.585 --> 00:45:49.960
in the world.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.005
Even, what, Time
Magazine said that,

00:45:52.005 --> 00:45:53.370
and they're never wrong, right?

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.860
- Never.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.750
- I mean, this is just
grossly improbable.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:58.290
And it has--

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.831
- They got Trump
right so many times.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.590
- So anyway, I feel as though
I know what I want to do,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.070
which I consider to
be a great blessing.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.350
So long as my faculties
hang together,

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.140
I will do what it seems
to me as if I ought to.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.490
I'm content with that.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.730
I'm much more than content--

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.870
amazed at the
opportunity, frankly.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.360
- Between Housekeeping
and Gilead,

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.060
you were writing essays.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.637
And you may-- also,
you will tell me--

00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:31.720
have been writing fiction.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.300
Why were you writing essays, and
so many essays, in that period

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.780
and not, at least,
publishing fiction?

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.580
- I wasn't writing fiction.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.890
I had a crisis, a crisis
you might call a doubt.

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.900
After I finished
Housekeeping, which

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.500
I liked and I was pleased with
the reception of it and so on,

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.940
but I felt as if I had
solved a problem in a way

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.160
that it would be
dishonest to repeat.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.740
I could not use the
same solution again.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.520
I did not want to be
regional in the sense

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.090
that I could not move
beyond my region.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.470
And I realized, frankly,
that my education,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:19.410
as much as I valued
it, was really

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.410
only an annotated bibliography.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.380
I just knew what I had--

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.300
I had a general sense
of what I should know

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.100
and no great confidence that I
knew it in any meaningful way.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:38.580
So I went-- the luxury, I spent
24 years basically reading,

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:42.650
reading things like
The Wealth of Nations,

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:48.600
Malthus' theory of population,
Capital, every book

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.990
that everyone had always
spoken to me about as if they

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.720
had read it.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.930
And it was a new territory.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.810
It was a-- you know what I mean?

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.700
And once you start
doing that, then there's

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.380
no natural stopping place.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.910
I just stopped finally because
I had this novel in my mind.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.610
But to the extent
I've stopped, I'm

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.720
still reading all
kinds of strange things

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:13.890
by other people's standards.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:24.300
But I could not repeat the
northwestern provincial style.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.953
Don't ever quote that.

00:48:25.953 --> 00:48:28.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:32.840
And I could not write anything
else with the confidence

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.270
that I myself was
actually saying this.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:39.890
And so I did a great
deal of very basic work

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.340
in order to feel that my
thoughts were, in some degree,

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:43.935
my own.

00:48:43.935 --> 00:48:47.180
And of course, there are limits
to how much that's ever true.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:51.050
But I felt, finally, as if I
could speak in my own right,

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:52.227
you know?

00:48:52.227 --> 00:48:53.660
- Yeah.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.080
And one conclusion you came
to, I know from that reading,

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:02.620
is the one that Liz quoted
in her introduction.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.350
And it's in one of the
essays in the new book,

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:15.470
that the world is run,
not very well, according

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.610
to unread books.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.440
One of them is the Bible.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.956
Do you want to name another?

00:49:23.956 --> 00:49:27.395
- Well, Capital is
certainly a good example.

00:49:27.395 --> 00:49:28.640
And it's so odd.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.990
I mean, frankly,
the same person that

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:37.010
sent my novel to his agent also
lent me his copy of Capital,

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:38.510
which I never returned.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:44.750
But in any case, that's
embarrassing, but it's true.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:49.700
But he writes in the
style of Martin Luther.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:54.020
He does this because he was
reared as a Lutheran, right?

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.260
Who doesn't?

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.300
I mean, we are such--

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.390
what do you call it--
racists or something

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.750
that we assume that
we know everything

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.990
about this man because
of his, what, last name?

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:10.640
But in any case, when you
read him, having read Luther,

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.370
you can see what kind of
argument he's making and why.

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.030
I mean, and of course, this
is complicated by the fact

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.740
that they're a hundred
of years apart,

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.030
and there's the influences
of culture and so on.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:31.130
But nevertheless, that's
something that's absolutely not

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:32.700
recognized in him.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.320
He was dealing in the
language of social morality--

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.360
I mean, basic equity--

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.590
that you find in Adam Smith and
that you find in the tradition

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.925
that he felt that he--

00:50:43.925 --> 00:50:47.180
he was writing for Germans.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.900
So his polemical
methods would certainly

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:54.590
be influenced by the most potent
polemic that was ever launched

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.375
in the German language.

00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:59.810
I mean, the sort of
de-contextualization

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.590
that people engage in,
which is dramatically

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.470
inappropriate to an
interpretation of his work.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.920
The reason-- I mean, I sort
of started early with Marx

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.670
because I knew so many
Marxists, and I never

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.680
knew one who had read him.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:25.910
- So once you were really
reading Marx, what conclusions

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.230
did you come to in terms of--

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:32.030
I mean, what were people
taking from the Marx

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.980
they weren't reading?

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.260
How was he getting
flattened down,

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.890
and what would it be
that you want to restore?

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:43.400
What would be most
important to talk

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.710
about now about our neglect
of actually really Marx?

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:50.230
What are we not getting there?

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.070
- Well, his argument
is basically

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:57.680
a recoil from the fact of
the extraordinary suffering

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.850
of the working class.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:03.740
I mean, when-- what's his name--

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:09.350
Disraeli said that the lifespan
in Manchester, at that time,

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:11.030
was 15.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.310
People could expect
to live to be 15.

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:20.330
And I mean, the routine,
mechanized brutality

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.110
of reducing populations
to that level, I mean,

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.570
that's where you have to
begin in understanding Marx.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.410
And then I'm sure
we could find things

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:33.440
that are perfectly equivalent
in other parts of the world,

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.900
and certainly in the less
well-functioning parts

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.180
of this country.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:45.290
So I mean, there's a
humanitarian core in Marx

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.780
that was turned into
some kind of, like,

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.080
industrial-age
machinery so that you

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.490
had this and that dialectic
going on and so on,

00:52:55.490 --> 00:53:00.350
completely without
the moral ballast

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.965
that is absolutely
central to Marx himself.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.200
- And this is generally, in your
essays, particularly when, say,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.260
you write about the university,
but it's a strong current

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.720
throughout this book--

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.762
as I was reading it, I was
thinking how much you sound--

00:53:18.762 --> 00:53:20.720
and I'm not the first
person to have said this,

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:27.530
I know-- but how much you
sound like certain 19th century

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.310
social critics.

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:34.910
There's a real prophetic
strain in your writing,

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:38.480
perhaps increasingly
emboldened, as you are,

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:44.780
by the last four or five years
of political developments.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.580
But there's a strong
sound there of certain--

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.370
Marx would be one.

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:51.770
Ruskin might be
another, maybe even

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:55.280
Dostoevsky of Notes from
Underground-- an attack on what

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:04.130
you see as a stifling
pragmatism, utilitarianism,

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:08.420
a narrow economic
definition of both education

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.690
and of human potential.

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:17.770
And that's a powerful
note in your essays.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:23.182
I know you talked somewhat to
President Obama about that.

00:54:23.182 --> 00:54:24.890
But I'd sort of hoped,
in that interview,

00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:30.250
that you and he would dig
a little further into that.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:31.380
- Yes, well, it ended.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.640
He was on a tight schedule,
and we were just getting

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.740
into the meat of things.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:40.930
And then suddenly, operatives
come and scuttle him out

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:42.747
of the room.

00:54:42.747 --> 00:54:44.455
It's the problem
talking with presidents.

00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:46.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:47.705 --> 00:54:51.610
- This is the first
moment where I

00:54:51.610 --> 00:55:00.329
hear you taking justifiable
pride in your achievements.

00:55:00.329 --> 00:55:02.620
- Actually, I'm going to
limit myself to one president.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:11.565
- Yeah, well, it's
true that there's

00:55:11.565 --> 00:55:14.640
a sad moment in that
wonderful exchange that

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.325
was published in the Review
of Books where Obama says--

00:55:18.325 --> 00:55:21.090
or maybe it's elsewhere
that he says something

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.060
about how he picked
up Gilead when

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.240
he was campaigning in Iowa.

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.900
And he says something like,
there were long journeys

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.610
between campaign stops.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:36.140
There's a lot of
down time to read.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.090
I immediately think, well, not
with the current president.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:43.290
That's just more
time to watch TV.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:47.670
Maybe we should open
the questioning up

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.590
to the audience at this point.

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.010
We've got about 20
minutes, I think.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.600
Here we go.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.240
- Hi, I'm Patsy
[? Bodwin. ?] I'm

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.430
curious to know whether
your books are--

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:01.417
I assume your books
have been translated.

00:56:01.417 --> 00:56:03.750
And I'm wondering what you
think of the reception you're

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.550
getting in any
countries that you would

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:06.660
want to speak to us about.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.330
- My books have been translated.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.610
My most recent
language is Icelandic.

00:56:18.828 --> 00:56:20.180
I don't know.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.760
I can't follow those
things particularly well.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.240
But I assume, since
they keep getting

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.910
translated in places
like Iran and so on,

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:34.910
that they have a reasonable
history of life in translation.

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.810
I'm very grateful to think
that people are reading them

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:43.780
in other places.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.770
- Hi.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:46.690
My name is Sarah, and--

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.940
oh, this is very loud.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.730
So my question is I guess
Calvinists kind of have

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:56.090
this reputation as being,
like, grumpy and boring,

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.770
which is not how I
think many people who've

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.810
read your books would
characterize them

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:03.910
or the people in them.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:06.800
They're compassionate and funny.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.190
And so I guess I'm
wondering, like,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:13.660
why is it that people think
Calvinists kind of suck,

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:17.860
and why do the people
in your books not?

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:23.410
- Well, there are Calvinists
that deserve that reputation.

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:26.260
What can I say?

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.830
I mean, I think part of
my fascination with Calvin

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.780
is resurrection.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:37.060
I'm trying to excavate him from
this burial under the worst

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:41.830
implications that people
have drawn from his writing.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:48.730
Every major theologian,
including Ignatius Loyola,

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.790
has said, yes, there
is predestination.

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.400
The only two who
don't agree with this

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.590
is [? Chrysostom ?]
and John Wesley.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:01.340
So how did it get
pinned on Calvin?

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.170
Polemic.

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:04.870
I think he had the
problem of being

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:10.810
the most effective polemicist,
the most effective theoretician

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:11.650
of his period.

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:17.710
And therefore, he took the
brunt of a lot of controversy.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.930
That's a very complex
question I've brought up,

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:23.620
but nevertheless, things like
that that are artificially

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.900
associated with him as
if other people had not

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:29.180
come to the same conclusion.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.036
And then there are just
inexcusable Calvinists.

00:58:32.036 --> 00:58:33.524
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.290
- Hi, I'm Heather.

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.900
Happy to be here [INAUDIBLE]
I was [? thinking ?] when

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.630
you were talking about in
the absence of a caring God,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.090
is our suffering meaningful.

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.910
And just a thought, so
I won't go on too long.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.700
But I was thinking, for me as
a humanist, I feel like my job

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.190
as a human being is to
watch other people suffering

00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:56.110
with at least watchful
concern and caring,

00:58:56.110 --> 00:58:58.316
that that's what people
do for each other.

00:58:58.316 --> 00:59:00.190
And then I think, as a
reader, the characters

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:01.420
I love the most
and the writers I

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.090
love the most, I feel like those
characters are sitting with me,

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.450
that they can sit and keep
me company in my suffering

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.549
without a God being here.

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:10.840
So I was just wondering what
you thought about humanism

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.000
as a way of approaching
giving meaning

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.460
to suffering even if I don't
feel a caring God is up there.

00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.800
- Well, that makes suffering
a different kind of problem,

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.370
certainly.

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:31.840
I think that human freedom
is real in the sense

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.130
that we, from moment to moment,
have the option of dealing with

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:41.410
people with the degree of
respect that they yearn for.

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:44.170
A lot of suffering, I
think, is not visible.

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:48.100
I think that a huge
source of suffering

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.936
is the rationing of
respect that we engage in.

00:59:52.936 --> 00:59:54.880
In other words, I
think that we are

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.900
given the real
problem of dealing

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:06.290
with the sad burden of human
sensitivity in all its forms,

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:11.500
and that the
question is actually,

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:17.260
are we going to
respond from the soul?

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:23.170
And that's one of the
existential questions

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:27.670
that we are burdened with or
dignified by as human beings.

01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:33.530
- Hi.

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.260
My name is Linda
Schneider, and I

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:39.160
was introduced to
your writing in 1982

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.120
in the first fiction
course I have ever taken.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.080
It was not an assigned book,
Housekeeping, at that time.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.970
But Susan [? Mansker ?]
had really

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.250
read a story that
I wrote and said,

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.390
you have to read this book.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:57.660
And I have read
it multiple times,

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.700
[? though ?] the religious
element, at that time,

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.900
just went right over my head.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.360
But what I was deeply
moved by in the book--

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.280
and I think you
alluded to it when

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.020
you talked about authorial
respect for characters.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:18.070
And that was there
was clearly something,

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:20.440
quote, unquote,
"wrong" with Sylvie--

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.100
or mental illness.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.340
I don't know what
you want to call it.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:30.490
But the respect accorded
her and the girls

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:36.520
and the sad history of the
family was very moving.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.070
And I don't know if you had
encountered in your life

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:44.650
or in your town or
whatever, but what

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:53.080
made you just have such a much
larger vision of these people

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.560
than a lot of
writers might have.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.410
- Well, I was talking
earlier about how,

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.680
reading contemporary
fiction at the time,

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.580
I couldn't find characters
that seemed real to me

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.560
that were complex enough.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.170
And so my solution was to
do a kind of Cubist portrait

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.690
where Ruth--

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:23.130
in my mind, Ruth is one
profile, and Lucille is another,

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.760
and [? Sophie ?] is another.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.550
It's Cubist.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:31.080
But in any case, I
consider them to be--

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.040
I mean, I think everyone lives
not only with the choices we

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.940
have made, but with the
choices we have not made,

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.200
with the kind of
yearnings that we

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.470
have felt we had to suppress.

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:45.630
Where I lived, I think
one of the yearnings,

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:47.850
since there was just
wilderness all around us,

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.600
was that you could just
take off and just disappear

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.870
into nature in some way.

01:02:54.870 --> 01:03:00.510
So I was rewarded, when I
tried to make, by my lights,

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.940
one character
richer, by the fact

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.220
that it seemed to make
all the characters richer,

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.220
in my experience.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.830
So that's what was
happening there.

01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:15.020
- Hi.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.480
My name is [INAUDIBLE],, and
I'm a senior at the college

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.890
studying sociology.

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:20.860
So I love your fiction.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.670
I'm a huge fan of your
fiction, but I also

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:25.580
love your essay collections,
The Death of Adam

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.630
and When I Was a
Child I Read Books.

01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:34.430
And I was really struck by
the ideas of Old Testament

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:39.020
traditions and liberality and,
as you've been talking about,

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.270
restoration and resurrection.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.580
And it resonated
with me not only

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.530
because you were very
convincing, but also

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.920
because of my own Protestant
traditions growing up.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.530
But I wanted to ask
whether your ideas

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:55.700
on social justice, which have
been really compelling because

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.820
of this prophetic, religious
fire that you have,

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.990
whether religious thinking
is a foundational premise

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:06.410
for these social justice
ideas, or just the lens

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.950
through which you
look at issues.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.440
So is God or religious
thinking a necessary condition

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.250
of your ideas, or is it
just one of many lenses

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:18.410
that you can have or
that any person can

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:21.110
have looking through
it, as a secular lens,

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:24.240
for instance, and reaching
the same conclusion?

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.990
- Yes, it's an
interesting question.

01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:30.450
I think that there's a tendency
to think of religion as being

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.520
doctrinal and formulated.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.470
I think there are lots
of people who would not

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.210
think of themselves
as religious,

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.910
but nevertheless, they
look at another human being

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:42.210
and they say, this is sacred.

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.670
We ought not to allow
this to happen--

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:48.390
a crowded prison, or any
of the infinite number

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:50.790
of things that we see.

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:54.720
I think that if you have an
intuition of the sanctity

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.870
of a human being so that
you want to give them

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:03.310
dignity and the
possibility of living out

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.870
their lives by their
lives and so on,

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:08.710
that is basically a
religious impulse.

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:15.130
It's just non-doctrinal,
non-denominational.

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:18.000
- But it could-- just to leap
in, but it could be there's no

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.010
reason why it needs to
be grounded necessarily

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.985
in the notion of the divine.

01:05:23.985 --> 01:05:24.610
- I don't know.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.220
I mean, I think that you
proceed from a different set

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.230
of assumptions that I do.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.870
I think that if you see
the sacred in anything,

01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:34.390
that is an intuition
of the divine.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:37.510
It doesn't matter if
it's quantum physics

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:41.700
or your next-door neighbor.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.450
- Thank you.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:45.364
- Hi.

01:05:45.364 --> 01:05:46.780
I was wondering
if you could speak

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:48.280
a little bit about
your experience

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.500
as a writing
instructor, what you've

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.620
observed in the classroom, the
different mistakes students

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:57.760
have made, promising
aspects of what's emerging

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.460
from writing programs today.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.300
- Oh, a great deal is
emerging now, a great deal.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.330
I see a lot of students
making the mistake that I did,

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:11.230
which is the idea that you can
look at what is being written

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.240
in your moment and
feeling as though you have

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.230
some obligation
to it or as if you

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.430
will fall into a stream
of the publishable

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.400
or something like that.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.950
And, I mean, if you're
trying to do that,

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:28.210
then you're making yourself
second-rate, in effect.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:30.490
It's incredibly difficult
to do, but people

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:34.010
have to find their own voices,
as everybody tells you,

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:37.330
but they tell you the truth.

01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:40.116
The workshop, at
the moment, it's

01:06:40.116 --> 01:06:41.740
going through an
interesting transition

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:47.260
because finally, we have
a diversity of students.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.900
For such a long
time, people will not

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.580
apply to come to
Iowa because it's

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.530
Iowa, which is a lovely state.

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:54.700
I mean, it's just a--

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.070
but anyway, this has ended now.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.150
So we're getting a lot of kids
that are first generation, kids

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.010
from the Caribbean, and so on.

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:08.080
And people like that
have the advantage

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.140
of making a case for the
world they come from.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:16.540
And so they're very attentive
to the kind of beautiful details

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:25.100
of life that most of us only
notice when you stop and think,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.940
well, this is a beautiful,
sunlit day here,

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.840
even in the middle
of the Middle West.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.780
So there's a kind of
richness that is coming in,

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.470
and an attentiveness to detail--

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.030
you're great on detail--

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.610
that is a tremendous
[? balloon. ?]

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.280
We're seeing a lot
of interesting stuff.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.519
It diversifies the voices.

01:07:47.519 --> 01:07:49.810
It makes everybody more
conscious of what they're there

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:50.660
to do.

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.210
It's a very good thing.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.240
- Hi, my name is Abigail.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.600
And I was curious about
the role of reading.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.400
So it seemed as
though you articulated

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.630
that you wanted to read widely
before returning to fiction,

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:09.620
or it seemed somehow necessary
to develop a new sense of self

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.460
as a writer.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.780
But it didn't seem like you had
that same feeling about writing

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.560
nonfiction in essays.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.920
And I'm wondering about the role
of that kind of wide reading

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.840
in both of those
voices, and also

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.660
whether there's a different
sort of sense of position

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.390
that comes when you write
nonfiction and fiction

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.540
and how voice differs there.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.740
- Well, my essays,
they're usually lectures.

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.979
And they're usually very much
as I delivered the lecture.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.290
And what they usually
are, I'm usually

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.160
speaking to a college
or sometimes a church.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.760
They're little
screams of surprise.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.620
This is what you've
been led to believe.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.170
This is not true.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:54.080
And it's based on some
book I've been reading

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.479
or some literature
I've been reading.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:09:03.500
And so the essays, up
until very recently--

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.600
and perhaps recently also--

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.840
are rooted directly in
my going back and looking

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.720
at things that,
frankly, were things

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.200
that were misrepresented to me.

01:09:16.329 --> 01:09:18.010
- Hi, my name is John.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.630
My question has to do with the
sense of religiosity or faith

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:27.010
or kind of a belief in a
divine or something mysterious.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.870
I'm curious to know--
and this is something

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.994
that I had experienced when
I was in college, too--

01:09:30.994 --> 01:09:34.479
whether it comes from a kind
of intellection or thinking,

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.939
or it comes from
experience, or it

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:41.410
comes from experience
that is kind of everyday

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:46.450
and really not through
kind of a logical faculty.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:51.830
Where do you see that situated
within our mind and soul

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.470
and in other parts of our body?

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.530
- I think I have a more sort
of holistic sense of thinking.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.500
I mean, some of the craziest
writing in the world

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.800
is writing that has taken
itself to be severely logical.

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:16.300
And I think that experience, if
you're functioning attentively,

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.360
experience feeds so directly
into every other aspect

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.230
of your thinking and in
your dreams and so on.

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:28.600
I think that if you isolate
something like intellection,

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.260
you are robbing it of its
primary resources, which

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.870
are all the other things
that you have named that also

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:38.021
come into the experience.

01:10:38.021 --> 01:10:44.170
I think that we
are, for one thing,

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:48.310
acculturated to exclude
from our thinking

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:55.540
what we take to be imaginative,
as if imagination didn't

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:59.380
discover a thousand things that
science has adopted, and so on.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.370
Also, I think we
live in a time when

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:10.090
the notion of what religion
is is strange enough

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:13.740
to drive people away
from it because it's

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.110
settled so strangely
in a great many minds.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.560
It tends to be a claim
that you make for yourself

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.440
rather than an obligation
you feel for yourself,

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.440
that sort of thing.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.960
I think that if you just
sort of relax and think,

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.780
my mind is my mind, and
it's so interesting,

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.040
and here I am with it.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.540
And I will watch it live,
and it will watch me live--

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.990
I always start out
telling my students

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:46.840
that the human brain is the
most complex object known

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.960
to exist in the universe,
which is simply true.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.650
You can read it in
Scientific American.

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:53.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:59.260
But if you think about that,
that every skull in this room

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:06.454
has, in it, this primary object
of cosmic life, then you think,

01:12:06.454 --> 01:12:07.120
well, I have it.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.700
Now what do I do with it?

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.440
Or what does it
do with me I think

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.970
is a more important question.

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:17.590
I think that you shouldn't
be passive in relation to it,

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:22.060
and you shouldn't try to do the
procrustean thing of making it

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:26.260
into something that is
useful to a industry

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.760
rather than being the
unbelievable cosmic privilege

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.310
of having that brain, that mind.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.980
- May I ask a
follow-up question?

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:43.310
For someone who is
perhaps interested in kind

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:47.210
of grasping the sense of
unfathomable or mystery

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:53.240
or finding interest
in religion, do

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.470
you have any words
of encouragement?

01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:58.118
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:58.118 --> 01:13:02.480
Or if it's not just coming
from sitting in a room

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.570
and thinking on your own,
where does one find it?

01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:13.700
How did you find that sort of
encounter or understanding,

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.990
if you can put it that way?

01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:20.960
- I haven't used conventional
methods, obviously.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.210
I think that-- what can I say?

01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:31.160
People come to it by unique
ways, I think, very often.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.870
If there's anything
that you consider

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:37.090
to be overwhelmingly
beautiful or amazing,

01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:40.130
that gives you a taste of it.

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:44.030
If I want to have a full-blown
religious experience that's

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:51.090
as good as reading the psalms,
it's Scientific American.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:54.050
I love these
beautiful hypotheses

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.800
about the beginnings of
things and the configuration

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.320
of the universe and all this.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.880
It is so hyperbolic.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.630
I mean, the Earth is
not a speck of dust.

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:07.790
And here we are,
looking at all this.

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:10.080
It's absolutely amazing.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.070
I mean, that's my little
testimony to human beings

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:17.960
as being totally
unaccountable creatures.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:25.100
But the things, the fact of
the materiality of things

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:31.090
looked at closely disappear
under the gaze, all of that

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:31.960
is very beautiful.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.720
And for me, it's
very theological.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.200
- Hi, my name is Bree.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.650
And as a reader,
in my experience,

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:46.320
a lot of contemporary
literature tends

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.380
to be characterized by
a sense of hopelessness.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.530
And as a lover of
stories, wanting

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.400
to capture this really
powerful sense of awe and joy

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:59.520
without it being seen as, like,
a lack of depth or something

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.830
that's naive, I think
in your stories,

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.960
you really capture
the balance of having

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:08.850
this deep, real sense of reality
and this deep sense of sadness

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:11.680
with this really real
experience of joy.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.580
And as a writer, I
guess, how do you

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.830
strike that balance
between those two

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.740
and have it be believable?

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.020
And I guess, the follow-up
question would be too,

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.390
like, what do you
see the role of hope

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:27.980
in literature moving forward?

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.940
- Well, I think that
it has to be authentic.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.840
You know what I mean?

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:37.310
I don't think that you can
induce in yourself something

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.900
you don't yourself feel.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.910
You can work towards
something you don't feel.

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:44.390
That's always valuable.

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:48.380
I think that finding the balance
between anything and anything

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:52.850
else-- when you're writing,
every question is real.

01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:55.130
Every moment is
another question.

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:56.280
How do I do this?

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.800
How do I do this?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.520
There is no solution that's
external to the specific work

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.900
that you are doing.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.990
I think that one of the
things that really helps

01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:11.750
is respect for your
characters, that you don't

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:13.560
embarrass them or abuse them.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.250
Or you know what I mean?

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:20.990
I think that maybe readers take
a certain amount of reassurance

01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:23.717
from the fact that they
are also not being abused.

01:16:23.717 --> 01:16:24.800
They're not being lied to.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:28.280
- Thank you.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.740
- You're welcome.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.240
- Hi, there.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.985
My name is Catherine.

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:33.610
My question is, are
there ways that you

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.440
would recommend to us
to better cultivate

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.514
graciousness in our lives?

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:38.680
- To cultivate graciousness?

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.530
- Yeah.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:47.600
- Well, I mean, I so
admire the project.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.390
I mean, I think
that that would be

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.850
the answer to so many problems.

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:59.150
But you have to notice
it when you see it.

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:02.060
You have to be aware that
you have an occasion where

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:06.050
you yourself can enact it.

01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.930
I think one of the
things that we don't do--

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.650
I talk about Calvin
and the human being

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:14.630
on the stage with God
watching and so on.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:20.060
But we have, individually
in our own lives,

01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:25.930
the continuing possibility
of acting well;

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.810
thinking not, what do I
need or what do I want,

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.350
but what's gracious
in this moment.

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:38.830
I think that's really the
discipline, to be aware of,

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:43.510
in terms of the sort of whole
canvas of human dignity,

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:45.670
how could I make a
decent account of myself

01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:46.630
in this moment?

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:48.280
How can I do
something beautiful?

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:53.009
That's what I would say.

01:17:53.009 --> 01:17:53.800
- Thanks very much.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.760
- Well, that was really
an inspiring conversation.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.110
[APPLAUSE]
