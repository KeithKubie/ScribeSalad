[Wes]So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich,

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:07.393
the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript.

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:11.359
So u could tell us how that language came to be.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.876
[Brendan] Sure. So I can say more about how I got ready

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:19.710
to make JavaScript. It was when I wrote Netscape. I didn't have much time to do that,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.511
and I had to have the skills already.

00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:26.026
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:31.742
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics. First studying theory of formal languages

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:38.893
and automata theory. Regular languages, regular expressions.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:42.026
This was the early 80ties and I loved the

00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:46.344
cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:50.609
theories as algorithms.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.844
So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically.

00:00:56.844 --> 00:01:00.960
It was strange to me, and it was useful too.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.310
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.723
at some point. There's often a need you have

00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:12.243
that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:14.093
and you can use that. It's educational

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:15.993
and can often solve your problem

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:17.809
in a better way than any other language.

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:20.260
And so, I encourage that. I did that myself

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.559
and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.725
because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there,

00:01:26.725 --> 00:01:30.642
with Java looming. Questions about if we needed two languages:

00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:34.792
a scripting language versus a big language as Java.

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.210
I had to go fast.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.871
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.393
already on the way.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:44.489
[Wes] So in this class we will learn a lot of

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.760
the things he have just mentioned.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.859
in various points. Regular Expressions,

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.607
Finite State Machines, adding a lexer that follows them automatically,

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.992
Context Free grammars, parsing, having a parser thet flow through automatically.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:58.359
And I can only say that I really agree:

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.443
I have written a number of little languages

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:02.909
in my time to scratch various hitchies.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.550
I think it's a very important tool to have under ones' belt.
