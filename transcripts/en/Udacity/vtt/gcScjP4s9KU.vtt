00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the final problem in this homework, we're going to be talking about some

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
distinctions between P and NP and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
also what it would mean if P were equal to NP

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or if instead P were not equal to NP.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's look at a few examples.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So first it might be the case that if P were equal to NP

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
then that would mean that every single computational problem

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
could be solved in polynomial time.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It could also be the case that if P were not equal to NP,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we could prove that,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
then that would mean that there are no NP-complete problems

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that could be solved in polynomial time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We might also say that regardless of whether

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
P equals NP or P does not equal NP

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that there are still NP-complete problems

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that are easier in some sense to solve in practice than others.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We might also say that, well, if we have the ability to solve some

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
instances of an NP-complete problem,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
then that necessarily implies that P equals NP.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We could also say that showing a problem is NP-complete

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
automatically means that we know it can't be solved in polynomial time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, which of these statements do you think are actually true?

00:01:08.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check all that you think are true statements.
