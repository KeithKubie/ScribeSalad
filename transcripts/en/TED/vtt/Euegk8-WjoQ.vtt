00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.576
About six months
into my career as a therapist,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.896
I was working at a drug
and alcohol rehab facility.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.496
I got a call from one of the nurses
down at the detox unit.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.376
She asked me to come down
and assess one of the new patients

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.256
that had arrived earlier in the day.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.696
So I went down to the unit
and had the pleasure of meeting Anne.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.176
Anne's a transgender female,
and as her and I started talking,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.216
she was sharing with me
about what brought her into treatment,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.976
but I could hear this fear in her voice,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.896
and I could see this worry in her eyes,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.896
and she began to tell me
that she didn't fear coming into rehab

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.296
and having to give up drugs and alcohol.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.336
Her fear was that the doctors
that were going to be treating her

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.240
would not treat her as her female self.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.176
She then told me about this ongoing pain
that she has experienced her whole life

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.656
of being assigned male
but knowing she's female.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.976
And what she meant by that is,
when she was born,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.136
the doctor held her up to her parents

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.056
and based on her genitalia said,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.816
"It's a boy."

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.480
She always knew she wasn't a boy.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.536
Many years passed and the feelings
that she was feeling

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.575
and holding all this in grew and grew,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.896
and she knew she had
to come out to her family.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.576
And when she did,
it didn't go over so well.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.136
Her parents said,
"Absolutely not. You're not a girl.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.416
This is not how we raised you.
We don't know what you're thinking.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.640
Get out."

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.256
So Anne then found herself on the streets
and in and out of homeless shelters,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.456
and it's here where
she started using drugs and alcohol

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
to numb this pain she felt inside.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.216
She told me about her journey of being
in and out of hospitals and rehabs

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.496
trying to get sober,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.456
and when she did, the health care
providers and doctors

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.536
wouldn't use the correct
female name or pronouns.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.920
This caused her pain.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.536
You see, when I was studying
to become a therapist,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120
I wasn't taught how to work
with transgender patients.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.040
I had no idea these would be
the patients I'd be working with.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.096
But the more I worked with Anne
and other patients like Anne,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.416
I began to see my mission evolve,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.496
and that was to make sure
that the transgender community

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280
got their health care needs met.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.456
The more I looked into this,
I saw how this very real fear

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.256
of violence, discrimination
and this lack of acceptance

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.416
caused so many of these patients
to turn to alcohol and drugs.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.016
And I also heard these horror stories

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.976
of when these patients
were seeking medical care

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.416
and how they were treated,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.774
and how a lot of their
medical needs were ignored.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.536
Now let me tell you about Leah.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.736
I had the pleasure
of meeting Leah a few years back.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.040
She's a female and she has
a wife and a child.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.856
See, Leah was also assigned male at birth

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.696
and she knew since she was a young child
that she was not a male,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.920
that she was a female.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.856
She hid it from herself
and from everyone she knew,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.496
especially from her wife,
until the age of 50.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.936
She couldn't take it anymore.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.056
She was like, I can't
keep living like this.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.296
I gotta get honest.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.976
She was extremely scared to tell her wife.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.256
What if her wife said,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.000
"This is unacceptable,
I want a divorce, get out"?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.136
To her surprise, her wife was accepting.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.176
She said, "I love you
regardless of who you are.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.080
I want to help you in every way I can."

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.296
So she talked with her wife,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.496
and she made the decision
that she wanted to medically transition,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.976
and she was interested in being
assessed for hormone replacement therapy,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.280
otherwise known as HRT.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.360
So she made an appointment
with her doctor.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.136
She arrived on the day
of her appointment early.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.776
She filled out all the paperwork,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.400
put the name correctly down there
and waited patiently.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.560
A little bit of time passed and a nurse
called her back to the exam room.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.976
When she got back there,
she took a deep breath,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.880
and the doctor and the nurse walked in.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.040
She extended her hand to the doctor
and said, "Hi, I'm Leah."

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.136
The doctor looked at her,
didn't shake her hand and said,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.360
"Why are you here?"

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.520
She took another deep breath and said,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.976
"Well, I'm a transgender female.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.696
I've known this my whole life,
I've hid it from everyone,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.016
but I can't do it anymore.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.816
My wife's supportive,
I can financially afford it,

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.336
I've got to make these changes.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.880
Please consider me,
and let's evaluate me for HRT."

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.736
The doctor said,
"We can't do anything today.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.320
You need to go get an HIV test."

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.360
She couldn't believe it.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.375
She was furious.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.200
She was angry. She was disappointed.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.896
If her doctor treated her this way,
how would the rest of the world treat her?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.296
First, he wouldn't shake her hand,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.456
and second, when he heard
she was transgender,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.776
all he cared about was getting
an HIV test and ending the appointment.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.840
He didn't even ask her
any other questions.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.256
See, I can understand
where Leah's coming from,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.856
because the years that I've worked
with the community,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.456
I hear myths every single day
that aren't true at all.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.416
A couple of those are:

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.056
every transgender person wants
to transition with medication or surgery;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.976
transgender people are mentally ill,
this is a disorder;

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.480
and: these people
aren't real men and women.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.200
These are all myths and untrue.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.256
As this community expands and grows older,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.416
it is imperative that all
health care providers be trained

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.136
on how to take care
of their health care needs.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.656
Back in 2015, a survey was done

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.216
and found that 72 percent
of health care providers

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.656
did not feel well-informed

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.480
on the health care needs
of the LGBT community.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.640
There's a huge gap
in the education and training.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.336
Today, in this talk,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.536
I want to offer a new way of thinking
for three groups of people:

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.856
doctors, the transgender community
and, well, the rest of us.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.616
But before we do, I want to cover
a couple of definitions

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.496
that's going to help you wrap your head
around gender identity a little bit more.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.176
So I hope you've got your paper and pen.
Get ready to take some notes.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.496
So let's start out
with this idea of a binary system.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.776
And what this means is,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.736
before, we always thought
there was only two, male and female.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.416
Get it? Binary? Right?

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.000
So we've come to find out
that this isn't true.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.456
Gender identity is a spectrum

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.416
with maleness on one side

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.816
and femaleness over here
on the other side.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.296
This spectrum of identities

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.696
include identities such as
gender-nonconforming,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.016
gender-affirming,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.336
gender-nonbinary,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.616
two-spirited, three-spirited,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.360
as well as people that are intersex.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.976
The term transgender is this umbrella term

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.160
that encompasses all these
different types of identities.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.696
But for today's talk, I want you
to think about transgender

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.256
as someone who is assigned
a sex at birth that doesn't match

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.136
with who they are as a person
and their sense of self.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.416
Now, this is very different
than biological sex.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.816
So gender identity is sense of self.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.136
So think of it as
what's between your ears:

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.016
sense of self, who you are.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.776
This is very different
than biological sex, right?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.736
Hormones, genitalia, chromosomes:

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.400
that's what's between our legs.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.776
Now, you may be thinking, "Dr. Kristie,
I have never questioned who I am.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.496
I know I'm a man, or I know I'm a woman."

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.120
I get it. You know who you are.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.536
This is how many
transgender individuals feel.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.216
They just know who they are

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.320
with that same conviction.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.776
It's important to know that there
are many different types of identities,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.816
and I identify as a cisgender female.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.016
Now, for all y'all out there
that like to know how to spell things,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.736
cis is spelled "c-i-s."

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.696
It's the Latin term
for "on the same side of."

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.176
When I was born,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.296
the doctor held me up
to my parents and said,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.576
"It's a girl."

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.656
All this, based on my genitalia.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.456
Even though I grew up
in a small farm town in Georgia,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.696
very much a tomboy,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.736
I never questioned that I was a female.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.296
I've always known I was a girl,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.736
regardless of how I was as a kid.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.576
Now, this is very different
than someone who's transgender.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.736
Now, trans is a Latin term
for "on the other side of" --

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.616
think about transcontinental airlines,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.496
across, on the other side of --

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.536
someone that's assigned a sex at birth

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.000
and they identify
on the other side of the spectrum.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.696
A transgender male is someone
who was assigned female at birth,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.056
but their sense of self,
who they are, how they live their life,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.616
is as a male.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.696
And the opposite is, as we talked earlier,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.536
a transgender female,
someone that's assigned male at birth

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.616
but lives their live
and sense of self as a female.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.456
It's also important to point out here

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.496
that not everyone
that has a nonbinary identity

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.440
identifies with the term "transgender."

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.256
Just so nobody gets confused,
I want to point out sexual identity,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.816
or orientation.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.576
That is simply who we're attracted to,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.480
physically, emotionally,
sexually, spiritually.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.736
It's got nothing to do
with gender identity.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.096
So just for a quick recap,
before we continue on:

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.816
gender identity between the ears,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.016
biological sex, just think
of it between your legs,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.856
and then sexual identity,
well, sometimes we use our heart,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.296
but it's here.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.120
Three very different identity spectrums.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.296
Now, the average medical student

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.616
spends about five hours learning
about the LGBT health-related needs

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.456
while they're in medical school.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.296
Now, this is despite us knowing
that there are unique health risks

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.520
to this community.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.096
And there's an estimated
10 million American adults

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.520
that identify as LGBT.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.416
Most doctors that work
with transgender patients,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.480
they learn trial by fire.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.496
That means they figure it out
as they go along,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.816
or the patient ends up spending their time

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.280
trying to teach the doctor
how to take care of them.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.696
Many doctors don't feel comfortable
asking about gender identities.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.016
Some don't feel like it's relevant at all
to their medical care

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.600
and others just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.816
Many doctors who say
something inappropriate

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.336
or they say something negative,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.936
they may not be coming
from a malicious or mean place,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.776
they may have never been trained
on how to care for these individuals.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.560
But this can't be accepted
as a norm anymore either.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.496
So what happens to a transgender male --

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.576
for a quick recap, that's someone
who is assigned female at birth

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.216
but lives their life as a male --

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.720
what happens when this transgender male
goes for their yearly gynecological visit?

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.216
How that doctor treats that patient

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.496
will set the whole tone for the office.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.096
If that doctor treats that male
with the correct pronouns, correct name,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.336
gives dignity and respect,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.960
it's highly likely
that the rest of the staff will too.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.536
So that's a little bit
about my thoughts on doctors,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.256
and now let's move on
to the transgender community.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.536
I'm here talking about fear,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.696
but y'all know who
is really fearful, right?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.096
It's the transgender community.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.936
Earlier I shared the story about Anne

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.456
and how she was so worried
about going into treatment

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.536
and not being respected
as her female self,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.496
and then Leah who was scared
about how her doctor would react,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.576
and the second
that he didn't shake her hand

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.200
and ordered that HIV test,
her fears came true.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.336
The transgender community
needs to be empowered

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.056
to speak up for their health care needs.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.200
The days of remaining silent and taking
whatever treatment you can get are over.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.856
If you don't speak up
for your health care needs,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.440
no one's going to do it for you.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.480
So what about the rest of us?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.936
A lot of y'all, maybe in the next week
or a couple of months,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.216
are going to have
a doctor's appointment, right?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.576
So let's say you go
to your doctor's appointment

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.936
and when it's over,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.760
you feel worse than you did
when you got there.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.176
What if you felt dismissed by the doctor,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.816
that they ignored your needs,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.920
or you even felt judged?

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.936
That's what happens for many
of the 1.4 million transgender adults

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.216
here in the US

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.400
if they're lucky enough
to get an appointment.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.856
Now, you may be thinking,
"Why is this important to me?

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.776
I'm not transgender.
I don't know anybody that's transgender.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.040
Why should I even care?"

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.656
Think of it this way.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.296
A transgender individual is human,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.520
just like you and me.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.456
They deserve competent
and trained health care providers,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.720
just like you and me.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.616
So let me ask, if you don't
mind raising your hand:

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.376
Do you know or have you met
anyone who is transgender,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.736
gender-nonconforming, agender, intersex,
two-spirited, three-spirited?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.080
Thank y'all so much. Lovely. Thank y'all.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.336
Every one of y'all
who did not raise your hand,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.656
in the very near future

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.416
you will get the opportunity to meet

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.136
someone that falls into one
of these identities, I guarantee it.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.640
The number of this
community is increasing.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.280
That's not because it's a fad
or the new thing to do.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.000
It's safer to come out.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.656
There's more awareness.
There's more visibility.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.896
There's more safety, so people
are speaking up about their true self

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.160
like never before.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.136
That's why it's so important
that our health care system get on board

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.976
and make sure that our doctors
and health care providers are trained

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.256
to approach these patients
with dignity and respect,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.200
just like we expect.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.056
I remember being
in my 11th grade literature class,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.256
with one of my favorite
teachers, Mr. McClain,

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.896
and he shared this quote by Heraclitus
that sticks with me to this day.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.576
Y'all may have even heard it.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.600
It's, "The only thing that is constant
is that things will change."

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.800
Familiar, right?

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.776
Every single one of us
face changes in our lives,

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.136
and often when we're faced
with these changes,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.200
we've got some difficult
decisions to make.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.936
Will we remain in fear, stay stuck

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.616
and not grow?

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.016
Or, will we face fear with bravery,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.600
evolve, take the opportunity to grow?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.856
Every one of us face new things.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.080
What will you do?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.176
Will you remain in fear,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.080
or will you grow?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.696
I invite each of you, doctors,
the transgender community

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.056
and you and I,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.776
to face fear together

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.536
as we walk into this brave new world.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.776
Thank you.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.200
(Applause)
