00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.200
Iron Man 3.
Yeah what about it?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.550
It is awesome.
Yeah?

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.850
Yeah.
Wait, that movie's not even out yet.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.450
Yeah it is. It�s out today.
No. I mean, �today� in the sense that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.310
we're launching this video �today,� yes�
it comes out �today.� But the day we're

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.620
filming it �today,� it's not out yet.
It is in Europe.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.170
Man, I think I would know it if you had gone
to Europe to see Iron Man 3.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.610
Why?
Because I would have noticed your absence,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.400
and it would have been glorious.
Not if I did it sneakily. Covertly.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.040
Covertly?
You know like in shifts.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.250
You flew to Europe in shifts?
I'm not saying I did, no, I�m just offering

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.320
that as one possible explanation for how I
could've gotten to Europe to see Iron Man

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.601
3 without you noticing.
There are other possible explanations? How

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.090
many different possibilities are there? How
many different ways could you have gotten

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.380
to Europe.
Well sure. I could have teleported over like

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.000
those guys in Jumper.
Oh, see, now I don't know why I didn�t think

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.360
of that.
I could have used a Star Trek transporter.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.569
Right, because those are real.
I could have used Gandalf's personal eagle

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.619
taxi service.
Man you need to let the eagle thing die, don�t

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.670
you think?
Maybe I'm a ninja.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.320
Honestly, the 13-hour flight to Europe done
in shifts over multiple evenings is actually

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.810
starting to sound plausible.
Whatever, dude. Regardless, the point is I've

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.789
seen Iron Man 3, and you haven't, and it's
awesome.

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.509
Prove it.
Prove that I've seen it?

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.829
Yeah.
Man, if I say you anything proof-worthy, I'm

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.709
gonna be spoiling the movie's plot for all
our nice viewers.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.579
Don't kid yourself, man. Not that many people
watch these things. Not the conversation videos.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.919
Well, at least the people that are watching
them seem to be enjoying them.

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:52.920
Dude, they're just humoring you. They�re
being nice to you because they think you're

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740
mentally challenged.
You're mentally challenged.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.829
You can't use that as an insult, man, that's
basically the same thing as calling me retarded.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.549
No, no, it's the opposite of that. The phrase
�mentally challenged� was created so that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.030
I could call you slow without any of the shame
that comes from having used the word retarded.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.470
Wow.
Dude, wait a minute. I saw your sins videos

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.130
for Iron Man 1 and 2. Why would you even see
number 3? I thought you hated the first two.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.810
What's up with that? Why would you even go--
Just because I do a sins video about a movie

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.360
doesn't mean I hate it.
What?!

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.110
Man, I thought you got this by now. A sins
video isn't a record of a movie's quality

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.780
overall, it's just a freaking list of sins.
What? But some of the things you say are just

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.280
jokes!
I'm sorry, man, I must have missed the part

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.070
where you got to determine the rules for how
I define sins.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.130
So a sin is anything that you find wrong in
a movie, or any dickhead observational jokes

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.220
you want to make?
I do not endorse that definition of cinema

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.730
sins. No.
Why am I not surprised?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.620
No. In fact, the definition of a cinema sin
is a closely guarded secret. You know how

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.710
there's only three people in the world that
know the original recipe for Colonel Sanders

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.470
chicken?
Okay, yeah?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.790
Those are the three people I would tell what
the definition of a sin is. Because they know

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:29.240
how to keep a f*cking secret.
I couldn't have done that if I�d tried.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.620
Why does it have to be a secret?
Why does it have to be public? Can't you just

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.540
watch a video that pokes fun at a movie without
acting like I violated one of your Constitutional

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.321
rights?
You did violate my Constitutional right. My

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:42.760
right not to be confronted by Internet assholes
shoving their opinion in my face.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.790
Right. right. Because YouTube videos are so
obtrusive and invasive.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.210
Dude, can you at least tell me why you bleep
the swear words?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.430
F*ck you.
