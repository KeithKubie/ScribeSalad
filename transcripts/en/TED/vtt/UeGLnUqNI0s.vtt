00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:19.714
At no point did I think superheroes
would become such a huge part of my life.

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:24.525
As a kid, I looked at them,
and I saw everything I wasn't.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.011
They had big muscles,

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:28.726
supermodel good looks,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.606
and phenomenal cosmic powers.

00:00:32.462 --> 00:00:33.612
And me?

00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:36.278
I kind of looked like this,

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.406
except shorter and with frizzier hair,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.088
and I never felt powerful.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.866
I was always just one big ball
of nervous, soft energy,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.152
and superheroes,
much like the bullies at school,

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.840
didn't seem to have
a lot of room for that, for me.

00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:56.151
So I stayed away.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:59.867
And besides, who needs superheroes

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:02.895
when you're surrounded
by Puerto Rican women from the Bronx?

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:05.018
(Laughter)

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:08.295
My tías were cops and paramedics,

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.160
my abuelas were seamstresses
and sold jewelry up the street,

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:15.050
and my mom got her master's degree

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:18.288
in education and taught kindergarten
in New York City public schools

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.041
for over 30 years.

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:23.295
So my superheroes were sitting
around the dinner table with me.

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:25.721
And I don't know how much time

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:28.428
you've spent with Puerto Rican
women from the Bronx,

00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:32.110
but we're also some
of the world's greatest storytellers.

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:37.086
And I'd sit there
at my grandmother's dining room table

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.110
and I'd listen to the women in my family

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:46.784
tell these wild, rambunctious tales
about navigating their lives in the Bronx.

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:49.480
And I wanted to be them so bad.

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:52.342
But I wasn't tough like them either.

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.107
So mostly, I listened,

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:56.694
and I soaked it in,

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:02.221
and I found myself gravitating
to the soft threads in their stories,

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:03.729
and I wrote those down.

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:07.574
The funny, the goofy, the gentle --

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.686
those were my in to storytelling,

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:16.332
so much so that I wrote
a young-adult novel

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:18.903
called "Juliet Takes a Breath,"

00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:22.212
about a chubby, queer
Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx

00:02:22.236 --> 00:02:25.427
navigating sexuality, family and identity.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.993
And on the strength of "Juliet,"

00:02:29.017 --> 00:02:33.533
Marvel Comics tapped me
to write the solo series

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:38.363
for their first-ever
Latina lesbian superhero,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.253
America Chavez.

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:41.428
Yeah!

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.832
(Cheers)

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:45.317
(Laughter)

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:46.572
Listen, OK.

00:02:46.596 --> 00:02:52.325
Created by Joe Casey and Nick Dragotta
for the Marvel miniseries "Vengeance,"

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.221
America Chavez has been
in the Marvel Universe

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.777
for over seven years.

00:02:57.182 --> 00:02:59.193
She's tough, Latina,

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:03.391
and she's so strong that she can punch
portals into other dimensions.

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:04.503
(Laughter)

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:05.758
I know, right?

00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:07.067
(Laughter)

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.766
And people were so excited,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.441
because finally, someone who shared
her identities -- queer and Latina --

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:14.800
would be writing her story.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.276
And I saw that, right?

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.891
And also, when I looked at America,

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:23.673
I saw a young Latina in survival mode.

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:27.903
See, because her moms
had sacrificed themselves to the universe

00:03:27.927 --> 00:03:29.085
when she was a kid,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.553
and she'd been on her own ever since.

00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:34.157
No wonder she had to be tough.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.684
And that link, that link
of having to be tough,

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:40.279
that rested heavy with me.

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:44.080
Like I said, I'm from the Bronx,
and the Bronx is tough,

00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:47.349
tough like walking past sidewalk memorials

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:50.921
and dodging cop towers
on your way to the train type of tough.

00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:54.144
When stuff happens that's bad,
people are like,

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.833
"Yo, you gotta keep it moving.
You gotta keep trucking.

00:03:56.857 --> 00:03:58.634
Don't cry. Don't let it get to you."

00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:02.389
And my mom and my tías and my abuelas,

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:06.968
I never saw them take a moment to rest
or to invest in self-care.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.890
And their soft? It never left the house.

00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:16.637
And so that was the first thing
that I wanted to give to America,

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.621
the thing that I wished I'd been able
to give to my abuelas and my tías,

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.269
the thing that I'm trying
to give to my mom now:

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:26.690
permission to be soft.

00:04:26.714 --> 00:04:29.880
Like, it's OK to sit in silence

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.584
and go on a journey
just to discover yourself,

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.291
and your pain will make you
crumble and you will fall

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:38.729
and you will need to ask people for help,

00:04:38.753 --> 00:04:40.919
and that's OK,

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:43.363
and that being vulnerable is good for us.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.845
But see, I didn't come to all this
compassion and healing stuff

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.846
like, you know, out of nowhere,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.930
and so when it came to America's story,

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:57.139
I wanted to give her the space
to be human, to mess up,

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.513
and to find soft on her own.

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:04.582
So she kind of had to quit her day job.
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:07.549
I had to give her a superhero sabbatical,

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:08.580
(Laughter)

00:05:08.604 --> 00:05:13.924
and the first thing I did was enroll her
in Justice Sonia Sotomayor University.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:17.257
(Laughter)

00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:18.695
(Applause)

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:24.116
Because where else would she feel safe
and represented and liberated

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.721
but a university dedicated
to the first Puerto Rican woman

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:31.020
nominated to the Supreme Court
of the United States?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.746
And her first class is "Intergalactic
Revolutionaries and You,"

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.290
and America is so excited,
she's ready to show off her strength,

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:43.031
she's ready to show off
her portal-punching skills,

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:44.056
(Laughter)

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.992
and I stripped that safety net
from her right away.

00:05:47.502 --> 00:05:50.644
And I limited her powers,
and I changed up her location

00:05:50.668 --> 00:05:55.244
and shook up her world,
because that is what college is like,

00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:56.269
(Laughter)

00:05:56.293 --> 00:05:57.923
especially if you're alone.

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.241
But I didn't want America
to be alone for long,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.513
and so in a homework assignment
gone totally wrong,

00:06:06.537 --> 00:06:09.187
she lands on a battlefield with the X-Men.

00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:10.703
(Laughter)

00:06:10.727 --> 00:06:12.830
Because, when I was in college,

00:06:12.854 --> 00:06:16.163
the Reverend Kelly Brown Douglas
was my mentor,

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:19.226
and I knew that America Chavez
needed one, too.

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:26.219
And who better to mentor
America Chavez than Storm,

00:06:26.243 --> 00:06:29.165
the first black female superhero

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.950
and one of the most powerful
members of the X-Men?

00:06:32.786 --> 00:06:34.626
Nobody, that's who.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.942
(Laughter)

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:39.892
And Storm teaches America
how to quiet her mind

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.875
inside of a star portal,

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.295
and when America quiets her mind,
she opens up the dimensions,

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.646
and in that silence,

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.757
she can listen for anything and anyone.

00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:56.552
And no one has ever offered her
silence and deep reflection

00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:58.187
as a way to be powerful.

00:06:59.443 --> 00:07:03.427
And at first, she rejects it,
but with Storm's encouragement,

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:04.601
it clicks,

00:07:05.376 --> 00:07:07.737
and America quiets the world around her,

00:07:09.432 --> 00:07:12.488
and she leans into a deep vulnerability.

00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:15.227
I mean, her and Storm even hug.

00:07:15.884 --> 00:07:17.034
I know.

00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:22.281
And that's because my mentors
loved me enough

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:26.515
to encourage me to investigate
myself and my ancestors,

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:29.807
and when you're 19,
how do you even know what that means?

00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:33.993
I didn't learn about the history
of my people in college.

00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:38.284
I learned about the history of my people
sitting on my grandmother's lap

00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:39.981
when she pulled out the photo album

00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:43.569
and she named everyone that was here
and everyone still left on the island.

00:07:44.807 --> 00:07:49.162
So obviously, I had to crash-land
a grandma on America Chavez,

00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:53.797
and not just any grandma --
a big, strong, luchador grandma,

00:07:54.864 --> 00:08:00.523
one that loved her enough
to take her to the ancestral plain,

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.784
where America Chavez
could see the history of her people

00:08:03.808 --> 00:08:05.737
play out in the skies above.

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:10.685
And America gets to see Planeta Fuertona,

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:13.720
the birth planet of her grandmother,

00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:15.549
and she sees it get invaded,

00:08:15.573 --> 00:08:18.385
and she sees her grandmother
and her mom flee.

00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:22.475
And she also sees the joy
that they experience

00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:26.124
when their new homeland
accepts them openly

00:08:26.148 --> 00:08:28.354
and offers them tremendous care.

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:33.570
She gets to see great pain
met with even greater compassion,

00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:37.372
and that's right alongside
the tremendous strength of her family.

00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:41.241
And so everywhere that I could, right,

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:44.200
I wrote her little love notes

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:47.020
for her and for all the other
queer kids of color

00:08:47.044 --> 00:08:48.890
trying to be magnificent.

00:08:50.437 --> 00:08:52.056
Like, when you lose yourself,

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:57.319
dig deep into your ancestry,
because you will find the pieces there.

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:05.715
And also, reminders that soft
is not a pass to duck,

00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:08.421
to hide, to be silent, to cower.

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:11.884
Soft is also a push

00:09:11.908 --> 00:09:13.598
to hold ourselves accountable.

00:09:14.786 --> 00:09:17.892
Kind of like when America
lands in World War II

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:19.799
and comes face-to-face with Hitler,

00:09:19.823 --> 00:09:21.521
and she knocks him the hell out ...

00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:23.015
(Laughter)

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:26.099
just like Captain America did in 1941,

00:09:26.123 --> 00:09:29.975
and who knew we'd need America Chavez
to punch Nazis in 2018.

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:31.651
(Laughter)

00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.651
(Applause)

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:36.955
(Laughter)

00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:41.462
And even that, that justified act
kind of wrecks her a little bit,

00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:44.716
so I made sure that she linked up
with her best friend,

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.628
and they talk feelings
and they go on a road trip

00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:51.328
and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt
at the top of their lungs.

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:52.699
(Laughter)

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:56.824
And when Midas, a sinister corporation,

00:09:56.848 --> 00:09:58.814
takes control of Sotomayor,

00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:02.330
threatens to ban portals
and almost kills America ...

00:10:04.764 --> 00:10:06.692
her ancestors reach for her ...

00:10:08.177 --> 00:10:10.240
because they know that she needs to heal.

00:10:12.318 --> 00:10:16.151
And it is that burst of care,
that healing, that gives her the fuel

00:10:16.175 --> 00:10:20.317
to defeat Midas and reclaim herself.

00:10:22.244 --> 00:10:24.525
See, because that myth

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:27.973
of having to go it alone
and having to be tough ...

00:10:29.543 --> 00:10:30.765
doesn't serve us.

00:10:31.904 --> 00:10:34.478
America Chavez is a whole superhero,

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:38.731
and she still needed a team of support
to help her find herself.

00:10:40.538 --> 00:10:42.395
And she needed that gentleness,

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:46.968
the type of gentleness
that is rooted in compassion

00:10:46.992 --> 00:10:51.316
and still very much invested
in justice and liberation.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:11:00.001
Because it's in that space where softness
and vulnerability meet strength

00:11:00.742 --> 00:11:03.695
that we transcend our everyday selves,

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:06.749
that we become something greater,
something majestic,

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.799
maybe even something super.

00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:12.119
Thank you.

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:15.755
(Applause)
