00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.166
So in the last lecture I spent
quite a while trying to convey a

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.754
sense of
how the structure of DNA was

00:00:08.754 --> 00:00:09.836
discovered.

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:13.690
The crystallographic
data that led to it,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.492
as I said, was collected by
Rosalind Franklin.

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:20.465
And
I saw there was some confusion

00:00:20.465 --> 00:00:24.000
about this picture that I showed
you next.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is not a photograph of a
double helix.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.465
This is what happened when she
bounced the x-ray off the

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:34.551
crystal of
DNA.

00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.498
This is the diffraction pattern
that she saw.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:40.037
And then one
works backwards from that

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:42.856
trying to figure out what kind
of structure it

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:46.167
was that would have caused that
diffraction pattern.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.842
And you have
to be a pretty good x-ray

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.428
crystallographer to draw any
kind of

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:52.856
inferences from that.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:55.714
And there were people,
including Francis

00:00:55.714 --> 00:01:00.000
Crick, who saw the implications
of it right away.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.462
But the point was she collected
the data and then two people

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:06.138
that I told
you about then whose name you

00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:08.569
know so well,
Jim Watson and Francis

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.855
Crick, were the two individuals
that came up with the model that

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:15.064
explained the diffraction
pattern.

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.692
And therefore we learned the
structure of DNA as a

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.318
double-stranded helix.

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:23.298
I also tried
to make the case that it wasn't

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:25.712
two geniuses who sat down in the
room,

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:30.000
took a look at this and popped
up with the model.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.334
It was a story of real people
with misadventures and mistakes

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.928
and
recovery from mistakes and so

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:37.971
on getting it.

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:40.390
It was also a very
small group.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.305
And I'm going to take just a
very small minute at the

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:47.900
beginning of the class because
I have a colleague,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.179
Vernon Ingram
who's sitting down here in the

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.845
front, who was a member of this
very

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:57.252
small group with Jim Watson and
Francis Crick.

00:01:57.252 --> 00:02:00.425
So he was there
where all this happened.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:03.141
And almost nobody in the world
has

00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.824
had a chance in your generation
to hear directly from somebody

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:08.921
who was
there when it happened.

00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.713
So asked Vernon if he would
come and just

00:02:11.713 --> 00:02:15.455
talk to you for a little bit
just what it was like to be

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:16.000
there.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:40.848
Well, thanks,
Graham.

00:02:40.848 --> 00:03:01.864
You seem to
be at a very exciting state in

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:03.000
7.014.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.991
This structure of the secret of
life no less.

00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:13.937
And it is interesting
that immediately when Watson

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:18.427
and Crick put together a model
of the

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:24.688
DNA molecule that fit the x-ray
data, that was the point,

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:28.947
how do you
know a model is correct?

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:33.271
Because there are certain
distances

00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:37.065
in the model,
and those have to correlate

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:42.543
exactly with the distances
of the x-ray spots in the

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:46.361
diffraction pattern that you
saw.

00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:51.868
That is how you know that a
model that you've built to

00:03:51.868 --> 00:03:55.828
certain
specifications corresponds to

00:03:55.828 --> 00:03:59.454
what the molecule of itself in
the

00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:06.000
crystal that you're examining
actually is composed of.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.500
It was by sheer accident that I
happened to be working as a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.741
biochemist in the MRC,
The Medical Research Council

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.640
lab at the
Cavendish Laboratory where

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.687
Watson and Crick were working.

00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:26.625
Sheer
accident.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:32.000
It was a very crowded lab,
as Graham said.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.821
And that's something that you
should remember.

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:41.154
When you're choosing a
lab to work in,

00:04:41.154 --> 00:04:45.235
always go to a lab that's
overcrowded.

00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:50.632
Never go to a
lab where there's lots of space

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:57.392
because a really successful lab
attracts so many coworkers,

00:04:57.392 --> 00:05:02.000
visitors that it rapidly gets
overcrowded.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.603
And that was the case in this
laboratory.

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:10.042
The director was Max
Perutz.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:16.500
Co-director John Kendrew doing
x-ray crystallography of

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.422
proteins for almost the first
time, and solving the protein

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:23.750
structure.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.489
Francis Crick was a graduate
student of Max Perutz's doing

00:05:29.489 --> 00:05:31.000
his PhD work.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.538
And the first thing I remember
about Francis was when I went

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:38.674
there as a
biochemist to work with Max

00:05:38.674 --> 00:05:42.076
Perutz, when I went there,
there was this

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:46.690
tall gangling guy constantly
circulating between the top

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.657
floor of
the building,

00:05:48.657 --> 00:05:53.151
his office in the middle and
the x-ray machines at the

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:53.730
bottom.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.623
He was constantly going up and
down.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:00.943
And in those days the
buildings didn't have an

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:04.228
elevators or lifts as the
English

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:05.856
called them.

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:10.912
So he was in excellent physical
shape.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.907
Very crowded,
a very modest lab.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:19.983
And what's usually forgotten
is a key member of that group,

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:23.665
an engineer,
Tony Broad, key person

00:06:23.665 --> 00:06:29.189
because he invented what was
then the world's best and most

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.361
efficient
x-ray machine,

00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:37.000
a rotating anode x-ray machine.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.311
And because to the x-ray
crystallographers in that group

00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.231
this
machine was available,

00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:51.000
because of that they were the
preeminent x-ray

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.123
structure group in the world.

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:58.000
My job was as a biochemist,
protein

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.283
biochemist, putting a heavy
atom, mercury,

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:09.520
very heavy atom into Max
Parutz's hemoglobin crystals in

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.000
specific places.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.369
That has a predictable effect
on the x-ray pattern and that

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.637
enables the
Fourier diagram to be

00:07:20.637 --> 00:07:25.331
constructed with real phase
values for the x-ray

00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:31.027
diffractions,
for the physicists among you

00:07:31.027 --> 00:07:32.000
here.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.692
Are there any physicists here?

00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:38.030
Yeah, I thought so.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.380
That was a big
step forward and that was also

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.000
a big step in figuring out the
structure

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.814
of the DNA samples
semi-crystals that Professor

00:07:54.814 --> 00:07:58.271
Walker
just referred to.

00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:03.083
All dependent on the engineer
Tony

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:07.707
Broad who is never mentioned in
any of these histories,

00:08:07.707 --> 00:08:11.803
but without him
this would not have happened.

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:15.415
So it was an exciting place to
work in,

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.613
very exciting.

00:08:16.613 --> 00:08:19.268
We were all young in those
days.

00:08:19.268 --> 00:08:24.262
And living the lives of
young men and young women with

00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:27.747
all the complications that arise
when

00:08:27.747 --> 00:08:32.326
you put a whole bunch of very
energetic young men,

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:36.118
very energetic
young women together.

00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:40.000
And by that I mean the
interpersonal

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.718
relationships which when you're
in a crowded,

00:08:43.718 --> 00:08:47.846
very active situation can
sometimes interfere.

00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:52.000
And always very entertaining,
I can tell you

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.434
that.

00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:55.391
I could give you chapter and
verse.

00:08:55.391 --> 00:09:02.285
But it isn't really so very
different from people your age

00:09:02.285 --> 00:09:04.000
now, right?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.456
I mean I'm not saying it
interferes with you,

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:10.380
sometimes it might.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.323
But
it was an exciting lab,

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:18.179
an exciting time to be there
because we were not

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:24.288
the only group trying to figure
out the structure of DNA.

00:09:24.288 --> 00:09:28.652
A huge
competitor was Linus Pauling at

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:34.212
Caltech who had beaten that same
group once before,

00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:37.912
quite recently,
over the alpha helix,

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:42.636
the crucial
component of protein structure.

00:09:42.636 --> 00:09:46.332
He got the right answer first,
1.5

00:09:46.332 --> 00:09:50.082
angstrom reflection,
the alpha helix.

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:52.999
And our group,
Max Parutz

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:55.884
and our group had been wrong.

00:09:55.884 --> 00:09:59.664
So the group was smarting under
that

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:02.733
kind of defeat,
if you like.

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:07.166
And competition is a wonderful
spur,

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:12.284
as long as you don't let it get
out of hand.

00:10:12.284 --> 00:10:18.581
Well, needless to say we
didn't, but the competition

00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:23.832
with the Pauling lab was
certainly so severe

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.598
that we awaited the next
letter.

00:10:27.598 --> 00:10:33.608
You see, in those days new
scientific information arrived

00:10:33.608 --> 00:10:37.000
not by publications,
that too much too

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.558
long, but by personal letter.

00:10:39.558 --> 00:10:43.000
And, in fact,
the NIH has put together

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.104
all these various letters in
the Francis Crick collection.

00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:51.676
And when
you have time you should look

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:52.507
at those.

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:57.647
They're quite interesting
because they tell you in a way

00:10:57.647 --> 00:11:01.000
a scientific paper does not tell
you.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.426
What I feel about my experiment
results.

00:11:04.426 --> 00:11:08.494
What she feels about her
experiment results.

00:11:08.494 --> 00:11:12.599
What it means to me as a
person, to her as a

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:14.901
person, to him as a person.

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:18.399
So we were constantly watching
the mail

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:23.358
and discussing the news as it
came in, mostly over a beer at

00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:25.517
the pub
next door.

00:11:25.517 --> 00:11:30.000
It was very conveniently
located.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.770
But being a small group crowded
together made communication

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.274
within
our group very easy indeed.

00:11:39.274 --> 00:11:41.013
And we had fights.

00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:44.018
I don't mean physical
fights.

00:11:44.018 --> 00:11:46.468
We had scientific fights.

00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:49.998
And as a biochemist I was able
to

00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:55.782
settle a crucial fight among
the crystallographers Crick and

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:59.350
Watson
who were building the model.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.899
Because, quite frankly,
they didn't

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.740
know much chemistry.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.698
And were trying to build a
model with the

00:12:08.698 --> 00:12:11.893
wrong confirmation of the
peptide bond.

00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:17.086
They didn't realize that the
peptide bond has two possible

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:18.335
confirmations.

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:22.904
And they had at one
point a terrible time trying to

00:12:22.904 --> 00:12:26.099
fit everything together because
they

00:12:26.099 --> 00:12:28.877
were using the wrong
confirmation.

00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:32.076
I'm talking about lactam-lactim
for

00:12:32.076 --> 00:12:37.845
those of you who are organic
chemists and it means something,

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:39.372
a
confirmation.

00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:44.384
And once they got the first
confirmation then the model

00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:46.210
clicked into place.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.538
So we all helped,
that's what I'm trying to

00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:50.894
say.

00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:54.462
We all helped with one great
aim in mind.

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:55.621
It was clear.

00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:59.456
And you
know from what Professor Walker

00:12:59.456 --> 00:13:02.846
said, that the DNA structure,
in its

00:13:02.846 --> 00:13:08.147
structure held the clue to
crucial physiological behavior

00:13:08.147 --> 00:13:09.000
of DNA.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.636
And Crick and Watson said this
in their first paper,

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:17.519
the structure
itself because of its

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:23.612
complimentarity gives you an
immediate clue as to how it

00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:24.677
replicates.

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:29.896
And replication of DNA
structure from generation to

00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:33.000
generation is,
of course, the

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.344
crucial thing about DNA.

00:13:35.344 --> 00:13:38.666
The copying,
the precise copying

00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:41.245
from generation to generation.

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:44.818
And that fell out the of x-ray
structure.

00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:49.331
That's why the x-ray structure
was so very important,

00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:53.351
because it gave you an
immediate understanding of the

00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.771
role of DNA in
modern biology.

00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.000
So that's what we did.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.313
And eventually the people in
the group, the group got so

00:14:05.313 --> 00:14:09.650
overcrowded
they built a huge lab that was

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.735
beautiful, like any new lab is.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.998
But
the thing I remember most of

00:14:15.998 --> 00:14:19.426
all was the atmosphere in that
place.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:22.345
So
remember, when you go and

00:14:22.345 --> 00:14:26.665
choose a lab,
choose one that's overcrowded.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:45.000
It will pay off. [APPLAUSE]

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.964
Thank you so much.

00:14:45.964 --> 00:14:47.357
That was really wonderful.

00:14:47.357 --> 00:14:48.000
Thank you.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:00.937
I don't know if some of you
realized

00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:04.215
quite how rare that was,
this discovery of the structure

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:04.811
of DNA.

00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:07.921
As I said, probably one of the
big discoveries of mankind.

00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:09.358
Because, as
Vernon said,

00:15:09.358 --> 00:15:12.558
you could see so many of the
secrets of life as soon as

00:15:12.558 --> 00:15:13.850
you saw that structure.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.433
Very few people have ever heard
from someone

00:15:16.433 --> 00:15:17.894
who was there at the time.

00:15:17.894 --> 00:15:20.308
Maybe you'll forget a bunch of
stuff down

00:15:20.308 --> 00:15:23.520
the line, but I hope you'll
remember you heard somebody who

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.645
was there
when Watson and Crick were

00:15:25.645 --> 00:15:28.061
there and maybe his extra piece
of advice

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:29.514
about choosing a lab.

00:15:29.514 --> 00:15:31.937
To say one thing quickly,
some of

00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:34.785
you I think understood what
I've been trying to do.

00:15:34.785 --> 00:15:37.175
I spent quite a
bit of time talking about

00:15:37.175 --> 00:15:39.684
science being done by real
people doing real

00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:40.434
experiments.

00:15:40.434 --> 00:15:41.996
Thanks for your comments.

00:15:41.996 --> 00:15:44.972
A few of you have gone
out of your way to say that

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:47.433
this was a total waste of time
and you didn't

00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:50.654
understand why I didn't teach
you something instead of doing

00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:52.013
something
on the test.

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:53.716
Well, I'm making up the test.

00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:56.661
And if you don't think
there'll be something on

00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:59.061
scientific process on the second
exam

00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:00.450
you'll be surprised.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.812
So I'm spending a lot of time
on

00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:05.429
this, and the reason is because
you are MIT students.

00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:07.937
You know, you can
go many places in the country

00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:10.059
to many high school biology
courses and

00:16:10.059 --> 00:16:12.095
you can memorize,
someone will tell you to

00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:15.412
memorize everything that's in
the book, and you'll get tested

00:16:15.412 --> 00:16:16.974
whether you can memorize it.

00:16:16.974 --> 00:16:18.649
You
guys are at MIT because you

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:20.933
have the potential to be leaders
in whatever

00:16:20.933 --> 00:16:21.324
you do.

00:16:21.324 --> 00:16:24.559
I've made the transition from
being an undergrad sort of

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:28.186
trying to memorize stuff in a
textbook to working

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:29.563
on a cutting-edge.

00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:32.825
I've made some reasonably
significant discoveries in

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.893
science, as have my other
colleagues in the

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.099
department, some of them making
greater than I.

00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:39.687
But nevertheless if
you're on the cutting-edge then

00:16:39.687 --> 00:16:41.417
you're dealing with all the
stuff

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.319
I'm trying to tell you about in
this thing.

00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:45.162
You're working as a part of
a group.

00:16:45.162 --> 00:16:46.371
There's competition.

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:48.657
There are interpersonal
relationships.

00:16:48.657 --> 00:16:49.575
You make mistakes.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:50.697
You recover from them.

00:16:50.697 --> 00:16:52.097
You're
making inferences.

00:16:52.097 --> 00:16:53.185
You're testing models.

00:16:53.185 --> 00:16:55.657
This is a very complex,
very real, very dynamic,

00:16:55.657 --> 00:16:56.795
very human interaction.

00:16:56.795 --> 00:16:59.938
I hope you got a
little bit of whiff of that

00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:01.000
from Vernon.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.460
And I wouldn't be,
I'm quite capable of

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.510
reproducing diagrams from the
textbook without trying to give

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.064
you a deeper understanding,
and that's

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:11.812
what I'm trying to do here.

00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:14.596
And I hope if it hasn't made
sense to you

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:18.145
by the end that at least a few
more of you will get it.

00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:20.969
And those of
you who I think saw what I was

00:17:20.969 --> 00:17:23.664
doing I appreciate your telling
me that in

00:17:23.664 --> 00:17:24.387
the things.

00:17:24.387 --> 00:17:28.199
These are anonymous so I don't
know, but a couple of you

00:17:28.199 --> 00:17:32.326
are certainly trying to make it
clear that you didn't think it

00:17:32.326 --> 00:17:34.213
was
worth your time coming to

00:17:34.213 --> 00:17:34.686
lecture.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:37.426
I'm trying to tell you why I'm
trying to do it.

00:17:37.426 --> 00:17:39.338
I'm trying to teach you in a
deeper way.

00:17:39.338 --> 00:17:41.096
And this
is a required course.

00:17:41.096 --> 00:17:42.710
It's important for your life.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.607
I hope
some of you will see that or if

00:17:44.607 --> 00:17:46.498
you don't see it now you'll see
it later

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:47.222
in your career.

00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:47.367
OK.

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.784
Now, we're going to talk about
DNA replication.

00:17:49.784 --> 00:17:52.490
I'm going to start to drive
into some of the details that

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.563
maybe are
more the kind of things you're

00:17:54.563 --> 00:17:55.061
expecting.

00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:57.482
I just want to make one
quick point here.

00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.932
I've talked about cell division
and

00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:02.530
we saw this,
how cells come from other cells

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.145
going to make more
cells.

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:07.664
I showed you this little movie
you've seen a few times of a

00:18:07.664 --> 00:18:10.141
yeast cell dividing,
but all cells divide.

00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:12.021
Here's a cancer cell
dividing.

00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:15.396
If you get a cancer it's a cell
that's forgotten how to stop

00:18:15.396 --> 00:18:17.681
dividing and is growing to make
a tumor.

00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:19.790
There's this cancer cell
dividing.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.603
It looks not unlike a yeast on
a molecular level,

00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:24.388
very,
very similar.

00:18:24.388 --> 00:18:27.000
But there's another point.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.258
I told you how the structure of
DNA with the complimentary

00:18:30.258 --> 00:18:32.986
strands with
G pairing with C and A pairing

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.231
with T immediately gave rise to
an

00:18:35.231 --> 00:18:38.963
insight as to how the genetic
material could be replicated.

00:18:38.963 --> 00:18:41.151
And
you guys know that it's held

00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:43.468
together by hydrogen bonds
between

00:18:43.468 --> 00:18:47.180
base pairs which are about
one-twentieth the strength of

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.536
the
covalent bonds.

00:18:48.536 --> 00:18:51.703
So you're able to peel the
strands apart without

00:18:51.703 --> 00:18:53.375
breaking the covalent bonds.

00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:55.821
And then by pairing A with T
and G with

00:18:55.821 --> 00:18:59.940
C and doing that on both
strands then you can end up with

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.520
two identical copies.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.680
And so if you do two identical
copies and you do it again you

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.264
get eight.

00:19:06.264 --> 00:19:09.358
One of the things we've
realized over the last two or

00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:11.640
three years in looking through
the exams

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.873
is somehow, at least some of
the class, didn't connect the

00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:17.029
business
about cells coming from other

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:19.355
cells and DNA duplicating to
give daughter

00:19:19.355 --> 00:19:19.592
DNA.

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:23.212
And I'm just trying to hammer
home the point that these are

00:19:23.212 --> 00:19:23.735
related.

00:19:23.735 --> 00:19:27.069
Every time a cell divides it
has to duplicate its

00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:28.583
genetic information.

00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:31.307
That's why I'm going to be
telling

00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:33.020
you about DNA replication.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.921
Here's a picture of that same
cancer cell,

00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:37.278
but watch over here.

00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:38.364
This is the DNA.

00:19:38.364 --> 00:19:40.060
And you see it's doubled.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.708
And
see how the DNA,

00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:45.152
which is the chromosomes,
has pulled apart so

00:19:45.152 --> 00:19:48.902
that at the end you now have
two cells and you've got

00:19:48.902 --> 00:19:50.793
identical
copies of DNA.

00:19:50.793 --> 00:19:53.797
So if you're studying cancer,
for example,

00:19:53.797 --> 00:19:56.538
this
sort of thing is relevant to

00:19:56.538 --> 00:19:56.845
you.

00:19:56.845 --> 00:19:57.076
OK.

00:19:57.076 --> 00:20:00.721
So the issue of how --
Well, before I do that,

00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:01.470
I'm sorry.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.165
Just a couple of things about
DNA

00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:06.712
replication before I dive into
this.

00:20:06.712 --> 00:20:09.332
So we all started out as a
single

00:20:09.332 --> 00:20:09.711
cell.

00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:14.498
I've got a lot more obviously
because I'm made up of a lot of

00:20:14.498 --> 00:20:14.928
cells.

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:18.731
If I took all the DNA in my
body and I wind up all the

00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:21.629
molecules
in it, do you guys have any

00:20:21.629 --> 00:20:23.667
idea how long that would be?

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:28.640
Who thinks it
would reach let's say across

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.000
the room?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.375
OK.

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:32.125
Across campus?

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:34.250
Across Cambridge?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.375
Around the world?

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:38.223
To
the moon?

00:20:38.223 --> 00:20:39.630
Anybody left?

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.820
To the sun?

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.149
I've got ten to the fourteenth
cells.

00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:49.585
There's about a meter or two in
each cell.

00:20:49.585 --> 00:20:56.005
10 to 20 billion
miles of DNA in each of our

00:20:56.005 --> 00:20:59.000
bodies, human DNA.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.125
They would go back and forth to
the sun multiple times.

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:06.543
So that much
DNA had to get replicated in

00:21:06.543 --> 00:21:09.544
order for the fertilized egg we
all

00:21:09.544 --> 00:21:12.050
started out as to become you.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.816
Another thing,
the accuracy of

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.149
replication is about ten to the
minus tenth.

00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:20.087
Most people,
including

00:21:20.087 --> 00:21:24.063
myself, don't have a very good
feel for exponents.

00:21:24.063 --> 00:21:27.288
So that's one
mistake in 10 billion.

00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:30.615
You know, it could be one
mistake in

00:21:30.615 --> 00:21:32.333
10 to the ninety-ninth.

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.845
Well, what is one mistake in 10
billion mean?

00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:38.758
So let's relate it to something
we know.

00:21:38.758 --> 00:21:42.569
If I was typing let's say an
eight letter word,

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:45.308
60 words a minute,
24 hours a day,

00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:48.647
7 days a
week, and I was as good as DNA

00:21:48.647 --> 00:21:51.536
replication, how often would I
make

00:21:51.536 --> 00:21:52.272
a mistake?

00:21:52.272 --> 00:21:56.031
So you can each think of how
long you think that is.

00:21:56.031 --> 00:21:58.511
But if
I was good on average,

00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:02.000
I would make a mistake once
every 38 years.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.907
So I'm about to tell you about
a process that's absolutely

00:22:06.907 --> 00:22:11.104
astonishing in terms of how
fast and how much you can do and

00:22:11.104 --> 00:22:13.919
with an
accuracy that goes beyond what

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:16.303
we're used to in our ordinary
life.

00:22:16.303 --> 00:22:18.147
So
how does it do this?

00:22:18.147 --> 00:22:21.634
It has to be more than just
pulling the strands

00:22:21.634 --> 00:22:22.087
apart.

00:22:22.087 --> 00:22:26.544
And there's been some confusion
as to why I'm emphasizing

00:22:26.544 --> 00:22:28.314
5 prime and 3 prime.

00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:31.500
Well, each of these subunits,
each

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.500
nucleotide, this is a 3 prime
hydroxyl and this is the 5 prime

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.214
position.

00:22:37.214 --> 00:22:41.500
If we were joining together
subunits that had a hook

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.953
and an eye it would make a
difference because it's not the

00:22:45.953 --> 00:22:47.455
same
on both ends.

00:22:47.455 --> 00:22:51.500
If we're going to start hooking
together it's exactly

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.156
the same thing when we get to a
biochemical level,

00:22:55.156 --> 00:22:58.807
the 5 prime end
is not the same as hydroxyl at

00:22:58.807 --> 00:23:01.500
the 3 prime end because the
whole

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.215
thing is asymmetric.

00:23:04.215 --> 00:23:08.833
So the enzymes that copy DNA
are

00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:12.439
known as DNA polymerases.

00:23:12.439 --> 00:23:18.499
And it was a very difficult
challenge to

00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:26.123
figure out how they operated,
but Arthur Kornberg was the

00:23:26.123 --> 00:23:31.390
first person
to solve this problem.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.375
He was an extraordinarily
gifted

00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:37.420
biochemist.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.607
He's still at Stanford.

00:23:39.607 --> 00:23:43.125
And what he found was if we
have a

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:47.560
5 prime end this would then be
the 3 prime end,

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.575
and there's a 3 prime
hydroxyl which is this one

00:23:52.575 --> 00:23:53.717
right here.

00:23:53.717 --> 00:23:56.625
And this was paired,
say,

00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:59.533
with a C and A paired with a T.

00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:02.817
And let's say a G paired with a
C

00:24:02.817 --> 00:24:03.258
here.

00:24:03.258 --> 00:24:08.453
And let's say the next template
base was, let's make it a

00:24:08.453 --> 00:24:08.617
T.

00:24:08.617 --> 00:24:13.436
What Arthur Kornberg was able
to find was an enzyme activity

00:24:13.436 --> 00:24:16.907
that
catalyzed a template-dependent

00:24:16.907 --> 00:24:18.692
replication of DNA.

00:24:18.692 --> 00:24:21.761
That was
critical because he had to

00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:25.362
find, if you broke the cells
open, somewhere

00:24:25.362 --> 00:24:31.000
in that gamish of enzymes and
things from inside a cell.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.525
There had to be something that
was able to copy DNA.

00:24:34.525 --> 00:24:37.705
So in order to do
that he had to work out an

00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:38.120
assay.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.816
And he also had to have some
kind of

00:24:40.816 --> 00:24:45.284
guess as to what the cell would
be using in order to carry out

00:24:45.284 --> 00:24:46.435
the
synthesis.

00:24:46.435 --> 00:24:50.634
But one thing that was sort of
obvious was a DNA template

00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:52.738
because that was being copies.

00:24:52.738 --> 00:24:55.544
But the other part was you had
to have

00:24:55.544 --> 00:24:57.745
energy to form a covalent bond.

00:24:57.745 --> 00:25:00.443
So somehow there had to be
something

00:25:00.443 --> 00:25:04.354
that was sort of activated with
the energy built into the

00:25:04.354 --> 00:25:07.173
molecule so
that thermodynamically the

00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:10.220
whole thing would slide downhill
when you

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.095
made a bond.

00:25:11.095 --> 00:25:14.233
And he knew that the cell had
triphosphates,

00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:17.729
just the
same type that we talked about

00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:20.000
when we talked about ATP.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:42.044
So this would be a 
deoxyribonucleotide

00:25:42.044 --> 00:25:43.541
triphosphate.

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:47.570
And he was able to make a
guess,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:53.763
because he had to try things
until he found something that

00:25:53.763 --> 00:26:00.308
would work,
that this was what's used in

00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:03.000
DNA synthesis.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.616
So this hydroxyl ultimately
attacks this phosphate here.

00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:13.313
And these two
other phosphates then come off

00:26:13.313 --> 00:26:15.253
as a leaving group.

00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:20.575
So if we thought of
it as a P like this with two

00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:24.750
more Ps here,
these two come off and

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:32.000
you get a new bond formed to
the phosphate.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.110
And so what Kornberg then was
able to find by using a DNA

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:45.235
template that
had this sort of structure and

00:26:45.235 --> 00:26:50.284
P, P, P, like this,
that he was now

00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:54.938
able to get an A added here.

00:26:54.938 --> 00:27:01.891
This hydroxyl here became
the new hydroxyl.

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:07.111
And so the direction of
synthesis,

00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:12.341
this strand is the other way,
so the direction of synthesis

00:27:12.341 --> 00:27:16.026
of a DNA
polymerase, it's polymerizing

00:27:16.026 --> 00:27:19.555
in the 5 prime to 3 prime
direction.

00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:24.199
This was again an amazing
discovery because it was the

00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:29.881
first time that
anyone had found an enzyme that

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.000
could copy DNA.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.585
Arthur Kornberg got a Nobel
Prize for it.

00:27:34.585 --> 00:27:38.371
But at this point actually
genetics came in because there

00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:40.921
was a scientist John Cairns who
was at

00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:44.923
that point down at Cold Spring
Harbor, as I told you the other

00:27:44.923 --> 00:27:45.383
day.

00:27:45.383 --> 00:27:49.016
And John, in spite of the fact
that Arthur had found a DNA

00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:51.473
polymerase
that had all the properties

00:27:51.473 --> 00:27:54.307
that you would expect for
copying DNA, didn't

00:27:54.307 --> 00:27:57.687
think that was the one that
actually copied the DNA

00:27:57.687 --> 00:28:00.412
necessary for
cellular replication.

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:03.307
So he reasoned if he was right
he'd

00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:07.452
be able to find a mutation that
would eliminate the activity of

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:10.156
that
enzyme and the cell would still

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:10.516
live.

00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:14.138
And so they did a screen,
and it was a lot of work,

00:28:14.138 --> 00:28:16.639
but they eventually found a
mutant of E.

00:28:16.639 --> 00:28:19.112
coli
that lacked this DNA polymerase

00:28:19.112 --> 00:28:21.325
that Arthur Kornberg had
discovered.

00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:23.726
And
the cell was still alive and

00:28:23.726 --> 00:28:25.824
was still replicating its DNA.

00:28:25.824 --> 00:28:28.307
So it
told both John and then Arthur

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:31.000
there must be another enzyme in
the cell.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.188
And so Arthur went back.

00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:34.465
And now working in a mutant
that was missing

00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:37.452
this first polymerase he
discovered he found the one that

00:28:37.452 --> 00:28:38.886
really
replicates the DNA.

00:28:38.886 --> 00:28:40.443
The first one is important,
too.

00:28:40.443 --> 00:28:41.950
It's needed for
DNA repair.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.512
I'm going to talk to you about
that in next lecture,

00:28:44.512 --> 00:28:46.491
but
it's not absolutely crucial for

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:46.754
life.

00:28:46.754 --> 00:28:49.857
And there's an interplay of
genetics and biochemistry.

00:28:49.857 --> 00:28:53.530
And you'll see I'm just sort of
foreshadowing what we're going

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.543
to get to when we talk about
the genetics of this.

00:28:56.543 --> 00:28:58.736
And I know a couple of you
clearly

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:01.128
were frustrated about me
showing you pictures of the

00:29:01.128 --> 00:29:03.703
people who did this,
but nevertheless since this was

00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:05.682
such a historic event a couple
of years

00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:07.010
ago at Cold Spring Harbor.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.155
This you see the helix model
down there.

00:29:09.155 --> 00:29:11.301
There was Jim Watson opening
the symposium.

00:29:11.301 --> 00:29:14.097
When I got up to talk I
said, well, I told my students

00:29:14.097 --> 00:29:16.104
that I'd let them know what it
was like

00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:18.369
when I was there,
so I took out a camera and I

00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:20.031
took a picture of the
audience.

00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:23.051
And so there are a bunch of
Nobel Laureates and types here

00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:25.912
who were sitting there smiling
for you guys in the class.

00:29:25.912 --> 00:29:29.421
And there
was Arthur Kornberg giving his

00:29:29.421 --> 00:29:30.000
talk.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.882
Now, these DNA polymerases are
incredible protein machines.

00:29:33.882 --> 00:29:35.984
The
crystal structures of DNA

00:29:35.984 --> 00:29:38.568
polymerases operating their
template

00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:39.803
have been solved.

00:29:39.803 --> 00:29:42.855
And you can solve,
depending on how many

00:29:42.855 --> 00:29:46.437
diffractions you can get,
you can get a model that's more

00:29:46.437 --> 00:29:47.734
and more
detailed.

00:29:47.734 --> 00:29:51.426
And there have been very high
resolution models of DNA

00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:52.161
polymerases.

00:29:52.161 --> 00:29:55.712
This blue and white stuff is
the surface of the protein,

00:29:55.712 --> 00:30:00.000
and this is sort of a template
and the various parts.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.289
Just to give you an idea here
are these tracings of the shapes

00:30:04.289 --> 00:30:06.134
of the
electron density.

00:30:06.134 --> 00:30:09.844
You can see how the
crystallographers have fit the

00:30:09.844 --> 00:30:13.535
nucleotides right in the
crystal into these electron

00:30:13.535 --> 00:30:14.259
densities.

00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:16.876
And
here putting it together a bit

00:30:16.876 --> 00:30:19.690
in the blue is the secondary
structure

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.699
of the protein and the
templates and whatnot.

00:30:22.699 --> 00:30:26.097
And I don't expect you to
see very much in that,

00:30:26.097 --> 00:30:29.538
but the point is I wanted to
sort of just set you

00:30:29.538 --> 00:30:32.055
up to show you this little
movie.

00:30:32.055 --> 00:30:35.902
Because DNA polymerases are
incredible machines.

00:30:35.902 --> 00:30:39.248
They copy at about a thousand
nucleotides a

00:30:39.248 --> 00:30:42.174
second and their accuracy is
really amazing.

00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:46.027
And I'll tell you all the
tricks to the accuracy in the

00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:48.913
next lecture,
but I want to show you this

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:52.781
little movie because this is
sort of a simulation of what

00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:55.596
must happen
every time a nucleotide is

00:30:55.596 --> 00:30:56.022
added.

00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:58.582
Now, we'll see this over and
over

00:30:58.582 --> 00:31:00.732
again so I'll take it in
pieces.

00:31:00.732 --> 00:31:03.230
The yellow and the orange are
the

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.716
secondary structures.

00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:06.274
That's an alpha helix.

00:31:06.274 --> 00:31:09.638
And certainly one
thing you can see is happening,

00:31:09.638 --> 00:31:12.152
as we're looking at this,
is the parts

00:31:12.152 --> 00:31:14.691
of the protein are moving
during this.

00:31:14.691 --> 00:31:18.489
So you can see this alpha
helix that's sort of swinging

00:31:18.489 --> 00:31:20.170
up and swinging back down.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.110
Now, what's
over here is the template base.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.538
That's the base that
correspondents

00:31:25.538 --> 00:31:30.000
to the T that I was just
showing you here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.022
This is the incoming
nucleotide.

00:31:32.022 --> 00:31:34.306
There is the triphosphate
coming

00:31:34.306 --> 00:31:34.930
down here.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.115
And, in fact,
you just see those two

00:31:37.115 --> 00:31:38.176
phosphates going.

00:31:38.176 --> 00:31:39.912
So
what's happening here,

00:31:39.912 --> 00:31:42.922
this is going to be the end of
the growing chain.

00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:46.272
It's going attack right there,
join the phosphate and the

00:31:46.272 --> 00:31:47.916
pyrophosphate
will leave.

00:31:47.916 --> 00:31:51.538
And if you'll take a look,
when you see this movement of

00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:55.177
this helix from the beginning
state to up to here,

00:31:55.177 --> 00:31:57.284
you'll
see what happens.

00:31:57.284 --> 00:32:00.500
It's squeezing the template
base and

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.852
the incoming nucleotide
together.

00:32:02.852 --> 00:32:05.500
What it's really doing is
testing

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.027
for the correct shape.

00:32:07.027 --> 00:32:10.500
Remember the shape of an A-T
base pair and a G-C

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.166
base pair is the same.

00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:15.500
And if those of you who are
confused about

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.013
guanine and the keto-enol
thing, try to draw hydrogen

00:32:19.013 --> 00:32:23.083
bonds with the enol
form of guanine and see how you

00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:23.333
do.

00:32:23.333 --> 00:32:27.261
I think you'll begin to
understand a bit.

00:32:27.261 --> 00:32:31.200
So at the heart of life is
something

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.088
that can copy DNA.

00:32:33.088 --> 00:32:37.599
And there are these exquisitely
beautiful

00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:38.447
machines.

00:32:38.447 --> 00:32:44.000
The replicative machine in E.
coli has 18 proteins and the

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.101
ones in our bodies are even
more sophisticated with even

00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:50.400
more parts.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.720
OK.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.799
But to replicate a DNA molecule
there's another problem

00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.686
that comes up.

00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:17.662
Because DNA polymerases copy --
-- and grow chains in a 5 prime

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:33.000
to 3
prime direction.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.312
And they need a 3 prime hydroxy
terminus.

00:33:37.312 --> 00:33:43.489
So they won't work if you
just gave it a single strand of

00:33:43.489 --> 00:33:43.896
DNA.

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:47.664
No DNA polymerase can handle
that.

00:33:47.664 --> 00:33:53.830
It has to have something like
this where there's a template

00:33:53.830 --> 00:34:03.914
strand --
-- and there's what's known as

00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:06.433
the
primer strand.

00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:10.199
So there has to be something
that has the 3 prime

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:14.237
hydroxyl and there has to be
something that's going to

00:34:14.237 --> 00:34:17.187
provide
the template that's going to be

00:34:17.187 --> 00:34:17.681
copied.

00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:21.677
So if we pull strands apart
like this with 5 prime to 3

00:34:21.677 --> 00:34:24.599
prime then they'll be 5 prime to
3 prime

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:27.826
running in the opposite
direction.

00:34:27.826 --> 00:34:31.250
If we have a template like
this,

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:38.641
this is OK because the strand
here can be copied 5 prime to 3

00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:39.750
prime.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:46.390
This is the new strand being
synthesized by the DNA

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:48.250
polymerase.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.182
But what about the other
strand?

00:34:52.182 --> 00:34:56.750
The replication fork is moving
in

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:01.921
this direction,
but if the -- So here is the 3

00:35:01.921 --> 00:35:04.548
to 5 prime
direction here.

00:35:04.548 --> 00:35:08.248
So if the DNA polymerase is
going to be copying

00:35:08.248 --> 00:35:11.769
this strand it's going to be
moving backwards to the

00:35:11.769 --> 00:35:14.385
direction of the
replication fork.

00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:17.914
Now, I guess evolution and
nature could have

00:35:17.914 --> 00:35:22.170
selected for two types of DNA
polymerases, one that copies 5

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.248
prime
to 3 prime and one that copies

00:35:25.248 --> 00:35:27.581
in the opposite direction.

00:35:27.581 --> 00:35:29.142
But it didn't.

00:35:29.142 --> 00:35:33.863
And there are a number of
theoretical reasons that we

00:35:33.863 --> 00:35:36.460
could discuss in a more advanced
course

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.195
perhaps for why that is true.

00:35:38.195 --> 00:35:40.768
But, in fact,
what it does is it uses the

00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:41.738
same polymerase.

00:35:41.738 --> 00:35:45.076
So as these things peel apart
the polymerase works in

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:48.116
the other direction,
but there's another problem.

00:35:48.116 --> 00:35:51.082
If I just peel it
apart like this there's no 3

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:51.993
prime hydroxyl.

00:35:51.993 --> 00:35:55.663
So it took people quite a
few years to figure out the

00:35:55.663 --> 00:35:58.000
strategy that's used in nature.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.361
Nature has a special enzyme
that makes a little piece of

00:36:04.361 --> 00:36:04.824
RNA.

00:36:04.824 --> 00:36:08.292
It's
called an RNA primer.

00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:13.500
And what it does is it provides
a 3 prime

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.541
hydroxyl.

00:36:14.541 --> 00:36:21.250
And once you have the 3 prime
hydroxyl at the end of the

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:29.000
little RNA chain then the DNA
polymerase --

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:39.856
-- can be made 5 prime to 3
prime.

00:36:39.856 --> 00:36:45.398
So as you peel open the
replication fork then little

00:36:45.398 --> 00:36:50.945
pieces of RNA are
used to make a new strand of

00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:53.959
DNA and it goes this way.

00:36:53.959 --> 00:36:59.520
Now that
obviously doesn't give you a

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.000
new intact DNA strand.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.123
And part of the clue to this
working out what was going on at

00:37:08.123 --> 00:37:11.096
DNA
replication was the recognition

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:14.271
that newly synthesized DNA was
made as

00:37:14.271 --> 00:37:15.432
little pieces.

00:37:15.432 --> 00:37:19.327
And then later it got joined
into longer pieces.

00:37:19.327 --> 00:37:22.323
And
the person who discovered this

00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:23.289
was Okazaki.

00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:27.925
So these fragments of DNA
that are synthesized initially

00:37:27.925 --> 00:37:31.181
are called Okazaki fragments,
after the

00:37:31.181 --> 00:37:33.290
person who discovered this.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.181
It was rather puzzling because
when

00:37:36.181 --> 00:37:39.761
you tried to look at the
synthesis of DNA you're looking

00:37:39.761 --> 00:37:42.475
at a long
molecule, and you found some of

00:37:42.475 --> 00:37:44.907
the newly synthesized material
was in

00:37:44.907 --> 00:37:45.779
short pieces.

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:48.599
And as you watched over time it
got longer.

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:51.132
So the
cell, I think you can sort of

00:37:51.132 --> 00:37:53.635
see from first principles what
has to

00:37:53.635 --> 00:37:57.756
happen here then.

00:37:57.756 --> 00:38:06.000
That in order to come and make
--

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
This strand is pretty easy to
do,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
but what the cells have to do
now is they've got these little

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
RNA primers.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.884
And then they remove the RNA by
an enzyme that's capable of

00:38:27.884 --> 00:38:34.205
degrading
the DNA or clipping it at the

00:38:34.205 --> 00:38:36.000
junction.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.900
And that then leaves the cell
in this sort of situation where

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.086
there
are little tiny gaps in between

00:38:44.086 --> 00:38:45.720
these pieces of DNA.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.283
But at the end
of each one of these is a 3

00:38:49.283 --> 00:38:50.490
prime hydroxyl.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:55.257
So another polymerase or
one or another polymerase in

00:38:55.257 --> 00:39:00.325
the cell can fill those little
pieces of DNA out.

00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:04.300
And then there's one little
nick

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.629
that needs to be sealed.

00:39:06.629 --> 00:39:10.900
And so what you finally end up
with is a 3

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.800
prime hydroxyl here,
a 5 prime phosphate that's at

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.791
the other end,
and then these are joined

00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:20.616
together.

00:39:20.616 --> 00:39:24.099
This is one nucleotide here and
the

00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:25.234
other here.

00:39:25.234 --> 00:39:30.699
These are then joined together
to give the ordinary

00:39:30.699 --> 00:39:39.000
phosphodiester bond that links
--

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.089
-- the two nucleotides together
like that.

00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:47.007
And the enzyme that does that
is an enzyme called DNA ligase.

00:39:47.007 --> 00:39:50.000
You can almost think about it
as DNA

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.039
Scotch tape that will take a
little nick in DNA,

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:57.800
if we've got a
phosphate and hydroxyl,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.000
and it will join them together.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.062
So this process of replication,
which can go at about a

00:40:06.062 --> 00:40:09.686
thousand
nucleotides a second with this

00:40:09.686 --> 00:40:13.000
amazing degree of accuracy,
uses two

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.956
different DNA polymerases,
both of which biochemically can

00:40:17.956 --> 00:40:20.183
only go in
one direction.

00:40:20.183 --> 00:40:25.000
But you can see they have to be
somehow oriented so that

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.239
one of them is able to move in
this direction and the other one

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:33.245
is able
to move in that direction.

00:40:33.245 --> 00:40:36.181
The key part in this sort of
the

00:40:36.181 --> 00:40:39.755
course is to try and understand
this 5 to 3 prime and to get

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:42.434
this basic
idea that nature had to do

00:40:42.434 --> 00:40:43.161
something.

00:40:43.161 --> 00:40:46.877
It was fairly easy to
copy one strand because that

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:50.930
was sort of the direction of the
polymerase movement was the

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.635
same as the replication fork
movement, but

00:40:53.635 --> 00:40:58.000
the other strand had to have
been much more a problem.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.848
And so when you get down to a
biochemical level,

00:41:00.848 --> 00:41:03.369
though, it's very
conceptually easy to say,

00:41:03.369 --> 00:41:06.000
oh, you've got complimentary
strands so we just

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.885
take it apart,
we take the photograph and the

00:41:08.885 --> 00:41:11.681
negative and we
make the opposite one and now

00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:12.898
we've got two copies.

00:41:12.898 --> 00:41:15.552
When you get down
to the biochemical details

00:41:15.552 --> 00:41:18.000
there is this major biochemical
issue of

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.314
whether the polymerase can go
in the 3 prime or the 5 prime

00:41:21.314 --> 00:41:22.000
direction.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.529
And nature has chosen to do it
all or has been selected to do

00:41:25.529 --> 00:41:28.530
it all
somehow with a polymerase going

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.000
in one direction.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.707
There are many other aspects to
DNA replication.

00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:37.978
And one of the tricks
that I find most fascinating is

00:41:37.978 --> 00:41:41.199
that these polymerases,
once they get on

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.540
DNA they stay on.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.800
And that's part of the secret
because it takes about

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.039
a millisecond to add a
nucleotide, but if it comes off

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:54.266
the DNA it has
to get back on.

00:41:54.266 --> 00:41:58.000
Then it takes about a minute.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.873
So the whole trick to being a
very, very fast DNA polymerase

00:42:01.873 --> 00:42:04.056
is to
somehow hang onto the DNA.

00:42:04.056 --> 00:42:06.798
So what biochemists did was
they purified

00:42:06.798 --> 00:42:10.242
the actual enzymatic activity
that could carry out this

00:42:10.242 --> 00:42:12.971
process, and
then they started to look for

00:42:12.971 --> 00:42:15.599
other protein factors that would
help the

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.205
process to work better.

00:42:17.205 --> 00:42:19.998
And they discovered something
called a

00:42:19.998 --> 00:42:24.004
processivity factor which made
the polymerase stay on the DNA.

00:42:24.004 --> 00:42:26.210
And
people wondered for a lot of

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.798
years how that worked and why
did this

00:42:28.798 --> 00:42:30.406
system work so well.

00:42:30.406 --> 00:42:33.460
And finally the crystal
structure of

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.578
the processivity factor was
discovered.

00:42:36.578 --> 00:42:40.502
And if I go back to
this sort of diagram where this

00:42:40.502 --> 00:42:43.304
is the piece of DNA that's
copied, what

00:42:43.304 --> 00:42:47.910
it turned out was that the
processivity factor is basically

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.083
a
doughnut that kind of gets

00:42:50.083 --> 00:42:52.367
clamped around the DNA like
that.

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:55.150
So it's
sort of like taking a washer

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.076
with a place where you can pry
it apart

00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:02.324
opening it up,
putting it around the DNA like

00:43:02.324 --> 00:43:03.000
this.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.660
And then the polymerase,
more or less since this is

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.190
topologically
linked to the DNA,

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.757
is like a washer sliding on a
wire.

00:43:11.757 --> 00:43:14.929
This DNA
polymerase hangs onto that and

00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:16.440
it doesn't come off.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.734
And I think
there's a little picture of it.

00:43:19.734 --> 00:43:21.321
Here's a little movie.

00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:24.333
There's the
DNA going through and this is

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:25.714
one of these clamps.

00:43:25.714 --> 00:43:30.148
It's virtually the
same structure in a bacterium

00:43:30.148 --> 00:43:32.000
and inside of us.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.419
But, in fact,
the amino acids are almost all

00:43:35.419 --> 00:43:36.215
different.

00:43:36.215 --> 00:43:39.025
But the
underlying structure of the

00:43:39.025 --> 00:43:41.032
protein is almost identical.

00:43:41.032 --> 00:43:44.450
And there are
special machines called clamp

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.269
loaders that pry open this
clamps,

00:43:47.269 --> 00:43:51.203
clamp them around DNA,
and that's part of the secret

00:43:51.203 --> 00:43:54.108
to how these
polymerases are able to

00:43:54.108 --> 00:43:55.856
polymerize DNA so fast.

00:43:55.856 --> 00:43:59.639
There are a lot of
other pieces of this machinery.

00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:02.250
If you go on you'll hear more
about

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:02.571
them.

00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:06.107
I just want to give you one of
the most recent insights.

00:44:06.107 --> 00:44:08.312
I mean
this, as you might guess,

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.250
since DNA replication is at the
heart of life

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.473
it's been studied very,
very hard, ever since the

00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:16.119
discovery of DNA
helix.

00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:17.784
My colleague,
Alan Grossman,

00:44:17.784 --> 00:44:20.250
made quite a discovery just
probably

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.815
three or four years ago.

00:44:21.815 --> 00:44:24.750
He took that green fluorescent
protein that

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.488
we've seen a few times,
and he actually joined the gene

00:44:28.488 --> 00:44:31.540
encoding
green fluorescent protein to

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.139
the backend of a piece of
the DNA polymerase.

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.846
So wherever the DNA polymerase
went

00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:40.251
now there was a little
fluorescent molecule.

00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:42.958
And he looked to see
where it was in the cell.

00:44:42.958 --> 00:44:45.230
And I, like many other people,
had for

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.781
years taught,
and this is why,

00:44:46.781 --> 00:44:48.922
you know, I have respect for
the fact

00:44:48.922 --> 00:44:51.585
that I'm just teaching you the
current model.

00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:53.457
For much of my
career I taught,

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:56.306
so DNA polymerase is sort of
like a train going down

00:44:56.306 --> 00:45:00.000
the tracks a thousand molecules
per second.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.808
And we're doing all this stuff
with the leading and with the

00:45:05.808 --> 00:45:07.151
two
strands.

00:45:07.151 --> 00:45:12.046
So let me just put those words
up while I'm up there.

00:45:12.046 --> 00:45:14.156
This
one is called,

00:45:14.156 --> 00:45:19.199
this strand that's easy to
replicate is called the

00:45:19.199 --> 00:45:20.675
leading strand.

00:45:20.675 --> 00:45:25.599
And this one where you have to
do the primer and

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:32.000
whatnot is called the lagging
strand.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.268
In any case,
what I had taught was that

00:45:34.268 --> 00:45:37.161
polymerase was like a train
running on tracks.

00:45:37.161 --> 00:45:40.000
You could calculate how fast it
would move.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
What Alan, to his amazement,
found was when he looked to see

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.411
where the DNA polymerase was,
it wasn't spread out all over

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.552
the cell
as if you thought it was a

00:45:49.552 --> 00:45:50.985
thing running on tracks.

00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:53.464
In fact, it was
in the center of the cell.

00:45:53.464 --> 00:45:56.000
And then late in cell division
it split into

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
two spots that went to the
midpoints of what would be the

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.440
daughter cells.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.800
And so what he ended up
realizing

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.721
from that was that instead it
was more as if the polymerase

00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:12.898
was a
factory and it pulled the DNA

00:46:12.898 --> 00:46:16.000
through it rather than it
traveling

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.191
down the tracks of the DNA.

00:46:18.191 --> 00:46:21.599
And that was a very surprising
discovery

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:26.239
that went against all the dogma
and all the pictures in the

00:46:26.239 --> 00:46:27.199
textbook.

00:46:27.199 --> 00:46:29.530
And it was a discovery at MIT.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.250
That was published in,
I think it

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.823
was 2001, something like that,
a very recent discovery.

00:46:35.823 --> 00:46:37.354
Things keep
changing.

00:46:37.354 --> 00:46:41.250
That's again why I keep
emphasizing I cannot teach you a

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.293
fact in biology.

00:46:42.293 --> 00:46:45.750
I can teach you the best
understanding we have that

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.867
explains the experiments to
date.

00:46:47.867 --> 00:46:50.250
But somebody may make a
discovery

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:50.861
tomorrow.

00:46:50.861 --> 00:46:54.192
That means we'll have to change
our understanding.

00:46:54.192 --> 00:46:54.396
OK?

00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:56.095
So good luck on the exam.

00:46:56.095 --> 00:46:57.961
I’ll see you on Monday,
OK?
