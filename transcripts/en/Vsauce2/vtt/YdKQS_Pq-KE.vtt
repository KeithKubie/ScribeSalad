00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.779
Chop-Syc is an interactive cutting board with
built-in scale and measuring devices.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.870
And this bench concept allows you to record
a video to the cloud while you sit on it which

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.600
is linked to the shadows cast by the bench
that can later be accessed with an augmented

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.120
reality app that reads the data from the appearance
of the shadows.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Vsauce!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.250
&nbsp;Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.619
IBM is working on a new computer prototype
fueled by electronic blood.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.120
Using the human brain as a model, they're
designing them to be cooled and fueled by

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.980
a liquid just like the blood of a human brain.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.390
This new system pumps an electrolyte blood
through a computer carrying power in and taking

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.390
heat out.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.579
And they hope by 2060 a one petaflop computer
the size of half a football field today will

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340
fit on your desktop.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.860
The Neurocam is a wearable camera that automatically
records what interests you by analyzing your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.020
brainwaves.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.239
It works on a scale of 1 to 100 with a brain
wave sensor that connects to an iPhone.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.140
If your interest exceeds 60, the phone will
automatically start recording to produce a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.170
5 second animated GIF.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.200
The future of this project is to create an
emotional interface that can use people's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.460
thoughts and feelings for a wide range of
practical applications.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.990
China's smog problem could be helped by a
new smog-devouring vacuum concept.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.170
By using underground copper coils the smog
particles are attracted and brought down from

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350
the atmosphere to the ground.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.700
Recently in a lab setting they created a one
cubic meter smog free hole in a 5 by 5 meter

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.729
room, and the challenge is now to create it
on a larger scale for public spaces.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.100
Dung Beetles gallop.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.790
And it looks like this.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.799
So Yeah.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.200
The Aerial Imaging Plate displays interactive
images floating in the air.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.790
Developed by Asukanet, the image is visible
at a specific certain angle so only the user

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.000
is able to see it which would make it safe
to use for ATM's.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.020
And there are no fingerprint or hygiene concerns
since the user is not actually touching an

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.020
actual screen.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.030
FlyKly is a smart wheel that significantly
upgrades an ordinary bike.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.769
It has a pedal assist that's able to go up
to 20 mph for 30 miles and is used in conjunction

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:18.849
with an app.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.109
The smart light attached to the handlebars
has a pad designed to hold your phone and

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.010
also charges it while you're riding.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.659
The wheel locks with the touch of a button
and in case your bike is still stolen there's

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.560
GPS tracking sent directly to your phone and
it can also suggest alternate routes that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.849
may be faster or just more fun.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.489
The poppy project from INRIA flowers is trying
to create everyday personalized humanoid robots.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.640
And even though it's not quite ready to walk
on its own, it was designed to better understand

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.879
biped locomotion and interactions between
humans and robots.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.109
All of the parts for the robot will be able
to be 3D printed or purchased from an electronics

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.319
store, even though it may cost around $11,000
to make your own.&nbsp;

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.370
Cooler Cannon.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.779
Star Path from Pro Teq is a spray-applied
elastometric coating that creates illuminated

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.169
paths at night.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.129
The coating is applied in three layers and
only takes about half an hour to dry.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.389
The middle layer absorbs UV energy during
the day and emits this blue glow when it gets

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.389
dark out.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.209
The process can be applied to many surfaces
including stone paths, driveways, and even

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.349
playgrounds.&nbsp;

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.779
The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System
will be the largest solar thermal power tower

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.939
system in the world.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.150
Located in the California desert, the amount
of carbon dioxide saved from going into the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.099
atmosphere will be the equivalent of taking
70,000 cars off of the road and will generate

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.109
electricity for 140,000 homes.

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.290
Flirty is the first unmanned aerial vehicle
delivery technology.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.049
Zookal dot com is an online textbook resource
delivering textbooks via a drone in Sydney,

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.049
Australia.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.719
All you have to do is order from the app on
your smartphone and the book will be shipped

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.739
within minutes.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.739
But currently commercial flights of UAVs are
not legal in the United States.

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.400
Finally Tribocycle created by Ben Ridgway
is a absolutely mesmerizing looping movie

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:28.319
for large scale projections and installations.&nbsp;

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:33.990
I'm gonna leave you with a robotic ape transitioning
from a quadrupedal to a bipedal posture.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:05:09.090
And as always - thanks 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.969
for watching.
