00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.010
Here's another example that comes from the World Cup.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.860
I like this visualization in particular because it uses small multiples.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.710
Small multiples take advantage of the same layout and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.190
visual encodings from one slice of the data to the next.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.040
This allows us to make comparisons across the data or

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.250
across the different views of the data quickly.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.800
You can find a link to this visualization in the instructor notes.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.430
I'd like you to do the same thing for this graphic as you do with the last one.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.580
I want you to determine how the variables are encoded in the visualization.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.950
The encodings for this graphic are somewhat harder to decipher

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.680
because a variable may be encoded in more than one visual encoding.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.860
We've set up the grader to accept a variety of answers, but

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.720
when you go to integrate your answer, I only want you to choose

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.950
one visual encoding, one of these, for each of the variables.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.060
So what do you think?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.150
How are these variables visually encoded?
