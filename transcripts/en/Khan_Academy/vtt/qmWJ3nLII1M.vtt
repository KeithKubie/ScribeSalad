00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:02.679
- [Instructor] We're told
that the nth partial sum

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:05.207
of the series from n
equals one to infinity

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:06.847
of a sub n is given by.

00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:09.743
And so the sum of the first
n terms is n squared plus one

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.291
over n plus one.

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:12.494
And they want us to figure out,

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.637
what is the actual seventh term?

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:16.808
And, like always, pause this
video and see if you can

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.597
figure it out on your own before

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:21.152
we work through it together.

00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:25.411
All right, so, one way to
think about it is: a sub seven,

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.358
let's think about how that
relates to different sums.

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:32.478
So, if we have a sub one,
plus a sub two, I'll just

00:00:32.478 --> 00:00:36.228
go all the way, a sub
three, plus a sub four,

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:41.874
plus a sub five, plus a
sub six, plus a sub seven.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:47.274
So, if I were to sum all
of these things together,

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:51.357
that--this entire sum--that
would be s sub seven.

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:55.304
And if I wanted to figure out a sub seven,

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:57.280
well I could subtract from that.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.900
I could subtract out the
sum of the first six terms.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.483
I could subtract out s sub six.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.140
So, once again, what am I doing
here, what is my strategy?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.593
I know the formula for the
sum of the first n terms.

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:16.441
I can use that to say, okay,

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.628
I can figure out the sum
of the first seven terms.

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:20.260
That's gonna be the sum of all of these.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.869
And then I can use that
same formula to figure out

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.216
the sum of the first six
terms, and the difference

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:29.013
between the two, that's
going to be our a sub seven.

00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:32.177
So, another way of saying
what I just said is that

00:01:32.177 --> 00:01:36.344
a sub seven is going to be the
sum of the first seven terms,

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:40.441
minus the sum of the first six terms.

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:45.817
And if you were doing this
problem on your own you wouldn't

00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:47.937
have to write it out this way,
I just wrote it out this way,

00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:51.700
hopefully making this statement
a little bit more intuitive.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.690
Well, what is this going to be?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.302
Well, s sub seven, the sum
of the first seven terms,

00:01:58.302 --> 00:02:00.858
we just, wherever we see an
n, we replace it with a seven.

00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:04.839
So it's going to be
seven squared plus one,

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:09.006
over seven plus one and from
that we are going to subtract

00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:13.243
s sub six, the sum of the first six terms.

00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:17.561
Well, that's going to
be six squared plus one,

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.894
or six plus one.

00:02:21.414 --> 00:02:24.877
And from here we just have to
do a little bit of arithmetic.

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:28.167
So, this is going to be
seven squared plus one,

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:32.663
this is 49 plus one so
that is 50 over eight.

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:35.413
And this is six squared plus one,

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.366
that's 37,

00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:39.361
over seven.

00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:42.717
So, we want to find a common denominator

00:02:42.717 --> 00:02:44.922
between eight and seven.

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:47.022
That would be 56.

00:02:47.022 --> 00:02:50.439
So this is going to be something over 56,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.287
minus something else over 56.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:01.677
Now, to go from eight to
56 I multiply by seven,

00:03:01.677 --> 00:03:04.210
so I need to multiple the
numerator by seven as well.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.043
50 times seven is 350.

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:11.277
And then, this second fraction,
I multiple the denominator

00:03:11.277 --> 00:03:14.618
by eight to get to 56,
so I have to multiply

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:15.868
37 times eight.

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:19.996
Let's see 37 times eight is going to be

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:22.329
240 plus 56, so that is 296.

00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:30.075
And so this is going to be equal to--

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:34.242
so I have a denominator of
56, 350 minus 296 is 54.

00:03:36.648 --> 00:03:39.050
So, it's 54/56.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.545
And if we wanted to
reduce this a little bit,

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:45.338
before we rewrite it
maybe in a simpler form,

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:47.606
we're rewriting the same value.

00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:51.773
This would be, let's see, could
we write it as 27 over 28?

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:55.497
Let's see, is that about?

00:03:55.497 --> 00:03:58.458
Yep, that's about as
simplified as we can get.

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:02.896
There you go, that's what
a sub seven is, it's 27/28.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:04.949
The difference between the
sum of the first seven terms,

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.866
and the sum of the first six terms.
