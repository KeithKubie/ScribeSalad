00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
PHIL: The prize for the biggest
crystal is a lunch

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.900
with John and the TAs at Legal
Seafood, which I'm personally

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.016
very excited about.

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:40.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.490
NARRATOR: Today the students are
going to learn a totally

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.165
different technique,
recrystallization.

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.120
PHIL: Pesticides,
pharmaceuticals, food

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870
colorings, and products where
they have to produce tons per

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.510
year, recrystallization
is the key method.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.550
Yesterday you were working
with about 100

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.890
megs of each compound.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.975
Today, you're going to be
working with 2 grams.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:04.080
NARRATOR: But there's more on
the line than just getting

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.800
those 2 grams back.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.750
This is practice for next week's
crystal competition.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.010
If the students do well, they'll
have a better shot at

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.200
winning a free lunch with
the teaching staff.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.570
The first step in a
recrystallization is to choose

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.020
the right solvent.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.520
The students need a liquid that
will not dissolve the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
target molecule when it's cold,
but will dissolve it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.510
when it's hot.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.360
The students then dissolve the
sample in hot solvent and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.570
filter out any solid
impurities.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.220
Then they cool it down
in an ice bath.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.280
The target molecule should
crystallized out of solution

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.880
forming a pure solid.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.120
The impurities should
stay in the liquid.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.560
ANTHONY: Fresh.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.000
IKE: Yep.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.880
That's how we want it.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.690
Crystal clear.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.520
NARRATOR: Ike, Ethan, and
Anthony are having

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.270
no problems at all.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.840
ETHAN: Ain't nothing too hard
for an MIT chemist.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.675
NARRATOR: Hansol, Jason, and
Fred on the other hand--

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.815
HANSOL: I made like two,
actually three mistakes today.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.870
JASON: I've made so many
stupid mistakes today.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.090
HANSOL: Yeah, I didn't realize
it would heat that fast.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.250
FRED: Um, it exploded all over
the side of my flask.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.170
HANSOL: And then it exploded,
so then I had to start over.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.900
PAUL: It started sputtering
out and actually

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.530
it was kind of scary.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.190
Some of it almost like
hit me in the face.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.530
JASON: I've broken
a test tube.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.975
HANSOL: And then I put it
through a small funnel which

00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:16.590
was a total mistake.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.510
JASON: I put too much solvent
losing some product.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.595
HANSOL: The funnel,
I just dropped it.

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:22.860
So--

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
JASON: The yield on this
is almost nothing.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.470
NARRATOR: After filtering,
washing and drying, everyone

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.520
eventually makes it to the
final step, weighing the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.770
purified crystals.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.730
Getting 90% yield is the goal.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.180
That would be 1.8 grams of
the original crystal.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.570
LEALIA: So far my yield
says 1.9 grams.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.270
So I don't know if that's right
because there is only

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.475
supposed to be two grams.

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:48.640
JULIE: That's probably not going
to be that good because

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.080
that all I have.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.050
There were some problems with
filtering and then also

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.630
noticed trying to put the stuff
in the beginning, I

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.100
spilled it everywhere.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.130
YI-SHIUAN: Is it really pure?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.810
JULIE: 7%.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.160
LEALIA: 101% yield.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.410
JULIE: Good job.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.170
JASON: 3%.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.750
So besides 3% yield, my melting

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.000
point's almost perfect.

00:03:18.334 --> 00:03:20.990
NARRATOR: For some today,
a good start.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.540
For others--

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.560
JASON: 3% yield.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.220
You needed 90%.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.955
I only got 3%.

00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:30.530
NARRATOR: Not looking so
hot for next week.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.490
Tune in, and see how
it all unfolds.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.700
PHIL: Just make observations,
write down what could have

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.072
went wrong, what you could
do differently next time.

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:44.085
JASON: Not spill.

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:50.290
Sleep more beforehand so
I don't make mistakes.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.890
Not spill.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.290
PHIL: Take your vitamins.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.790
JASON: Not be an idiot.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.590
I don't know.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.923
