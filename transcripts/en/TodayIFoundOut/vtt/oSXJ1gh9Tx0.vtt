00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.220
Who is Craig from Craigslist?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.690
Craig Newmark is the Craig of Craigslist whose
estimated net worth as of 2010 was around

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.750
$400 million.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.689
This is in direct contrast to his financial
wealth during childhood, where his mother

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.800
struggled to support Craig and his brother,
Jeff, after the death of their father.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.039
Craig Alexander Newmark was born on December
6, 1952, in Morristown, New Jersey, to Joyce

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.039
and Lee Newmark.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.820
Lee worked as an insurance salesman but after
his death, Joyce had to move her two sons

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.239
into an apartment.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.030
Craig was only thirteen years old when his
father died.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.590
After graduating from Morristown High School
in 1971, Craig had earned enough scholarships

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.160
to fund his post-secondary education at Case
Western Reserve University.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.129
There, he received a Bachelor of Science degree
in 1975 and a Masters of Science degree in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.260
1977.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.510
With his new degrees, Craig landed himself
a job as a programmer with IBM for 17 years

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.100
– first in Boca Raton, Florida and then
in Detroit.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.570
In 1993 he moved to San Francisco to work
for Charles Schwab.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
It was here that he was introduced to the
internet, resulting in his development of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
Craigslist.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
Craigslist began as a simple e-mail distribution
list amongst friends in 1995.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.840
The majority of the earliest posts were posted
by Craig himself and were notices of social

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.350
events attractive to software and Internet
developers living and/or working in the San

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.160
Francisco Bay area.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.710
Thanks to word of mouth, the number of both
postings and subscribers grew rapidly and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.460
Newmark was surprised when people started
using the list for non-event postings, most

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.720
of which were to fill technical positions.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.880
This lead to the addition of a category for
“jobs”.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.700
Additional categories were added in response
to user demand.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.450
Ever growing in popularity, community members
demanded a web interface and thus the now

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.450
super popular website, Craigslist.org went
live.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.410
It was 1996.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.160
Fast forward to 1998, Newmark was still enjoying
a career as a software engineer, more specifically

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.870
a hardcore java programmer.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.680
Craigslist was still a hobby to him, but a
hobby with great perks.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.170
Through the site, he was getting himself invited
to the best parties for geeks and nerds out

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.170
there.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.680
In 1999, Craigslist was growing so fast that
it was incorporated as a private for-profit

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.060
company and Newmark stopped working as a software
engineer to work full-time running Craigslist.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.900
By April of 2000, there were nine Craigslist
employees working out of Newmark’s San Francisco

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.439
apartment, including Jim Buckmaster who joined
the company in January of 2000 as lead programmer

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.989
and CTO – chief technology officer.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.150
He contributed to the site’s multi-city
architecture, its search engine, discussion

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.689
forums, flagging system, self-posting process,
homepage design, personals categories and

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.530
best-of-Craigslist feature.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.970
In November of 2000 he was promoted to CEO
which is a position he still holds today.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.609
Over the next few years Craigslist expanded
rapidly to several cities throughout the world

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.349
and on August 1, 2004, they began doing something
they had never done before – charging a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.569
fee to post job openings in select cities.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.980
On the Los Angeles and New York pages it cost
$25 per job posting.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.670
That very same day, a new Craigslist section
called “Gigs” was added.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.249
In the “Gigs” section, low-cost and unpaid
jobs and internships can be posted for free.

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:22.110
As of August 9, 2012, over 700 cities in 70
countries have Craigslist sites, with the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.170
website serving over 20 billion page views,
80 million new classified advertisements,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.079
and 2 million new job posting listings each
month, making it the leading classifieds service

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.010
and one of the top job boards in the world.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
If Craigslist is free for most everybody,
then how in the world does it make any money?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.739
Its main source of revenue is still primarily
from the paid job ads in select cities.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.930
It charges $75 per ad in San Francisco and
$25 per ad in New York, Los Angeles and now

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.719
San Diego, Boston, Seattle, Washington, D.C.,
Chicago, Philadelphia, Orange County in California,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.889
and Portland, Oregon.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.150
It also charges $10 per paid broker apartment
listing ad in New York City.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.730
This might not sound like much, but despite
being one of the biggest websites in the world,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.599
the company today only has a little over 30
employees and the estimated revenue that they

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:34.200
bring in annually from those small percentage
of paid posts is a gross of about $130 million

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:47.390
as 
of 2012, with about $100 million of that being

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.900
profit… so, they’re doing alright.
