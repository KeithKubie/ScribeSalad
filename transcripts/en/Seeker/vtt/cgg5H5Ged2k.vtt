00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.640
Allergies turn your own body against you over
something stupid like strawberries.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.150
We've got to be able to stop that.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.330
Anthony here for Dnews and allergies suck.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.660
There is no more annoying reminder of how
fragile the human body really is than getting

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.099
laid up in bed because a pollen or peanut
dust.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.529
And while there's everything from over-the-counter
pills to epi pens to help mitigate the symptoms,

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.519
we've never been able to knock out allergies
entirely.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.510
But thanks to some researchers over at Johns
Hopkins, we just got crazy close to eliminating

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.920
these things once and for all.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.219
So allergies basically occur when your immune
system thinks that something normal is a threat.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.149
It makes these antibodies called Immunoglobulin
E to protect you from things that cause illness.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.980
An allergic person's body makes way too much
in it.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.420
These antibodies that bind to mast cells and
together they absorb chemicals from your blood

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.239
that are helpful in fighting invasion.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.300
When something like pollen gets into an allergic
person's bloodstream, it sticks to the antibodies

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.760
and the mast cells release all those chemicals,
like histamine.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.910
That's the one that gives you all the itchy,
runny nose, can't breathe, swelling up sorta

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.330
reactions, which is why allergy medicines
are antihistamines.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.920
Allergies can also change over time.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.590
So maybe you weren't lactose intolerant when
you were younger but now, whoops, no more

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.840
ice cream for you.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.680
Or maybe you could never have ice cream and
now you're totally good,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
but why?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.450
As always, it's genes.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.452
If one of your parents is allergic to something,
your chance of having some kind of allergy

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:34.250
is about 50 percent.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.770
Two allergic parents, seventy to eighty percent.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.840
But other factors come into play: pollution
in the environment, your diet, even your emotional

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.380
health, which makes it sound like someone
that epigenetic stuff we've been talking about

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.380
lately right?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.220
Like maybe every allergy is connected to some
specific gene sequence and environmental trigger.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.880
Well the team at Johns Hopkins just found
out that no!

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.500
One single genetic pathway is responsible
for a huge number of common food and environmental

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
allergies.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.840
One stupid protein called TGF-beta, is causing
all of our problems.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.130
Now TGF-beta controls how cells in your vital
organs grow and how they communicate with

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.130
each other.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.980
Faulty signaling from it has been known to
cause connective tissue disorders.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.150
But here's what's awesome.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.010
See right now, a lot of people are using expensive
prescription medicine or injections to treat

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.010
allergies,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.200
but high TFG-beta signaling can be treated
with something called Losartan, which is a

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.530
very old simple drug that's been used for
years to control high blood pressure.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.730
Now more study has to be done, of course,
but how awesome is that?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.190
If your body wants to make something simple
like cat hair deadly, well then you can use

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.920
something simple to get it back in line.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.900
And in the future just like anything genetic,
we might be able to nip this in the bud and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.640
use some sort of gene therapy or future medication
to change the way TGF-beta works in our bodies

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.200
entirely and say goodbye to allergies forever!

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.630
That's pretty cool.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.040
You guys have any allergies?
