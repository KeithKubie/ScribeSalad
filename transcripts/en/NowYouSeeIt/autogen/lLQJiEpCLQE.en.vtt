00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
 Start 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:02.880
 Think about it 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.780
 what is this 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.920
 circle 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.880
 Almost 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.540
 But still wrong 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.340
 Now let's take a look at two shapes 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.800
 Left and right 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.580
 Which shape is more suitable for "Bouba"? 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.320
 Which is more suitable for "Kiki"? 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.860
 About 98% think the shape on the left is Kiki and the one on the right is Bouda. 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.660
 And the results have nothing to do with the region and age. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.080
 The results of experiments in different language cultures are consistent. 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.100
 Then, what does this mean? 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 From this research, we can understand 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.020
 How does the brain go in a unified way? 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.140
 Give abstract meaning to different shapes. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.600
 And how the directors used this discovery to tell their story. 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.980
 The best practice is naturally in animation. 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.100
 In animation, the painter can create objects and characters with whatever shape they want. 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.280
 Let's start with the simplest shape: 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.540
 Circles, squares and triangles. 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.580
 It looks very simple, but these graphics can express far more than you think. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.180
 Evil characters are like Kiki 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.100
 Their shapes are relatively sharp 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 A pointed nose with long, curved fingers. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 And the cute image is designed to be the same as Bouda. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 Soft, round. 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.720
 Is it that the name of the uninhibited character in the animation is Baloo is just a coincidence? 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.980
 I think these are the embodiment of intuition. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.520
 Our brain has always been more threatening to think of sharp things. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.280
 "The top is too round and should be sharp." 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.860
 "There is no deterrent of the circle" 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.260
 "The sharp point is scary" 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.380
 You see, these three circles draw the best and best known animated characters. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.860
 At the same time, I also noticed that evil characters are just a combination of various triangles. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.320
 Slightly touch up 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.180
 This way you can express your emotions in a way that is not easily noticeable. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.640
 I have always seen it in my favorite movie clips. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 When we saw the weird bad guys turn from Kiki to round, the weak Bouba 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.760
 You might think that this only applies to animations. 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.660
 But it is a coincidence that Das Vaderâ€™s mask has this shape, 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 And the main dark helmet, Darth Vader's cartoon comedy and imitation, 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.900
 Have this shape? 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.740
 One of the sharpest villains is the Sleeping Curse. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.360
 They even tried to keep the sharp chin and eyebrows in the real remake. 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.500
 In other words, do you use "party" to describe what someone wants to express? 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.800
 This means they are bored or they are out of date. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.780
 But "square" also implies that it is solid and stable. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.680
 Deja vu? 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 The square is rigid and not easy to change. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.520
 If the development of the situation is not what they envision, they are likely to be a little angry. 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.740
 "You are looking for it, try this!" 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.380
 "Ah, ah, ah ah ah!!!" 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.280
 If you really want to look at the abstract 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 The movie world behind a rectangular camera lens. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 Many important geometric shapes come from the picture. 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.880
 The most noteworthy framing is probably picture-in-picture 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.820
 This technique is used to represent an image trapped in an existing situation. 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.620
 *Various car speakers* 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
 Another unfamiliar but equally important picture-in-picture framing method is a circular viewfinder. 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.040
 Brings a geometric impression of surveillance and spying. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 *noise* 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.840
 Going further than picture-in-picture, you can use lines to create visual prisons in the picture. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.880
 Whether it's an office in a blind or a computer screen, 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.960
 The combination of vertical and horizontal lines implies that a character is his or her existing lifestyle. 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.280
 Prisoners and slaves. 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.500
 These lenses use geometric vision as a means of storytelling. 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.420
 "From the time I remembered, I always wanted to be a robber." 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.120
 We didn't even notice that there were lines everywhere in the picture. 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.540
 Geometry is everywhere, obeying the same principles. 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.600
 The balance of power that triangles can emphasize, 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.720
 Linear screens can show physical separation, 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.680
 Or a straight line can guide our sight. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.200
 So, the next time you watch a favorite movie, you can try to analyze the geometric layout of the picture and the characters. 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.880
 If you do this, you are in good shape. 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.600
 "What about this?" 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.780
 "Several lines of wavy lines?..." 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.640
 "Sorry." 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.180
 "This is not your lucky day!" 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.100
 Thanks for watching. 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.760
 First of all, thanks to Good Blood, I got the inspiration for making this film from his amazing crash kangaroo video. highly recommended!
