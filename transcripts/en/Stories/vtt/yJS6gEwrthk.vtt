00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.870
INTERVIEWER: So the
Egyptian military recently

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.760
announced that it's building
a number of fish farms

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.980
right on the border with Gaza.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.940
That seems like a weird
thing for Egypt to be doing

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.390
and an even weirder
place to be doing it.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.350
And weirder still, Egypt
sees the fish farms

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.500
as part of their
counter-terrorism strategy.

00:00:21.174 --> 00:00:22.590
As you might have
guessed, there's

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.180
a lot more going on here.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.990
The site of the
future fisheries is

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.640
Rafah, a town that
sits half in Egypt

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.030
and a half in the Gaza Strip.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.189
The border cuts right
down the middle.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.380
That border became a
very big deal in 2007

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.560
when the organization
Hamas took control of Gaza.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.200
Hamas' military arm was a big
security concern for both Egypt

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.440
and Israel, and both
countries basically

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.870
closed their borders with Gaza.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.870
This has meant a severe
blockade of the Gaza Strip.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.290
The flow of goods in and
out is extremely limited.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.960
For Gazans, the blockade has
inspired some creativity,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.870
namely a network of secret
tunnels between the Gazan

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.480
and Egyptian sides of Rafah.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.510
The tunnels have been used to
smuggle in all manner of goods

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.520
from fuel, construction
materials, and tools

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980
to dry foods, cigarettes,
and livestock.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.079
It's been a big
industry for years

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.120
with some estimates placing
the number of tunnels

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.870
in the thousands.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.970
Depending on who
you ask, the tunnels

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.380
are either a godsend or a curse.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
Israel has called them
arteries of terror out of fear

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950
that they're helping
weapons get to Hamas.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.690
Hamas, on the other hand,
happily collects taxes

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.690
on anything passing
through the tunnels

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.520
and has admitted to getting
weapons that way too.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.540
And then there's Egypt.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.450
The Egyptian military has long
feared that the tunnels could

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.090
allow terrorists to
sneak across the border

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.240
and has done a lot shutter them.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.920
In 2009, they built
an underground wall

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.960
almost 60 feet deep
beneath the crossing.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.590
Smugglers breached
it within a year.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.410
In 2013, they pumped raw
sewage into the tunnels.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.440
Smugglers presumably
plugged their noses.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.810
And then, this past
August, the military

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.760
began construction of the fish
farms, which sounds ridiculous,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.450
except that it involved pumping
untold gallons of seawater

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.560
into the border area, which
utterly swamped the tunnel

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.370
system.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.570
According to one
anonymous tunnel builder,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.190
the result was devastating.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.630
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.130
SUBJECT 1 INTERPRETER:
They have destroyed

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.540
everything in 20 days.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.510
During the 50-day war,
the Israeli rockets

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.800
couldn't do such a thing,
and 10 days after the war,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.870
we were able to get
this business back.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.290
But now we are unable to
get our businesses back.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.862
All the tunnels have collapsed.

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:34.820
INTERVIEWER: The ruination
of the tunnel system

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.130
is great news for the Egyptian
military, bad news for Hamas,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.310
but maybe the worst news of
all for the Gazan people.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.800
Legal or otherwise, the tunnels
were an employer in Rafah

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.950
and an important release
valve for the pressures

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.380
of the blockade.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.640
All of that may be gone
now, which is really

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.770
just the latest in a
series of hardships

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.880
for the residents of Rafah.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.330
Most of them are refugees
and their families

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.920
displaced from Israel
as long ago as 1948.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.280
Many were separated
from family and friends

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.690
when the border split
the town in two.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.190
And they've seen
homes and buildings

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.190
demolished by
Israel in an attempt

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.040
to route out the tunnels.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.030
Now those tunnels
are gone, and they're

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.690
left wondering
just what is going

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.536
on across that border in Egypt.

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:20.660

SUBJECT 2 (INTERPETER):
We respect our neighbors.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.180
We love the Egyptians,
because we are connected,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.940
and we are relatives.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.920
But our neighbors are
making our lives harder.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.702
They have caused
us a lot of damage.

INTERVIEWER: To see the fallout
from another very different

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.010

This is a satellite image of
Perang, Indonesia in 2004.

This is that same place in 2008.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.860
What happened in
between those two photos

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.520
wasn't an earthquake
or a typhoon,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.990
it was one of the most
mysterious natural disasters

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.880
