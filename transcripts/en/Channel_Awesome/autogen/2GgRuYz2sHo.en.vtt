00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:43.670 align:start position:0%
was I that that Mel's a little a little
 

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.020 align:start position:0%
was I that that Mel's a little a little
goofy<00:14:44.470><c> but</c><00:14:45.470><c> the</c><00:14:45.620><c> most</c><00:14:46.250><c> pros</c><00:14:46.520><c> done</c><00:14:46.700><c> pretty</c><00:14:46.910><c> well</c>

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
goofy but the most pros done pretty well
 

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.579 align:start position:0%
goofy but the most pros done pretty well
and<00:14:47.450><c> nothing</c><00:14:47.630><c> probably</c><00:14:48.050><c> looked</c><00:14:48.170><c> as</c><00:14:48.290><c> good</c><00:14:48.470><c> as</c>

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:48.589 align:start position:0%
and nothing probably looked as good as
 

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:50.410 align:start position:0%
and nothing probably looked as good as
the<00:14:48.740><c> Kurt</c><00:14:48.920><c> Russell</c><00:14:49.280><c> one</c><00:14:49.430><c> in</c><00:14:49.610><c> guardians</c><00:14:50.180><c> to</c><00:14:50.390><c> I</c>

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:50.420 align:start position:0%
the Kurt Russell one in guardians to I
 

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
the Kurt Russell one in guardians to I
think<00:14:50.750><c> that's</c><00:14:50.900><c> probably</c><00:14:51.110><c> the</c><00:14:51.230><c> most</c><00:14:51.350><c> solid</c><00:14:51.800><c> one</c>

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.030 align:start position:0%
think that's probably the most solid one
 

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
think that's probably the most solid one
but<00:14:53.030><c> but</c><00:14:53.180><c> this</c><00:14:53.540><c> look</c><00:14:53.720><c> pretty</c><00:14:53.900><c> pretty</c><00:14:54.560><c> damn</c>

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
but but this look pretty pretty damn
 

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%

like I said the action with the idea
 

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
like I said the action with the idea
that<00:15:28.710><c> they're</c><00:15:28.890><c> big</c><00:15:29.070><c> they're</c><00:15:29.250><c> small</c><00:15:29.490><c> they're</c>

big they're small they have the same
 

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.490 align:start position:0%
big they're small they have the same
power<00:15:32.700><c> and</c><00:15:32.970><c> in</c><00:15:33.600><c> fact</c><00:15:33.750><c> it's</c><00:15:33.960><c> magnified</c><00:15:34.470><c> like</c>

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
power and in fact it's magnified like
 

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.410 align:start position:0%
power and in fact it's magnified like
their<00:15:34.830><c> punches</c><00:15:35.130><c> can</c><00:15:35.370><c> be</c><00:15:35.790><c> even</c><00:15:36.090><c> more</c><00:15:36.120><c> when</c>

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
their punches can be even more when
 

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
their punches can be even more when
they're<00:15:36.570><c> smaller</c><00:15:36.810><c> I</c><00:15:36.900><c> mean</c><00:15:37.200><c> it's</c><00:15:37.410><c> like</c><00:15:37.530><c> that's</c>

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:37.770 align:start position:0%
they're smaller I mean it's like that's
 

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
they're smaller I mean it's like that's
such<00:15:38.040><c> a</c><00:15:38.220><c> great</c><00:15:38.760><c> idea</c><00:15:39.090><c> and</c><00:15:39.600><c> I</c><00:15:39.690><c> feel</c><00:15:39.900><c> like</c><00:15:40.110><c> you</c>

is<00:15:43.020><c> there</c><00:15:43.200><c> with</c><00:15:43.440><c> making</c><00:15:43.860><c> these</c><00:15:43.980><c> action</c>

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.490 align:start position:0%
is there with making these action
 

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.340 align:start position:0%
is there with making these action
sequences<00:15:44.610><c> just</c><00:15:45.000><c> amazing</c><00:15:45.840><c> like</c><00:15:45.990><c> you</c><00:15:46.140><c> could</c>

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.350 align:start position:0%
sequences just amazing like you could
 

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.740 align:start position:0%
sequences just amazing like you could
not<00:15:46.590><c> do</c><00:15:47.250><c> these</c><00:15:47.430><c> action</c><00:15:47.880><c> sequences</c><00:15:48.030><c> like</c><00:15:48.480><c> 30</c>

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:48.750 align:start position:0%
not do these action sequences like 30
 

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.990 align:start position:0%
not do these action sequences like 30
years<00:15:48.990><c> ago</c><00:15:49.350><c> and</c><00:15:49.680><c> I</c><00:15:50.190><c> think</c><00:15:50.400><c> that</c><00:15:50.760><c> that's</c>

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
