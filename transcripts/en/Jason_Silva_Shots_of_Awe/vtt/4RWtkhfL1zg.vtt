00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.240
So you know, I
think that there's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.910
few things more primal than
the urge to communicate,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.766
the pull towards intimacy,
towards merger with the other,

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.890
a way of almost
smashing, or isolating,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.570
and debilitating sense
of individuation.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.070
We feel so separate from
everything and everyone,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.410
so alienated from ourselves
and from other people.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.980
And this urge to communicate--
or as Terence McKenna says,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.800
this urge to language--
is an ecstatic activity

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.570
of signification.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.750
It is a way of saying we
are here and we exist.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.486
It is a way of affirming
our own existence.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.349
And through these developing
communication technologies

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.020
that started with crude
grunts as early hominids that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.530
evolved into language and
ecstatic cave paintings

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.065
that eventually evolved into
the alphabet and writing,

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:21.760
it was this urge to telepathy,
to experience a technologically

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.810
mediated telepathy,
to share minds,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.400
to share mind spaces
with one another;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.740
and this is known by
David [? Porish ?]

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.660
as intersubjectivity and the
ecstasy of communication.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.700
Intersubjectivity, like two
strands of DNA, human beings,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.760
get coiled up in one
another when they have sex,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
when they proclaim their
love with language,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.650
when they take pictures and make
ecstatic paintings and compose

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.220
songs to put each other
in one another's world.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.410
Perhaps the cinema is
the best technology

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.620
thus far to allow us to
share dream spaces together.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.640
But this urge to
merge ultimately

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.130
is about a desire for intimacy.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.985
It's a cry.

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.920
It's a manic,
existential agitation,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.320
a desire to become one.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.360
That is its origin.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.560
That is where it comes from.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.282
We are travelers,
[? hermonauts, ?] in search

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:16.990
of signification.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:23.645
That, that is our condition.
