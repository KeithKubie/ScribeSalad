00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.390
How to start your targeted resume.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.440
First, select the job
that interests you, and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.330
a corresponding job description.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.110
Before starting a targeted resume,
you want to make sure you have a strong

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.260
understanding of the position and
what the employer is looking for.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.550
This requires looking at big and
small scale themes and

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.900
patterns within the job description.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.130
When reading a posting,
I like to ask myself questions like,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310
what are the core features of this job?

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.780
What keywords are used?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.430
Are any technical skills highlighted?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.200
Any soft skills mention?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.830
Finally, you'll want to
think about your audience.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.580
To the best of your ability answer the
questions, who will be interviewing you?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.980
What are they looking for that's
not written on the job description?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.770
What do I need to consider about
the organizational culture to construct

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.280
my resume?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.300
Did you come up with any
additional questions?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Add them to the forum.
