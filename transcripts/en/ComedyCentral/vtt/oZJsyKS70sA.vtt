 (jazz music)

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:07.640 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Okay, well, we
 want a subtle queef

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.510
 because we're coming in full
 queef and want it to be like,

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.445 size:88% position:44%
  "Was that a fart,
  or did she queef?"

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:13.713
And then later on in the episode

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.581 size:88% position:44%
  we find out that
  she queefed, okay?

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:18.818 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, subtle, subtle,
subtle, subtle, subtle,

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.521
barely a queef type queef, okay?

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.723
 All right, thank you.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:24.924
 Okay, bye bye.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:28.061 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Dude, I'm so
  pumped to be here.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:31.364 align:start position:0%
 - Hooray, I'm freaking
 pumped that you're here, man.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:33.499 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Thanks for letting
 me come down.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:36.202
 I'm so pumped to do audience
 warm-up for the shows, man.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.770 size:88% position:44%
 - You murdered last season.

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.541
 I especially love that joke
 that you do about the dorms.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.942 size:84% position:42%
  You can't be in
  the dorms anymore

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.244 size:88% position:44%
 because everybody
 jerks off together.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:46.546 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.713
 That's funny.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:49.348 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Thanks for the
compliment, but that was

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.317
actually Pete Davidson.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:54.020 size:88% position:44%
  - That wasn't you?

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.658 size:84% position:42%
  Well, you're here, right?

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.293 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.694
 - Might as well do it.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.030 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think you were
probably good last year.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.832 align:start position:0%
  - I got to be honest, man,
  I know New Orleans is a

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.303
 dope place to do the show, but
 it's not all that happening.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.839
 There's nobody on the streets.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.109 size:84% position:42%
  It's pretty dead.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.143
 - Yeah, man.

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.414 size:84% position:42%
  It's pretty dead.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.585 align:start position:0%
  - Ladies and gentlemen,
  make it loud, New Orleans!

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.420 size:84% position:42%
  Adam Devine, give
  it up, come on!

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.754
 This is what it's all about.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:29.589
 - Cheers, man.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:30.457 size:88% position:44%
 Oh!

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Our first comic
 coming to the stage is

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.228 size:88% position:44%
  so, so, so, so, so, so, so

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.129
(sniffs)

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.130 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.364 size:84% position:42%
  so funny!

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.634
 - I'm looking for the
 ultimate dick joke.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.102 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
- A difficult place to do
cocaine is an air hockey table.

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.608
 - Yeah, that's where
 I like to take it.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.810 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.779
 - Why is your hair so poofy?

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.149 size:88% position:44%
 (pop music)

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.523
(yells)

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.129
- Hello!

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.798
 Have you seen my friend, Adam?

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.900
 Adam Devine.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.869
- Oh, that's the
Workaholics guy!

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.072
(laughs)

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:22.976
- Help!

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.913 size:88% position:44%
  (distorted voices)

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:30.616 size:88% position:44%
 (pop music)

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.885 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.688
(exhales slowly)

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.764 size:84% position:42%
  (exhales sharply)

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.041 size:88% position:44%
 (pop music)

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.943 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I can't even walk into
Abercrombie and Fitch

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.478
 without a guy going,
 "Hi, are you lost?"

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.848 size:84% position:42%
  - Half orangutan,
  half beast-man.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:04.717 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.987 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Welcome to Adam
 Devine's House Party!

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.892 size:88% position:44%
  - [Adam] It's pretty dead.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.501
 - Who are you looking at, man?

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:25.638
 Look, I'm gonna go get
 ready for the shows

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.241
and we'll kick it later, right?

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:32.612
 I'll see you tonight?

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.317 size:88% position:44%
  Just text me when you're--

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:41.254 size:84% position:42%
  when you want to kick it.
