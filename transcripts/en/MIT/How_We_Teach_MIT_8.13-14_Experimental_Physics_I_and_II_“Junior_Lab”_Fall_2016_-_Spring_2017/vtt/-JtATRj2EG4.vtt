JANET CONRAD: So
in 8.13, the way

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880
that we assess student
learning, one of the ways

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.887
that we assess student learning
is for them to give talks that

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.220
are the kind of talk that you
would give at the American

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.079
Physical Society meeting.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.500
It's a little bit different.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.320
We give them three
extra minutes than what

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.466
you would have in the American
Physical Society meeting.

00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.840
Nevertheless, it's very hard
to squeeze everything you've

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.224
learned into a 15 minute talk.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:28.890
And what we're looking
for in the talks,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.265
we're looking for
several things.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:34.350
We're looking for how well
they understand the content.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
And how will they communicate
the content, both visually

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.860
and also verbally.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.570
And so those are
the three things

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.730
that we're really
trying to hit on as we

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.300
grade them related to the talk.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.790
So the students will end
up giving four talks.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.210
The first talk is on the
early set of experiments

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.840
that they have.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.030
So they do three short
experiments, just

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.010
to learn a lot about
how the equipment works,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.077
how statistics works,
things along those lines.

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:02.910
And they choose one of
those to give a talk.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.440
And that talk doesn't count.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.910
So it's an opportunity
to find out

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.682
what it is like to give
a talk and to find out

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.890
how I'm going to be responding,
the kind of questions

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.700
that I'm going to
ask at the end,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.760
and how we're going to go
back through everything

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.220
and take it all apart and see
if we can put it back together.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.720
Then they have three long
labs that they have done.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.150
And one of those
three long labs will

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.370
be the subject of
their final talk

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.590
that they give at
our mini conference.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.550
And so, in the three talks that
they give, what we're doing

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.284
is we are not just checking
all of the information

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.700
that they've learned to make
sure that they understand all

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.360
of the physics and so forth.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.560
We're also helping them
rethink those talks

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.530
so that they can then
give an even better talk

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.060
at the mini conference.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.830
And so I'm doing that.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.430
I always do this with my TA.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.950
So there's two of
us in the room.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.400
And the lab partners are
together in the room.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.510
One person gives
the 15 minute talk.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.260
And then as we go back
through, the other lab partner

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.330
writes down all of the
comments that we have.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.650
So that the other lab partner
can give the first one,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.190
the one that was giving the
talk, all of our information.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.870
So that they can
make the changes.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.740
And so this seems
to work really well.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.870
And they will also work
very closely with Atissa,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.670
our communications person.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.480
And she also goes through
the talks with them.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.950
We videotape them.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.140
So she can see the
videotape and then

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.050
she can go through the
videotape with the students.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.420
And that really helps to
make the mini conference

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.070
talk really good also.
