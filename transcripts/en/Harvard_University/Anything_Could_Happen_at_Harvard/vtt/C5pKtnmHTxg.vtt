I apologized to him when I handed him
this 40-some-odd page document.

00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:20.667
I just said,
“I don’t think I did what you wanted.

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:22.300
I was supposed to write a one-act play...

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.900
and this is clearly the first act
of a three-act movie.”

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:28.033
He was unbelievably encouraging.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.267
He gave me a flat “A” in the class,
which was a big deal.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.667
He wrote extensively in the margins–

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:37.467
or on a cover page that he put on it–

00:12:37.533 --> 00:12:40.367
to “please keep up with this”–

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:43.100
that it was worthy,
that it was good...

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.600
that it wasn’t anything
close to a failure...

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:48.200
that it was something I had to pursue.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:50.967
So I showed it to Ben Affleck,
and the rest is history.

I didn’t plan to end up in the food business.

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:03.000
I started, right after graduation,
working for a consulting firm.

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:05.600
I left the consulting firm
and got a job at a restaurant...

00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:07.167
and then I fell in love with it.

00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:10.367

and opened a bakery.

When I got to Harvard as a freshman–

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:19.700
I’d always been kind of a math geek
in high school...

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:23.533
so, to me, it seemed natural
to kind of fall into math.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.900

that I didn’t even know existed...

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.867
that I could possibly be interested in.

00:14:28.933 --> 00:14:32.900

trying to make sure that all of its offerings...
