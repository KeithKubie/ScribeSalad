00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.320
What did you decide on, David?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.569
&gt;&gt; So for the first sentence,

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.110
my background knowledge tells me that
the numbers 3 and 5 aren't objects.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.280
They aren't destinations, they aren't
locations, they aren't targets.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.720
They're just numbers.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.160
Of all these frames,
the only one that's looking for

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.110
just numbers is the frame, to subtract.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.228
So I choose take8 as the meaning for
the first sentence.

00:00:19.228 --> 00:00:22.742
So for the second sentence, my
background knowledge tells me first that

00:00:22.742 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm an agent, that my briefcase is an
object, and that work is a destination.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.464
So if I then try to map those three
things to their various different

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.433
categories here, I find that
the only one that works is take2.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:38.330
I am an agent, my briefcase is
an object, and work is a destination.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.110
So the third sentence a good
bit more complicated.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.190
I still know that I am an agent, I know
that the casino is a place of business,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.090
and the $5 million could be
considered a prize or an object.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.669
So that gets me down to take6 or take7.

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:56.180
Take6 is to steal, take7 is to cheat or
swindle, which are subtly different.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.000
But my background knowledge
of the idea of source

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.330
said that sources were usually
indicated by the preposition, from.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.980
If I took $5 million from the casino,
then the casino would be a source.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.680
But I don't have from in
front of the casino here, so

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620
I'm not going to regard it as a source.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.740
Instead I'm going to go with take7.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.650
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting analysis,
David.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.520
Thank you.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
First of all,
congratulations on becoming rich.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.540
I didn't know that you were going to
become rich teaching this course.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.970
Of course, there are several
other points to note here.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.680
One point is that you have a lot of
background knowledge associated with

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.380
the word for, perhaps because you are a
native speaker of the English language.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.133
Not everyone may associate the same kind
of background knowledge with for and

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.491
may not be able to disambiguate
between these two.

00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:41.697
&gt;&gt; That actually gets to an underlying
element of the problem as well,

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:44.730
that these two meanings
are themselves very similar.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.420
So it makes sense that it's more
difficult to disambiguate between very

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200
similar meanings than
disambiguating between stealing and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.680
medicating, for example.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.035
&gt;&gt; Another point to note here is that
although we have been discussing about

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:56.340
stories that are in
the English language,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.600
this kind of analysis
applies to all languages.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.070
Note also that so far we have been using
sentences in the English language, but

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.830
actually this kind of analysis works in
respect to the language we are using.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.410
So I'm originally from India and
my mother tongue is Hindi.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.670
And we can write the sentences in Hindi,
and the same kind of analysis will

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.210
work that is working here for
the word take in English.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.230
This raises a few questions.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.950
Might this kind of analysis work for

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.860
translation from one language
to another language?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.870
If the different languages have similar
kind of structures, then this analysis

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.840
might help us translate sentences from
one language to another language.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.150
Here's another question.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.900
Do all languages have the same kind
of structure that enables mind to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.180
make use of the structure of the
sentences to disambiguate between verbs?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.430
&gt;&gt; Feel free to take up that
discussion over on our forums,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.330
especially if you yourself don't
speak English as a first language.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.200
You might be particularly aware of the
different structures present in English

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.790
compared to whatever
language you speak natively.
