00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.203
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here my inputs are 4, 1, 4 and 5. So I list this here. I don't need to list

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:12.133
this 4 twice so I'm going to erase this one. My outputs are 3, 2, 5 and negative

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:18.399
1. I draw my arrows to represent the ordered pairs. 4 is with 3, 1 is with 2, 4

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:23.602
is with 5, and 5 is with negative 1. Notice that I have an input leading to two

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:28.498
outputs. So this first one is definitely not a function. We can see this more

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:33.322
easily because the input repeats. If the input repeats, then that means it

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:38.580
produces two different outputs which we know can't be true. So, if we have one

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.487
x-value producing two different y-values, we know it's not a function. Here's a

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:50.423
mapping diagram for the second set. The arrows indicate the ordered pairs, and I

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:55.714
see that each input corresponds to exactly one output. So yes, this is a

00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:56.545
function.
