00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:03.602
(beeping)

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:08.498
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.630
Bipedal.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.890
Naked.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.923
Large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.703
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.873
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.883
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.800
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.693
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.210
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.713
and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.970
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.693
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:24.760
(ambient music)

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.167
(uptempo music)

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.440
- I do study chimpanzees in a savanna

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.273
and I'd like to tell you

00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:46.660
a little bit more about that site

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.480
because it does have a lot of

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.820
importance as far as the
chimpanzees' hunting behavior goes.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.700
And this map I will show you,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.210
most of the long-term
chimpanzee study sites

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.790
operating today, not all of them,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.910
but these sites most
of them here have been

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.530
ongoing for at least 10 years

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.810
and in some cases and the
case of Gombe and Mahale

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.060
more than 50 years.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.090
And so, most of you are probably
familiar with Jane Goodall

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.610
and at least the person,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.170
but Gombe is the site that
she helped to establish

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.440
that Ian talked about.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.060
I'm across the continent

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.730
and I'm over in West Africa,

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.250
this is my site, the Fongoli study site.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.600
And I chose this site
because it is in a savanna

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.143
and we think that our lineage,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.520
evolutionarily speaking
evolved in this type of habitat

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.594
and so, I'll show you
some images from the site.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.280
My underlying questions have to do with

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.780
how these chimpanzees differ

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.520
from chimpanzees living in forests,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.100
like the chimps we've heard about before

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.880
and in Goualougo and in Gombe.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.950
And I will cite Jim Moore here,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890
he's written a lot about using chimpanzees

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.550
as what we call a referential model

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.210
and that is comparing them to

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.707
chimpanzees living in a forested site.

00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:05.660
And the assumption is that
the environment will have

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.100
effects on their behavior.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.760
And I did think this going in,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.060
I had ideas about what
the differences might be

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.160
and the chimps kind of went their own way

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.100
and showed me a lot more
differences including hunting,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.223
and so I'll talk to you about that today.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.810
So though I'm going to talk
about three main questions

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.030
and I focus on the types of hunting

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.660
or aspects of the Fongoli
chimpanzees' hunting

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.450
that you don't necessarily
see at other sites

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.083
or that are very rare.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.230
And so one of the things
that we see here commonly

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.423
is that chimpanzees hunt with tools

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:42.060
and that's something that we
use to define our own species.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.070
It has been seen literally
a handful of times

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.030
at another site in Tanzania

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.020
but at Fongoli chimpanzees
do this quite frequently

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.780
so we've seen hundreds of cases now

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.480
and I'll talk to you more about that.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.140
So one of the questions that I'll touch on

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.573
is why hunt with tools in
this particular habitat?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.720
Something else that is not really common

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.640
at other chimpanzee
sites is that in fact in

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.050
regarding this particular type of hunting,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.310
females are more frequently going to be

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.500
those hunting with
tools compared to males,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.890
and as we heard that's just not the case

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.710
in most other chimpanzee study sites

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.563
so I'll talk more about that.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.160
And then to follow up with David's talk

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.960
I will talk about meat sharing

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.100
or I use the word sharing

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.500
and I'll talk about how I define that,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.263
but I'll specifically talk
about how females dole out meat.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.890
And then finally I'll come
back to this idea about

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.490
using chimpanzees as a model

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.470
and what perhaps the Fongoli
chimpanzees that I study

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.510
can help us say or think about in terms of

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.663
the evolution of early hominin
or bipedal ape hunting.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.600
So these are some images
from my study site,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.530
the Fongoli study site
is one of the hottest,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.530
driest and most vegetatively
open sites that you see today

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.270
where chimpanzees have
actually been habituated

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.670
to a human presence.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.230
So this took us quite a long time,

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.300
it took us four years.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.080
I started in 2001 and we
habituated males to our presence

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.160
by 2005 but I wasn't able to identify

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.240
all the chimpanzees in
the group until 2006.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.660
That's when we identified all the females,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.100
this is a view of my
pretty fancy camp there.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.300
And hopefully that gives you
some idea of the vegetation.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.020
So it's a woodland savanna,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.430
the dominant understory
is grass the savanna

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.260
but you do have a large proportion

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.760
of the habitat as woodlands.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.850
Over half of the habitat is woodland

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.130
and only a very small portion is forest,

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.210
about 3% of the habitat is forest

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.400
and this is where you
find your water sources.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.220
This is really the chimpanzees'
most limiting resource

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.700
at Fongoli is water.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.540
Temperatures are incredibly hot,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.890
really hot for me, even hot for chimps.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.940
So right now we're, well,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.700
yeah, the month of March in Senegal is

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.670
almost approaching the
peak of the dry season

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.160
so temperatures are regularly
over a hundred degrees.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.440
They may get up to 115 or so.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.710
During the rainy season

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.320
or at least at the beginning
of the rainy season

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.250
you find some relief

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.180
because the trees will
put out leaves again.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.660
They lose all their trees
during the dry season.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.070
But yet you have this lag,
you have hot temperatures

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.540
and then you have this high
humidity which is really fun.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
And so, literally the heat
index in June is around 120, 125

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.729
and that's when I take students out.

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.350
(audience laughing)

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.683
So a little bit about
the Fongoli study group.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.250
Within this particular habitat

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.410
they have a very large
home range, 110 kilometers,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.600
which is one of the largest

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.920
if not the largest so far described.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.920
The community size is relatively small,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.380
it's not the smallest
chimpanzee community studied

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.040
but it's on the small
size, around 35 chimps.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.770
And importantly we have
a sex ratio that is

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.760
sort of the opposite of
what you see at other sites.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.310
So we have more males than females,

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.510
that's usually not the case.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.900
And the data that I'm
gonna talk about today

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.533
stem from 2005 through 2017.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.720
One other thing I'll say about adult males

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.600
versus adult females is

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.913
because of the fact that
when I first got to Fongoli

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.490
I heard that even though chimpanzees

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.190
are not eaten at the site

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.840
and this is not within a national park,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.320
this is outside of a national park

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.730
so you do have villages in the area.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.060
Anthropogenic or human
disturbance accounts

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.120
for about 5% of the habitat.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.580
You do have chimpanzees
living alongside people,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.800
they're not habituated to them,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.640
they're habituated to us so we're okay

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.180
but other people are not.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.930
But in rare cases you do have people

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.440
that will try to hunt a chimpanzee

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.100
in order to get a female's
infant for the pet trade

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.120
and we had that happen
one time in 17 years.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.620
And because of that I focus on adult males

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.410
as my focal subjects.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.130
The Fongoli community is often
together as one large group

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.470
so I can collect data on females,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.010
but they are more timid
when they're by themselves

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.980
and I don't try to follow them
when they're by themselves.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.310
So I think I know a lot about
what is going on with males

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.680
and I know some about what
is going on with females

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.223
but perhaps not as much.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.940
So this pie chart gives you an idea

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.970
of the prey species consumed
by Fongoli chimpanzees

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.420
both by males and by females.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.220
And as Ian pointed out

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.940
there are no colobus monkeys
in this particular habitat.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.900
So it is a savanna woodland habitat,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.140
colobus monkeys don't occur here.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.950
Forest guenons like red-tailed monkeys

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.840
or other colobus monkeys, blue
monkeys do not occur here.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.750
Instead you have savanna
species like baboons,

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.073
patas monkeys, vervets.

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.530
You have mongooses,
bushbucks, things like this.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.870
And then on the very lower right

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.810
you see that adorable little bush baby

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.560
and Ian introduced the galago as well.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.620
The galago is actually
the main prey species

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.030
of Fongoli chimpanzees,
both males and females,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.830
and this is the animal
that they hunt with tools

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.080
and I'll actually hopefully
show you some video of that

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.530
and talk more about that.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.330
So the prey profile if
you wanna call it that

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.590
really reflects the
savanna type of habitat

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.090
and it does also support
as Ian pointed out

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.713
or talked about what is
called a risk-averse strategy.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.360
So I'm just going to show you some video

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.643
and try to narrate it here.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.280
So this is tool-assisted hunting.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.550
What this image is gonna show you

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.040
is an adult female
that's if you can't tell,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.050
that's Farafa, she's an older female.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.080
We estimate her age to be around 40.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.193
She's one of the top female
hunters in the group.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.330
So she's trying to get at these
adorable little bush babies

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.450
that try to sleep in
cavities during the day

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.170
until this rude chimpanzee
comes with the tool.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.990
That's an adult male, that's Jumpkin

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.453
and he goes about it a
little bit differently.

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:05.199
(audience laughing)

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.390
And so, even though
females hunt with tools

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.090
more than expected,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.410
I'll talk a little bit
more about that next,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.392
males do exhibit this type
of hunting behavior as well.

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:20.270
(audience laughing)

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.123
I have to say he's
usually better than that.

00:10:22.123 --> 00:10:23.420
(audience laughing)

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.123
They just caught him on a bad day.

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.493
(audience laughing)

00:10:40.192 --> 00:10:43.692
Well, we'll let Jumpkin try one more time.

00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:49.065
(audience laughing)

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.600
If you didn't guess he wasn't successful

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.590
in this particular bout.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.983
So we're looking at a lot of
different aspects of this.

00:11:00.983 --> 00:11:01.816
Well.

00:11:01.816 --> 00:11:03.780
(audience laughing)

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.343
I almost feel bad showing that.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.110
We're looking at a lot
of different aspects

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.790
of this particular behavior

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.130
and so this is a juvenile female, Vivian,

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.830
that was her mother that was hunting.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.090
And the juveniles start this behavior

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.500
when they're about two years of age,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.640
when they're still infants and nursing

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.050
but they don't learn really the proper

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.830
tool length and that sort of thing

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.910
until they get to be about four.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.876
So she gets a little frustrated too.

00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:33.120
(audience laughing)

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.363
All right, enough fun I guess.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.610
So in terms of our results so far,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.550
I apologize because in your
abstract I put over 500,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.250
I was sure that we would
hit the 500 mark this year.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.525
499, I just can't believe it.

00:11:49.525 --> 00:11:50.500
(audience laughs)

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.680
But we have 499 hunting records,

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.380
those aren't all successes

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.680
and that's including adults and immatures.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.180
We've only seen adolescent
and adult individuals

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.890
successful in this type
of hunting behavior.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.900
Like I said infants begin to exhibit it

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.720
and they do really good
as far as making the tool

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.500
but they don't make a proper tool

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.800
until they get to be a juvenile.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.020
So we see about 32 hunts
per year on average

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.960
when you take into account
that there are some days

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.470
that we can't be there,
the river's too high

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.930
or someone's sick.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.650
We think that they probably
hunt at least 50 times a year.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.640
And again, our most recent
analysis suggest that

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.920
females do hunt significantly
more than expected with tools

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.050
even though males also hunt.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.450
And we did analysis taking into account

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.580
not only their membership in
the the community as a whole

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.580
but also their membership

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.600
and so-called hunting parties

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.593
or parties that the chimpanzees
are in on those days.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.940
So I want to talk a little bit more about

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.660
just the hunters themselves

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.610
and this is a lot of color there

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.340
but I wanted to show you the
top 10 hunters at Fongoli

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.510
and also the different types of foods

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.460
or prey that they hunt.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.970
And so, you have two
females that are actually

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.380
among the top 10 hunters at Fongoli.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.220
Interestingly I think is
that both of those females,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.860
females are very high-ranking.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.500
So Tumbo there is
currently our alpha female

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.860
based on these very
stylized pant grunt records,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.890
sorry, vocalizations

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.010
and we keep records of these vocalizations

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.750
where a subordinate individual will

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.830
pant grunt to a dominant individual.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.750
And Tumbo actually overtook
that alpha position

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.330
from Farafa there about two years ago.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.300
And so, females actually do
hunt some in this community

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.030
or at least enough to be considered

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.480
among the top 10 Fongoli hunters.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.340
And also I'd like to point out that

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.810
we have a tie right now
for the very top hunter

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.903
and one is the alpha male, that's David.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.900
He is tied for the top
hunting position with Siberut

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.507
and some of you will be
happy to know that Siberut

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:54.750
who is pictured there is not only

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.440
the oldest hunter in the
group, he's oldest male

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.863
but he's also the lowest
ranking male as well.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.100
And then if you look at female
hunting behavior in general

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.360
females, almost all females hunt

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.210
and almost all males hunt as well

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.010
so they hunt about what you would expect

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.520
or at least their participation
in hunting overall

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.200
is what you would expect based
on their their membership

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.463
in the Fongoli community.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.340
I wanted to look, talk a little
bit about Fongoli hunting

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.540
and the context of female
hunting across study sites.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.010
So, Ian talked about that some

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.840
and I've used data from
his work and others

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.810
to look at Fongoli female hunting

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.470
and in fact, there are females elsewhere

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.520
that also engage in
quite a bit of hunting.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.150
In fact, females at
Mahale hunt a little more

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.120
than females at Fongoli if you look at

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.210
Fongoli female hunting behavior overall.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.100
And then when you look at tool use

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.630
you see that Fongoli
females do hunt quite a bit

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.920
almost half of the tool-assisted hunting

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.320
at Fongoli is by females.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.350
And again remember that we
have fewer females at Fongoli,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.540
we don't follow females
systematically like we do males.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.770
And so one question as to why females hunt

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.343
is basically as David started out with,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.150
you know, it's probably no surprise that

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.600
the chimps gained a lot
of nutrition from hunting,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.310
but I think perhaps a more
interesting question is

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.920
why females don't hunt
more at other sites.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.840
And Ian talked about some
of these issues as well

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.350
that I'll pursue right now.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.993
And so, if you looked
at for example theft,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.820
there's not a lot of theft at Fongoli

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.170
so when I use the word share
I'm referring to basically

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.600
the last three categories I
think that David talked about.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.330
So active food transfer
but not theft, right,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.290
and passive food transfer, et cetera.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.000
So I consider theft to
be a different category

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.210
and at Fongoli you have very little theft.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.230
The only thought we've seen involves

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.270
two different alpha males,
so very little theft.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.840
Whereas at other sites you
do have quite a bit of theft

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.763
and so I believe as Ian said,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.600
females don't have incentive
to hunt at some sites.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.900
At Fongoli there definitely is incentive

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.600
and not only females but this
is a little video of again

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.510
that lower-ranking male.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.650
So out of 13 males he's number 13.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.710
He's the oldest male, that's Siberut.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.830
So he's walking by a number of adult males

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.220
with this bushbuck fawn that he's captured

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.050
and no one makes any
attempt to take it from him.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.430
He had actually been eating
on that fawn for over an hour

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.590
and he had a number of
individuals sitting around

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.210
basically begging, he
didn't share with them.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.660
And as he moves off
you'll see that there's

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.500
another older male that will follow him

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.303
and this is his ally Bandit.

00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:50.940
Where's Bandit?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.640
There he is.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.540
Calmly following his buddy Siberut out.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.690
And so, he did end up sharing with Bandit.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.690
So not only do you see
some sort of concept

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.100
well, I hate to say concept of ownership

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.970
but you see tolerance.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.010
So tolerance of possession of prey

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.870
by dominant males of these
low ranking individuals,

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.910
females and also lower ranking males.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.880
So I think that at
Fongoli you actually have

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.900
the incentive to hunt.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.730
It's one of the reasons that
you see so much hunting,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.113
at least tool-assisted hunting in females.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.860
I wanna show it a slightly different way.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.400
So, these are the same top 10 hunters

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.720
but rather than being expressed

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.100
in the number of prey that they brought in

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.990
this is the number of kilograms

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.520
or estimated kilograms of meat, right?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.640
And so, you see that David has jumped up

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.390
to number one position there.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.860
It depends on what you hunt

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.710
and almost everybody hunts
bush babies except K.L.,

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.680
we've never seen him capture a bush baby.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.540
But what's interesting is you see that

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.250
the third top hunter there

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.180
at least in terms of prey captures,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.040
Lupin has fallen quite low

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.740
because he does seem to
specialize on bush babies.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.800
So the females really didn't
change positions at all,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.460
they're still in the top 10

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.290
but you do see a lot of variation.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.320
So that's something that
we're looking at now

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.970
and so, I wanted to talk
just a little bit about

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.693
what females can provide in
terms of transfer or sharing.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.450
And we, so far this is still
preliminary to some degree.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.770
We've looked at sharing or
food transfer by females

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.490
and again I'm considering
David's categories

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.630
of active transfer, passive transfer

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.190
and scrounging but tolerated scrounging,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.540
and I'm not considering a theft
in this category in females

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.620
actually shared with other individuals

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.510
more often they did with their offspring.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.970
So that's something that
we're exploring right now.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.860
And basically I would argue that females

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:52.820
as Rebecca has pointed out
should be considered as well

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.250
and finally I'll just
move on to my last slide

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.890
and leave you with a couple of thoughts.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.730
First of all I think
Travis Pickering said it

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.370
probably better than I can.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.750
So, he actually thinks that if you

00:19:05.766 --> 00:19:07.800
think about the tool-assisted
hunting at Fongoli

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.730
it perhaps can tell us more about

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.900
some of the early hominin
hunting that went on

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.410
compared to the emotionally-charged
hunting of chimpanzees

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.900
as he puts it.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.140
And I'll just end up by saying

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.740
echoing what Rebecca has said
as well about female humans

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.500
is that just now

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.070
and I think Richard
mentioned this as well,

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.080
we're beginning to understand

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.040
more about female chimpanzee hunting,

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.860
and that they also play
a part in this scenario.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.108
So, thank you very much.

00:19:37.108 --> 00:19:39.525
(audience applauding)

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:42.192
(uptempo music)
