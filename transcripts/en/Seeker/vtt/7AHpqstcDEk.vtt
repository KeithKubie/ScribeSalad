00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.560
There are probably few experiences you could
have that would confuse your brain more than

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.970
almost dying.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.610
Hey friends, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.211
"Near death experiences" have been described
by people across the world who came--or thought

00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:19.609
they were coming--within an inch of their
life.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.499
What's totally crazy is that no matter who
you are, where you come from---everyone describes

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.029
it very similarly.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.589
It starts with a warmth spreading throughout
their body, absolute serenity and calm, some

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.169
might even call it nirvana.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.480
Then comes a bright light and a feeling of
being detached from the body, as if you were

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480
floating.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.739
The number of people who have a near death
experiences is on the rise, thanks to technologies

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.010
that can save people at the last moment.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.679
Naturally, there's a burning question:

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:45.980
WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN!??

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.019
This is a complicated and emotionally charged
question.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.500
For some, the near death experience is proof
of the afterlife.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.780
For others, it's a fascinating neurological
question.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.129
Let's take a look at this phenomenon through
a scientific lens.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.589
One of the most highly regarded studies on
NDEs comes from the University of Kentucky.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.520
They found that some Near Death Experiences
may actually be something called REM intrusion.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.800
During REM intrusion, the mind awakes before
the body, which can trigger hallucinations.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.770
It's sort of like dreaming - while you're
awake, kind of.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.990
I covered this phenomenon in my video about
sleep paralysis, so if you're interested you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.070
should definitely check that out cause it's
freaky stuff.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.840
Because REM intrusion happens in the brainstem,
it's possible for this to occur even when

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.000
higher functioning parts of the brain have
gone dead.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.509
Building on this research, trauma to the brain
can result in a sensory mix-up.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.979
As your brain struggles to stay alive, all
of that chaos results in an information overload

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.189
in the visual cortex.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.570
This is known to produce visions of a bright
light or a dark tunnel.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.670
The brain also releases a flood of happy endorphins
which put you in a profound state of peace

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.759
and calm.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.340
And because your brain is responsible for
orienting your body relative to everything

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.539
around you, trauma and oxygen deprivation
can cause a sort of out of body experience.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.750
This has been observed in lots of people who
aren't having a near death experience as well.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.450
Lastly, a new study has been published by
the Proceedings of the National Academy of

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.100
Sciences on NDEs.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.660
The study was done on rats and found that
after cardiac arrest, there is a crazy spike

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.660
in neural activity.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.880
The lead author says that "if anything, the
brain is much more active during the dying

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.200
process than even the waking state".

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
Essentially, the neurons go into overdrive
as death sets in, causing the brain to go

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.430
haywire in a predictable way - cue warmth,
bright light, floating, etc.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.780
We perceive this experience with profound
intensity as our brain takes a last hurrah

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.110
before death.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
I can't decide if this is beautiful or terrifying
or depressing or what.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.300
