00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.300
Why do humans get migraines?

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.320
The potential answer is a real headache.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.900
Hey everyone, Matt Lieberman here for DNews.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.860
Just about everyone knows someone who’s
had a migraine, or if you’re really unlucky,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.960
you suffer from them on a chronic basis.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
The Mayo Clinic defines a migraine as a “headache
[that] can cause intense throbbing or a pulsing

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.739
sensation in one area of the head and is commonly
accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.479
sensitivity to light and sound.”

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.840
They can last anywhere from minutes to several
days in length, and the pain and disorientation

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.430
can be so intense that it renders the sufferer
incapable of doing just about anything.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.620
So why do we get them?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.530
There isn’t one answer for sure, but a new
study authored by researchers at the University

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.370
of Toronto offers a compelling clue: participants
who witnessed physical abuse between their

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940
parents were more likely to get migraines.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.990
Men were 52% more likely and women were 64%
more likely to get migraines if they had witnessed

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.600
domestic violence as a child than those who
hadn’t.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.550
This means, potentially, that migraines are,
at their core, caused by how the brain develops

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.580
long before we reach adulthood.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.201
The headaches themselves are thought to be
brought on by abnormal brain activity and

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.479
an imbalance of serotonin in the brain.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.840
Now serotonin is one of many neurotransmitters
found in the human brain, and it’s been

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.590
proven that when under intense levels of stress
and anxiety, the brain produces greater amounts

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.950
of fear-related chemicals, such as adrenaline,
and less of the chemicals associated with

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.549
relaxation and joy, like serotonin.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.270
With this in mind, it’s possible to build
on the University of Toronto study and say

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.090
that witnessing domestic physical violence
raises the risk of migraines by adding viscerally

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.850
stressful memories to a still-developing mind.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.030
If the pattern of abuse is constant, the brain
can very easily get used to overproducing

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.670
adrenaline and under producing serotonin.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.920
So what can migraine sufferers do to avoid
migraines?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.799
Avoid salty or overly processed foods, remain
well hydrated, and avoid caffeine, to start.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.420
Try to reduce stimulation.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.810
Bright lights and thumping bass are not your
friend.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.600
Also, regular exercise can help release serotonin
into the body, reducing anxiety and making

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.249
migraines less likely.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.509
Now we want to hear from you: Have you ever
suffered from a migraine?

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.509
How do you or your loved ones cope with them?

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.220
