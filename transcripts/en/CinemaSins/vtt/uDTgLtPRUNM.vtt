00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.269
Alright, Pacific Rim, man. I am pumped to
talk about this movie!

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.700
I can tell.
The only problem is... how do we decide who's

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.380
gonna do the pros and who's gonna do the cons.
What do you mean?

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.480
Well, we're both gonna want to do the pros,
so you know, how do we choose. Do we flip

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.630
a coin or what?
I do not mind doing the cons, alright? That

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.529
doesn't bother me.
You mother*cker. You didn't like Pacific Rim?!

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.269
No, that's not even remotely what I said.
I just saw enough wrong with it that I don't

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.040
mind taking the con side in an argument.
You mother*cker.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.549
Whatever. I can't help it.
Okay. Whatever. I'm going first, though.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.059
Do it. You go first.
The robot drags a f*cking cargo ship through

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.449
the streets of Hong Kong and beats up a giant
alien monster with it!!

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.760
Yeah, that was pretty awesome.
(That was easy)

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.670
Okay, my turn, now. That's only awesome at
the expense of story and character.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.250
What?
Like, it's so obvious they spent so much on

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.180
the robots they just had an intern who watched
too many Roland Emmerich movies be the screenwriter.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.080
What's there to script? Exterior: Day: Robot
punches monster.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.070
That's about how they approached it, yeah.
I mean, they couldn't have more clichés in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.240
this movie if they tried. Will the two new
partners get along? Will they fall in love?

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.250
Will the grizzled old veteran come out of
retirement to save the day? Will the scientist

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.870
storyline make me want to choke a b*tch? None
of those questions have good answers.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.420
Man, I liked all that stuff. Are you—do
you mean to tell me that you knew they were

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.140
going to fall in love, like, in the beginning
of the movie? Cause I didn't see that coming

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.570
at all.
That's only because you were too busy masturbating

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.320
to the robot fights.
I did that when I got home, alright? I am

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.320
an adult.
Whatever. It's my point. (That was easy)

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.370
The robot drags a f*cking cargo ship through
the streets of Hong Kong and beats up a giant

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.100
alien monster with it!!
I know, but you already used that.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.060
It's worth more than one point!
No, it's not. Not according to the rules.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.019
(That was easy) I'm sorry. Now, let's talk
about the accents for a second.

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.810
Accents?
I'd like to talk about the accents. Specificall

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.010
Idris Elba. That guy's a god of accents. I
watched all 5 seasons of The Wire twice before

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.670
I even knew he was British. But what the hell
is up with his accent in this movie? It's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.480
like, Scottish at times, and English at times,
and a little Australian, South African. It's

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.480
all over the place. It's really distracting.
I didn't notice. I was too busy paying attention

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.060
to the bad-ass locker-room speeches.
If you didn't notice the accents, then you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.030
can't argue against that. (That was easy).
That one's mine too.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.530
Alright, my turn. The bad-ass locker room
speeches!

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.780
You know, I'm kinda glad you did that, actually.
Because the speeches are, indeed, terrible.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.819
Like, they're cheesy—there's one speech
where it's just him and the other guy talking

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.170
in a room, and he starts screaming all of
the sudden like there's a thousand guys needing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.180
to be inspired. It's ridiculous. (That was
easy).

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110
You have to give me a chance to argue back.
Fine, argue back.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.620
Those speeches were inspiring to me. Dude,
what do you want from a giant robot punching

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.290
aliens movie, like, Oscar-caliber acting?
I wish you could hear how you sound right

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.130
now. You sound exactly like those people who
defend their love of the Transformers movies

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.239
by saying basically the same thing. Look,
I don't mind if the movie wants to say, "Hey,

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.170
there's a crack in the ocean and aliens can
come through it," and then never address it

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.620
again. That's fine with me. I don't care if
they want to say, you know, robot fighting

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.280
is more important to us than character development.
That's fine with me. But even the "don't take

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.930
me seriously" fun, casual movie can still
be made well. Don't you think?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.819
The robot drags a f*cking cargo ship through
the streets of Hong Kong and beats up a giant

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.569
alien monster with it!!
Man, you are the reason they're gonna make

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.160
six more of these things over the next ten
years.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.849
That... sounds awesome to me.
Pacific Rim 2: More Rimming

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.019
Man, I am all over that sh*t.
Pacific Rim 2: More Inception Sounds.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.680
Okay, that was a little distracting.
BWAAAAAAAAHHHM!

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.709
BWAAAAAAAAHHHM!
How many people do you think stayed for the

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.650
after-credits scene in this movie?
Pacific Rim has an after-credits scene?
