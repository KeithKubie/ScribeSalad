00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.260
Hey, guys! One of the things you've always asked me is what it's like to actually make a video. So, today

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.420
I'd love to walk you through the process of

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:15.899
how I'm artistically creative from the beginning to the end. So, I wake up at about 9:30, feed my cats

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.319
And frantically go through my journal trying to figure out what the day's video is going to be. At 10 a.m,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.480
Cat, my makeup artist arrives

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.920
and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the video is going to be.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.009
I usually don't have anything written until I'm sitting in the makeup chair probably at 10:30, 10:45,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.189
with the crew arriving at 11 a.m.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.629
Usually, right on the dot of their arrival is when I will print the script and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.740
frantically highlight things to figure out exactly where in my home we're shooting each section.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.300
The crew is great.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.180
Hey, my name is Erik. This is my baby, C. I'm the DoP here on Anna's videos. I am very meticulous.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.180
I like to have things very precise.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.740
(Fuck it.) I will not stop till the shot is absolutely perfect. I'm very demanding of my crew.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.940
[Meghan: How's this, Erik?] Fuck it, it's fine. Eh... Fuck it.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
Hi, I'm Kat. I do makeup for Anna's videos.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.360
It's a pretty fun gig.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.989
I mean, it's a lot of work cause you're always touching up, and, you know, sometimes

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.600
I wish I had more down time to sit and just hang out.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.900
She's a little lazy, you know,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.120
um -- kind of exactly like a cat, actually -- so, I really quite like it. She lounges around and hangs out with the cats.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.999
I have a back massager that she's frequently using between takes. I normally have to be like, "Hey, Cat,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.669
like, I need your lipstick touch-up" or something, and then she'll finally come in after a minute.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200
(I'm good.) Hi, I'm John. I, uh,

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.688
I help on set as a sound grip, which... isn't... actually a position,

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.179
but, I don't say anything. They- they're very accommodating to feed me as much as I want, so it's not bad gig.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.310
He can eat a lot. For a while, I thought he was actually like a Kobayashi in disguise;

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.500
he was just kind of doing this on the side for fun.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.050
But it turns out that he just has an insane stomach or tapeworm problem or something.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.580
I have told him he should probably get it checked. He's dating Melissa. Hi. My name is Melissa and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.880
I have a lot of fun at these shoots.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.820
I especially have fun working with John.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.300
I really like the other girls. They-they talk a lot.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.180
And I think we get along pretty well. Hi, my name is Reed. I do some producing for Anna.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.049
I really just try to be helpful as much as possible on set and I think the person that appreciates it the most is probably

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.230
John.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.230
So what do you think about Reed?

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.559
[Reed: Lunch is here.] Okay, that's lunch. Everyone, break.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.130
He always brings us lunch. So, we have our own little call.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.750
When we- when we want food. It's mostly like, "REED! REED!"

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.800
It's usually, like, a bunch of us. Like, Cat and I was like right. It's like,

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.940
"REED! REEEEED!"

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.600
So that's how we kind of like... Like a baby bird kind of calling for its mother out of the nest.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.709
Hey, everyone! So, I'm Meghan.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.560
I'm, uh, part of the crew on Anna's videos.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.100
How do you like working with Meghan?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.080
Um... I think you mean "Melissa". I don't think we have a Megan on the set. Who?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.080
Who?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.900
Well, uh, I guess I enjoy working with myself, cause... I'm Meghan?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.940
What do you think about Meghan?

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.420
Meghan is...

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.600
You know, they say, "Keep your enemies close"?

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.200
(intense staring)

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.310
We go through an entire day,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.029
film a bunch of stuff throughout the house and.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.510
At the end of it, Eric will take the footage and go edit it

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.300
then send it to

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.400
lovely Bethany Radloff who adds the graphics and then, it gets to you usually about a week or so after we film. I

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.140
wish that the process was not this way. You think it's a joke. But, for real, this is how we we shoot this shit.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.940
I'm Anna Akana. Bye!

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.880
Aaaand... Action.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.880
