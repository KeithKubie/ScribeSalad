hi I'm Ankur Kotwal and I'm an engineer
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.290
hi I'm Ankur Kotwal and I'm an engineer
on the Android developer relations team

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

hi I'm Chris Broadfoot I work on the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
hi I'm Chris Broadfoot I work on the
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.849
hi I'm Chris Broadfoot I work on the
Google Maps Android API team today we're

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
Google Maps Android API team today we're
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.320
Google Maps Android API team today we're
going to talk to you about the Maps API

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
going to talk to you about the Maps API
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.170
going to talk to you about the Maps API
for Android and we're going to cover a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
for Android and we're going to cover a
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.580
for Android and we're going to cover a
few things but to start with us talk

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
few things but to start with us talk
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.679
few things but to start with us talk
about animation if you have a look at

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
about animation if you have a look at
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.939
about animation if you have a look at
the the sample code for the Maps API

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949
the the sample code for the Maps API
 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.589
the the sample code for the Maps API
you'll see that we use handlers to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
you'll see that we use handlers to
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.229
you'll see that we use handlers to
animate markers and for other purposes

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
animate markers and for other purposes
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.510
animate markers and for other purposes
too so what we're going to talk about

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
too so what we're going to talk about
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970
too so what we're going to talk about
today is how you can use handlers for

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
today is how you can use handlers for
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530
today is how you can use handlers for
backward compatibility but use some of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
backward compatibility but use some of
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600
backward compatibility but use some of
the newer API is ie the property

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
the newer API is ie the property
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.910
the newer API is ie the property
animation framework to have an even

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
animation framework to have an even
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160
animation framework to have an even
better experience so let's switch to the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
better experience so let's switch to the
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.660
better experience so let's switch to the
tablet and let's just see a basic marker

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
tablet and let's just see a basic marker
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639
tablet and let's just see a basic marker
animating all we're doing is where we

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
animating all we're doing is where we
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.160
animating all we're doing is where we
tap we just generate a polyline from the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
tap we just generate a polyline from the
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170
tap we just generate a polyline from the
source to destination just tell the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
source to destination just tell the
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.180
source to destination just tell the
marker to move there yep so here you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
marker to move there yep so here you
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.260
marker to move there yep so here you
know we've accomplished what we wanted

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
know we've accomplished what we wanted
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.810
know we've accomplished what we wanted
to but as I said in Gingerbread what

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
to but as I said in Gingerbread what
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310
to but as I said in Gingerbread what
we'd be a gingerbread and although what

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
we'd be a gingerbread and although what
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.500
we'd be a gingerbread and although what
we would do is animate these markers the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
we would do is animate these markers the
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.969
we would do is animate these markers the
markers position using a handler so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
markers position using a handler so
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710
markers position using a handler so
let's have a look at some code that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
let's have a look at some code that
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870
let's have a look at some code that
shows us how we do this okay so we'll be

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
shows us how we do this okay so we'll be
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300
shows us how we do this okay so we'll be
showing you three ways of animating a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
showing you three ways of animating a
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490
showing you three ways of animating a
marker and each of these methods will

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
marker and each of these methods will
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499
marker and each of these methods will
have the same parameters so the marker

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
have the same parameters so the marker
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.039
have the same parameters so the marker
itself the final destination lat/long so

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
itself the final destination lat/long so
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.410
itself the final destination lat/long so
that's the it's final point and a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
that's the it's final point and a
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940
that's the it's final point and a
lat/long interpolator which we'll talk

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
lat/long interpolator which we'll talk
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.390
lat/long interpolator which we'll talk
about a little bit later so from

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400
about a little bit later so from
 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609
about a little bit later so from
Gingerbread and before we need to do a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
Gingerbread and before we need to do a
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260
Gingerbread and before we need to do a
little bit of setup to set up our

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
little bit of setup to set up our
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840
little bit of setup to set up our
animation handler so first of all we get

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850
animation handler so first of all we get
 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300
animation handler so first of all we get
the start position just by calling get

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
the start position just by calling get
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210
the start position just by calling get
position on the marker and then just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
position on the marker and then just
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100
position on the marker and then just
again some of that setup so just the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
again some of that setup so just the
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190
again some of that setup so just the
start time and our animation duration so

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
start time and our animation duration so
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.030
start time and our animation duration so
here's the meet of the animation so this

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040
here's the meet of the animation so this
 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.830
here's the meet of the animation so this
runnable gets called every 16

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
runnable gets called every 16
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.980
runnable gets called every 16
milliseconds while the animation

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
milliseconds while the animation
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.469
milliseconds while the animation
animation is in progress the T variable

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
animation is in progress the T variable
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.649
animation is in progress the T variable
is the portion that we are through the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
is the portion that we are through the
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270
is the portion that we are through the
animation and we're also using an

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
animation and we're also using an
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.990
animation and we're also using an
interpolator

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
interpolator
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.119
interpolator
so these are available before Ice Cream

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
so these are available before Ice Cream
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.490
so these are available before Ice Cream
Sandwich and honeycomb as well so this

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
Sandwich and honeycomb as well so this
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Sandwich and honeycomb as well so this
is great for like a accelerate

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
is great for like a accelerate
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.680
is great for like a accelerate
decelerate Interpol

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
decelerate Interpol
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.680
decelerate Interpol
or bouncing interpolation and then we

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
or bouncing interpolation and then we
 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.110
or bouncing interpolation and then we
just go ahead and call that set position

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
just go ahead and call that set position
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.530
just go ahead and call that set position
on the marker with its new value you'll

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
on the marker with its new value you'll
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.850
on the marker with its new value you'll
see at the end of the handler what we do

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860
see at the end of the handler what we do
 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.430
see at the end of the handler what we do
is we re invoke the handler after 16

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
is we re invoke the handler after 16
 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.230
is we re invoke the handler after 16
milliseconds and of course that magic

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240
milliseconds and of course that magic
 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.700
milliseconds and of course that magic
number is used so that we can get 60

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710
number is used so that we can get 60
 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.950
number is used so that we can get 60
frames per second now one of the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
frames per second now one of the
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.480
frames per second now one of the
downsides to this is that we are doing

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490
downsides to this is that we are doing
 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.110
downsides to this is that we are doing
this asynchronously to the Android UI

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
this asynchronously to the Android UI
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.030
this asynchronously to the Android UI
rendering thread so what we can do is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
rendering thread so what we can do is
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.310
rendering thread so what we can do is
use the property animation framework and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320
use the property animation framework and
 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.050
use the property animation framework and
we're going to shift to the next one and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
we're going to shift to the next one and
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.820
we're going to shift to the next one and
see in the value animator how we can

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830
see in the value animator how we can
 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.400
see in the value animator how we can
synchronize those okay so from honeycomb

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410
synchronize those okay so from honeycomb
 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.770
synchronize those okay so from honeycomb
onwards we can use value animator as

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780
onwards we can use value animator as
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.080
onwards we can use value animator as
Ankur said so here we still have to do a

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
Ankur said so here we still have to do a
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.580
Ankur said so here we still have to do a
little bit of setup we get the markers

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
little bit of setup we get the markers
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.730
little bit of setup we get the markers
starting position but the value animator

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740
starting position but the value animator
 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.890
starting position but the value animator
can give us the animated fraction so

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
can give us the animated fraction so
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.750
can give us the animated fraction so
this is the combination of how far the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760
this is the combination of how far the
 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.370
this is the combination of how far the
animation is through and also the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380
animation is through and also the
 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.720
animation is through and also the
interpolator so any accelerate

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730
interpolator so any accelerate
 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.960
interpolator so any accelerate
decelerate is applied to that as well

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
decelerate is applied to that as well
 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.570
decelerate is applied to that as well
and so we just again call set position

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
and so we just again call set position
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.180
and so we just again call set position
on that so the on animation update

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190
on that so the on animation update
 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.060
on that so the on animation update
override it gets invoked as the next

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
override it gets invoked as the next
 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.010
override it gets invoked as the next
frame is being prepared so literally

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020
frame is being prepared so literally
 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.560
frame is being prepared so literally
that's your opportunity to do whatever

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
that's your opportunity to do whatever
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.300
that's your opportunity to do whatever
changes you want to make and then the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310
changes you want to make and then the
 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.550
changes you want to make and then the
frame will get drawn unlike the handler

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
frame will get drawn unlike the handler
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.560
frame will get drawn unlike the handler
which is just going to happen every 16

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
which is just going to happen every 16
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.840
which is just going to happen every 16
milliseconds regardless of you know when

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850
milliseconds regardless of you know when
 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.120
milliseconds regardless of you know when
you're drawing you your next frame this

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130
you're drawing you your next frame this
 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.710
you're drawing you your next frame this
happens synchronized with that rendering

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
happens synchronized with that rendering
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.780
happens synchronized with that rendering
framework now the interesting thing is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790
framework now the interesting thing is
 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.280
framework now the interesting thing is
or important thing is you want to make

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290
or important thing is you want to make
 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.990
or important thing is you want to make
sure you complete your execution within

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000
sure you complete your execution within
 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.180
sure you complete your execution within
16 milliseconds otherwise you're gonna

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
16 milliseconds otherwise you're gonna
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.949
16 milliseconds otherwise you're gonna
miss that drawer and you're gonna get

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959
miss that drawer and you're gonna get
 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.440
miss that drawer and you're gonna get
jank or jitter the actual animation of

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450
jank or jitter the actual animation of
 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.270
jank or jitter the actual animation of
the value we're just we're not really

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
the value we're just we're not really
 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.060
the value we're just we're not really
using that as you can see we say ignored

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070
using that as you can see we say ignored
 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.800
using that as you can see we say ignored
because we're animating from 0 to 1 but

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
because we're animating from 0 to 1 but
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.110
because we're animating from 0 to 1 but
it's we're not actually utilizing that

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
it's we're not actually utilizing that
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.180
it's we're not actually utilizing that
at all so let's talk about object

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190
at all so let's talk about object
 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.949
at all so let's talk about object
animator which is also available from

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959
animator which is also available from
 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.050
animator which is also available from
honeycomb upwards but Ice Cream Sandwich

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060
honeycomb upwards but Ice Cream Sandwich
 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.490
honeycomb upwards but Ice Cream Sandwich
adds some other nice options I suppose

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
adds some other nice options I suppose
 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.350
adds some other nice options I suppose
so here we're using an object animator

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360
so here we're using an object animator
 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.390
so here we're using an object animator
and we can just create so if you see

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400
and we can just create so if you see
 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.100
and we can just create so if you see
down on this line we just create an

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110
down on this line we just create an
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.740
down on this line we just create an
object animator of the marker and it's

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750
object animator of the marker and it's
 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.280
object animator of the marker and it's
property position we pass it in a type

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290
property position we pass it in a type
 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.469
property position we pass it in a type
of valuator which basically tells the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479
of valuator which basically tells the
 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.090
of valuator which basically tells the
animation framework how to animate

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100
animation framework how to animate
 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.210
animation framework how to animate
between custom object types so in this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220
between custom object types so in this
 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.540
between custom object types so in this
case

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550
case
 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.939
case
it's a latitude/longitude object and we

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949
it's a latitude/longitude object and we
 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.950
it's a latitude/longitude object and we
just passed in the final position so

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960
just passed in the final position so
 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.869
just passed in the final position so
there's no need to call market get

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879
there's no need to call market get
 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.159
there's no need to call market get
position at the start of the animation

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169
position at the start of the animation
 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.550
position at the start of the animation
which is quite nice so the type of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560
which is quite nice so the type of
 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.070
which is quite nice so the type of
valuator is very simple in fact it's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080
valuator is very simple in fact it's
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.390
valuator is very simple in fact it's
very similar to our lat/long

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400
very similar to our lat/long
 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.339
very similar to our lat/long
interpolator object which we'll show you

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349
interpolator object which we'll show you
 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.619
interpolator object which we'll show you
in the next section so the I mean the

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629
in the next section so the I mean the
 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.689
in the next section so the I mean the
the other advantage that I can see here

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699
the other advantage that I can see here
 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.040
the other advantage that I can see here
is that we've actually got significantly

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050
is that we've actually got significantly
 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.529
is that we've actually got significantly
less code to do this now then when we

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539
less code to do this now then when we
 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.149
less code to do this now then when we
started so you can obviously group

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159
started so you can obviously group
 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.950
started so you can obviously group
properties you can group different

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960
properties you can group different
 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.330
properties you can group different
objects in here as well so you can

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340
objects in here as well so you can
 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.879
objects in here as well so you can
animate things you know in bundles yeah

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889
animate things you know in bundles yeah
 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.320
animate things you know in bundles yeah
this works well with the property's

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330
this works well with the property's
 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.529
this works well with the property's
value holder for example yeah all right

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539
value holder for example yeah all right
 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.749
value holder for example yeah all right
so that's animation now let's switch

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759
so that's animation now let's switch
 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.930
so that's animation now let's switch
back to our tablet Chris why don't you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940
back to our tablet Chris why don't you
 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.469
back to our tablet Chris why don't you
walk us through the next problem okay so

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479
walk us through the next problem okay so
 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.180
walk us through the next problem okay so
our animation is very simple we're just

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190
our animation is very simple we're just
 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.279
our animation is very simple we're just
animating the latitude and longitude

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289
animating the latitude and longitude
 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.689
animating the latitude and longitude
values of the lat/long object separately

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699
values of the lat/long object separately
 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.059
values of the lat/long object separately
so this has some problems on the surface

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069
so this has some problems on the surface
 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.260
so this has some problems on the surface
of the earth where things wrap around

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270
of the earth where things wrap around
 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.459
of the earth where things wrap around
the dateline so at the 180th longitude

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469
the dateline so at the 180th longitude
 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.680
the dateline so at the 180th longitude
is actually the same point as minus 180

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690
is actually the same point as minus 180
 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.320
is actually the same point as minus 180
longitude so you'll notice if we try to

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330
longitude so you'll notice if we try to
 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.390
longitude so you'll notice if we try to
animate the cross the mark is going to

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400
animate the cross the mark is going to
 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.950
animate the cross the mark is going to
go all the way around the world instead

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960
go all the way around the world instead
 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.320
go all the way around the world instead
of taking the shortest path so we can

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330
of taking the shortest path so we can
 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.899
of taking the shortest path so we can
fix this very simply let's go over to

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909
fix this very simply let's go over to
 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:48.749
fix this very simply let's go over to
the code so here's our broken

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759
the code so here's our broken
 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.649
the code so here's our broken
interpolator

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659
interpolator
 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.110
interpolator
it just takes the Latin long and and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120
it just takes the Latin long and and
 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.309
it just takes the Latin long and and
takes a linear interpolation of each

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319
takes a linear interpolation of each
 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:59.029
takes a linear interpolation of each
value and our fixed one just figures out

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039
value and our fixed one just figures out
 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.529
value and our fixed one just figures out
whether we should take a shorter path or

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539
whether we should take a shorter path or
 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.589
whether we should take a shorter path or
not so it just sees if the distance it

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599
not so it just sees if the distance it
 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.680
not so it just sees if the distance it
needs to travel is more than 180 degrees

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690
needs to travel is more than 180 degrees
 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.760
needs to travel is more than 180 degrees
so let's switch back to the tablet and

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770
so let's switch back to the tablet and
 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.290
so let's switch back to the tablet and
just see what happens there

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
just see what happens there
 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.119
just see what happens there
so this is the the broken one where

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129
so this is the the broken one where
 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.529
so this is the the broken one where
we're traveling around the world to get

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539
we're traveling around the world to get
 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.629
we're traveling around the world to get
to that that shortest distance if we

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639
to that that shortest distance if we
 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.700
to that that shortest distance if we
just switch to our fixed one you'll

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710
just switch to our fixed one you'll
 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.670
just switch to our fixed one you'll
notice that we get that path yeah so

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680
notice that we get that path yeah so
 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.820
notice that we get that path yeah so
it's very simple so you may notice that

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830
it's very simple so you may notice that
 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.800
it's very simple so you may notice that
the marker doesn't exactly follow this

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810
the marker doesn't exactly follow this
 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.439
the marker doesn't exactly follow this
polyline that we've added to the map so

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449
polyline that we've added to the map so
 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.330
polyline that we've added to the map so
the polyline that we're using has a

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340
the polyline that we're using has a
 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.450
the polyline that we're using has a
geodesic property which means that it's

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460
geodesic property which means that it's
 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.939
geodesic property which means that it's
taking the shortest path on the surface

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949
taking the shortest path on the surface
 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.639
taking the shortest path on the surface
of the earth as opposed to a straight

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:38.649
of the earth as opposed to a straight
 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.320
of the earth as opposed to a straight
line on the surface of the map

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330
line on the surface of the map
 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.540
line on the surface of the map
so we can if we wanted our market to

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550
so we can if we wanted our market to
 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.910
so we can if we wanted our market to
follow the polyline we can use similar

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920
follow the polyline we can use similar
 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.460
follow the polyline we can use similar
spherical map mathematics to do this

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470
spherical map mathematics to do this
 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.860
spherical map mathematics to do this
interpolation instead switching back to

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870
interpolation instead switching back to
 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.590
interpolation instead switching back to
the laptop yes so this one's quite a bit

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600
the laptop yes so this one's quite a bit
 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.900
the laptop yes so this one's quite a bit
more complex you probably won't be

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910
more complex you probably won't be
 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.300
more complex you probably won't be
writing this function yourself instead

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310
writing this function yourself instead
 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.500
writing this function yourself instead
you should probably just copy and paste

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510
you should probably just copy and paste
 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.080
you should probably just copy and paste
it or include the Android Maps utils

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090
it or include the Android Maps utils
 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.410
it or include the Android Maps utils
library but basically it just does this

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420
library but basically it just does this
 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.390
library but basically it just does this
spherical math so if we switch back to

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400
spherical math so if we switch back to
 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.450
spherical math so if we switch back to
the tablet here it is broken just to

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460
the tablet here it is broken just to
 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.070
the tablet here it is broken just to
show you that it's it's actually not

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080
show you that it's it's actually not
 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.770
show you that it's it's actually not
following that line yeah and let's

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780
following that line yeah and let's
 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.650
following that line yeah and let's
switch to spherical yeah so let's let's

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660
switch to spherical yeah so let's let's
 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.390
switch to spherical yeah so let's let's
go near the poles for example where this

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400
go near the poles for example where this
 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.540
go near the poles for example where this
is more obvious so yeah so you can see

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550
is more obvious so yeah so you can see
 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.540
is more obvious so yeah so you can see
there's quite a quite a large bow and

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550
there's quite a quite a large bow and
 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.640
there's quite a quite a large bow and
the mark is following the line exactly

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650
the mark is following the line exactly
 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.680
the mark is following the line exactly
and if we go back to the broken one

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690
and if we go back to the broken one
 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.020
and if we go back to the broken one
you'll see that it goes straight across

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.030
you'll see that it goes straight across
 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.930
you'll see that it goes straight across
yeah so so the spherical method is very

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940
yeah so so the spherical method is very
 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.630
yeah so so the spherical method is very
useful if you want this market to follow

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:40.640
useful if you want this market to follow
 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.870
useful if you want this market to follow
a line like we are here or if your

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880
a line like we are here or if your
 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.370
a line like we are here or if your
markers have some sort of actual

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.380
markers have some sort of actual
 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.200
markers have some sort of actual
geographic importance like perhaps a

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210
geographic importance like perhaps a
 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.970
geographic importance like perhaps a
plane on the map or something like that

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:48.980
plane on the map or something like that
 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.250
plane on the map or something like that
just animating the latitude and

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:51.260
just animating the latitude and
 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.020
just animating the latitude and
longitude separately is fine for short

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.030
longitude separately is fine for short
 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.460
longitude separately is fine for short
distances or if you don't really care

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.470
distances or if you don't really care
 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.780
distances or if you don't really care
about any geographic properties and it's

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.790
about any geographic properties and it's
 

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.010
about any geographic properties and it's
probably quite a bit faster than the

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.020
probably quite a bit faster than the
 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.750
probably quite a bit faster than the
spherical methods there's a lot of maths

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:01.760
spherical methods there's a lot of maths
 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.780
spherical methods there's a lot of maths
in there yeah so please do check out the

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:04.790
in there yeah so please do check out the
 

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.850
in there yeah so please do check out the
the code that we have here we'll put an

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860
the code that we have here we'll put an
 

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.130
the code that we have here we'll put an
annotation in into the the video gonna

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.140
annotation in into the the video gonna
 

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.630
annotation in into the the video gonna
be on anchors face and we we hope you

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:13.640
be on anchors face and we we hope you
 

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.970
be on anchors face and we we hope you
found this useful
