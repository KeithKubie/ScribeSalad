00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.405
IN AN AREA
WHERE BATHROOMS ARE SCARCE,

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.207
BILLY'S HAS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO ATTRACT

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.643
A SLEW OF BATHROOM-GOERS
THAT CAN THEN BE CONVERTED

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.144
TO CUSTOMERS.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.412
ONCE THEY USE THE BATHROOM,

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.648
THEN WE SELL THEM
ON EATING HERE.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.649
- MM-HMM.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.850
- YOU GUYS COULD BECOME

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:20.521
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOILET.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.256
- YEAH, I GUESS
IT'S GOOD IDEA.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.957
- AND WHERE BETTER TO MARKET
TO THEM

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.094
THAN WHERE WE HAVE THEIR
COMPLETE, UNDIVIDED ATTENTION?

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.629
WE PUT TOGETHER
A SHORT COMMERCIAL

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:29.930
FEATURING GLORIA,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.064
AND ONCE IT WAS DONE,

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.900
I INSTALLED
MOTION-ACTIVATED MONITORS

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.736
IN EVERY BATHROOM STALL
AND URINAL AT BILLY'S.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.870
WITH THE AD IN PLACE,

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.639
IT WAS TIME
TO START SPREADING THE WORD

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.641
THAT BILLY'S BATHROOMS
WERE FOR EVERYONE.

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.544
THE WINDOW SIGNS WOULD WORK
GREAT FOR PASSERS-BY,

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:44.645
BUT I ALSO WANTED
TO SPREAD AWARENESS

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.613
TO OTHER BUSINESSES
IN THE AREA.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.516
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS
THAT NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.752
YOU CAN SEND THEM
TO BILLY'S DOWN THE BLOCK.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:52.819
- OH, OKAY.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.154
- NOW I WAS READY
TO CONVINCE PEOPLE

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:55.956
WHO CAME FOR THE BATHROOM

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.957
TO STAY FOR THE FOOD.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.958
HI, THERE.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:00.294 line:0%
 
ARE YOU HERE
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.595 line:0%
 
OH, TO EAT? OKAY.
- YEAH.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.097 line:0%
 
- ARE YOU HERE
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.133 line:0%
 
HERE TO EAT.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.134 line:0%
 
THREE?
- YES.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.570 line:0%
 
- FOR THE BATHROOM
OR FOR A TABLE?

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.772 line:0%
 
OKAY, UM, YEAH,
SHE CAN HELP YOU.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.308
AT FIRST, IT WAS LOOKING
LIKE MY SIGNS WEREN'T WORKING,

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:16.944
BUT THEN THE BATHROOM CROWD
STARTED TO ARRIVE.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.579 line:0%
 
HI.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.113 line:0%
 
FOR THE RESTROOM?
- YEAH.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.281 line:0%
 
YES, IT'S RIGHT AT THE BACK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.583
- OKAY.

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:23.750
- THEY WERE ABOUT TO SEE
OUR COMMERCIAL,

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.185
AND I WANTED TO SHOW GLORIA
THEIR REACTIONS.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.387
SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY LEGAL,

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.856
BUT WE SET UP
A COUPLE HIDDEN CAMERAS

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.290
INSIDE THE BATHROOM.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.359
I'LL JUST NEED TO GET PEOPLE
TO SIGN A RELEASE

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.527
CONSENTING TO THE USE
OF THE FOOTAGE

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.628
ONCE THEY GET OUT,

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.897
WHICH I DON'T FORESEE
BEING AN ISSUE.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.398
- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.133

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.336

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.751

WE WERE FILMING YOU

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.929

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.597
