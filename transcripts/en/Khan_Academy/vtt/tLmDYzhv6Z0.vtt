00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:02.756
- [Voiceover] Hey,
grammarians, hey, Paige.

00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:03.589
- [Voiceover] Hi, David.

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:05.170
- [Voiceover] Today we're
gonna talk about dashes

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.993
which is a piece of punctuation,

00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:10.099
looks kind of like this, shoop.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.792
It's just kind of a straight line.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:13.315
Later we're gonna talk about hyphens,

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.221
which look like this, shoop.

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:17.140
And there is a difference
between the two of them,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.973
it's kind of confusing,

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.390
but first we're just
gonna talk about dashes,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.092
what they are, what they do.

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:23.186
- [Voiceover] Okay, sounds good to me.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:26.781
- [Voiceover] So, dashes
have approximately four uses.

00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:29.258
Use number one is that
they can mark interruptions

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:32.040
in the structure of a sentence, as in,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.088
"I ran to the bus stop--but the bus

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:36.023
"had already driven away."

00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:38.959
So we're using this dash
to interrupt the structure

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.774
of this sentence.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.255
- [Voiceover] Okay, but couldn't
you just put a comma there?

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:45.615
- [Voiceover] You know,
you're totally could,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:48.736
you absolutely could use
a comma instead of a dash.

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:51.653
But the dash has this feeling.

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:53.354
And I'm gonna make up a word here,

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:55.437
it feels more interrupty.

00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:58.226
- [Voiceover] Okay, right,

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:02.202
so a comma sort of helps
the sentence keep flowing

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:04.033
and the dash kind of
stops it for a second.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.578
- [Voiceover] And even
though, grammatically,

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:07.461
those two sentences are identical, right,

00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:10.077
"I ran to the bus stop, comma,

00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:12.353
"but the bus had already driven away."

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:13.923
Even though that's, technically,

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:15.663
that means the exact same thing,

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:18.369
"As I ran to the bus stop, dash,

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.370
"but the bus had already driven away."

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.462
This is kind of like an abrupt cutoff.

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:27.172
So, like the comma,
right, the dash is uniting

00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:28.847
these two independent clauses.

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:31.345
"I ran to the bus stop, the
bus had already driven away."

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:33.376
Right, so, like, you know, comma,

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.394
but we connect those
two independent clauses

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:39.496
the same way the dash but is
connecting those two clauses.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.600
But it has a slightly
different connotation.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.933
It's just more abrupt in
the way that it connects

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.536
these two things together.

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:46.369
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.302
Also, it looks like you don't
have a space before or after

00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:50.746
your dash, is that right?

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:51.579
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.562
So, originally when I drawn
it, it did look a lot closer.

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:55.938
But, yes, according to to
the Chicago Manual of Style

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:58.326
that Khan Academy uses,

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:02.326
it would just go word,
dash, word, then a space.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.361
But when you're using dashes, generally,

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.491
you don't put spaces in between them,

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:10.686
in between words.

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:12.020
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.233
- [Voiceover] So that's use number one,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.795
it can interrupt the
structure of a sentence.

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:18.309
Use number two for the
dash is that they can act

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.476
like parentheses in pairs.

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:24.283
- [Voiceover] So the
dash is in the same place

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:27.065
as another type of
punctuation could be again?

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:27.898
- [Voiceover] Correct.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:28.731
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.925
- [Voiceover] The dash,
I guess, is kind of like,

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.515
so let's look at another example sentence.

00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:33.959
And I'll switch colors.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.049
"The bug--which landed on
my nose--had to be the size

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.910
"of a softball."

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.082
Enormous bug.

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:41.811
But, Paige, as you rightly
pointed out, you know,

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.227
this is the same as
having it in parentheses.

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:47.574
You wouldn't have both of
these together like that.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:48.407
- [Voiceover] But they do the same thing.

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:50.444
- [Voiceover] Yeah, they
have the exact same function.

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:51.277
- [Voiceover] In this case.

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:52.110
- [Voiceover] In this case.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.808
So when you have them
in pairs like so, it's

00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:56.631
"The bug--which landed on
my nose--had to be the size

00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:57.464
"of a softball."

00:02:57.464 --> 00:03:00.089
So it's kind of this aside.

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.437
If we really wanted to,
we could take it right out

00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:04.383
of the sentence, kind
of like an appositive,

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.615
right, with commas.

00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:08.665
So we could say, "The bug had
to be the size of a softball."

00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:09.847
Sentence still makes sense.

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:10.997
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:11.907
- [Voiceover] Use number three.

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:15.927
A dash can be used where you
would otherwise use a colon.

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.165
- [Voiceover] So, in
this case, it's gonna be

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.740
sort of introducing something, right?

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.573
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:22.503
So the colon has this
linking power, right,

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.598
it can introduce ideas,
it can start a list,

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:27.367
you can do the same thing with a dash.

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.433
So, for example, if you
wanted to introduce an idea,

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:30.905
we could say.

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:34.987
- [Voiceover] I have only
ever wanted one thing--snacks.

00:03:34.987 --> 00:03:35.820
- [Voiceover] Me, too, Paige.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.653
- [Voiceover] So many snacks.

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:37.988
- [Voiceover] Me, too.

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:38.821
So, right.

00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.973
So we're using this to introduce this idea

00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:44.917
the same way that we
would had it then a colon.

00:03:44.917 --> 00:03:45.750
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.420
So the dash is like a little actor.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.671
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.001
- [Voiceover] Yeah, the
dash is like an actor

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:53.133
that can use like do the jobs

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.745
of all these other punctuation marks.

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:57.578
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:03:57.578 --> 00:03:58.791
- [Voiceover] So it can be parentheses,

00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:00.291
it can be a colon,

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:04.539
it can be like a comma sometimes.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.018
- [Voiceover] Wow!

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:08.085
- [Voiceover] That is
a talented little guy.

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:09.733
- [Voiceover] Seriously,
I'm very impressed.

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:12.570
- [Voiceover] And the fourth
use of the dash is, again,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.199
to indicate interruptions,
but specifically to indicate

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.018
interruptions in speech.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:19.388
- [Voiceover] This is like
its own little special thing.

00:04:19.388 --> 00:04:20.221
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:04:20.221 --> 00:04:21.054
- [Voiceover] It's not
acting like anything else?

00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:22.298
- [Voiceover] Nope.

00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:25.034
- [Voiceover] Just
indicating an interruption.

00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:26.117
Yes, it does.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:27.974
"Watch out for that--"

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:29.132
- [Voiceover] Wham.

00:04:29.132 --> 00:04:32.132
So we're using this dash to say that

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:35.315
this sentence was
interrupted by something,

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:37.358
and then, you know, we
deploy the sound effect.

00:04:37.358 --> 00:04:38.910
But it could be anything, really.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.547
So if you're trying to write down dialogue

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:45.118
that is being cutoff by something,

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.455
by another person interrupting,

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:50.781
by an avalanche of ice
cream, I don't know,

00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:54.497
whatever it is, then you would use a dash

00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:56.064
at the end of the sentence.

00:04:56.064 --> 00:04:57.524
So, no space.

00:04:57.524 --> 00:05:00.857
So we'd go, that, dash, quotation marks.

00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:03.258
And you wouldn't have to do any kind

00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:05.923
of terminal punctuation,
no need for a period

00:05:05.923 --> 00:05:09.506
or a question mark or
an exclamation point.

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:13.876
The dash kind of serves that role,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.726
because it's a very fancy actor.

00:05:17.726 --> 00:05:21.268
So I wouldn't say that the
dash as an actor can perform

00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:23.644
the same roles as terminal punctuation,

00:05:23.644 --> 00:05:26.507
as periods or question
marks or exclamation points,

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:28.512
but rather I would say that
it is cutting off the sentence

00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:30.867
before we can even get to
where those would live.

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:32.820
- [Voiceover] Okay, yeah, it's saying

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.339
there would've been more
words in this sentence

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.775
and then terminal punctuation, but.

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:38.736
- [Voiceover] So that's
what dashes can do.

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:40.640
They are used to mark interruptions

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.279
in the structure of a sentence, like,

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.037
"I ran to the bus stop--but the bus

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:47.804
"had already driven away."

00:05:47.804 --> 00:05:49.556
- [Voiceover] They can
act like parentheses

00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:51.558
when they're used in pairs, so like,

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:54.301
"The bug--which landed on
my nose--had to be the size

00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:55.952
"of a softball."

00:05:55.952 --> 00:05:57.520
- [Voiceover] You can
use them like a colon

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.687
to lead into lists or to link an idea.

00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:05.021
So, "I have only ever
wanted one thing--snacks."

00:06:05.021 --> 00:06:07.643
- [Voiceover] And they can
indicate interruptions in speech,

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:08.775
like, "Watch out for that--"

00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:10.004
- [Voiceover] Wham.

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:10.925
- [Voiceover] That was good.

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:12.205
- [Voiceover] Thanks.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.625
And those are the functions of the dash.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.809
- [Voiceover] You got it.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.210
- [Voiceover] You can learn anything.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.043
David out.

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:19.062
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
