00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's look at how the distinction between static friction

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and kinetic friction applies to the rolling wheel.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Assume that the wheel first occupies this position

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then rolls on towards this position a fraction of a second later.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This would be the distance covered by the car.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's mark the same distance on the perimeter of the wheel.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If the wheel was rolling without slipping, it would have rotated by this angle,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but we want to study breaking so there will be a certain amount of slippage

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between the road and the wheel.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The road will not turn by this complete angle. It will turn with less.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There would be a certain amount of distance left marked in blue.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This leads to the definition of wheel slip.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Wheel slip is the ratio of that missing distance to the distance traveled by the car.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we have perfect rolling, there won't be any difference.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The wheel slip becomes zero. It won't move at all.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The blue distance equals the red distance and the wheel slip becomes one.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now one can study how friction depends on wheel slip.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If a wheel slip equals one, the wheels are locked. They don't move with respect to the car.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
They slide on the streets, which means that we are in the regime of kinetic friction.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The coefficient of friction will be less than optimum.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If the wheel slip equals zero, the wheel is rolling perfectly,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the car only experiences the rolling friction, which is so small that we neglect it here

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and simply set the friction to zero.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When there's just a slight amount of slippage between the wheel and the surface,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the wheel develops the maximum friction. What's going to follow?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we're working with one single curve to describe

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
how the coefficient of friction depends on the wheel slip.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Actually, that's far from true.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
With the higher speed of the car, friction will be reduced,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and of course if there's water or ice on the street, we see a very strong reduction of friction.

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
To keep things manageable, however, we're going to stick to one single curve.
