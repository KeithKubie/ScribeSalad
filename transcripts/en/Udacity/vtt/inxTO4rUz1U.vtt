What if we added a whole new pizza
to the one we already ordered?

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.870
That means we have two pizzas and

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.670
they're both cut into eight slices,
each full pizza is eight over eight.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.816
How many pieces of pizza are there and
two whole pizzas?

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.911
