00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.590
We're progressing toward
the learning health system.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.710
As a result of the federal efforts
we'll discuss in lesson two,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.090
electronic record adoption
levels are very high.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.120
And the focus is now shifting
to the next challenge,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.240
the inability of the hundreds
of systems in use to share data.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.730
The term for this is interoperability.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.200
And we'll discuss it in
more detail in lesson 5B.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.910
We'll place particular
emphasis on a new approach

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.510
that is rapidly gaining traction, and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.170
that appears to provide a long-sought
practical solution to interoperability.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.640
It's called Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources, or

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.274
FHIR, F-H-I-R.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.710
Through FHIR, access is provided by
web services such as rest API's.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.050
And health care data is packaged
in the JSON or XML formats.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340
Or to use widely on the internet and
by other industries.
