00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:07.858
Hello. I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to. Well seeing how we are at the end of Nickelodeon Month.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.809
I can safely say that I am not the least bit happy.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.599
Why?

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.380
Because I have to review what many consider to be a double order of

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.460
bullshit with extra crap and a side order of dick cheese

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.400
 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.880
The fast-food abomination simply known as Good Burger

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.660
Based off the hit sketch performed on the kids show All That, Good Burger was an attempt to take one line

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.110
"Welcome to Good Burger home of the Good Burger,

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.760
can I take your order?"

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230
And somehow turn that into an hour and a half movie. "Welcome to Good  Burger home of the Good Burger,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.419
can I take your order?" No but you can take this, and shove it up hard!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.360
The film Stars Kel Mitchell reprising his role as Ed, the idiot fast-food attendant who works at the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.079
inappropriately titled Good Burger. It also stars Kenan Thompson, which is weird because he never really starred in any of the good burger sketches

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.279
But who the hell cares let's just get this ass burger review out of the way.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.460
Alright, so it starts off with our protagonist, Ed. "Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger can I take your order?"

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
"Oh!"

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.030
Oh God

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.110
"Eeeed, I see youu"

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.860
What the fuck is that?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.360
"I see you"

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.550
 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.970
"I wanna stay here with you."

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.389
"We love you Ed."

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.889
"Come with us Ed".

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:29.389
 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.889
"Fly Ed, fly"

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:30.389
 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.889
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.000
"Weeee"

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.360
"Whoah, I'm flying with fast food!"

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.860
[Critic mouthing]

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.760
"I'm flying with hamburgers!"

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.360
[Screaming]

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540
Agh! Welcome to Good Burger home of the Good Burger can I take-" Stop, stop. I need a minute.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.520
[Whispers] Pull it together, pull it together!

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.960
So it turns out that opening was just a dream

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.410
But unfortunately the rest of the movie isn't,  as Ed rushes out the door because he's late to work

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.500
This is bad because nobody else at the restaurant knows how to take orders, which really pisses off huge, angry Robert Walls

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.250
"Just give me two Good Burgers! I had it up to here with Good Burger!"

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.580
 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.830
Hey, I don't need this I had a cameo in Batman!

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.440
So we see Ed rushing down the street as he trips into some girls playing jump rope, drags one of them down the street,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.820
accidentally steals a woman's baby, collides with some basketball players, mixes up the basketball with the baby as the baby is dumped into a basketball hoop

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.320
You know what I'm gonna need another minute.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.500
[Sobs]

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.280
So Ed finally makes it to work only to find that there's another restaurant called

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.810
Mondo Burger being built across the street that could be dangerous competition

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240
But their boss isn't worried. "Good Burger has been here for over 40 years and nobody is putting good burger out of business

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.180
[Chorus of "Yeahs"]

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.920
[Record stopping sound]

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.180
[Dialogue rewound]

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.650
Abe Vigoda what are you doing? Is there just really no movie that you'll say no to?

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.320
I mean, did you read the script? You know it couldn't have been a good movie!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.767
My guess is he was in some sort of contract or something.

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.250
It probably went something like this.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.758
[NC] "Abe, the president of Nickelodeon says you had to do the Good Burger movie."

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.740
"He can't do that. It screws up all my arrangements."

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.500
[NC]"Sorry Abe, you're under contract."

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.220
"Tom can you get me off the hook?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.660
For old times sake."

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.580
[NC] Can't do it, Abe."

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.500
[NC] "Come on. You get to wear the little hat and everything."

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.720
So we then cut to our other main character Dexter, who's in a classroom being taught by- Oh Jesus no

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.849
[sigh] Being taught by Sinbad with an outfit made of wrapping paper and a haircut modeled after a blowfish.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.923
His personality though? That's a little harder to figure out.

00:03:48.923 --> 00:03:50.419
"I know you're thinking, my brother, WHY?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.880
Why would this man give us a test on the last day of school before summer start, well I'm gon' tell you why because- [hits desk]

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.910
The mind never sleeps."

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.220
Right on my mid-seventies-early-eighties-black-panther-hippie-environmentalist-blacksploitation-flower-child...brother?

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.000
 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.400
Dexter thinks he's out of school for the summer which means he can spend the rest of his time partying,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.180
but there's a change of plan when he accidentally crashes into Ronald McDonald here.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.380
"See when I left school today, I didn't think I was gonna run into you this summer, I didn't think you was gonna run into me!

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.880
 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.540
I mean just right into me like this, you in trouble young man you in trouble with me!"

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.680
"No listen Mr. Weed(?) It wasn't my fault see this nut on some rollerblades.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.320
He skated into my vision sight and I couldn't see nothin' so I swerved and I was spinnin' around-"

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.260
Okay, how long does this scene go?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.880
"Do you know how much that car cost me?"

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.380
"No"

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.580
"Do you know?!"

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.160
"No"

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.360
"That's a $22,000 car. $22,000! And that's just the base price.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.440
Give me your drivers license."

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.940
"Um, regarding my drivers license-"

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.940
Alright, seriously, did they just run out of script?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.960
I mean it seems like they're just making this shit up now.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.840
[Unfunny dialogue about Dexter not having a drivers license or insurance]

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.609
"Yes, I hate to do this young man. I hate to put a black man in jail. I'm gon' have to call the police."

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.530
"You ain't got to- I'm just a kid!"

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.320
It's like they knew they had no story a little jokes so they just told the actors to make some crap up off the top of their heads.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.400
We have to fill that hour and a half movie somehow. What should I talk about? Who cares, it's just a kids film, it's not like you have to try.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.129
My God, they're still going! This could be handled with just one line of dialogue." Oh shit, I need a job." Why is that so hard?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.360
Finally a different scene- no no c'mon! How much longer do I have to see Raggedy Anne and that pincushion argue?!

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.540
Just get on with it! Get on with it! Oh wait no not that way, I didn't mean it like that just no no that's wrong that's wrong!

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.040
Bad touch! Bad touch, that's a very bad touch! Very bad no no stop it- alright I have no choice!

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.480
ELEPHANT!

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.300
[Angelic singing]

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.180
Oh, I never thought that would be my call back to reality, but I'll take it!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.710
So Dexter has to get a summer job,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.620
y'see, one sentence, that was so much easier. As he applies at the Mondo Burger where everyone dresses like they're at an eighties gym

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.340
"From now on

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.340
your life is

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.060
Mondo Burger.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.619
You can forget about your friends, you can forget about your family,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.420
because Kurt is now both your mother, and your father."

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.440
But Dexter, sadly doesn't seem to fit in.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.400
"Get this loser out of my face!"

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.260
"Loser! Oh now you about to push me a little too far!" "You want a piece of me?"

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.120
"Yeah extra crispy, please!"

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.309
I hope Saturday Night Live ain't watching

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.440
So he goes to a place where his clear lack of talent and absolutely no experience will do him well

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.540
"But you said you wanted nothing on it"

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.249
"Yes, well I expected a meat patty!"  "Dude, a meat patty is something"

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.611
"You said nothing. Fizz, is a meat patty something or nothing?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.260
Don't you get philosophical with me kid. It's not a kind of movie. [Imitating] We're all born to die sir.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.480
So Ed and Dexter finally meet, as Dexter vents his "whoahs" (woes)

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.900
"One more Good Shake" "Good, good, keep 'em coming."

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.740
"Um, dude, don't you think you've had enough?"

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:13.040
[Slurring] Don't tell me when I've had enough Shakes, I'll tell you when I've had enough Shakes.[Crying] I'm sorry I didn't mean to snap at you

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.820
I'll chase it down with some fries.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.559
So Ed tries to convince his boss that Dexter should begin the job at Good Burger

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.390
"Hey Mr. Bailey, this guy needs a job can he have one?" "No!" End of the movie bye

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.180
"C'mon Mr. Bailey he really needs one, he can do fries." "Otis does fries."

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.780
"Yeah, but look at him, how much longer could he possibly live?"

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.230
Nothing can kill me, I'm Abe Vigoda

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.940
"All right"

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.960
So Dexter is hired on as one of his jobs is to make deliveries in- I'm not kidding the burger mobile.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.500
"Come on. I'll take you for a spin!"

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:52.940
[Batman theme and accompanying sound effects]

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.480
 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.360
But all is not well as the ruler of Mondo Burger comes in to intimidate our heroes.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.419
"The second we open our doors, good burger goes in the grinder"

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.580
What's up with this kid? It's like someone put Sting, Frankie Muniz and Ben Stiller in a blender, it's kind of surreal

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.060
"I'm Ed, huh."  "Well, Ed, you better watch your butt, man"

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.510
"Okay"

00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:40.539
So mondo burger does open up to probably the most overblown Fast-food restaurant opening ever

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:46.160
Even planet Hollywood doesn't get this type of opening. I mean, what are they expecting to see in there?

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.580
Oh my God they have fries!

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.260
Honest-to-God fries!

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.420
So they take a look at one of the mondo burgers to see why their business is doing so well

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.220
"It's huge!"  "How do they do it?" My God they use actual meat, no raccoons at all

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.390
So Ed asks Dexter if he wants to hang out and-

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.919
"Do you think you get me to a hospital? I think I broke my ass."

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.059
Okay, yeah, I'm convinced now that Abe wasn't supposed to be in this movie

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.909
He just wandered onto the set threw on the costume and start walking around bumping into people. They were just like hey

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.280
He's not hurting anyone just keep them in the movie

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:31.450
You were in Godfather man show some dignity! As Ed and Dexter become more acquainted with each other it discovered that they have a

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:38.200
Complicated relationship. "I don't like you, can you get that through your head?". "Look, I'm grape nose boy!

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:45.700
Bloobity bloopity bloopity bloopity Bloobity bloopity bloopity bloopity

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:54.249
[This goes on for some time]

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
[NC yells shut up repeatedly]

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.460
[Insanity]

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.860
 

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:26.589
"Made you laugh!"  My God I just realized what this is, this is Dante's 11th level of hell

00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:30.040
He just didn't write about cuz he thought it would be too scary for people to comprehend

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.720
[Voice over] And lo and behold an obnoxious douchebag with unconvincing dreads will

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.020
put grapes in his nose and constantly shout "bloopity bloopity bloopity bloopity" and it will be called the

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:44.199
11th level of Hell

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:50.259
Dante then wet himself and cried in fear. So turns out, Ed brings his own special sauce that

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:53.558
He made himself as people pass the round they realize it's pretty good

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.618
I personally don't trust anything that looks like a blended fraggle

00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:00.249
But everyone else seems [to] as they marketed to the people raising their profits again

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:05.589
But dexter makes Ed sign a contract that lets dexter have 80% of all the money that they [make] on the sauce

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:11.408
Presumably high as a kite that agrees and continues to be shed upon by the people he thinks he knows and loves well

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.419
Here you go ed. You get to keep

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:16.269
$13 wow that's almost

00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:17.929
$14, huh?

00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:20.019
[wow], that is the stupidest thing

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:24.578
I've ever heard plain and simple but Edie being a sentimental guy ask dexter

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:31.058
If he wants to hang out on the rooftop and just look at the stars yeah apparently Ed's deep what kind of problems

00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:32.640
Do you have?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.049
Most of them sided when I was a little kid, that's when my dad [left] me and my mom

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:45.089
Must have lived in 15 places since then wait wait a minute. Are you actually trying to have a moment?

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:47.609
are you actually trying to emote an

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.839
emotion

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.839
other than disgust [I]

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.630
remember the last time I saw my dad I

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.240
Was seven years old [I'm] sorry. It's a little hard to get into this moment. Well one of the last scenes

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.080
We saw was I think I broke my ass that makes a little tricky [I]?

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.779
Give up. I'm going on

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.700
And I enact him I'm really going home fuck this movie

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.190
The next day they get a call to deliver a special order to the holy other celebrity they [could] afford in [this] movie

00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:23.969
Feel hungry take the food take everybody

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.860
Just please don't do any rapid so the gift shake is order and even managed to get a little

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.859
Endorsement from him. Oh good. This is back in the days when is endorsements actually meant so order tomatoes on this good burger

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.860
I don't see no tomatoes well, [manga]

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:43.709
Consider yourself tomato. Huh? Wow, that's pretty badly and making Shaquille o'neal look like a good actor

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:50.339
Meanwhile [Mama] burger is just please the good burger sales are suddenly rising as it just steams their PVC spaces

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.680
Good burger is still in business

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:59.489
Well, what are we supposed [to] do about it our burgers are already twice the size of [an] [sceptic] may I recommend firing our photon

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.329
Torpedoes at the restaurant

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:03.329
kitchen, yes, sir

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.899
Make our burgers bigger bigger foot. They're already

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.950
but

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:19.150
There's still the problem as to how does [not] that special sauce and created so they decide [to] send in a beautiful woman to seduce

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.499
end and get his secret ingredients if anyone can get the sauce better pet

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.109
She can okay. [I] don't [wanna] know how she gets the sauce out of [idi]. I just assume. That's private oh

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.310
I felt that a while

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.710
So Roxanne tries to seduce Ed

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.469
But our attempts are [fetal] against a thick wall in this you are so hot oh

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:51.579
I often sweat it work. [huh] my God hallmark cards are funnier than this so you hungry

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.110
Yes, I am hungry

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.970
but not for food

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.970
I'm hungry for you. Oh

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.670
Well, well, I'm not edible

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.559
So it agrees to go out with Roxanna. [oh]

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.939
Hold up, well somebody give aid some direction back there

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.299
Give him a cookie or something [can] he come on [this] [ain't] A-Gonna. Not a dishrag. He's the funniest thing in this movie

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.300
[I] don't even think it's supposed to be there

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.629
So hank goes out with Roxanne [as] dexter also asked to have his coworker named monique

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:31.449
But I think he's doing that because he secretly wanted I mean look at them. They look exactly alike

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.309
I think that some closed doors here that need to be opened, [so] we roxanne tries to get intimate with N

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.440
But this turns out to be extraordinarily dangerous and she discovers that love hurts even more than she knows

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.910
Abuse to women is funny

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:53.290
After roxanne gives up at the hip love burglar and in dexter start to suspect foul play as they think Mondo burger is using illegal

00:14:53.450 --> 00:15:00.160
Chemicals to make their food larger so they disguised themselves as on jesus really you're gonna go the drag route what?

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.830
What?

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.770
Why if I didn't know better? I'd say you were from a subpar childish sketch comedy show

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.840
After they [worked] their way inside our two heroes find out Mondo Burgers dirty little secret

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.290
people

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.459
No, it turns out that they were using illegal chemicals

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:30.730
But our heroes are caught as the head of mondo burger decides to do the first logical thing in this movie have them both committed

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.070
Finally it should have done at the beginning of them

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.209
So the [two-part] taken idiot interrupted as they try to figure out a way to [escape]

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:44.230
But while that's going on the mondo burger people partake admission implausible as they try to sabotage ed's sauce making everyone who eats it

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.350
incredibly sick

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.589
Let's go guy here guys you woke up abe

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:57.600
abe says he's gonna call the police, but the mondo burger decides to have him committed to I somehow doubt that was very hard

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.210
So our three nut jobs are stuck in a mental institution and have to figure a logical way out that solution

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.939
start a synchronized dance number! Of course, look at them go! You know, for the mentally disabled

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.819
they sure do have good on-the-fly dance choreography

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.619
I'm really impressed and as your sense of impossibility may have told you don't

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.700
Guards start dancing to [queue] up, let's go over here and dance

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.700
I think it's our job to stop out-of-control stuff like this

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.299
But pretty sure if we let our guard down once nothing bad can happen oh

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:33.059
So that's why we're not paying well okay, so they steal the keys get out of the room

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.590
But how are they going to get out of the actual building?  One of the local crazies decides to help them out.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.330
You know for as bad as this movie is, I do like its sudden burst of cruelty

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.429
But how's a frail old man like a pagoda gonna get out of there , [and] that's the last we ever saw him

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.580
It's okay. I landed on the fat kid

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.799
they all tried to make it a good burger to stop the customers from getting sick as a suddenly turns out to be  the end of the

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800
Benny Hill Show

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:16.300
(upbeat music playing)

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:23.080
Yeah, that's nice crashing the car breaks some teeth and endanger people's lives, but at least the good burger will stay open

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.140
But Ed and Dexter make it in time as Ed stops an old lady from eating one of the burgers. This needs to be censored

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:35.559
so Ed and Dexter explained about the sauce and stop all the orders just before they hatch a plan to break into Mondo Burger and

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.900
expose them for the liar's they are but first this joke.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.000
I need a hot jakozzi

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.660
You know, what fuck it

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:53.290
So they figure out a plan to get into the mondo burger and get rid of all their chemicals

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:59.110
Gee I sure have a hungry for some rold gold pretzels right now. How do you expect me to get up there?

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.250
Oh, it's easy

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.530
You just jump on a burger jump on the fry and then you hop on a cup and then shimmy up the straw

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.560
What is this, American gladiators?

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.200
What is that, a joke?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.000
so they break into the mondo burger and try to intimidate the rest of the cook

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.900
Mama never had one of these

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.379
with the electronic numbers we always had to turn the knob

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.000
If I was you, I wouldn't come any closer.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Stand back.. I think that's real ketchup.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.839
OH NO, how are they gonna? Go around the restaurant covered in Ketchup and Mustard?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.320
That's just silly

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.200
That's right. Smack your ass just show us what a likeable character you are. You little troublemaker?

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.050
Uh oh

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.589
How's Ed gonna screw it up this time?

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.290
*sensible chuckling*

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:54.519
Ed, you nincompoop, but I bet it'll all work out in the end somehow.. It always does

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.810
Uh Oh! It looks like all those chemicals are causing the burgers to explode!

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:04.350
That's so out of the ordinary. I dare call it wacky!  You people had better run faster

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.769
There's no telling what other zany antics could possibly follow

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:14.010
Ooo it's that character that nobody likes. (heavy sarcasm) Do you think he'll get his comeuppance in the end? Well, that all depends.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.900
Do you want cheese on that?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.100
Oh ho ho

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.939
It looks like God is finally smoting you for making jingle all the way, sinbad. 
 Good luck trying to clean that up

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.800
What a mess!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.249
Well, it looks like our two lovable skanks and finally come out on top

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.550
They were scary moments at times, but was there ever any doubt that

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:39.629
They'd make it in the end.  I don't think so.  So, after *all* this wild crazy and totally off-the-wall antics

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.710
How else can they possibly end this movie besides saying the classic line?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.910
Welcome to good burger home of the good burger. Can I take your order?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.069
You certainly can ed. You certainly can

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.500
DIIIIIIIIEEEE!

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.600
This is crap. It's got awful good burger?  Good God! What a lot of shit

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.689
it's like if shit could shit and that shit could shit and that shit could shit and that shit to raise money to put together a

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.000
Team of Filmmakers directors of steaming flaming pile of shit.  you forever

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.900
My advice is leave this order a monkey puke forever

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.810
And never look back as long as you live or even after you die

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.530
because that way at least God knows you're trying to do better. I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:40.300
About this contract man ... What do you say we just forget it.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.000
You don't want to be partners?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.400
Well, no. See....

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.200
Is it because I'm black?

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.500
AHH, a funny joke!
