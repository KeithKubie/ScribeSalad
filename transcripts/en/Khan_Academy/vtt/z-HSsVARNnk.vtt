00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Instructor] Caterina was testing

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.290
her null hypothesis is that the true

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.970
population mean of some
data set is equal to zero

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.810
versus her alternative hypothesis,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.110
is that it's not equal to zero and then

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.520
she takes a sample of six observations

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.160
and then using that sample her

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.990
test statistic, I can never say that,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
test statistic was T is equal to 2.75.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.820
Assume that the conditions
for inference were met.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.310
What is the approximate
P-value for Caterina's test?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.610
Like always, pause this video and

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.320
see if you can figure it out.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.090
I just always like to remind ourselves

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.260
what's going on here, so
there's some population here.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.890
She has a null hypothesis that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.300
the mean is equal to
zero, or the alternative

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.180
is that it's not equal to zero.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.220
She wants to test her null hypothesis

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.450
so she takes a sample of size six.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.000
From that, since the population parameter

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.750
we care about is a population mean,

00:00:57.697 --> 00:00:58.800
she would calculate the sample mean

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.520
in order to estimate that and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.880
the sample standard deviation.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.110
From that, we can calculate this T value.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.080
The T value is going to be equal to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.000
the difference between her sample mean

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.370
and the assumed population mean

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.370
from the null hypothesis, that's what

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.477
this little sub zero means, it means

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.141
it's the assumed mean from the

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.700
null hypothesis, divided by our

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.610
estimate of the standard deviation

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.070
of the sampling and distribution.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.910
I say estimate because unlike when

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.894
we were dealing with proportions,

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:31.514
with proportions we can actually

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:32.480
calculate the assumed, based on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.060
the null hypothesis, sampling distribution

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.990
standard deviation, but
here we have to estimate it.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.650
It's going to be our
sample standard deviation

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.890
divided by the square root of N.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.100
In this example, they
calculated all of this for us.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.996
They said hey, this is going to

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:49.530
be equal to 2.75 and so we can just

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.219
use that to figure out our P-value.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.340
Let's just think about what
that is asking us to do.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.750
The null hypothesis is
that the mean is zero.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.240
The alternative is is that
it is not equal to zero.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.990
This is a situation where, if we're

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.240
looking at the T
distribution right over here,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.750
my quick drawing of a T distribution.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.480
If this is the mean of our T distribution,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.210
what we care about is things that are

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.270
at least 2.75 above the mean and at least

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.670
2.75 below the mean because we care

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.860
about things that are
different from the mean,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.990
not just things that are greater than

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.470
the mean or less than the mean.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.350
We would look at, we would say

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.300
what's the probability of getting

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.300
a T value that is 2.75
or more above the mean,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.690
and similarly, what's the probability of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.690
getting a T value that is
2.75 or more below the mean?

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.730
This is negative 2.75 right over there.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.700
What we have here is a T table

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340
and a T table is a little bit different

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.030
than a Z table because there's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.470
several things going on.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.000
First of all, you have
your degrees of freedom.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.350
That's just going to be
your sample size minus one.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.270
In this example, our sample size is six,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.476
so six minus one is five, and so

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:14.476
we are going to be in
this row right over here.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.630
Then what you want to do is,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.340
you want to look up your T value.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
This is T distribution critical values,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.140
so we want to look up 2.75 on this row.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.740
We see 2.75, it's a little bit less

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.090
than that but that's the closest value.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.960
It's a good bit more than this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.780
right over here, so it's a little bit

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.820
closer to this value than this value.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.010
Our tail probability, and remember,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.940
this is only giving us this probability

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910
right over here, our tail probability

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.910
is going to be between 0.025 and 0.02

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.310
and it's going to be closer to this one.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.550
It's gonna be approximately this.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.020
It'll actually be a little bit greater

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.315
because we're gonna go a little bit

00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:00.800
in that direction because
we are less than 2.757.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.000
We can say this is approximately 0.02.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:07.310
That's 0.02 approximately,
the T distribution

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.960
is symmetric, this is going
to be approximately 0.02.

00:04:11.257 --> 00:04:13.160
Our P-value, which is going to be

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.690
the probability of getting a T value

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.690
that is at least 2.75 above the mean

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.379
or 2.75 below the mean, the P-value

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:30.880
is going to be approximately the sum

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.840
of these areas, which is 0.04.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.260
Then of course, Caterina would want

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.660
to compare that to her significance level

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.600
that she set ahead of time, and if this

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.960
is lower than that, then she would

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.930
reject the null hypothesis and that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.380
would suggest the alternative.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.760
If this is not lower than her

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.650
significance level, well then she would

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.020
not be able to reject her null hypothesis.
