00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.897
is focus on the budget
process in the US Congress.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.036
And just as a reminder, that's
one of the major functions

00:00:10.036 --> 00:00:13.619
of the United States
Congress is to pass a budget

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.048
for the Executive Branch
to decide how much money

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:21.516
the Executive Branch has to
use to actually function.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.667
And when it comes to the budget,

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.026
the two most powerful committees are

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.614
the Appropriations Committees

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:31.108
in the House of Representatives
and in the Senate.

00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:33.552
They get to decide how much money goes

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:36.114
to various departments and programs

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.696
in the federal government.

00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:41.678
Just for context, let's
get a broad view of what

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:43.495
the federal budget looks like

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:46.623
and how it has changed over time.

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:50.541
So over here you see the
trend from the early 80s

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:53.838
all the way until projected
a few years into the future

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:56.344
at the time of this video being created.

00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:59.804
And you can see the absolute
level of the federal budget

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.358
has gone from a little under $1 trillion

00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:06.525
and it is now approaching $4 trillion.

00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:12.345
And this view of the breakdown
of the various spending areas

00:01:12.345 --> 00:01:14.983
gives us a better sense of some trends.

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:18.648
As we mentioned in other videos,
there's a significant chunk

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.608
of mandatory spending.

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:23.783
Mandatory spending are things that by law

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.627
we have already obligated ourselves to.

00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:30.049
And the big ones here are
Social Security and Medicare

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.099
and you can see that they
have gone collectively

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.688
from a little over 20%
of the federal budget

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:40.855
to now approaching almost
2/3 of the federal budget.

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:44.933
Now another chunk of this
budget that we are obligated

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:49.098
to pay is the net interest
on our national debt.

00:01:49.098 --> 00:01:51.044
We are borrowers as a country

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.186
and so we need to pay interest.

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:55.164
Now everything else here you can consider

00:01:55.164 --> 00:01:56.528
to be discretionary.

00:01:56.528 --> 00:01:59.326
That would be this national defense piece

00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.303
right here in purple and then everything

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:04.067
above this net interest piece.

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.748
And that's what the Appropriations
Committees are going

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:09.424
to decide on, where to spend that money.

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.881
How much does national
defense get and how much

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.947
do these other priorities
for the country get?

00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:18.530
Now generally speaking, the
amount of money allocated

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.669
to various programs and
various departments,

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.788
how it is spent tends to be
decided by the Executive Branch.

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.420
Congress's job is to set the budget

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.724
but that is not always the case.

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:35.051
Congress can also set aside
portions of this budget

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:36.884
for specific projects.

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:40.869
And the setting aside
of parts of the budget

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.452
for specific projects
is known as earmarks.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.445
And to make things tangible,
here are some examples

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:53.612
of earmarks from the Highway
Bill that was passed in 2005.

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:57.698
And as you can see, it just lists a bunch

00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:00.951
of special projects and
this goes on for tens

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:03.668
and sometimes hundreds of pages.

00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:06.492
So here in California,
there's a project to construct

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:09.995
safe access to streets for
bicyclists and pedestrians

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:12.137
including crosswalks, sidewalks,

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.955
and traffic calming measures

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:16.622
in Covena, California, $400,000.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.173
If we go down here to number
five, renovate and expand

00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:24.309
National Packard Museum
and adjacent historic

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:28.723
Packard facilities, and
that is almost $3 million.

00:03:28.723 --> 00:03:30.949
And so one thing that's
probably crossing your mind

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.996
is hey, this is a national
highway bill and you have

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:38.665
these little projects that
seem very, very, very local.

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:41.390
And these earmarks here, these set asides,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.224
because they feel sometimes
wasteful or they're being used

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.395
more as a political tool versus something

00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:50.322
that the federal government
should actually worry about,

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:53.294
sometimes these types of
earmarks are referred to

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:55.294
as pork barrel projects,

00:03:58.116 --> 00:03:59.866
pork barrel projects.

00:04:01.412 --> 00:04:04.707
And the reason why I introduced
both words are earmarks

00:04:04.707 --> 00:04:05.861
are just a general thing.

00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:08.004
You can decide whether
they're good or bad.

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:10.275
Many of those earmarks that I
listed, even though they are

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:13.136
for specific projects
in specific locations,

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:15.692
they seemed at least
related to the Highway Bill,

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:18.331
but it would be very reasonable
for some folks to say

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:19.650
why is Congress in the business

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.003
of funding these specific projects?

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:24.848
Isn't it their job to just set the budget

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:27.183
to figure out how much the
Department of Transportation

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.350
gets and then let them, as
part of the Executive Branch,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.023
decide how to execute on improving

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.396
the national highway system
or our transportation system?

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:38.950
And so they would argue that that is pork,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.093
that those are pork barrel projects,

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:42.906
that those are government waste.

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:45.545
Now to get a sense of
how significant earmarks

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:49.838
and debatably pork barrel
have been in the past,

00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:53.789
we have this chart from Citizens
Against Government Waste

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.789
and it shows earmark
spending from 1991 to 2016.

00:04:58.773 --> 00:05:01.454
And you will immediately
notice some things.

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:05.578
Going from 1991 all the
way until about 2006,

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:09.123
you have this steady upward
trend in earmark spending

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:11.567
all the way to the peak in 2006

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:13.817
of $29 billion of earmarks.

00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:16.561
But then something interesting happens.

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:20.065
In 2011, it looks like it
gets pretty close to zero

00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.084
and then it starts trending up from there,

00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:24.478
but it's much lower that it was before

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:28.645
and that's because as we get
into this period after 2006,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.246
earmark spending became a
very big political issue.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:36.069
Some of these projects,
there was famously an earmark

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.873
for a bridge to an island
in Alaska that was going

00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:41.679
to cost several hundreds
of millions of dollars.

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:44.068
It was later canceled
but it got a lot of press

00:05:44.068 --> 00:05:46.372
and a lot of politicians
started to make it their mission

00:05:46.372 --> 00:05:48.685
to do away with earmark spending.

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:51.199
Some of these pork
barrel projects were easy

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.518
to get people worked up about,

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:55.608
and say, hey look, this is
a sign of government waste.

00:05:55.608 --> 00:05:58.542
And so in the end of 2010, both the Senate

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:01.388
and the House of Representatives
passed resolutions

00:06:01.388 --> 00:06:04.164
to end earmark spending,
although you can see

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:07.032
that it still exists in
some way, at least according

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:09.632
to the Citizens Against Government Waste.

00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:14.577
Now at first, this seems
very good because $29 billion

00:06:14.577 --> 00:06:18.731
on things like museums or maybe
bridges that go to islands

00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:21.037
that very few people live on does not seem

00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:22.107
like a good idea.

00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:25.598
It seems like classic
examples of government waste.

00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:28.188
But it's also important
to keep it in context.

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:32.721
Remember the federal budget
is approach $4 trillion.

00:06:32.721 --> 00:06:35.890
So even in 2006, when the
federal budget was a little

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.176
under $3 trillion, this was only about 1%

00:06:40.176 --> 00:06:42.688
of the federal budget.

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:45.575
And so even though earmarks,
which often get called

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:48.172
pork barrel projects,
became a lightning rod

00:06:48.172 --> 00:06:49.614
for a lot of media attention

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:51.962
because they seemed so wasteful,

00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:55.005
in most years, they
represent well under 1%

00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.526
of the federal budget.

00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:58.947
And there are folks who would
even argue that earmarks

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:03.466
are a good thing by essentially
allowing Congresspeople

00:07:03.466 --> 00:07:07.633
to set aside an earmark for
something in their district.

00:07:08.648 --> 00:07:11.690
It makes it easier for bills to get passed

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.274
and it's only costing us
less than 1% to do it,

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:17.127
and it's only something
that's streamlining

00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:18.818
the political process.

00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:22.233
Other arguments they make is
these earmarks aren't spending

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.741
above and beyond the regular budget.

00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:28.494
If they do not set aside
this money for these projects

00:07:28.494 --> 00:07:31.461
in these various districts
or in these various states,

00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:34.261
well, then the Executive
Branch is just going to decide

00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:35.988
on how to use that money.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:38.865
And ideally the Executive
Branch would open these things

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:41.501
up for bid, these would
be competitive processes,

00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:43.314
but there's examples
of the Executive Branch

00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:46.943
also favoring certain
regions or certain projects.

00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:49.088
So the budget could arguably be the same

00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:51.193
whether or not there are those earmarks.

00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:53.666
It's really a question
of whether it is Congress

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:56.381
that is deciding where
these special projects go

00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:59.222
or whether it is the Executive Branch.

00:07:59.222 --> 00:08:01.286
Now another term that you might often hear

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:02.808
with the legislative process, something

00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:07.632
that helps streamline it,
is the germ logrolling.

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:10.227
Now logrolling can apply
to a lot of things,

00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:12.785
not just in terms of
where you spend money.

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:16.125
Logrolling is just the idea
that let's say that I am

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:20.075
Congressperson A and you
are Congressperson B,

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:23.742
and I really like this
bill right over here.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.957
I like bill number one and
you like bill number two,

00:08:28.957 --> 00:08:33.124
and I agree to support you,
if you agree to support me.

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:36.488
Here I describe logrolling
where we support

00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:39.123
each others bills but we
could even have logrolling

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:41.434
where we support each
others parts of bills.

00:08:41.434 --> 00:08:44.857
For example, I'll support
your transportation museum

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:49.725
in your state, if you support
my bicycle path in my state.

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:51.456
So I'll leave you there.

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:54.137
The big takeaways here
are to appreciate the size

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:56.939
of the federal budget,
where it gets spent,

00:08:56.939 --> 00:08:59.738
and some of the processes
used to help pass

00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:01.260
that federal budget.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.386
We also talked about earmarks
which sometimes get called

00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:06.171
pork barrel projects.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:07.432
And it's interesting
for you to think about

00:09:07.432 --> 00:09:10.642
after this video, are
they good or are they bad?

00:09:10.642 --> 00:09:13.032
At first, especially when you
look at the media attention,

00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:16.285
they seem clearly bad, they seem wasteful.

00:09:16.285 --> 00:09:18.884
But when you think about
that they're less than 1%

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:22.219
of the budget, and they might
help streamline the passing

00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:25.311
of other important legislation,
maybe making it even

00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:28.150
more bipartisan, who
knows, some would argue

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.188
that they might not be as
bad as people first believed.

00:09:32.188 --> 00:09:33.188
You decide.
