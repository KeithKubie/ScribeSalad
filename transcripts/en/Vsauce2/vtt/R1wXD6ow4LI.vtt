Vsauce!

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
Kevin here.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.880
Plymouth Colonists and Wampanoag Native Americans
shared an autumn feast in 1621 marking what

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.980
many refer to as the first Thanksgiving.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
Four men were sent on a "fowling mission"
to prepare for the three day event.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.600
It's believed they brought back wild turkey
which were in abundance at the time, thus

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.920
starting the tradition of eating turkey on
Thanksgiving in the United States.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.510
A holiday often referred to as "Turkey Day"

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.739
Only 1% of the population of Japan is estimated
to be Christian so Christmas is obviously

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.399
not a national holiday.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:42.030
But in 1974 KFC's marketing campaign "Kentucky
For Christmas" was a huge hit and remains

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819
popular to this day.

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:49.019
The lines of people waiting for a bucket of
chicken can be over two hours long and some

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.609
order their holiday chicken buckets months
in advance.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.210
Italian tradition states that Le Befana flies
around Italy leaving fruits, nuts candy for

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.070
good children and coal candy for bad ones.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.070
It's said she sheltered the three wise men
for a night and when asked to join them on

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.440
their journey to find the infant baby jesus
she declined because she had too much housework.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
The next day she regretted her decision and
tried to find them unsuccessfully.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.070
So to this day Le Befana flies around on her
broomstick looking for the baby Jesus and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.390
giving candy, good or bad, to children.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.860
King's cake is known in many different countries
but has become especially popular in the Southern

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.600
United States during Mardi Gras celebrations
originally brought by colonists from France

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600
and Spain.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.270
The cake is often made from twisted cinnamon
bread topped with icing featuring a hidden

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.500
plastic baby figurine or other trinket inside.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.890
The person that eats the slice with the trinket
will be blessed with good luck but is then

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.210
obligated to make the next king's cake.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.330
In the 12 seconds before midnight on New Years
Eve in Spain it's tradition to eat 12 grapes,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.360
one with each chime of the bell to predict
your luck for the upcoming year.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.620
Each grape represents a different month of
the year and if you can eat all of the grapes

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.860
it's said to bring prosperity.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.590
It's believed this custom started in 1909
when popular wine growers had an abundance

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.830
of grapes.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.890
Eating red bean paste porridge with small
rice balls is a popular Korean tradition for

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.560
the Winter Solstice.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.640
Red beans symbolize the chasing away of evil
spirits and the rice balls symbolize new life.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.090
Bowls of this porridge are placed around the
house to ward off evil and if you eat the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.130
same number of rice balls as your age it symbolizes
the successful passing of the upcoming year.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.920
Pan de Muerto or bread of the dead is made
in the weeks prior to Dia de los Muertos - celebrated

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.650
on November 1st and 2nd in Mexico.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.060
The bread is enjoyed by the family of the
deceased and set upon the altar of loved ones

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
that have passed and it's often decorated
with bones and a tear.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.440
Other dishes are also placed on the altar
to help feed the traveling souls of the dead.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.260
Finally, France is Europe's number one producer,
exporter and consumer of oysters and 50% of

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.070
their annual oyster consumption occurs between
Christmas and New Years.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.600
So if you're in France during that time - you'll
probably be eating oysters.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.890
If you like eating oysters.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.240
Whether you're eating grapes, oysters, turkey,
or around a tiny plastic baby - have a happy

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.840
holiday and as always - thanks for watching.
