00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
- [Tutor] Let's talk a little bit about

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.005
the short run and long run Phillips curve,

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.790
now they're named after the
economist, Bill Phillips,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.272
who saw in the 1950s

00:00:08.272 --> 00:00:10.960
what looked like an inverse relationship

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.523
between inflation and
the unemployment rate

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.817
and he was studying decades of datasets

00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:16.136
in the United Kingdom,

00:00:16.136 --> 00:00:18.771
where he saw usually when we had high,

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.020
or when the United Kingdom
had high inflation,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.303
you had relatively low unemployment

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:26.870
and that tended to be when
the economy was doing well,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.310
so he would see these data points

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.390
from the different years
and then he would see

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.339
that when there was a
high unemployment rate,

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.060
when the economy was a little bit slower,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.610
then you had low inflation

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.775
and so he theorized the
existence of a curve,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.929
that could describe this relationship,

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.250
maybe it looks something like this

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.888
and if we take this model
or if we assume this model,

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:53.577
then it would hold that
when the economy is strong,

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:55.534
you have high inflation, low unemployment,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.180
when the economy is weak,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.282
you have high unemployment
and low inflation.

00:01:00.282 --> 00:01:02.925
Now you fast forward to the 1970s

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:05.240
and economists started to see a situation,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.410
where this broke down, in
the 1970s in particular,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.859
you saw situations of stagflation,

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.710
where you had both high
unemployment and high inflation,

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.430
so it didn't seem to
fit the Phillips curve

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.370
and so economists theorized that,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.290
okay, maybe this thing
that Phillips theorized

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.167
is really just what
happens in the short run,

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:29.720
so they said that this is
the short run Phillips curve,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.900
but they theorized that there's actually

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.540
a long run Phillips curve as well,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.340
that describes the natural
rate of unemployment

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.440
or the natural rate of
unemployment you would get,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.030
when the economy is at full employment

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670
and remember, full employment doesn't mean

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.280
everyone's employed, it just means

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.520
a sustainable rate of
employment for the country

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.520
and so if we wanted to draw
that long run Phillips curve,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.430
that economists theorized in the 1970s,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.405
it might look something like this

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:00.190
and when you see it as a
vertical line like this,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.550
let me write this, long
run Phillips curve,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.285
it shows that over the long run,

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.970
the unemployment rate would
be this value right over here

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.880
irrespective of what's
going on with inflation

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.700
and so let's say for this economy,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.136
our natural rate of unemployment is 4%

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:22.510
and we see that it is
associated with 1% inflation

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.210
and so you can imagine,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.273
if there's some
perturbations to the economy,

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.750
maybe the economy gets
a little bit overheated,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.850
well then, you could get a little bit

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.740
higher inflation and lower unemployment

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.514
or if the economy slows down a little bit,

00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:39.820
you could have higher
unemployment and lower inflation,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.970
but it should gravitate back
to the long run Phillips curve.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.410
But now let's think about this in context

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.081
of our aggregate demand,
aggregate supply model

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.700
and think about a scenario,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.913
where our short run Phillips
curve could actually shift.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.903
So here we have our typical axes,

00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:58.230
when we're thinking about

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.960
aggregate demand and aggregate supply,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.490
we have real GDP on our horizontal axis,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.460
the price level on our vertical axis

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.490
and so our aggregate demand curve

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.500
might look something like
this, it is downward sloping,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.910
so let's call that our
aggregate demand curve

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.010
and then our short run
aggregate supply curve

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.853
might look something like this,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.080
so as price levels go up in the short run,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.140
people are willing to produce more,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.220
so this is our short run aggregate supply

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.813
and remember, when we talked about

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:36.100
aggregate demand and aggregate supply,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.880
we talked about a notion of
our full employment output,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.860
which is you could view

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.170
as a sustainable rate
of output for an economy

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.810
and we can draw that as a vertical line,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.120
so this right over here

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.100
would be our long run

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.733
aggregate supply

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.010
and where it intersects our real GDP axis,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.150
this is our full employment output,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.589
if you wanna put some numbers on it,

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.834
maybe this is equal too
for a small economy,

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.040
maybe this is equal to 50 billion dollars.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.300
So the way we've just described this,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.600
we are at equilibrium right now,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.380
we are at full employment output,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.880
our economy's producing 50
billion dollars per year

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.040
and our full employment output

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.510
implies an unemployment rate of 4%,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.967
where we have 1% inflation.

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:27.072
Now let's say that there's
some type of a demand shock,

00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:28.170
let's say all of a sudden,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.081
the government wants to
stimulate the economy

00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:33.371
even beyond where it is
here and so you have a,

00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.810
and so they start
spending all of this money

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.670
and so you have a shift in
the aggregate demand curve,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.204
so it would shift to the right,

00:04:41.204 --> 00:04:43.140
so the aggregate demand curve

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.740
would now look something like this,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.115
let's call that aggregate demand two,

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:49.412
well, what happens now?

00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:52.290
And we've seen this in previous videos,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.731
now you have, we go from
this equilibrium point,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.840
which was at this full employment output

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.840
and at this price level, let's
call that price level one

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.078
and now we are at this equilibrium point,

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:07.257
people are demanding
more, so suppliers say,

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:08.727
"Hey, if you want me to produce more,

00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:10.950
"I'm gonna charge you
some more for it too,"

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.030
so our price level has gone up,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.600
we're at price level two

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.880
and we are producing above
full employment output,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.596
maybe this level right here is 60 billion,

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:26.730
well, how would that be
reflected on our Phillips curves?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.980
Well, in the short run,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.550
our economy has gotten a
little bit above potential,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.030
so in the short run,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.210
so we would sit on the
short run Phillips curve

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.200
and our unemployment rate would go down,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.760
but if we assume the Phillips curve,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.818
the short run Phillips curve model,

00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:43.480
that means our inflation would go up,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.710
so this point right over here

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.710
might correspond maybe to
this point right over there,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.190
where when we get to that
beyond full employment output,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.630
let's say that this is 60
billion right over here,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.420
well maybe our unemployment rate is 2%

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.143
and our inflation rate here is 3%,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.734
now what happens next?

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.013
Well, we've talked about this

00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:15.200
when we studied aggregate
demand and aggregate supply,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.690
workers, when it's time for them

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.537
to renegotiate their contracts will say,

00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:21.637
"Hey, prices have gone
up, I'm not going to work

00:06:21.637 --> 00:06:23.450
"for the same amounts over the long run,"

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.950
and so you have a shift to the left

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.560
of the aggregate supply curve,
at any given price level,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.920
there's going to be
less supply, less output

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.600
and so if this shifts to the left,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.570
eventually the equilibrium point

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.400
will go back to where
everything intersects

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.460
with the long run aggregate supply curve,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.205
so the short run aggregate
supply curve shifts over there

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:47.770
and then we would be back to
our full employment output,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.740
although our price level
would have gone even higher,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.370
price level three.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.490
Now many economists would argue
that when you have a shift

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.710
in the short run aggregate supply,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.700
so this would be short
run aggregate supply two,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.180
that that also is associated with a shift

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.720
in our short run Phillips curve,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.973
because of these price increases

00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:10.690
and because workers are trying

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.930
to renegotiate their salaries upwards

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.630
and labor is the biggest
factor in price levels,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.252
you might have increased
inflation expectations,

00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:22.089
so then the given rate of inflation,

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:25.470
you might start having
a higher unemployment

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.150
and so this short run Phillips curve

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.970
could shift to the
right, so instead of this

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.457
just gravitating back
to where it was before,

00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:35.740
the whole curve could shift to the right

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.523
and we get to a situation
that looks like this,

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.640
where our inflation is still at 3%,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.220
but we are back to the long run

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.233
unemployment rate of this economy.
