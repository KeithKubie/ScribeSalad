ELIZABETH CHOE: End of day 11.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.420
Today was the
rough cut screening

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.860
of everyone's projects.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.050
I think that this class really
is more about pre-production

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.340
and everything.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.980
And I think that's the thing
that gets a little overlooked

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.290
by most people, at
least who are trying

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.260
to come from a technical side--
that they view production

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.880
as when the camera comes
on, that you just show up

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.030
and sit down and do your
interview, and you leave.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.840
And they overlook
how much work it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.350
takes leading up to that
point and of course,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.680
coming afterwards.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.710
And what I was most
pleased about today

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.900
was that people's
scripts in these videos

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.480
had really come a long way.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.500
It's really funny, because
people-- and I know

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.390
I've said this before,
but it's easy to look

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.160
at something that
someone else has made

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.930
and point out all the flaws.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.430
And it's so hard to be
able to learn from that

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.310
and implement that
in your own work.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.770
Some of them are
excellent critics,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.558
and you see their
work, and they're

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:04.099
making the same
mistakes that they're

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.360
pointing out with other people.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.780
That's partially
because it's very hard

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.440
to execute some of
these things well,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.110
and it's also hard to see
that you're not doing it.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.660
The other thing is when I first
started planning this class,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.350
I was so obsessed with
every day being perfect.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.140
And I would spend hours and
hours just on the presentation.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.034
I think the aesthetic
of the presentation

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:23.450
was really important
to me-- how I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.430
would say things,
how I'd lay them out,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.930
that there would be sort of
this branding in the class.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.630
And today, I feel like
things came together

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.290
at the last minute.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.400
And it was OK.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.020
It turned out fine.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.900
For the rough cut
editing we had spent,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.530
I guess it's been
months now, trying

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.900
to get this video
annotation software to work.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.080
We were emailing back and
forth with the developers hours

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320
before the class started,
and at the last minute

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000
we were creating
Google spreadsheets

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.290
to use those instead.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.600
And it worked out fine.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.620
Doing what's best
for the class and not

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.170
using technology
that exists just

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.389
for the sake of using them is
something I'm learning to do.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.140
I caught myself in the
editing spreadsheets,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.680
I would say, try this
if you have time.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.070
And I would almost
feel bad bringing stuff

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.380
up of what they should
reshoot, but then I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.630
think like, this is
part of the experience.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.130
This is why we gave them
two whole extra days

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.770
to do reshoots is
to reshoot things.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.930
And I shouldn't feel bad about
making them do more work.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.590
But it's a fine line that I'm
trying to toe really well,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.500
because I do sympathize with
the demands of being a student

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.410
here.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.830
So I'm not really sure if
I'm doing that super well,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.050
and I'm basically relying
on their individual feedback

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.300
to get a sense of that.
