00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course:
World History and today we are going to talk

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.560
about something we haven’t discussed much here at
Crash Course. Peace. Peaceful, non-violent protest.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.000
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Finally an episode where
no one gets killed.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.210
Mmmm. Ehhh. Some people are gonna get killed,
Me From the Past. Sadly, peaceful, nonviolent

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.060
protest is often just peaceful on the one side.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.020
So we’ve talked a lot about war this year
on Crash Course, how it shaped civilizations

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.829
and nation states. And it’s easy to assume
that humans are kind of naturally violent

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.480
and prone to fighting. And in recent human
history, especially during the 20th century,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.400
we got scarily good at waging war, right? There
were, of course, the two World Wars, but there

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.760
were also many other very destructive smaller wars
and we can’t forget that there were also genocides.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.990
But one of the most remarkable and often unnoticed
aspects of the 20th century is the incredible

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.150
number of peace, non violence, and anti-war
movements. Like, we know about Gandhi, but

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.720
what makes the 20th century unique in history
is that Gandhi wasn’t unique. There was

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.259
actually a surprisingly large number of peace and
nonviolence movements that were occurring all

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.469
around the world. So in this episode, we’re
going to talk a little bit about the nonviolent

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.089
heavy hitters, like Martin Luther King and
Gandhi. I guess I should say, the heavy “non-hitters”

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:16.560
because, you know, they were nonviolent. But
they were, by no means, the only ones.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.600
So by 1900, Europeans pretty much dominated
the world, even though there had been relative

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.950
peace in Europe since 1871, Europeans, using
new weapons, had unleashed an incredible amount

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.429
of violence everywhere else on the planet.
They had colonized most of Africa, Asia, and

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.670
the Pacific. Americans had also expanded across
the continental United States, and were making

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.850
eyes at the Caribbean and Asia. And I want
to be clear that this conquest and colonization

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.240
was consistently violent. But some people
were beginning to question the very idea of

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.909
violence itself. Like in his 1894 book, The
Kingdom of God is Within You, Leo Tolstoy,

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.560
who knew a little bit about War and Peace,
explored how Jesus’s message to quote “turn

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.819
the other cheek” was the basis for a life
of nonviolence.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.610
He argued that governments and individuals
needed to give up violence if they believed

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.450
themselves to be true Christians, and Tolstoy
also saw nonviolence as a solution to ending

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.310
colonialism. In 1908, Tolstoy wrote "A Letter
to a Hindu" to Mohandas Gandhi, and in the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.010
letter, he explained that Indians needed to
confront British imperialism with love and

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.240
nonviolence. Gandhi not only read that letter,
he also published it in his South African

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.250
newspaper "Indian Opinion" in 1909. And Tolstoy's
ideas in this correspondence with Gandhi marked

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.410
the beginning of an informal dialogue between
the advocates of nonviolence from around the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.620
world that spanned the 20th century.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.760
And Tolstoy wasn't the only influence on Mohandas
K. Gandhi, he'd grown up in the Gujarat region

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.980
of India where there's a sizable Jain community.
And through the Jain monks Gandhi was exposed

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.910
to the idea of Ahimsa: non-violence or non-injury
to life. He also read widely including western

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.510
writers like John Ruskin, and Henry David
Thoreau.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.340
So after his return to India from South Africa
in 1915, Gandhi began to distill his thinking

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.890
related to non-violence into a more explicit
philosophy. In his 1929 autobiography "The

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.280
Story of my Experiments with Truth", Gandhi
wrote about how his belief in Ahimsa could

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.220
be the basis for Indian resistance to British
rule. So for Gandhi non-violence was both

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.980
a way of life, and a tool for gaining Indian
self-rule. He saw Western civilization as

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.530
violent and exploitative. That's ridiculous.
I know the Eurocentrists are gonna get mad

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.160
at me for saying that but it is true, a smidge
violent and exploitative at times. That said,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.640
well done with like market-based innovation
and the Mona Lisa and etc. OK let's move on.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.180
Gandhi believed that Indians could reject
that lifestyle and replace it with a nonviolent

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.500
one. And Gandhi also believed that Indians
could bring about an end to British rule through

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.620
a combination of Ahimsa and Satyagraha, a
word often translated as adherence to truth.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.420
All right, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.190
These interconnected ideas of Ahimsa and Satyagraha
are best seen in the Salt March of 1930. So,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.320
since the mid 19th century, the British had
placed taxes on salt, and since salt, in addition

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.280
to making food more delicious is necessary
to live, Gandhi saw these laws as a perfect

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.180
example of how British despotism affected
all Indians. Gandhi announced that he and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.620
a small group planned to march from his home
in Ahmedabad to the coast in order to harvest

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.720
salt. The march took almost two months and
quickly gathered media attention from around

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.370
the world and the British raj in India was
forced to choose between arresting Gandhi

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.570
for breaking a British law or else allowing
him to break the law because he was harvesting

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.440
salt illegally. Millions of Indians were inspired
by Gandhi’s challenge to British rule and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.330
began their own protests against the salt
law. As civil disobedience spread across India,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.630
the British began to arrest people and the
international media focused even more on the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.150
protests and popular opinion began to see
British rule as unjust. By refusing to meet

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.480
violent British rule with violence of his
own and highlighting the injustice of British

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.240
rule, Gandhi was able to use nonviolence as an
effective tool in undermining the colonial regime.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.300
Thanks Thought Bubble. So as previously noted,
Gandhi’s use of nonviolence is very well

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.960
known but it wasn’t unique. Throughout the
early 20th century nationalist movements in

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.820
colonies throughout Africa and Asia also adopted
nonviolence. Like one of the first nationalist

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.360
leaders to advocate for nonviolence resistance
to Imperialism was Phan Chu Trinh. Just as the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.320
Vietnamese independence movement was developing
in the first decade of the nineteen hundreds,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.220
Phan began to question the violent methods
advocated by other nationalists. Like he spoke

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.710
out against the violent uprisings that were
occurring in many parts of Vietnam. He also

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.500
resisted requesting help from Japan in the Vietnamese Independence struggle because of Japan's militarism.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.180
In 1919, Egyptians protested against British
rule by going on strike, and boycotting British

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.520
goods, and organizing demonstrations across
the country. Those protests went on for months

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.960
and eventually in 1922 the British granted
independence to Egypt. Although some key areas,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.120
including the Suez Canal, did remain under
British control. And even as nonviolence became

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.949
a tactic associated with anti-imperial movements
in Africa and Asia it was also becoming entrenched

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.110
in the peace movement that developed in response
to World War One. When war broke out in the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.260
fall of 1914 there were lots of protests in
the United States, which had yet to enter

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.340
the war. A number of young activists met to
discuss how to stop it and how to prevent

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.930
the United States from entering it. This group
included AJ Musty and Kirby Page and Dorothy

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.020
Day, all of whom would go on to become important
figures in the Peace Movement in the United

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.840
States. They also helped found the Fellowship
of Reconciliation or (FOR), which advocated

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.699
on behalf of conscientious objectors and encouraged
nonviolent alternatives to conflict. And then

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.570
after the war ended many of these American
peace activists began to expand their horizons

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.210
and they saw connections between nonviolence
and antiwar movements and nonviolence in the

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.840
anti-imperial struggle.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.360
There was, for instance, Ricard Gregg, a young
activist who had been involved in the anti-war

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.740
movement in the United States, who traveled
to India in 1925. He spent four years in India

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.460
studying with Gandhi including seven months
living at Gandhi’s ashram in Gujarat. And

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.640
then when he returned to the US, Gregg wrote
the very influential book The Power of Nonviolence

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.610
in which he described how nonviolence would
remake the world.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.990
I mention this to get across the idea that
this was truly an international movement that

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.040
involved cultural exchange that went both
west to east and east to west. And this idea

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.419
of nonviolent resistance was also very compelling
to artists. During the Spanish Civil War the

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.660
nationalist forces of General Franco heavily
bombed the Basque village of Guernica and

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.169
after reading about the destruction of the
village, the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.430
who was working on a commissioned mural for
the Spanish Republic abandoned the mural and

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.350
began painting Guernica to draw attention
to the horrors that war inflicts upon innocent

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.120
civilians. The painting became one of the
most famous of the 20th century and it remains

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.639
a powerful antiwar symbol. There were even
nonviolent protests against the Nazis. Like

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:51.360
in 1943 the German Gestapo arrested about
1800 Jewish men who were married to non-Jewish

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.400
women. And as those men were being held in
an office building, their wives gathered together

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.320
on the street. Armed German Gestapo agents
attempted to disperse them with threats of

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.340
firing into the crowd and a stand off between
the unarmed women and the armed Gestapo went

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.370
on for a week. Instead of firing on the women,
Joseph Gerbils, the Nazi party director in

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.160
Berlin, ultimately decided to back down and
he released the men. The so called Rosenstrasse

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.020
protest was the only successful public protest against
Nazi policies in Germany but it wasn't the only protest.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.300
And then we have the Civil Rights Movement
in the United States which brought together

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.570
many of the different strains of nonviolent
resistance in the 20th century. Like during

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.370
World War II, civil rights pioneer Bayard
Rustin met AJ Musty and other members of the

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.740
Fellowship of Reconciliation, and they spent
much of the war protesting racial discrimination

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.399
in the armed forces but at the same time Rustin
was also becoming increasingly aware of the

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:47.510
injustice of the British colonialism in India
and Africa and began to protest that as well.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.060
And we see this global cross-fertilization
of nonviolent ideas again in 1948 when Rustin

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.960
traveled to India, where he met with many
of Gandhi’s associates -- Gandhi had been

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.730
killed in January of that year -- and learned
about the role of nonviolent protest against

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.890
the British. And in the following decade,
Rustin would teach Martin Luther King Jr about

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.110
Gandhi’s tactics, so he could use them in
protesting against racial segregation in the

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.230
United States. King himself traveled to India
in 1959 to learn more about nonviolence. And

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.990
before leaving he explained that he was quote
“more convinced than ever before that the

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.140
method of nonviolent resistance is the most
potent weapon available to oppressed people

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.860
in their struggle for justice and human dignity.”

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.010
And the principles of nonviolence would come
to shape the strategies used for the remainder

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.610
of the Civil Rights Movement. Nonviolent resistance
was also an important protest tactic during

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.910
the Cold War. Alexander Dubcek, the Czech
Communist Party’s first secretary, began

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.810
a series of reforms to communist rule in Czechoslovakia
in January 1968 that would become known as

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.790
the Prague Spring. And the Soviet Union was
like no no no no no no no we don’t like

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.870
democratic reforms or Spring. So they sent
in troops to destabilize Dubcek’s government

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.000
and in response to that invasion, civilians
quickly took to the streets in support of

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.980
Dubcek and to resist the invasion. Most people
resisted through a variety of nonviolent means,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.200
including deliberately giving wrong directions
to Soviet tanks, forming human blockades across

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:14.890
bridges, and distributing protest materials.
Secret radio stations were set up to broadcast

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.140
calls for nonviolent resistance across the
country. And the protest continued on for

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.510
the rest of 1968. In January of 1969, two
Czech students burned themselves to death

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.690
in a Prague square to protest the Soviet occupation
and as the tensions between the protesters

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:35.120
and the Soviets escalated, the Soviets began
a violent crackdown. By the summer of 1969

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.370
they'd brought the demonstrations to an end.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.930
Historians took note of all of this stuff,
like historian Gene Sharp published his multi

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.860
volume Politics of Nonviolent Action which
was reportedly read by a lot of the original

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.990
protesters in the Arab Spring of 2011, which
reminds us that nonviolent resistance movements

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.350
advocating for and in some cases achieving
political change are not just part of history,

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:01.029
they are also part of the world in which we
live today. Ideas about nonviolence that began

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:05.200
with Leo Tolstoy at the beginning of the 20th
century are still very much with us.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.399
And I think it is good important to remind
ourselves of two things. First, that Tolstoy’s

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:12.790
most famous book is called War and Peace.
And secondly, that the 20th century while

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:19.400
it featured intensely destructive wars, was by
many measures the least violent century ever.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.880
Wars are traumatic and they have relatively
straightforward narratives that allow us to

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.910
focus on human dramas and all of that stuff
is appealing to historians. But really the

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.550
nonviolent struggles against oppression in
the 20th century have been just as dramatic

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.830
and especially in the second half of the 20th
century they have born fruit and not just

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.709
in the US and India. When the news focuses
just on death and destruction it can be hard

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:46.490
to remember that more people are living under
peaceful regimes than ever before and that,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:52.459
at least between nations, inequality and injustice
are diminishing. Nonviolent resistance doesn’t

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.700
always work and the governments that emerge
form these movements aren’t always good

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.420
governments. The stories, as usual, are complicated.
So the next time we think about the 20th century

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.330
merely as a century of war and genocide and
nuclear weapons we need to remind ourselves

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:11.110
that it was also a century in which hundreds
of millions of people emerged from poverty

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.120
and fewer people died as a result of violence.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.040
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
