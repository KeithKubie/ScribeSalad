00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.580
Let's continue with the
story of Pete's mutual fund.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.530
So let's say that a year goes by
and that even after paying Pete

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.470
the 1%, so it had $500 of
assets under management,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.217
this whole assets under
management a year later,

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:16.800
let's say it goes
to, like I mentioned

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.830
at the end of the
last video, $1,000.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.650
So Pete either is really
good at or really lucky,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.460
or a little bit of both.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.500
So it goes to $1,000.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.550
So let me draw it like this.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.100
So now it is that
$1,000, and it still

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.560
has the same five
investors here.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.500
And I'm lucky enough
to be one of them.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.940
So here are the five investors.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.160
Let me draw the shares.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.050
So there's one, two,
three, four, five shares.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.310
Now, each of the
shares-- well, the $1,000

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.170
is called the NAV, or
the net asset value.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.770
So let me give you that
piece of terminology,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.000
just means net asset value.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.080
And so there's an NAV per share.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.490
The NAV per share right
over here is $200.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.180
I just took the total NAV and I
just divided it by the shares.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.730
And what's special about
an open-ended mutual fund

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.780
is at the close, or at
the end of every day,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.430
either new shares can
be removed from the fund

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.440
or could be created
for the fund.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.580
So in the first
video, I showed how

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.270
I wanted to buy into the
fund so I bought a share.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.519
And that increase the NAV.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.310
And it also increased
the number of shares.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.006
He had to create a
share for me to buy,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:30.880
he didn't sell me share
that already existed.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.110
So you can imagine, after
this type of performance

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.400
more people would
want to buy shares.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.560
So now they would have
to buy in to make things

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.020
fair at $200 per
share, because that's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380
the current NAV per share.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.080
So let's say that five more
people want to buy in at $200

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.310
per share.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060
So what Pete would do, or
what this mutual fund--

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.160
it's not Pete really,
it's the corporation--

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.140
it would create five new shares.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.010
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.662
If there was only
one person that day

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:03.120
it would create
one share that day.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.703
If there was 10
people that they would

00:02:04.703 --> 00:02:05.960
create 10 shares that day.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.480
And it could keep doing this.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.160
And the NAV of each
of these are $200.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.240
So it gives the shares
to each of these people.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.790
And they had to contribute $200.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.530
So essentially it puts
another $1,000 into the pool

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.450
that Pete can now manage.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.460
And so now the total NAV
for the fund is $2,000 now.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.600
And Pete will get his
1% management fee off

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.860
of this entire $2,000.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.930
Now let's say that we
fast forward a little bit.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.540
We fast forward a
little bit to let's

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.890
say Pete starts having
a not so good year.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.370
So let's say we fast
forward a year past that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.990
and Pete has a
negative 10% return.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.240
So if you started at
$2,000, and that's

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.030
when you include taking
his management fee out,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.000
you start at $2,000, you
lose 10% in one year.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.580
So it goes down to $1,800.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.230
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.110
So now he's at $1,800.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.310
It's not completely
drawn to scale,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.430
but hopefully you get the idea.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.100
So now he is at $1,800.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.870
But you still have a
total of 10 shares.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.510
So let me do my best
to draw the 10 shares.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.820
So I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.320
10.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.380
These should be of equal size.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.720
And now the NAV
per share is going

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.080
to be 1,800 divided
by 10, or $180.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.430
And let's say that I
get a little bit freaked

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.260
out by this recent performance.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
And I have some other
commitments with my money.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.250
So I say Pete, you need to
buy my share back from me.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.360
So what Pete does is he
would give me back $180.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.700
So the total NAV
would lose $180.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.480
So it would go down to $180.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.900
So we would take this out of it.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.110
1,800 minus 180 is 1,620.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.590
So now it is 1,620.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.490
And they would buy
back a share from me.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.040
So they would cancel
one of the shares.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.240
But notice, the NAV per
share does not change.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.709
By me redeeming my
share it does not

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.649
change what happens
to everyone else.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:26.450
Now you have 1,620 divided by
9 shares, that should still

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.120
get you to be $180 per share,
if I did my math right.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.400
So 1,800 minus 180
gets you 1,620.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.425
It should still be
one $180 per share.

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.300
But this is the nature
of an open-ended fund.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.690
You can keep creating
shares and selling them

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.380
to the public to
raise more money.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.650
Or when someone wants
their money back

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.010
you essentially buy the
share back from them,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.010
give them their money
when you buy it back,

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.310
and you remove that share.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.470
So an open-ended fund, really at
the close of every trading day,

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.220
can keep growing or shrinking.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.590
It could be keep adding
more and more investors.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.720
Or their investors can
take their money back.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.970
What's difficult about this
from the fund manager's point

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.920
of view, is that they
have to manage this.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.910
They have to manage
this constant buying

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.384
and selling with the public.

00:05:10.384 --> 00:05:11.800
They have to manage
the paperwork.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.341
And if you think
about it, they can't

00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:17.937
have all of their money invested
in relatively illiquid assets,

00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:19.020
or even in regular stocks.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.960
They have to keep some
amount of their money.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.040
And it's usually like 3% to 5%.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.550
They have to keep some of this
$2,000 before he lost my money,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.749
they have to keep
some of it in cash.

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.290
And from an investor's
point of view,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.330
they would say, well,
if I'm good at investing

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.670
I should try to minimize the
amount of cash that I have

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.294
because I'm not
getting return on cash.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.400
But because it's open-ended,
because investors

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.830
might come by and say,
hey, I want my money,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.080
you have to have a little bit of
cash as part of the asset pool

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.930
in order to be able to
buy people's shares back.
