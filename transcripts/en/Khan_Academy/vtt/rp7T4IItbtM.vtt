00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.340
In the last video, we
talked a little bit

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.650
about the immune system.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.930
In that video, we focused on the
nonspecific or the innate

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.695
immune system.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:11.945
So let me write that.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
And even in the nonspecific
immune system, we subdivided

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.870
that into kind of the
first line barriers.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.030
And those were things like the
skin, or the stomach acid, or

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.420
the acidity of the oils on
the outside of your skin.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.640
These are just natural barriers
to not allowing

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.210
things inside of your body, but
then once they get in-- so

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.520
you can almost imagine
these were the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.830
first line of defense.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.730
And then you had your second
line of defense, but these are

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.970
still nonspecific-- and when we
say nonspecific, it means

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.680
that they don't necessarily know
what type of virus, what

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.460
type of protein, what
type of bacteria.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.430
They just know that this
thing looks shady.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.260
Let me eat it up.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.950
Let me kill it.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.450
Let me have an inflammatory
response.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.710
So in there, we said, well,
there's an inflammatory

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.230
response, which I'm actually
going to talk about after we

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.470
do videos on the specific
immune system.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.580
You have your inflammatory
response, which really just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990
gets things to where the action
is at and then you also

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.070
have your phagocytes, which
are these cells that are

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.810
engulfing things.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.940
And just so you know, all the
phagocytes that we talked

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.070
about in the last video, these
are all instances of white

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530
blood cells or leukocytes.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.670
These phagocytes right here,
these are all-- I talk about

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.320
dendritic cells and macrophages
and neutrophils.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.900
These were all white
blood cells.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.740
These weren't all the kinds
of white blood cells.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.310
We're about to talk about more--
and the other word for

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.920
white blood cell is
also leukocyte.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620
So that is nonspecific.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.660
Well, one, it just doesn't let
you in, but then when you're

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.920
in, it says, hey, you're
just shady.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.880
I'm going to eat you up.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.980
I have receptors.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.170
You have some double stranded
DNA floating around.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.030
Only viruses have double
strand DNA.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.949
I'm going to eat you up.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.550
I don't know what type
of virus you are.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.400
I don't know if I've seen
you before or not.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
That's why it's nonspecific.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.130
Now the really interesting
thing about our immune

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.240
system-- and this nonspecific,
this exists across many, many,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.290
many species and types of
organisms. But the specific is

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.020
kind of a-- it's thought to
be a newer adaptation.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.450
What I'm going to talk about is
the specific immune system

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.705
that's particular to humans.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.470
That's our other
classification.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.060
Let me do it like that.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.070
So then you have your specific--
or you can imagine

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.690
it's an adaptive
immune system.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.850
You've probably heard
of things like that.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.690
I have resistance to that
bacteria or that virus.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.800
So this is adaptive.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800
And it's really all based on
having exposure to things.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.580
And within the specific immune
system, we talked a little--

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
when we talked about the antigen
presenting molecules

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.810
that phagocytes do-- that
plays a role in this.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.430
We're going to go into more
detail, but I don't want to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.230
confuse you.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.300
But the main actors here are
called lymphocytes, not to be

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.570
confused with leukocytes--
because they still are

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.180
leukocytes.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.430
So let me write this down.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.060
These are specific.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.180
Phagocytes, for the most part,
are nonspecific, but both of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.860
these are white blood cells.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.630
Lymphocytes are another
type of white

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.850
blood cell or leukocyte.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.150
Don't want to confuse you with
this convoluted diagram, but I

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.510
just want to make the
terminology clear.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.350
When someone talks about a
white blood cell, they're

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.380
really just talking about a set
of cells that when people

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.100
first tried to separate the
components of blood-- you'd

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.470
have your red blood cells that
would kind of settle in the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.040
bottom, then you'd have this
layer of white frothy stuff in

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.840
the middle that was really made
of white blood cells, and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.660
then on the top, you had the
fluid, the plasma from your

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.000
blood, kind of the
watery part.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.290
So that's where the name came
from, but they have different

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.350
roles, but they interact
with each other.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.890
Now lymphocytes can be divided
into B lymphocytes, usually

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.380
referred to as B cells--
and T lymphocytes.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.350
And the B and T just come from
where they're developed.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.820
B lymphocytes were first
recognized in

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
the bursa of Fabricius.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.810
That's why it's called B.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.520
That's actually a part of birds
that participate in the

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.410
immune system.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.520
And so the B came from bursa,
but B also applies to the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.380
human immune system because it's
produced in bone marrow.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.790
So that might be an easier
way to remember.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.920
It's produced in bone marrow.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.500
It's developed in bone marrow,
but historically, the B came

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.290
from the bursa of Fabricius,
just in case you want to know.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.420
But it's easy to remember.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.720
The B could also stand for bone
marrow because that's

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.000
where it's produced.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.490
T lymphocytes actually do start
off in the bone marrow,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.760
but they mature and become what
they are in the thymus.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.110
So that's where the
T comes from.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.130
Now in this video, I'm going
to focus just on the B

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.260
lymphocytes-- because frankly,
if I focused on everything, it

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.530
would be an hour-long video.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.570
But the B lymphocytes frankly on
some level-- well, I don't

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.230
want to pick and choose
favorites, but something in my

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.930
brain-- I just really like
the B lymphocytes.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.570
So the B lymphocytes participate
in what's called

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.820
the humoral response.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.050
And I'll tell you what humoral
means in a second.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.810
You'll see that T lymphocytes
participate in what's called

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.910
the cell mediated response and
we're going to do that in a

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.160
future video.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.770
They actually do certain classes
of T lymphocytes.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.470
We'll see that there are helper
T cells and there are

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.950
cytotoxic T cells.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.370
I know it's all very confusing
the first time you see it, but

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.180
that's why I just want
to focus on just

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.180
this part right here.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.240
We're going to see in the future
that the helper T cells

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.710
play a role in amplifying
and really activating

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.400
this humoral response.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.540
But a simple way to think about
the difference between

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.480
the humoral response and the
cell mediated response is,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.470
when I get infected--
let's say I get

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.485
infected by a virus, right?

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.230
At first, when a virus comes
into my system, it's just

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.710
floating around in the
fluids in my system.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.330
The fluids of our system--
that's really what humoral

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.800
responds to, into the humoral
fluids of your body.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.050
So you have your viruses.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.270
These are little viruses
floating around.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.740
So while they're floating around
and they're not sitting

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.710
inside of cells, that's where
the humoral response

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.600
can come into play.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.070
Same thing if we have little
bacteria floating around and

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.860
they haven't infiltrated
cells yet.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.320
They're just floating around in
the fluid, then the humoral

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.130
response can be useful
for that.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:37.730
Now if all of a sudden, these
guys have infiltrated cells--

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.580
so if the cells are now infected
with the virus and

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.570
they're producing the viruses
using the mechanisms of the

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.940
cell to produce more, then all
of a sudden we have to be a

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.950
little bit more sophisticated
in how we deal with these

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.180
cells and how we deal with the
viruses because they're not

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.580
just going to be floating
around anymore.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.230
We probably want to just kill
this cell even though it was

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.010
one of our own, but now it's
helping to make viruses.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.260
Or maybe it's been colonized
by bacteria.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.490
So in either case, you
want to kill this.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.010
And we'll talk more about that
in the cell mediating.
