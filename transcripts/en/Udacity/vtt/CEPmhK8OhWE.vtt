What happens when, the party's over and

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.250

may just be getting started.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.760

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.570

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.790
&gt;&gt; Right. A lot of this has to do with keeping the state sane across all

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.470
the classes
