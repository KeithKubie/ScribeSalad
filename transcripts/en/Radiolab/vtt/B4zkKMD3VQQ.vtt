1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.430
Ready? Yep. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And let's just, um,

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.290
let's just begin. Okay, cool. So, um, with our reporter and producer, lots of,

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
Nasir, I think the, the best place to begin it sounds like is in 2008,

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.490
I think that sounds about right. So this is Jason Deleon.

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.590
I am an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan and I

6
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:26.340
direct the undocumented migration project. But, uh, back in 2008,

7
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:31.080
Jason had actually just finished Grad School and my doctoral dissertation was on

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:35.600
h and stone tools elicit industries of Sanlorenzo and [inaudible],

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.790
an economic and technological study about as far removed as you can be from the

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.030
stuff that I'm doing right now using them Citi and technological data from 11

11
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:48.030
domestic and non domestic contexts. Just to explain,

12
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.090
Jason was on his way to being an archeologist,

13
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:52.650
so he would go out into the field,

14
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:57.651
do these digs for parts of Mexico and find these little fragments of old stone

15
00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:58.531
tools.

16
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:02.400
This study focuses primarily on percussion flake tools dating back to about a

17
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:03.390
thousand BC,

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.470
an industry that has often been ignored in Mesoamerican lithic analysis and then

19
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:09.000
you would write these papers.

20
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.570
I evaluate these models by comparing differences in the frequencies of various

21
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.404
tool types, you know,

22
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
and these journals that just had really just a handful of people would read.

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.810
But like many academics, and I can say this because I was an academic,

24
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.050
this study also finds that the introduction and adoption of prismatic plate

25
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.290
technology, he had this moment where just kind of

26
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.670
hit the wall. It's like, okay, this is enough. I'm not, I'm not doing this.

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.420
I want nothing to do with this anymore. You know,

28
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.640
when I finished my dissertation,

29
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.480
I had really become kind of disillusioned with the work that I was doing and I

30
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.390
had no idea what I was going to do. I remember telling my wife at one point,

31
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.081
I felt really bad.

32
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.710
I feel like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life doing archeology and to

33
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.560
make matters worse, I had taken this job at the University of Washington.

34
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.770
It's just gotten his job where he was supposed to teach the very thing he was

35
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.470
now sick of. Yeah, just like just an exit.

36
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.660
Just a full blown crisis. But then fate stepped in.

37
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.140
Well, Jason was preparing for one of his freshman classes.

38
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.460
Someone handed him a book by a writer named, um,

39
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.470
Luis Alberto Raya called the Devil's, uh, the devil's highway.

40
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.220
Five men stumbled out of the mountain pass. So sun struck.

41
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.460
They didn't know their own names, couldn't remember where they'd come from,

42
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.850
had forgotten and how long they'd been lost.

43
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150
One of them wandered back up a beak. One of them was barefoot.

44
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.260
They were burned. Nearly black. Your Lips. Huge and cracking.

45
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.640
So the devil's highway is actually, well, it's a, it's a true story.

46
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:47.450
It's the three of 26 men who came to the u s hiking their way through the

47
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.260
Arizona desert. 14 of them died along the way.

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.270
And so I start reading it and visions of home flooded through their minds, soft,

49
00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.100
green bushes, waterfalls, children. It just

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 2>shocked me. I mean, I knew a lot about the border leaks. I thought I did.</v>

51
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.440
I'd grown up, you know, in south Texas. My parents were immigrants,

52
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.390
but just like couldn't believe that, um, that you know, that this was,

53
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.890
this is somebody's world.

54
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.860
They were drunk from having their brains baked in the pan.

55
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.310
They were seeing God in devil's days and days of walking.

56
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.240
I'm running out of food and they were dizzy from drinking their own urine.

57
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.300
You know, dying of thirst poisons clogging their systems.

58
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.970
<v 0>At a certain point,</v>

59
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:31.971
Jason comes across this passage where the author is describing

60
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.320
<v 2>the things that were in these men's pockets.</v>

61
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.060
Belt buckle with a fighting cock in late one wallet in the right front pocket of

62
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:43.260
his genome. Some changed, some keys and silver belt buckle, fake silver watch,

63
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.110
one comb. Um, you know, these personal effects.

64
00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:49.860
Green handkerchief and he's trying to reconstruct the story about who these men

65
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:54.060
were that died from, from exposure. John Doe number 42 fewer genes,

66
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480
colored piece of paper and pocket. Jason says, when you read that book,

67
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.130
a light bulb went on. I said, I bought a plane ticket.

68
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:02.960
A month later I was in the Arizona desert.

69
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.963
<v 1>Uh,</v>

70
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.590
<v 0>Jason gets out to Tucson,</v>

71
00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:14.591
Arizona and he manages to convince someone from a local NGO to basically like

72
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:17.050
show him around and be his guide.

73
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.010
<v 2>When I said I want to look at the stuff that migrants are leaving in the desert</v>

74
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.720
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

75
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.840
<v 2>I was like, all right, you want to see this stuff?</v>

76
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:25.940
I'm going to take you real deep into the desert and see what you,

77
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.043
what you're made of.

78
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.540
<v 0>This guy just ran me through the ringer, that part of the Sonoran desert.</v>

79
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:37.310
It's a, it's hilly covered in Sagebrush, cacti everywhere.

80
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.080
Red Sand and Jason's has it at a certain point, a few hours into the hike,

81
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.610
they walked up this incline and got to this ridge where they could kind of look

82
00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:48.650
out over this huge expanse.

83
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.260
<v 2>Just imagine like a, uh, a ravine or a wash and</v>

84
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.240
<v 0>Jason says he suddenly noticed that that the desert ground below them,</v>

85
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.250
<v 2>it was just covered in stuff over a thousand backpacks and water bottles.</v>

86
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.190
I mean, the, just that much. Well,

87
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:09.700
what ends up happening is stuff gets left behind for a couple of different

88
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:11.320
reasons. If you're in route,

89
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.900
you might throw something down because you get so tired in your bag,

90
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:14.740
just gets so heavy.

91
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.140
And those things are kind of sprinkled across these migraine trails.

92
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.770
But once you get to the end past the checkpoint, your smuggler says, okay,

93
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.170
we're safe now. We've got to a new road or we can get picked up.

94
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.840
Someone else will show up in the truck and then they will say, all right,

95
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:28.900
the 30 of you get into this van, leave everything behind,

96
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.780
change your clothes so it doesn't look like you've just walked for two weeks

97
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.560
through this desert. Um, and so when groups were moving really big,

98
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:40.561
you would see things the size of like football fields of just stuff everywhere,

99
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.410
Gatorade bottles, bibles, photographs, um, toys,

100
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.020
the kind of random things that you might throw in your bag and say,

101
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.500
I'm leaving my home forever and these are the things I want to take with me.

102
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.550
You know, you see things like a diaper bag or a baby bottle and you wonder,

103
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:59.240
my God, you know who, who, who just came through this. Um, and what's,

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.350
what's happened to them.

105
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.000
<v 0>So for the next several years,</v>

106
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:07.180
Jason just keeps going back to this stretch of the Sonoran desert,

107
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:10.120
ripped clothes, fragments of closing bushes, gathering,

108
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:13.660
whatever he could find dirty socks and you know, like an archeologist,

109
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:17.710
he would collect this stuff and oh, you didn't mindset categorize it.

110
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.490
Cocktail dresses, high heel shoes. Try and figure out who it came from,

111
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:26.230
why it was their baby bottles, hair curlers, toys, rappers. You did this year,

112
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:30.790
sneakers, photograph after a year, socks, picking up this shoes, dresses,

113
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.120
backpacks, bibles, bottles. And then one day

114
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.940
<v 2>a human arm, he finds an arm weighs between some rocks,</v>

115
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.290
like an entire arm up to the shoulder. Just sort of sticking,

116
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.030
sticking out between two rocks. I mean,

117
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.810
there was no flesh other than the things that were holding the joint together.

118
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.220
Oh Wow. Yeah.

119
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.660
<v 0>Jason and his guide, the folks who was there with,</v>

120
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.960
they began to search the surrounding areas for other parts of the body.

121
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.190
<v 2>I mean, really the goal is to try to find the skull. Um, because in terms of,</v>

122
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.730
you know, um, identification, I mean your best luck is going to be,

123
00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:09.270
if you can get, if you can get the, um, pieces of the skull,

124
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.700
<v 0>because if you can find pieces of a skull,</v>

125
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.520
maybe you can id the body and if you can id the body,

126
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.970
maybe you can tell the family, here's what happened to your loved one.

127
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.620
And so we were out there basically digging around for,

128
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.030
for other parts of this person. We come across a human tooth,

129
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.750
some little tiny bits of rib bones, but we never find the skull.

130
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.690
<v 2>And I realized that nobody's ever gonna identify this person.</v>

131
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.150
There's just not enough left of them. And this says, not,

132
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.340
not likely to be a case that will be solved.

133
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.770
<v 0>Now, Jason says he knew of course, that people were dying in the desert.</v>

134
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.360
But to see this,

135
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.930
the fragments of a person who'd basically been erased, you know,

136
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.940
it's very,

137
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.113
<v 1>ah,</v>

138
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.990
<v 0>I mean it's kind of just, it sort of just kills you.</v>

139
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.170
Eventually he began have these nightmares,

140
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.650
snakes coming out of the eyes about the missing skull,

141
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.780
bird swooping down and pecking out the eyes,

142
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.460
coyotes playing soccer with this person's skull and for weeks he couldn't shake

143
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.380
this simple question. You know what?

144
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.680
What did this to this person and how many other bodies like this might be out

145
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.670
here? How did it get to be like this?

146
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:22.770
<v 1>No.</v>

147
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.970
<v 0>And those questions</v>

148
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.403
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

149
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.790
<v 0>would end up sending Jason down a sort of rabbit hole,</v>

150
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.600
digging in the library to forensics papers, decomposing composing flesh,

151
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.680
missing persons report, hikers who had gone missing historical trends,

152
00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:44.250
sociology papers, demography, paper, government document, illustrations,

153
00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:46.560
and the figures in the better buried in these appendices.

154
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.530
And over the next several years,

155
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:53.730
Jason would end up putting together this truly startling portrait of lost

156
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:56.190
stories, hidden little known

157
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.840
<v 3>policy decisions along our southern border that completely up ended.</v>

158
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.400
How I think about this issue.

159
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.430
The immigration issue poses real problems and challenges that we're constantly

160
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:12.200
fighting about. We will build a great wall along the southern border.

161
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.810
It's still never quite

162
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.313
<v 1>sing it.</v>

163
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.410
<v 3>This is part one of a three part series on our southern border.</v>

164
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.030
We'll be doing it today and then next week and the week after part one a hole in

165
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:30.864
the fence.

166
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.210
<v 4>All right, so I thought I'd start started off with Jason's question.</v>

167
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.680
How did it get to be like this?

168
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.740
How did it get to be that so many people cross into America through the desert?

169
00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:50.030
Like that's the classic image you have is someone walking through the desert.

170
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.160
Why out of all the places along the border that you could cross,

171
00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.580
why is it that so many people are are crossing in the hottest and most

172
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.160
unforgiving place imaginable and them to be?

173
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:09.190
One of the things that Jason ended up telling us about that we found most

174
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.020
striking was simply the numbers,

175
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.260
the yearly numbers of migrant deaths in the desert.

176
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.500
And I mean it is shocking if you look at the data,

177
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:21.930
there's a very stark moment when things shift it.

178
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:26.030
It turns out that if you're looking at the number of people dying in the Sonoran

179
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:29.510
desert, the numbers are a bit tough to pin down. But in the early nineties,

180
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.450
it's single digits, five bodies, one year, six bodies, another year,

181
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:33.320
seven bodies and other.

182
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.130
And then all of a sudden over night in the late nineties,

183
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.110
<v 2>you go from five to 10 bodies to, to hundreds. I mean,</v>

184
00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:43.300
it used to be that if you wanted to cross the US Mexico border,

185
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.160
you'd go down to Sandy, to Tijuana at dusk place called the soccer field.

186
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.430
You would hop the fence with about a hundred other people and you would just bum

187
00:10:51.431 --> 00:10:54.310
rush to the border patrol and you and half of you would get by,

188
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.020
would make it into the u s and nearly half would get caught,

189
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.040
send back and people would do it again the next day. Um,

190
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.820
that was a system for a long time. I mean, the, so what change? Well,

191
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.580
in the mid nineties there was a lot of push back up against the visibility of

192
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.280
offense hopping. And it,

193
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.230
it all kind of starts with this little known story. Um,

194
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.750
there's a great book by, by this Guy Timothy Dunn called, um,

195
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.050
blockade in the border and it's about these Latino high school students in

196
00:11:23.051 --> 00:11:24.550
Texas, right on the u s Mexico.

197
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.350
<v 4>We ended up calling the author, he mentioned Timothy Dunn,</v>

198
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:31.820
and then getting so interested in a story that done laid out for us that we're

199
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.240
gonna leave Jason Behind for a while and we're going to go on a little trip.

200
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.560
Yes. That by the way, is code reporter Tracy Hunt. Yes. All right. Well,

201
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:41.990
so where are we gonna go? We're gonna go to El Paso.

202
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.310
<v 3>El Paso, Texas. So yes.</v>

203
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:50.780
So Tracy and I went to El Paso a while back.

204
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.560
Everything calendered like until different,

205
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.820
if you were just born somewhere else.

206
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.810
Of course he thought that if I was born somewhere else, yeah, of course. I mean,

207
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:00.340
I think about that. I feel like,

208
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.360
I guess I got distracted at that point. You didn't finish the conversation.

209
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.900
But anyway, two flags flying the American flag and the text and flag.

210
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.140
We went down to El Paso to visit a high school called buoy high school.

211
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.520
Home of the buoy bears. Guys who goes,

212
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.640
you guys have been suffering too much to meet,

213
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.880
<v 5>you know, in many respects it's just, you know,</v>

214
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:28.680
your typical American high school.

215
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.320
<v 1>Good. Why do you bed? Yeah, baby.</v>

216
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.370
<v 3>Got Your a Taco Tuesdays it's ninth through 12th grade.</v>

217
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.280
About 1200 students. Very good.

218
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.830
So please take out your notes because it's Texas, you know,

219
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.580
football is a big deal.

220
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

221
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.610
<v 3>On their campus they have a huge football stadium with those big, you know,</v>

222
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.410
Friday night lights. Uh, they've got a marching band.

223
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.690
The pride of the south side.

224
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.680
It's a, yeah,

225
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.020
<v 5>yeah. Your typical Texas high school. Yeah. But,</v>

226
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.240
but there is something a little different about it and that is that almost all

227
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:17.320
the students here for here, the Lotto is here.

228
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.180
Jose are Mexican American, Oscar. And you know,

229
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.090
we actually talked to one former teacher. This is one cyber Coronado.

230
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.240
I was a teacher at buoy high school in the 1980s and 1990s and where did you

231
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:35.480
teach? I taught history and he said that in all his years teaching at Buoy

232
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.350
<v 6>taught there for 21 years and never had a single English dude.</v>

233
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.380
<v 4>Really? Really? Yeah. Never taught a single white student.</v>

234
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.930
The reason we went to buoy high school is because something happened there.

235
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.800
And the early nineties, something that it sort of in a,

236
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.160
in a kind of roundabout and, and totally unforeseeable way,

237
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:55.480
completely changed the way we think about the US Mexico border.

238
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.320
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

239
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.610
<v 4>so we're, we're, we're going to start,</v>

240
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:03.640
the story is actually in one of one cyber Coronado's classes.

241
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.490
The class was immediately after lunch and,

242
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.000
and on this particular day that we're going to have a debate in class and one of

243
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.960
the debaters, one of the kids who is going to be part of the debate was late.

244
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.950
Yes. Uh, his name is Albert. Albert

245
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.470
<v 6>often came [inaudible] came late to class and so we'd been waiting and waiting</v>

246
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.400
and waiting for him.

247
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.340
<v 4>10 minutes went by, 1520</v>

248
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.390
<v 6>and eventually he showed up being dragged in by this campus security guy,</v>

249
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.320
the school security guard. And I thought, you know,

250
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.640
the security guard had brought him in because he was, you know,

251
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.510
out doing some miscreant stuff like smoking pot again. And,

252
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.580
and so I kind of lay into Albert for being late again. And for,

253
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.730
you know, not holding up his responsibilities with class,

254
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.900
<v 5>but, but Albert's like, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

255
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.680
Albert says that he had been at the handball court playing with his friends and

256
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.230
then when it was time to go from the court back to class,

257
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.240
these two border patrol agents,

258
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.110
this came out of nowhere and they're green uniforms demanding to see his papers.

259
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.580
Like, who are you? Where are you from? Let me see your Id. Yeah. And He,

260
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:10.430
Albert tries to give them his school id, but they wouldn't take it.

261
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.140
And they actually told him

262
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.180
<v 8>that he needed a federal id of some sort for them to believe at all that he was</v>

263
00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:19.830
a United States citizen or belong on the campus.

264
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.460
And one's just standing there like [inaudible] [inaudible] border patrol.

265
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.400
Really? You know, I was haranguing the kid obviously,

266
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.080
but then three or four other students in class just kind of stepped in and said,

267
00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:32.580
no, what Albert's telling you it's true.

268
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.543
<v 7>Mm.</v>

269
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.220
<v 8>Not only is Albert telling the truth,</v>

270
00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:40.000
but in the last couple of weeks or to patrol had been on the handball court and

271
00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:43.360
on the playing field repeatedly stopping students,

272
00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:48.310
harassing students and I was quite frankly shocked.

273
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:49.990
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

274
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.621
<v 8>one says,</v>

275
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:54.430
of course he knew that the border patrol was around because of where the school

276
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:56.710
is situated, which we'll talk about in a second,

277
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.180
but he just never understood how present they were in his students' lives.

278
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.690
I was having a hard time processing this, so over the next few weeks,

279
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:05.890
<v 7>oh</v>

280
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.130
<v 8>one started asking around different students being like, Hey,</v>

281
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:12.190
have you had anything happen with border patrol at school?

282
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.510
And I got literally hundreds of stories.

283
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.770
<v 9>I was walking home from school and you know, I had my backpack on.</v>

284
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.160
<v 5>This is Nydia Rodriguez who was a freshman at the time</v>

285
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.040
<v 9>and all of a sudden I saw this truck, the a border patrol truck,</v>

286
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:28.500
and it was eating my way.

287
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.350
<v 5>A couple of agents got out of the track and started questioning her,</v>

288
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.790
<v 9>where am I from or where am I going? Basically you were all rounded up.</v>

289
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.000
<v 5>Arnessa Munios remembers walking to school with a bunch of kids.</v>

290
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.300
<v 9>We were searched her backpack</v>

291
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.960
<v 5>and again, you know, a couple of agents got out, started asking him questions,</v>

292
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.830
<v 9>so where we were born or date of birth with classes we were taking. Yeah.</v>

293
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.690
<v 5>Can we stop when they get out of the truck?</v>

294
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.440
Marcella Delyon who was walking with a friend near school and they go,

295
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:56.210
what do you have in the bag? And I go, books, you know,

296
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.790
what else would I have in my bag? They're like, well, let us see.

297
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.730
<v 10>Well, I was walking the yelled at me, hey, get over here. Ricardo, the Elma,</v>

298
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.350
they sped up to me and the stopped in front of me and asked me, you know what's,

299
00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:09.120
what's in the bag was like books.

300
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.390
One of them ripped the bag out for my hands as I was trying to pull it away from

301
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:17.010
them. The other one grabbed me and pushed me up against the truck,

302
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.580
forcibly took the bag away, rifled through.

303
00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:24.420
It pushed me off the or. They pulled me away from the truck,

304
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.390
threw my bag at me and told me to get outta here.

305
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.350
<v 8>As these stories came out,</v>

306
00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:32.830
it became clear that even the staff had had its run ins with the border patrol.

307
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:36.340
We, we talked to the assistant football coach, Ben Marijo.

308
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.850
He told us there was this moment he was driving with two of his football

309
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:40.390
players.

310
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.170
They got pulled over by the border patrol and one of them actually pointed a gun

311
00:17:44.171 --> 00:17:45.550
at his head. Never had it

312
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.040
<v 10>gun pulled on me. So I thought my life is over</v>

313
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.850
<v 11>and I identified myself. My name is coach Ben.</v>

314
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.870
Would you coach at Buoy High School? I have two of my football players.

315
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.710
I would really appreciate it if you'd holster your gun and the guy barked at me.

316
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.830
I appreciate you if you shut your mouth and get out of the car.

317
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.560
<v 0>Eventually the agent did holster the gun. Ben did get out of the car.</v>

318
00:18:08.561 --> 00:18:10.390
Everything was fine. What was that like

319
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.050
<v 11>right in your was uh,</v>

320
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.200
the one of the scariest things in my life.

321
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.190
<v 0>Wow. Why was the border patrol on the grounds of the school?</v>

322
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.480
Do they have some reasons? So let's, let's set the scene a little bit. Uh,

323
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.350
I'm more maybe because I think to understand what was going on at buoy high

324
00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:31.184
school,

325
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.530
<v 3>no, you have to understand something else. The legend of El Paso,</v>

326
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.060
you have to understand how pos, there's a spirit, a flavor.

327
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:45.690
So come on and may go see it for yourself from 30,000 feet of ball.

328
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.440
The desert [inaudible]

329
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.010
<v 0>right on the border of Texas, Mexico and New Mexico. It's right there.</v>

330
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:56.780
It's right there. It's also the biggest city,

331
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.820
<v 3>the West Texas city of El Teso</v>

332
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.850
<v 0>that shares a border with Mexico too.</v>

333
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.430
And the other thing to know about it is that it's like,

334
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:06.950
it kind of has a mirror city on the other side of the border,

335
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.540
which is war is warrants. See You dad. What is the largest city on the US?

336
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:12.374
Mexico border.

337
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.940
So the two cities are separated by this little sliver of the Rio Grande,

338
00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:21.941
but they were essentially the same city up until 1848 when the US invaded Mexico

339
00:19:22.221 --> 00:19:25.780
and annexed half the country. And even now, according to Juan,

340
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.450
<v 6>this mythical division between these two cities,</v>

341
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.890
it's just doesn't exist for most of us. I mean, I go to the dentist over there.

342
00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:38.220
I buy cigarettes over there. Okay. I smoke. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well,

343
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.210
almost everybody in El Paso knows people who live in the field. Headwaters.

344
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.480
Yeah.

345
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.720
People are feeling waters know people who have family members who live in El

346
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.330
Paso, and this is literally one community.

347
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.020
<v 0>But the thing is that when everything was going down in buoy in the early</v>

348
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.853
nineties male

349
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.490
<v 3>was the community in crisis.</v>

350
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.180
So come on and make them the night the Pacer,

351
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.700
<v 0>the crisis has spilled across the Rio Grande.</v>

352
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.290
In the 80s the Mexican peso crashed. Oh, dramatically.

353
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:10.830
Devalued peso is causing habit AISES in wages.

354
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.760
So people in Juarez started flocking new El Paso because, well,

355
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.560
that's where the jobs were. Like jobs in construction or childcare gardening.

356
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.220
Though you had tens of people getting these permits to come until a Paso legally

357
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.720
that then you had all these other people,

358
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.340
workers who can't get permits required by US law, couldn't get permits,

359
00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:30.750
but they still need it to work.

360
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:35.250
Simply respond to the laws of supply and demand and so they started coming to

361
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.660
making illegal dashes across the border to the United States at unprecedented

362
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.360
number. I mean he was as high as like 10,000 people a day,

363
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.950
a day coming back and forth illegally basically for their commute to work.

364
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.440
<v 12>It was chaos. It was a mess. Here</v>

365
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.950
<v 4>we spoke to this phone,</v>

366
00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:56.790
border patrol agent guy named David Ham at a smuggling special agent.

367
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.630
He told us that when, when he was on that job before dawn,

368
00:21:00.631 --> 00:21:04.350
you could go down to certain parts of the Rio Grande to have 102 hundred people

369
00:21:04.351 --> 00:21:08.880
lined up waiting on the river's edge. Sun come up and here they'd come.

370
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.450
It's morning in America and the rush hour has begun.

371
00:21:12.451 --> 00:21:17.010
The rest across the Rio Grande into El Paso and there videos where you can see

372
00:21:17.011 --> 00:21:17.221
this.

373
00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:22.020
You see people waiting into the shallow parts of the river to cross over to El

374
00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.830
Paso if they don't want to get wet, that can pay a young entrepreneur,

375
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.040
a small fee and raft across. And so for people like David,

376
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.760
these border patrol agents, okay, your code close about a hundred.

377
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.430
It becomes this cat and mouse game where

378
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.780
<v 12>way we had always done business. They come in, you chase him,</v>

379
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.970
catch him and send them back

380
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.410
<v 4>day and night and day and night. It was, it was a never ending job</v>

381
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.840
<v 12>and it was something, you know,</v>

382
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.510
you'd catch the same guys two or three times a shift sometimes.

383
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.470
So it was, it was chaos.

384
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.790
<v 13>Obviously we're not accomplishing 100% of our mission.</v>

385
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.140
<v 5>And this is actually kind of hilarious. So like, um,</v>

386
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.360
around this time in 1992,

387
00:22:05.361 --> 00:22:08.210
there was a television interview and Dale Mussa Guedes,

388
00:22:08.211 --> 00:22:11.060
he's the sector chief of the Border Patrol in El Paso.

389
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.580
He's wearing his green hat with his green uniform,

390
00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:15.350
with the gold shield on his chest.

391
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.030
<v 13>If we were not here and did not keep a lid on this situation</v>

392
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.330
<v 5>in the shots behind him,</v>

393
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.710
<v 13>uh, there would be just an absolute free in inflow from other countries.</v>

394
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:31.830
<v 5>You can see people climbing up the banks of the Rio Grande and just walking into</v>

395
00:22:32.621 --> 00:22:33.454
El Paso.

396
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.500
<v 4>That's like having Wyatt Earp standing in front of three bank robbers robbing a</v>

397
00:22:37.501 --> 00:22:38.334
bank.

398
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.080
<v 5>Exactly. And I'm like, so, okay. How many entries?</v>

399
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.700
Um, all right.

400
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:49.080
So it was reported at the time that for every one migrant,

401
00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:53.070
the border patrol caught there were at least three to five who snuck in and

402
00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:53.904
didn't get caught.

403
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.000
And the border patrol said that this was because they just didn't have the

404
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:57.834
resources.

405
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.070
They didn't have the money or the agents to apprehend all these people that are

406
00:23:02.071 --> 00:23:05.320
coming in, which finally brings us back

407
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.290
<v 4>to buoy high school. Okay. All right. Okay. Yeah,</v>

408
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.740
let's try it because there's two important things about bullying. Okay.

409
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.010
I'm counting my steps actually here. Okay. From the sidewalk. One,

410
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:21.970
one buoy is right, right. Four, five,

411
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.770
six right on the board. 49 but basically it's 50.

412
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.450
That was 50 steps. 50 steps from the buoy campus into Mexico.

413
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.370
Yeah. And to, uh,

414
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.970
the former assistant football coach and teacher Ben Marijo,

415
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.760
he showed me what's the, what is that?

416
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.180
This fence. Oh,

417
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.800
that's part of the old fancy El Paso in the 70s put up a bunch of fencing on the

418
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:54.140
border to curb illegal immigration. So it's like a, it's much taller than us,

419
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.470
but it was, it was pretty flimsy. They called it the Tortilla curtain.

420
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.480
And right at this spot across from buoy high school,

421
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.280
there was a hole in the fence.

422
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.933
<v 7>Mm.</v>

423
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.250
<v 4>Yeah. And David Ham,</v>

424
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.270
a former border patrol agent told us what that meant was that you had migraines,

425
00:24:10.271 --> 00:24:15.100
you had a lot of migrants who would be coming through that hole in the fence

426
00:24:15.101 --> 00:24:16.000
from buoy, a spoon.

427
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.610
<v 5>And he claimed that it wasn't just people looking for work,</v>

428
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.310
it was also people bringing in drugs.

429
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.300
<v 8>No Way. I know that because I work,</v>

430
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.320
our anti-smuggling unit would watch them come through.

431
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.890
<v 5>And so border patrol agents had taken to just sort of hanging out around the</v>

432
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:37.280
school on the school's property, on the football field,

433
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:41.630
across the street from the school. Like just, they were just there all the time.

434
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.440
<v 4>There were even rumors that border patrol agents would go under cover as</v>

435
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:48.590
students and that they would, you know, wander the halls,

436
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:50.540
that they would go into the locker rooms.

437
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:55.290
<v 8>I noticed the, uh, the suburbans parked on the Bouley campus.</v>

438
00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.390
<v 4>Yeah. Again, former buoy teacher one cyber cornetto.</v>

439
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.500
<v 8>But the whole reason, you know,</v>

440
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.010
that I thought they were there was the chain link is cut and they need to stop

441
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:07.760
people from entering into a high school instead of realizing that what they're

442
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:10.220
doing is they're using the high school as a hunting ground

443
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.310
<v 4>and tea and soda one,</v>

444
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.680
when he started hearing about all these stories of these 14, 15,

445
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:20.030
16 year old kids getting stopped and shaken down, it wasn't about border patrol,

446
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:23.840
China's stop migrants from coming in or trying to stop drugs from coming across

447
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:24.674
the border.

448
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.590
<v 8>It was the border patrol of simply stopping people because they were brown.</v>

449
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.350
And that really, um,

450
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.560
this is radio angered me,

451
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.490
but for most of these kids

452
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.920
<v 9>it wasn't nothing like out of the ordinary,</v>

453
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.420
<v 5>you know, kids like Ernesto Munoz, Ricardo v Elma,</v>

454
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.520
<v 8>that was just day to day life tuck it even to some of the committee members,</v>

455
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.040
honey Santos had told me, Oh, don't worry about it.

456
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.160
<v 5>Growing up in this poor neighborhood right next to the border,</v>

457
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.730
<v 8>just us, uh, we are live here in south El Paso.</v>

458
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.680
<v 9>It wasn't like a concern like, oh no, you got stop,</v>

459
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:05.230
<v 8>you go to the park and shoot some, some basketball. You'd tell your, your,</v>

460
00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:07.960
your school mates, you know, you guess what happened after school.

461
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.880
<v 9>He was like, you know,</v>

462
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.950
ha you got stopped and that's probably because your haircut or probably because

463
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.550
of how you're dressed or whatever.

464
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.460
<v 4>So the students were more likely to laugh about it than be angry.</v>

465
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.230
But it is us history class.

466
00:26:19.231 --> 00:26:23.070
That year one started teaching his kids about civil rights,

467
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.490
actually getting them to debate the different ways of thinking about civil

468
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:26.680
rights,

469
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.830
<v 8>talking about stuff like a [inaudible],</v>

470
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.880
<v 14>the activities which have taken place in Birmingham over the last few days.</v>

471
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.370
<v 8>A letter from the Birmingham jail</v>

472
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.480
<v 14>onto my mind, mark,</v>

473
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.090
the nonviolent movement coming of age

474
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.600
<v 3>and it's Liberte or day</v>

475
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.630
<v 8>Malcolm x is ballot or the bullet.</v>

476
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:52.420
<v 3>It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody and so the students are</v>

477
00:26:52.421 --> 00:26:53.290
learning about

478
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.123
<v 8>wow,</v>

479
00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.330
farm workers strikes in California in the 1960s we learn about Cesar Chavez.

480
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:05.000
I know workers know. We learned about Dolores Huerta,

481
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.210
[inaudible], Karina, and it was like, okay,

482
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.970
I'm bringing the book and I look out the window. And third, they are borderline

483
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.790
<v 3>patrol agents and SUV is on the parking lot. Stopping students.</v>

484
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.690
<v 9>I think that's when we were like, wait,</v>

485
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.850
<v 3>just kind of like it felt not okay.</v>

486
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.360
<v 9>I mean I didn't fully know exactly the letter of the law.</v>

487
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.120
<v 3>That's Nydia Rodriguez again,</v>

488
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.630
<v 9>but I knew that what they were doing was wrong and</v>

489
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.310
<v 3>eventually some of these students started to get together</v>

490
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.443
<v 9>some talk.</v>

491
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.260
<v 3>Do you think this is right? What do you think this is about,</v>

492
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:38.210
<v 9>Heather? You know that this is wrong.</v>

493
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.390
[inaudible] talked about how we wanted things to be different.

494
00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:47.620
<v 3>Let's see what we can do about it because this has to stop.</v>

495
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.770
Alright. Alright. That's what's up.

496
00:27:59.260 --> 00:27:59.650
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

497
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.290
<v 3>coming up. Juan and his students fight back.</v>

498
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.410
Will continue in just a moment. Let's do some more warm ups. Let's do

499
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:38.503
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

500
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.430
<v 15>Hi, this is Monica calling from Oakland, California.</v>

501
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:49.200
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public

502
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.200
understanding of science and technology in the modern world.

503
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.250
More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

504
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.000
caught a new podcast about juvenile justice from wny c studios follows a group

505
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:06.750
of kids as they navigate their way through our criminal justice system.

506
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.220
These aren't stories about innocence. They ask once the kid is caught,

507
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.330
what happens next?

508
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.610
<v 8>I wouldn't even wish like jail on nobody.</v>

509
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:19.020
Like cause is not a nice place to be because if you do something or say

510
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:21.840
something wrong, you're going to get in more trouble or like down

511
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.630
<v 15>Kai, right? The host of cod.</v>

512
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.020
Listen and subscribe to caught where ever you get your podcasts.

513
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.170
<v 3>God, Robert, lot f Tracy and hello. Ricardo and Tony.</v>

514
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.250
Okay. Okay. All right. So, uh, some of these kids at Bowie high school,

515
00:29:40.251 --> 00:29:42.100
they actually to this group,

516
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.930
<v 8>Metro Metro [inaudible],</v>

517
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100
which is a Chicano civil rights group that's been around since 1960s.

518
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.390
<v 5>It was a college group,</v>

519
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:56.050
but these kids at buoy actually petition them to have a chapter at the high

520
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:57.860
school and, and Mecha said

521
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.783
<v 8>sure.</v>

522
00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.860
We were the first ones to get a collegiate group and they asked one if he could,

523
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.060
you know, supervise,

524
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.800
we would meet about once a week and our meetings tended to be 30,

525
00:30:09.801 --> 00:30:12.590
40, 50 kids packed into a classroom.

526
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.790
<v 5>And for one of these meetings, one brought in, one of his friends,</v>

527
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:19.630
a woman named Susan Kern, she worked for the border rights coalition.

528
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.540
And so she comes in and the students start telling her, you know,

529
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:26.470
what's been going on? And they ask her, do we have any rights here?

530
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:31.090
She tells him, absolutely you do. Because according to the US Constitution,

531
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.060
the border patrol or really any officer,

532
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.250
<v 8>the law, they cannot stop you without reasonable cause. [inaudible]</v>

533
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:39.660
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

534
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.320
<v 5>they had to have seen you cross the border or when you saw them you started</v>

535
00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:46.050
acting fidgety or you ran away or something.

536
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.780
<v 8>They can't just arbitrarily stop you question you just because of the color of</v>

537
00:30:50.781 --> 00:30:51.410
your skin.

538
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:55.550
That's not enough to stop you because if that's the only reason they have to

539
00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:57.990
stop you, then they're violating your fourth amendment right. Yeah.

540
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.530
<v 5>The right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures.</v>

541
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.900
<v 8>Exactly. They just said, you know what, you're getting,</v>

542
00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:06.460
your rights are getting stomped all over.

543
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:09.760
Let's see what we can do about this because it needs to stop.

544
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.540
After Susan explained that the rights were being violated,

545
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.620
the conversation turned to, what are we going to do about it?

546
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:21.300
We had a lot of students who were suggesting things that were probably,

547
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.170
you know, slightly inappropriate. Like how about we just curse them out?

548
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.130
Which I thought, well maybe that's not a bad approach, but uh,

549
00:31:28.131 --> 00:31:32.280
apparently according to one's friends, Susan Huff was not the right response.

550
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.970
That can maybe get you in trouble, can be considered assault.

551
00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:39.420
And so another student said, well, what if we just run away from them? Uh, no.

552
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.110
Another kid was like, what if we fight back? Oh God, definitely don't do that.

553
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.510
[inaudible] but finally

554
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.940
one of the students who's been watching law and order, that'd be Mason,

555
00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:55.500
you're under arrest for the attempted murder of your mother whose knew all about

556
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:58.890
saying you have the right to remain silent, the right to remain silent,

557
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.940
Carolyn Tyler, you have the right to remain silent. And he was like,

558
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:02.843
that's a thing.

559
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.060
<v 5>It's your Fifth Amendment Constitutional Right.</v>

560
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.770
And it's something that you typically hear.

561
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.800
<v 8>I have, however,</v>

562
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:12.450
been instructed by my counsel not to testify based on my Fifth Amendment

563
00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:13.590
Constitutional Rights.

564
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.920
When rich white dudes get in trouble on the advice of counsel,

565
00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.460
I invoke my fifth amendment privilege and respectfully declined to answer your

566
00:32:20.461 --> 00:32:23.250
question, but this one buoy metro student was like,

567
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.220
<v 1>why don't we do that? And</v>

568
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.950
that's exactly what our students started doing

569
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:36.210
<v 5>after that, when border patrol agents would stop students and say, Hey,</v>

570
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.000
give me your papers. Some of these students would,

571
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.900
<v 3>no, I want to use my fifth amendment rights.</v>

572
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.170
I want to take the fifth amendment made a right to remain silent.

573
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.590
Simple as I have the right not to incriminate Iceland. Three remain silent.

574
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.430
I do not want to answer your questions. Sorry. I had a burp. Okay. Ready?

575
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.810
I have a fifth amendment right to remain silent. Remain silent.

576
00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.110
I don't want you to go through any of my stuff, right. To remain silent.

577
00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.420
You're not going through my backpack. I'm not talking to you.

578
00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.400
Once you use my pivotal amendment Fifth Amendment right and the message starts

579
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:10.980
spreading around right through Maine. Silence remain. Silence, silence, silence,

580
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.870
silence.

581
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:16.600
That we really don't need to answer these people's questions to remind sat

582
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.590
silent. Yeah. That has a terrific to nail down.

583
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

584
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.980
<v 4>well, I w I'm, I'm kind of trying to imagine myself being,</v>

585
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.610
being you and giving advice to these students. And on the one hand,

586
00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:37.080
obviously this is their legal right not to provide this information.

587
00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:40.350
On the other hand, I can imagine that, you know,

588
00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:45.000
I've heard that there are these border patrol abuses. There are, uh, you know,

589
00:33:45.001 --> 00:33:45.834
these,

590
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.590
there are times when this doesn't go well and I'm telling these students to go

591
00:33:49.591 --> 00:33:54.270
out and basically, you know, stonewall these agents and they,

592
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.930
it could put them in harms waves and it did frequently

593
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.620
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

594
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.920
<v 6>students were harassed for this. Students were,</v>

595
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.580
the most notorious case is the case of David Renteria.

596
00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.760
<v 7>And uh, the way I'll start started was June the third.</v>

597
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.000
<v 5>So this is David Renteria from a documentary that was made in the nineties about</v>

598
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:24.500
buoy high school. Yes. So David Mentor Maria, he was a senior at buoy,

599
00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:28.000
<v 6>a legally blind student who was coming home from graduation practice.</v>

600
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.260
<v 5>Uh,</v>

601
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.620
and this one day he and his friend are just walking down the street and a border

602
00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:34.060
patrol truck rolls up.

603
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.750
<v 7>They stopped and they asked us for, said that you and I responded, you know,</v>

604
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.360
you want citizen. My friend did the same thing and they asked us again,

605
00:34:40.361 --> 00:34:44.380
what is the citizenship of US citizens? So they asked us again and they said,

606
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.550
you're a citizen. And I just sat with time to get them and it's gone.

607
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.380
Check that box. And a [inaudible]

608
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.540
last night said it, we didn't stop that we're going to beat us up.

609
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.260
Feel bad to go work to the point that we going to be able to go.

610
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.420
<v 5>A border patrol agent, gets out of the truck, comes up to David</v>

611
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.440
<v 6>and started threatening to break his arm. If he tried to walk away,</v>

612
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.310
<v 7>I felt this hand on my arm leftover. You drag it back,</v>

613
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.560
you dragged it. I turned to face you and

614
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.590
ended up that had taken 15 minutes from exercising the right to remain silence

615
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.110
and he got me, slammed me, it gets a sense. And uh,

616
00:35:24.111 --> 00:35:28.130
he put his neck in the back of my neck and he kicked my legs,

617
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.240
<v 5>locked him in his face apparently. And you know,</v>

618
00:35:31.241 --> 00:35:35.140
David wasn't physically injured after that. He was freaked out.

619
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.550
But the reason one called this particular

620
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.410
<v 4>incident notorious is because</v>

621
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:44.590
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

622
00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:48.850
<v 4>immediately after to local news and El Paso picked it up and started doing a lot</v>

623
00:35:48.851 --> 00:35:53.410
more reporting on, on border patrol, on buoy and so did

624
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.830
<v 1>from the El Paso, Texas</v>

625
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.320
<v 4>National Ness, good morning freaking America. You know what I mean?</v>

626
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:00.893
That's pretty huge.

627
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.160
<v 16>The daily invasion has strained the relationship between the border patrol and</v>

628
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:08.520
some people at buoy high school, you know, and then, and we're talking to us,

629
00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:13.440
we all have rights and then our rights daily on a day to day course are being

630
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:15.000
violated. Why are they arrested?

631
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.640
Because we're Hispanic because the color of our skin,

632
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.130
because we live right on the border and because,

633
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.550
well we live in a really poor neighborhood and that's the only reason.

634
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.280
<v 4>And as this news started to grow, the border patrol sector, chief Dale,</v>

635
00:36:27.281 --> 00:36:31.120
Musa guedes decided he was going to come to buoy to talk to the students.

636
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.560
Is that something you remember him showing up to? Oh yeah, this the music aids.

637
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.850
Am I going, it was kinda doing damage control right.

638
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.840
<v 16>At that point when agent Dale Music Aids met with about 40 students to discuss</v>

639
00:36:42.841 --> 00:36:44.970
the alleged harassment, he kept us out.

640
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.160
<v 4>We tried to contact Dell, Musa Gates Multiple Times for this story,</v>

641
00:36:49.161 --> 00:36:51.500
but he did not reply to our voicemails or emails,

642
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.090
but they patch great when she morning,

643
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:59.270
we were able to get footage of that meeting.

644
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:03.710
Moosa Gades kept Good Morning America out because one of the students a tape

645
00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:05.870
this and then we managed to get our hands on it.

646
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.620
So it's like 30 40 kids from Mecha in this classroom.

647
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.490
And Dale Mussa guedes he was sitting in front of us wearing a suit and tie,

648
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.420
trying to put things into perspective. He started telling the students like,

649
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:21.890
look, the holes in the fence, hey apolo told we keep patching them up,

650
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.753
they keep getting here.

651
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.570
<v 16>[inaudible] and I said, I would try to come in and I can't, I,</v>

652
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.730
I don't think there's any way in the world. He'd go cold.

653
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.870
<v 4>And you told the students they busted some people who had brought drugs through.</v>

654
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.400
<v 16>I now have another case [inaudible]</v>

655
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:43.100
<v 4>so music gates is like, we're essentially trying to stop the flow of drugs here.</v>

656
00:37:43.101 --> 00:37:44.900
Why are you guys complaining so much?

657
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.470
<v 16>[inaudible] eventually you drive your hand, right?</v>

658
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:56.740
The students started speaking up. I gotta ask a question.

659
00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.960
Do you remember back in the borderline phone number? The days I've been in here,

660
00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:01.260
back and forth on Devon,

661
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.680
<v 4>one student stands up and says, Hey, you're harassing us.</v>

662
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:08.880
And that's why we're upset and be your strategy for capturing border crossers

663
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:12.270
seems to beat a, heard them all into the school where they're penned in.

664
00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.340
<v 16>I mean like how would you want to be running?</v>

665
00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.130
You run it into a place where they can get out of the circle.

666
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.770
The men paddle like old people

667
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.060
will not stop or will not obey the law and play.

668
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.050
You have to add some somehow or another apprehended. I don't, I,

669
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.370
you know, I don't know a better way to do it. I don't know. Not at this like,

670
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.370
okay. Number. Right.

671
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.820
<v 4>It's a little hard to hear, but he said not the sacrifice of our rights.</v>

672
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.170
<v 16>It's not, yeah. What do you mean by five on the right?</v>

673
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:49.250
[inaudible] they do not have rights to come into United States illegally.

674
00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.180
<v 4>What did it feel like to be sitting in that meeting? I mean,</v>

675
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.100
<v 8>well it felt bizarre. I mean that, you know,</v>

676
00:38:56.101 --> 00:38:59.760
somebody who's denying what everybody sees with their own eyes. Yeah.

677
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.970
There was no face value to what, what he said. You know,

678
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.080
cause at that point we were sinning. A cynical about the whole situation.

679
00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:09.000
And you know, you can't undo the stuff that was already done.

680
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.590
<v 4>So the meeting goes poorly, uh,</v>

681
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.430
and a bunch of the students and some of the staff, including Ben Mario,

682
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:18.610
the assistant football coach who had a gun pointed in his face, um,

683
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:22.930
they all together decide that they want to sue the border patrol.

684
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.690
<v 8>The phone rings one day and eventually they call up this guy and said,</v>

685
00:39:28.691 --> 00:39:32.140
we're getting ready to sue the border patrol. Will you be our local counsel?

686
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.240
And I said, not only yes, but hell yes, I'll pass a civil rights lawyer.

687
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:42.010
Albert Armandarez Jr were you optimistic? I mean, it's,

688
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.830
it's never an easy job. Suing the government is not easy.

689
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.250
When you live on the border and working sagoon the body,

690
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.870
you are never optimistic that a governmental system is going to work for you.

691
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:54.843
So yeah,

692
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.090
<v 4>October 23rd, 1992,</v>

693
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.270
the trial between buoy high school and the border patrol begins.

694
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:06.680
And apparently the courtroom was pretty much divided in half. On one half.

695
00:40:06.681 --> 00:40:11.540
You had the border patrol like a ton of agents in full uniform sitting there on

696
00:40:11.541 --> 00:40:12.650
the other half. You had these

697
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.260
<v 8>Buie students dressed in their finest Cyndi dresses, slacks, shirts.</v>

698
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.960
Those kids were little troopers and they all got up in the stand,

699
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:22.310
told their stories.

700
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:28.010
<v 4>And then eventually border patrol sector chief Dale, Mr. Gates testifies.</v>

701
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.680
Do you remember what the defense's argument was? Well,

702
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:34.710
they had lots of arguments. Um,

703
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.170
now we can't verify the specifics of what happened in the courtroom because a

704
00:40:38.171 --> 00:40:41.500
lot of the court documents had been destroyed, but Musa guedes got up there.

705
00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:45.970
And his basic argument was that if you look at the u s code of federal

706
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:50.920
regulations, section 1357 powers of immigration officers and employees,

707
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.443
number one,

708
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:58.230
officers have the power to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an

709
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:02.590
alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.

710
00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.880
And they can do that without a warrant. And then skipping down a bit from that,

711
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:07.720
um,

712
00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.550
they can do that quote within a reasonable distance from any external boundary

713
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:16.030
of the United States. What's a, what's a reasonable distance? Oh, this is,

714
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:17.050
what's nuts is,

715
00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:20.440
I don't know exactly what went into the germination of what that is,

716
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:23.920
but the distance is a hundred miles. Really? Yeah.

717
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:27.880
In that hundred mile zone, border patrol has the power to interrogate,

718
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:31.300
has the power to arrest without warrant and they can also, and I'm quoting here,

719
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.900
quote, search for in any railway car, aircraft,

720
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:40.370
conveyance or vehicle within that distance. And then on top of that,

721
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:43.460
within a narrower distance of 25 miles from the border,

722
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.920
they can go right under private property whenever they want theirs.

723
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.740
It's like this little zone

724
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.650
<v 17>that's designed to prevent border patrol officers from being charged with</v>

725
00:41:53.651 --> 00:41:57.820
trespass. When patrolling the border, I crossed, examined,

726
00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.250
she was a gate. And so

727
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.650
<v 4>what Mussa Gates was arguing is that like if they have all this power and if</v>

728
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:06.180
they can go on, you know,

729
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:10.290
private property right up on the border and you got this high school on the

730
00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:11.070
border,

731
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:15.210
then there's no question that they can be on school property and do their job.

732
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.950
<v 17>That's how they read that.</v>

733
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.020
But they couldn't understand is they were doing it in a way that violated the

734
00:42:22.021 --> 00:42:25.290
constitution and that is against the supreme law of the land.

735
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.150
<v 4>This was Albert's argument that no matter what powers you have,</v>

736
00:42:29.151 --> 00:42:31.280
you can't violate somebody's fourth amendment rights.

737
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.520
You have to have a legitimate reason to stop somebody.

738
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.030
<v 5>So, um, what did the court, um, what ultimately happened? Okay,</v>

739
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:39.780
before this court, finally of the,

740
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.360
it's a findings of facts and conclusions of law. Bunton Comma,

741
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.760
senior district judge before this court.

742
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.730
It's plaintiff's motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary

743
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:53.360
injunction and memorandum of law in support pursuant to rule six [inaudible]

744
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.390
does that sound any like anything to you? He's saying,

745
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.960
here's what we got in front of me here. All right. Okay. Thank you.

746
00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.530
The next week we, the next paragraph now jurisdiction and venue. I'm gonna.

747
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.670
Okay. That means keep leading on the findings of fact, the litigation,

748
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:12.150
the named individual plaintiffs, very, very bottom as

749
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.740
I here by order,

750
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:20.150
the court hereby enjoins the Immigration and National Naturalization Service.

751
00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:22.340
The INS, which is above at the time,

752
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.290
was above the border patrol from stopping and questioning an individual as to

753
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:32.390
his or her right to be or remain in the United States unless the agent has

754
00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:37.391
reasonable suspicion based on specific articulable facts involving more than the

755
00:43:38.571 --> 00:43:42.440
mere appearance of the individual being of Hispanic descent. Okay.

756
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:46.760
That's a fancy way of saying stop judging people by their looks side. The judge.

757
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.920
Yes, so they won. They won.

758
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.130
<v 16>It was just absolute elation.</v>

759
00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:56.340
It was a big celebratory school assembly and the whole school, no,

760
00:43:56.341 --> 00:43:59.730
Tony Santos was there and we were there yet. Yeah. Yeah. Pepe.

761
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.060
There were all these parties, Davis plaques.

762
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.930
I think I may even have stuff on the wall up there. It was pretty awesome.

763
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.010
Again, for my student, Ricardo v Elma,

764
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.710
it was crazy to see the least [inaudible] holes at the border patrol did violate

765
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.970
constitutional rights. You just don't see the agents on our campus anymore.

766
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.430
That's the assistant football coach, Ben Marijo,

767
00:44:20.431 --> 00:44:23.580
who ended up being the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit after treating us.

768
00:44:23.581 --> 00:44:26.340
Like people realize I'm not like second class citizens,

769
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.510
not like we have to be submissive simply because they're federal agents.

770
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.100
You know, we, we couldn't believe that we

771
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.480
<v 10>took on the federal government.</v>

772
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:36.750
And one that was one of the first times that I was really proud of what our

773
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:38.440
government, you know, stands for.

774
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.260
<v 3>And Ricardo said, coming out of federal court that day,</v>

775
00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.670
it was like him and seven other students and they came out and there was a bunch

776
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:01.770
of other students and faculty from the school there.

777
00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.080
<v 10>Everybody was like, cool, let's go back to school, hop in the car. Like, no,</v>

778
00:45:05.081 --> 00:45:09.270
we kind of want to bask in this. So we walked from, uh,

779
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.450
the federal courthouse downtown to bully highschool and you know,

780
00:45:13.451 --> 00:45:16.720
and we were getting, there were, we were all just kind of tearing up.

781
00:45:16.721 --> 00:45:20.820
We were proud. We were just happy and, and surprised all at once.

782
00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.030
It was just weird.

783
00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:27.031
We started our stones and you know we had camera crews and news crews waiting

784
00:45:27.131 --> 00:45:29.380
for us as we were walking up. Cause I guess the,

785
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.470
we got wind that we were just walking back to school.

786
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.490
<v 3>But in the wake of this victory, in the months following,</v>

787
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.520
there will be a chain of events that would really drastically change the US

788
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:52.911
Mexico border forever and take us to really to where we are now.

789
00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.730
<v 7>When you, because you just, you wrote in that essay sort of just sorta,</v>

790
00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.040
you don't see the connection, you don't think there's a connection,

791
00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:03.430
but the fact that the connection is being made still sort of weighs on you.

792
00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.900
Of course it weighs on us. Okay.

793
00:46:04.901 --> 00:46:09.901
Because I mean because of us fences were built because the fences were built.

794
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:15.700
Maybe 10,000 people have died in the desert.

795
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:33.430
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

796
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.550
<v 0>I didn't know when cactus among them many before that might hold some hope</v>

797
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.180
men tore their faces open. Chewing Saguaros prickly pears,

798
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.150
leaving gutted plants.

799
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:48.280
I've looked like animals have torn them apart with a clause.

800
00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.460
The green here, west grave.

801
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.990
They walked west though they didn't know it.

802
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.950
They had no concept anymore of destination.

803
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.350
They were in a vast trickery of sand.

804
00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.480
One of them said peaches.

805
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:18.770
<v 3>So how the story goes from jubilation and pride to death in the desert.</v>

806
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.970
That's the subject of our next episode. This episode of our,

807
