00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I'd like to ask you a tricky question about regression that will illustrate

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
why regression got it's name.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Why is this thing that gets us the best fit of a line?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What does that have to do with regression--going backwards?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd like you to tell me for any two variables x and y,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if they're not perfectly related--that is if the absolute value of their correlation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is not 1--how extreme is our y prediction compared to x?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
By extreme, to be a little more precise, I mean this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have x. We have some observation in the x's--say right here.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have a total probability that's denoted by this little shaded region

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that a given xi is either at that value above--farther away from the mean

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or here farther away in this direction.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We can map that to a y using our regression equation,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we'll get a value in the y distribution,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and it will have, again, some probability of being that value or more extreme.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The smallness of that probability is what we mean by extremity.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
One percent chance is more extreme than a 40% chance.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
One in a million is more extreme than 1 in 1,000.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What I'd like you to tell me is will y be more extreme?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Will y be as extreme?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Will y be less extreme?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Or it depends on the data.

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check the right answer.
