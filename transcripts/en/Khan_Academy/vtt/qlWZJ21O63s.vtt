00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.060
Plot the images of points
D, E, and F after a dilation

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.760
centered at the origin
with a scale factor of 1/2.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060
So we're going to center
around the origin.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.270
We want to scale this
thing down by 1/2.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.940
So one way to think
about it is the points

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.820
that will correspond to
points D, E, and F are going

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.000
to be half as far away from
the origin, because our scale

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.720
factor is 1/2 in
either direction.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.950
So for example, let's
think about point D first.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.760
Point D is at negative 8.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.280
So if we have a scale factor of
1/2, what point D will map to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.560
is going to be at negative
4 on the x direction.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.730
And on the y direction,
D is at negative 9,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.120
so this is going to
be at negative 4.5.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.124
Half of that.

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:48.790
So that is going to
be right over there.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.350
That's where point D is going
to be, or the image of point

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.070
D after the scaling.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.940
Now let's think
about point E. E is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.450
2 more than the origin
in the x direction.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.760
So it's only going to be 1
more once we scale it by 1/2.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.076
And it's 7 more in
the y direction,

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:06.450
so it's going to
be at 3 and 1/2.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.070
7 times 1/2 is 3 and 1/2.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.050
So we're going to stick
it right over there.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.160
And then finally F, its
x-coordinate is 6 more

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.840
than the origin.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.070
Its y-coordinate is 6 less.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.860
So its image after
scaling is going

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.960
to be 3 more in the x direction
and 3 less in the y direction.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.780
So it's going to be
right over there.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.686
So we've plotted the
images of the points.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.310
So if you were to
connect these points,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.200
you would essentially
have dilated down DEF,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.597
and your center of dilation
would be the origin.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.180
So let's just write
these coordinates.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.780
Point D-- and point D, remember,
was the point negative 8,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.960
negative 9.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.770
That's going to map to--
take 1/2 of each of those.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.790
So negative 4 and negative 4.5.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.170
Point E maps to--
well, E was at 2, 7.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.910
So it maps to 1, 3.5.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.930
And then finally, point
F was at 6, negative 6,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.915
so it maps to 3, negative 3.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.440
So the important
thing to recognize

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.330
is the center of our
dilation was the origin.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.550
So in each dimension,
in the x direction

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.140
or in the y direction, we
just halved the distance

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.520
from the origin, because
the scale factor was 1/2.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.450
We got it right.
