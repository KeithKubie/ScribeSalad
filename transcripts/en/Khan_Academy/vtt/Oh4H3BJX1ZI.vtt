00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.270
One of the viewers pointed out
not incorrectly that one

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.310
definition of return on asset--
so this whole video's

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.670
going to be on return on asset--
that one definition of

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.390
return on asset, and if you
look it up on some of the

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.420
finance sites or even some
finance textbooks, they'll

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.220
tell you it's net income
over total assets.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.310
Which is different from
what I told you.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.380
And other sources, namely
Wikipedia, will tell you that

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.460
it is actually-- so this
is one definition

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.690
of return on asset.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.760
Another definition
is net income.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.800
I'll just abbreviate
that as NI.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.500
Net income plus interest. So
they're adding back your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.450
interest. And then they're
subtracting out the tax

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:01.560
savings due to interest.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.950
And we could a whole video on
the tax savings from interest.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.540
And when it makes more sense
to raise money with debt

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.130
versus equity, because of the
cost of interest. But that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880
also increases your chance
of bankruptcy, the more

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.830
debt you take on.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.630
We could do a series
of videos on that.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.460
But tax savings from interest.
Divided by assets.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.090
This is a definition that
Wikipedia gives you.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.810
And then the very first
definition I gave you was

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.810
operating profit over assets.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.090
And then I'll add one more
definition to this video, just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.540
because I think it's worth
talking about.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.310
And I think this is kind of a
general theme in finance, is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490
that there's all these
formulas for things.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.100
And people memorize them.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.220
But in the process, you lose
a lot of the intuition.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.740
And it's also important to
realize that there are

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.690
multiple ways of defining the
exact same terms. So people

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.360
can confidently say
the ROA is this.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.045
And you know what?

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.880
It's never a bad question
to ask them what

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.060
they mean by ROA.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.320
And I think you'll also be
surprised by how many people

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.890
won't be able to tell you
what they mean by ROA.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.580
But then the last one, if I have
time to go over, we'll

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.350
call it EBIT.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.190
I know that look like
a very strange word.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.610
EBIT divided by assets.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.190
But just so you know what EBIT
is, EBIT is just Earnings

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580
Before Interest and Taxes.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.920
So this is just the same thing
as net income plus interest

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.260
plus taxes.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.810
So it's kind of a pre-tax
ROA divided by assets.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.090
So these are all different
things.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.890
And you might already say, wait
if I took net income--

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.500
let's actually talk about
this for a second.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.950
Let's compare EBIT to
operating profit.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.480
You might immediately say, if
I took net income-- so let's

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.560
remember EBIT is just an acronym
for Earnings Before

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440
Interest and Taxes.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.970
So let's see.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.030
If our earnings are $350,000.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.280
And we were to add back the
taxes and the interest. So we

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.030
add back the taxes, which
gets us to pre-tax.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.020
And we add back the interest,
at least in this example, we

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.240
get to an operating
profit number.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.390
So you might say, why is there
a different term EBIT instead

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.120
of, why don't people just always
use operating profit?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.960
And the reason why there's a
different term is, sometimes

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.990
you can have the non-operating
profit.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.780
So let's say that out of this
$10 million of assets-- and I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.820
didn't go there in the first
example because I didn't

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.050
really want to complicate the
issue, but I'll complicate the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.400
issue a little bit now.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.390
Let's say out of this $10
million of assets, let's say

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.610
that $9 million are
operating assets.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.070
They're the enterprise.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.960
They're the things that are
needed to generate the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.690
operating profit.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.850
And then you had another
$1 million of

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.360
assets of this $10 million.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.870
That the company really doesn't
need to operate.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.100
They just have it around.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.500
Maybe they're speculating
on oil prices.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.960
Or they're just hedging
something.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.800
Or they just have a super
flush bank account.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.610
So these assets might
be generating

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.150
non-operating income.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.230
So you could have a line here
for interest income or

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.200
investment income.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.670
Let me put that.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.300
Investment income.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.380
And then the company might have
made some money there.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.260
It might make $10,000 on
investment income.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.210
And of course that'll
drop to this line.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.360
This'll then become $510,000.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.790
The taxes will be $153,000.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:47.020
And the net income
is $357,000.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.620
Because we have a
30% tax rate.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.430
And that make sense, right?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.450
I added an extra $10,000
of income here.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.300
And then at the end of the day,
you're going to tax at

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.440
30%, so this should be $7,000
more of earnings.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.690
So that makes sense. $357,000.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.370
But this is the difference
between

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.420
operating income and EBIT.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.490
EBIT in this case would be the
operating profit plus this

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.360
investment income.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.490
So EBIT, in the case that I
just added some investment

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.600
income, would be $1,010,000,
while operating profit would

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.350
be $1 million.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.150
I didn't want to go there in
the first video, and that's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.600
why I just said operating profit
divided by assets.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.910
But if you really consider all
of the assets, and if you

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.740
assume that there are some
assets there that are

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.420
non-operating.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.080
They're not really used to
make widgets, or to sell

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.770
widgets or market widgets, or
help the CEO in any way do his

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.040
or her job.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.990
Then whatever this generates
is actually

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.390
non-operating income.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.290
And so EBIT factors that in.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.250
So EBIT, I kind of view that
it goes backwards.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.090
It starts with net income.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.840
And then it adds back the taxes
and interest. While

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.680
operating profit, you start at
the top line and you go down.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.710
But in general if you take
EBIT and you take out the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.550
non-operating income, you get
back to operating profits.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.480
So that's what EBIT
is right here.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.950
And so you can already imagine
that both EBIT and the way I

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.400
defined it initially, operating

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.040
profit divided by assets.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.120
They're ways of saying, before
you consider taxes, what are

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.930
your assets doing for you?

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.980
So once again, if this is a
balance sheet, this is the

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.590
assets, here are your
liabilities.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.620
Debt could be one of them.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.220
But in general it could be
a bunch of other things.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.270
You might owe other vendors
money or whatever.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.810
Then you have your equity.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.100
It's important whenever
you talk about

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.520
any of these ratios.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.220
What context?

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.640
Are you trying to pass the CFA
exam, or are you trying to

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.680
impress your MBA professor?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.010
Or are you trying to get an
intuition for helping to

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.600
become a better investor?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.975
And if you are an investor,
you're probably going to want

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:52.560
to do the last of the three.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.320
And there, ROA, the Return on
Assets is telling you, how

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.910
good is this company at getting
a return out of this

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.290
thing right here?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.590
I don't care how they paid for
it, whether they had debt.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.930
I don't want to think
about, are they good

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.940
at getting low interest?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.760
I don't want to think about, is
their CFO good at getting a

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.770
better interest rate
than another CFO?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.160
Or are they better at evading
taxes than another company?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.950
All I care is the assets that
they have, how good are they

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.540
at putting those
assets to work?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.800
And what type of a return
can they get?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.270
So if I calculate it using you
EBIT divided by assets, or

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.960
operating profit divided by
assets, if I use either of

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.600
these as my metric for ROA and
Company A has a 10% ROA and

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.100
Company B has a 15% ROA, then
I say, you know what?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.120
I don't care whether B's guy
is better at getting a low

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.950
interest rate.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.970
Or getting some type of tax
handout from the government.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.080
Or doing something fancy
with where he keeps his

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.970
subsidiaries.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.120
I just want to know which
management is better at

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.030
getting a return out
of these assets.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.650
And these metrics will
tell you that.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.660
Because it tells you either how
much operating profit is

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.340
being generated from here,
or it could tell

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.350
you how much EBIT.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.390
In this case, an EBIT might be a
little bit more informative.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.480
Because some of income might
be generated from

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.980
non-operating assets.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.410
So maybe the company holds some
stock, or it holds some

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.370
gold or something.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.040
Or it holds some forward
contracts to hedge its

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.720
exposure to oil or foreign
currency or something.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.299
So in general if you want to
know what I think is the best

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.760
ROA, I would say it's EBIT over
assets, which is very

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.950
close to operating profit
over assets.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.909
And now you say, well Sal, why
are these other things here?

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.170
And why don't you like
them as much?

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.460
Well, net income over assets,
I think the reason why that

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.440
definition exists is because:
one, net income does factor

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.620
into these things that frankly
I didn't want to

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.670
think as much about.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:05.360
But when you talk about return,
what you get off the

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.640
asset, you still are going
to pay taxes on them.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.760
And if you do have some
financing, you will be paying

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.150
some interest on that.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.620
So that's why this comes out.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.440
Where they actually just
take the bottom line.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.410
When people talk about top line
and bottom line, now you

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.410
know where those words
come from.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.790
Top line is revenue.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.730
It's the top line of the
income statement.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.430
And your bottom line, that's
the bottom line

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.310
of the income statement.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.820
That's where the word
comes from.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.250
So that one definition takes
this and they divide by the

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.250
total assets.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:40.380
But the reason why I don't like
that is this definition

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.320
does not separate out that one
company might be better at

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.380
evading taxes or paying taxes.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.660
And another company might be
better at somehow getting

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.090
better financing
from the bank.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.240
And that's not what matters.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.150
I care about the assets.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.770
I care just about the
left-hand side

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.670
of the balance sheet.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.530
While this is taking into
consideration some of the

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.870
factors on that side of
the balance sheet.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.770
For example, let's say you have
two identical companies.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.190
This could be an interesting
example.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:16.250
You have one company-- Actually
I just realized I'm

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.600
out of time.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.200
I'll continue the example in
the next video, and I'll

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.060
explain a little bit about the
tax savings from carrying debt

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.690
or interest. See you
in the next video.
