for example is is this big engineering

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550
for example is is this big engineering
 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.980
for example is is this big engineering

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
with their pulse on the market that you
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.740
with their pulse on the market that you
need back into the engineering people

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750
need back into the engineering people
 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.590
need back into the engineering people
and there's one case we know right now

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600
and there's one case we know right now
 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.260
and there's one case we know right now

through a huge change they figured it
 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.300
through a huge change they figured it
out they're basically using the H step

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310
out they're basically using the H step
 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.880
out they're basically using the H step
method that we've found for years now

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890
method that we've found for years now
 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.610

and what what's going to happen there's

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620
and what what's going to happen there's
 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.720
and what what's going to happen there's
tension already because as they move

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730
tension already because as they move

this engineering group is going to have
 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.540
this engineering group is going to have
to move with them and so these guys are

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550
to move with them and so these guys are
 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.760
to move with them and so these guys are
beginning to say wake up and say woo

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770

doing it and eventually the second group

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550
doing it and eventually the second group
 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.460
doing it and eventually the second group
is going to have huge influence if you

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470

example the same industry and there's
 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.800
example the same industry and there's
enough crosstalk across the industry

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810
enough crosstalk across the industry
 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.010
enough crosstalk across the industry
industry associations people change jobs

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020
industry associations people change jobs
 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.610
industry associations people change jobs
across companies that one company really

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620
across companies that one company really
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.470
across companies that one company really
starts going out front and they do it

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480
starts going out front and they do it
 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.000
starts going out front and they do it
not just by doing a bit a little bit

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010
not just by doing a bit a little bit
 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.940

the products but they really do it by
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.800
the products but they really do it by
changing the way they operate big change

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810

don't get on to it pretty quickly we're
 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.770
don't get on to it pretty quickly we're
going to be in trouble and so we get

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780
going to be in trouble and so we get
 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.810
going to be in trouble and so we get
this it's not quite a copying effect but

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820
this it's not quite a copying effect but
 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.180
this it's not quite a copying effect but
the second company is smart enough to

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190
the second company is smart enough to
 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.890
the second company is smart enough to
watch carefully what the first company

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900
watch carefully what the first company
 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.460
watch carefully what the first company
is doing and they moved so it's the

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470
is doing and they moved so it's the
 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.530
is doing and they moved so it's the
leader company has a huge impact without
