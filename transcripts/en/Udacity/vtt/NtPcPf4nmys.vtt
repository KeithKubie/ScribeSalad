00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.890
Okay, so here's a quiz for you Micheal, here's the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.490
setup, you ready? You've got N data points. The learner

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.420
that you're going to use over your subsets is a

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.570
zeroth order polynomial. The way you're going to combine the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.520
output of the learners is by averaging them. So, it's

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.320
just what we've been talking about so far, and your

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.920
subsets are going to be constructed in the following way. You

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.380
uniformly randomly picked them and you ended up with N different

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.160
subsets or disjoint, and each one has a single point

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.170
in it, that happens to be one of the data points.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.620
&gt;&gt; Okay i think i get that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560
&gt;&gt; Right, so if you look over here on your left

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.800
you got a graph of some data points and this is

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.740
one subset This is another subset, that's another subset, that's another

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.650
subset, that's another subset, that's another

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.710
subset, that's another subset, got it.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, now what do you want to know about it.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.490
&gt;&gt; Now what I want to know is when you do your

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.760
ensemble learning you learn all these different,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.990
you learn all these different rules and then

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.510
you combine them ,what is the output going to be? What does the ensemble output?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.640
&gt;&gt; And you want a number?

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.710
&gt;&gt; I want a description and if the answers a number that's a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.240
perfectly fine description. But I'll give you a hint, it's a short description.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.140
&gt;&gt; A short description of the answer. Okay, I'll think about it.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.710
&gt;&gt; Alright.
