00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So what we have at this point is that the condition in our code becomes true

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when we see a double quote and it becomes false when we see a single quote.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
At this point, we should have enough material to solve the problem.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What's the correct way to fix this condition--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
should it be a check for the just double quotes and single quotes and tags,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
should we go and invert the condition such that not tag is being checked,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
should we put parenthesis around the or condition,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or should it be none of the above and something completely different.
