Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich, Radiolab or topic today where its power of words of language. Okay, so Nicaragua 1970s that's where our next story starts. You with me? So imagine you're a kid that's deaf in Nicaragua at this time, born deaf, or are born deaf, born deaf. You've always been deaf and you're the only one in your family that's deaf. So you're in this situation where everybody's talking, their mounts are moving, you can't hear it and you don't know sign language cause no one's taught you. There was no deaf school in Nicaragua than nothing. Okay? No deaf education of any kind. So if you were this kid, all you've really got are a couple of gestures, really. Crew gestures. You've worked out to talk to your family and friends. But beyond that you're cut off Blake Ildefonso, the guy we met at the beginning of this show, except in Nicaragua in the 70s there were hundreds, maybe thousands of these LD fans.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Those really? Yeah. But then everything changes in the late seventies hopes of Mosa who was the wife of the then dictator established a new school for special education. I think she had someone in her family who had a disability, not deafness, but the school would include deaf people and that says psychology professor and Singhouse was the first cause. Now instead of deaf kids scattered about, they were together in the same room. There were 50 deaf kids in that first entering class, preschool to sixth grade, the late seventies for most of them. This was the first time they'd ever met another deaf person before the world was going on around them and everyone was all talking and they were cut off from that and suddenly for the first time they were all there and they were what was happening and they were what there was to talk about, but they didn't have a way of talking.

Speaker 1:          01:45          These are 50 different kids who'd never learned a language and had 50 different sets of like rudimentary gestures that they used to. Wow. That must have been like 50 people with 50 different ways to try and ask for breakfast or say they want to go outside. I mean nothing was shared. It's not like the teachers were using sign in the classroom. Everything in the classroom was Spanish, which none of them knew, copying it into their notebooks. A lot of it was going right over their heads who at the beginning things were completely confusing, but they're riding on the bus for an hour every day and they're playing out of recess for an hour every day and they're getting together at the park and no one knows how it happened. Like maybe one of the kids who was very charismatic, he invented a sign for safe ball, then told it to another kid who was very, you know, socially active. And that second kid then spread the sign. However it worked over time, the signs that these 50 kids used started to converge into a common system. And when you step back from it all, what that means,

Speaker 1:          02:43          they created a language

Speaker 2:          02:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:50          they, it's, they didn't just take it from somewhere else, they couldn't take it from somewhere else. They created own. But how unusual is that? Like this has happened with languages all over the world, but not while people were watching it. So you're saying this is the first time we've been able to watch a language being born? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:10          Wow.

Speaker 1:          03:11          And for the last 20 years, that is what Anne has been doing. She's been going to Nicaragua to that school and watch it.

Speaker 3:          03:19          So, um, oh, you want to describe that? So I may have gotten recording of this, but when you arrive at the school, the buses come around, the kids are all screaming and leaning out the windows and siding to each other and the kids pile out and they line up in rows on the basketball court that's in the center of the school yard. And they all sing the national him

Speaker 2:          03:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:50          and the deaf kids all sign the national hem and they all have one hand over their heart and sign with the other hand while the, the hearing kids sing it

Speaker 1:          04:01          and visited the school for the first time in 1990 about 10 years after it was formed, she'd been working at the time with a linguist named Judy Kegel, studying basic linguists type stuff. Right. Trying to figure out how the verbs work and whether they have agreement with their grammatical objects. And along the way her and a collaborator, jetty pyres stumbled into something really surprising about the power of certain words there to set it up. When she got there the first time in two Nicaragua, those original 50 kids who'd invented this thing had grown up already. And there were these younger generations of kids coming in behind them, growing up with the language, using it, inventing new signs. And at a certain point she got curious to just compare the original signers, the older kids to the younger kids. Yeah. In terms of how they sign, we show everyone this.

Speaker 3:          04:53          Well, one minute cartoon about this guy who's trying to fly. He sees a bird flying and he puts all these feathers on his body and clouds up to the top of a mountain, flaps his arm and jumps up and crashes on the ground.

Speaker 1:          05:10          So she showed deaf kids of different generations, this cartoon and asked them pretty simply to describe what they saw. Just describe it in sign, describe the whole story. The differences were striking. Um, first of all, so I'll just show you an example of each year of vaping. A movie here.

Speaker 4:          05:27          This is a first cohort signer talking about, she got out her laptop and showed me some video. First of this woman in her hair, her forties, with dark hair and a colorful tee shirt. She was one of the original signers. And when you see older signers like her, describe this guy who's trying to fly, it's really spastic. It's almost like they become the cartoon and she's flapping her hands just socially. So moving all around, a lot of full body movements. She's talking about someone who's moving in a crazy way. She's going to be moving in a crazy

Speaker 1:          05:58          way. And then she showed me a young kid who was about eight, the backwards cat. So here's Sylvester and now he talks about the manner when he described the man jumping and then falling, it was all in the wrist. All the movement is now in the hand and it's a very stylish, you know, they're trimming these signs down. But more to the point, there was one thing she noticed that was really unexpected, had nothing to do with movement, couldn't help noticing that they, that people, different people in the community talked about different things in this story. The older signers tended to describe all the events in this story and only the events and the younger kids, they would talk about the guy's feelings that this guy was trying to fly, wanted to fly, but failed the kids. She says, just seem to be better at thinking about thinking, thinking like other people's thinking. So Anne and Jenny decided, let's take all the different generations of deaf kids, 40 year olds, 30 year olds, 20 year olds, 10 year olds. Let me test them on how well they can think about thinking. So what they did was they showed everybody a comic strip different from before. This one was about two brothers.

Speaker 3:          07:11          There's a big brother who was playing with a train and then little brother is like wanting to play with the training and the big brother's playing with the tray and then the big brother puts it under the bed and goes into the kitchen to eat a sandwich.

Speaker 1:          07:22          And maybe before he goes, he looks at the little brother and says, Hey,

Speaker 3:          07:25          don't touch my train, don't touch it. And then little brother, while the big brother is out of the room, takes the train out and hides it in the toy box. And then the big brother comes back and the question is, where's the big brother going to go to find this train? Is he going to look under the bed or is he gonna look in the toy box?

Speaker 1:          07:44          Well, he's going to look under the bed. Yep. Because it's as far as he knows, that's where he left it. Yeah. He didn't see it moved. And if you ask kids over the age of five, most of them would say he's going to look under the bed because that's where he left it. And he doesn't know that it's been moved to the toy box, but here's the thing. When she asked the older signers, they would say, oh look in the toy box. Really they would pick the wrong one. These are 35 year olds. 35 year olds would get this wrong. They would fail this task. Yeah, seven out of eight she says, and then all of the younger signers that we worked with past at this point, she's just confused like why would this be, why can't the older people pass this simple test? You know, that involves thinking about someone else's thinking, what's going on here.

Speaker 1:          08:27          And then in a career tour you might have something to do with certain words because the older signers, they don't really have that many words for the concept of thinking. I mean they have mainly just one side pointing at your forehead. Yeah. Basically you just point at your forehead with your index finger. By the time you get to the younger kids, they've got tons of words for thinking things like, I know something and I know that you don't know it. I know something and I know you do know it. They've a signed for understand, believe, remember, forget how many roughly were there? 10 or 12 wow. So from 30 years we go from just a couple, two of them from like knowing and not knowing. Right? 12 yeah, and somehow that makes all the difference. She says the more of these think words you've got, the more you can think. Am I right to say that you're tiptoeing toward that, that you maybe you don't want to go there all the way. I'm trying to think that I guess I don't think it's so simple that you could just go in and say, Hey, I'm going to teach you 10 signs today and now suddenly you're going to have better cognitive capacity. But you are saying though that the verb think [inaudible] is somehow implicated in my ability to think about your thinking. Right.

Speaker 5:          09:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          09:45          thinking about thinking, understanding how other people understand. That's something that having language makes you better at. There are certain words she says that don't just give you a name for something. Somehow they give you access to a concept. It would otherwise be really hard to get or even talk about. It's really hard to talk about thoughts without the word thoughts or what does time without the word time. It's really freaking hard concept. These words are like breaches. Somehow they get you to some new mental place that otherwise you'd be cut off from. But that's sad though. I mean these young kids have something that the people who actually invented the language double, but

Speaker 1:          10:38          you went back two years later, tested the same people and then suddenly some of them were performing a lot better than they had the two years before on the same kinds of tasks. Do you mean the older signers? Yeah, they were passing suddenly some of them were passing. Yeah. Was that what happened? What happened in the past two years? Yeah. Those younger kids grew up and started hanging out at the deaf association. Wait, what? So what had happened in the mean? So here's the strange twist of the whole thing. The Deaf Association is this place where the older signers would hang out. Yeah. It's a social club. So they played chess, do whatever. Well, it has certain point these youngsters start showing up, you know, cause they've graduated and they want to hang out at the deficit association too. But they bring with them all of their new mental verbs, you know all these words for thinking. They start using it with the older kids. The older kids pick it up. Most suddenly these older kids are now passing the test. So there was learning that took place in adulthood that actually it gives them new insight into other people's thinking and motivation and now they can pass these tasks. That super interesting story. It's really cool.

Speaker 7:          11:57          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:58          and sank Hass is an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College in New York.

Speaker 7:          12:06          Hmm.

Speaker 8:          12:07          The thing, of course you want it, you wonder is a, once you've gotten these, this new facility in you, there's, there's a lot of literature about this. My fear lady is about this and Philly's about this. Yeah. It's about a woman who learns uh, proper English and she can no longer be a flower girl and come in and garden. She's family. Yeah. I guess it is kind of like this. You want like member that our program began with the story of Ildefonso, right, which we heard from Susan Scholler Ildefonso who's The guy who for 27 years had no language at all. So you kind of wonder, I can tell you that like what happened to Ildefonso once he got language, right. And after that first breakthrough where elephants will realize things have named Susan ended up leaving for a few years.

Speaker 9:          12:47          So let's see, it was a about four years, I think, four or five. Then she decided to write a book about him. And so I, um, I went and found him again and he had language and I could ask him all kinds of

Speaker 8:          13:00          questions. Were you able then to sit down with him and ask him about his life and to really get the sort of his biography

Speaker 9:          13:05          somewhat, somewhat one, um, area that everyone wants to know about is what was it like to be language this, you know, what was going on in his head? Yeah. And I asked, when I asked him, I asked and he starts telling me that was the dark time in his life learning language. It's like the lights went on and I tell him what we know about language and we want to know what it's like not to have language and he doesn't want to talk about it.

Speaker 8:          13:30          But there was a day she says when she was writing the book and she met Ildefonso in a restaurant and there he was sitting with his brother, Mario, who she'd never met before and she quickly learned that Mario also was deaf

Speaker 9:          13:41          and the language lists Billy. So I was shocked and because I was so amazed going, I can't believe you have a language that's brother. That's when, um, we build upon the son. Well, let, let me introduce you to some of my friends. So they get in a car and they drive for a while. We stopped at this apartment, we walk into this small little room and there were these six Mexican men doing this mine routine. Wait, all of these guys were like Ildefonso used to be, they had no language. We're all born deaf and they didn't know that they were deaf and what, what were they doing? One man would stand up and he would start miming, he would just start acting out a bull fight. So He'd read the bull and he'd be charging and then you'd be the matador, and then he'd be somebody in the crowd watching. And then he would add a detail, for example, a hatch and they'd swap. So then another guy would get up to take over the story and they'd start miming maybe Mac the matador, describe the hat. But now the second storyteller would add a new detail, like another person with a pair of glasses or something.

Speaker 8:          14:53          So each one would stand up, take the bull, fight the same bull fight to a different point and add a detail.

Speaker 9:          14:59          Exactly, exactly. Oh my God. In other words, I would take him maybe 45 minutes to say, do you remember the time when we were out of the bull fight and this woman did such and such? It was like drawing

Speaker 8:          15:11          a picture. Well, let me ask you a pull it all together. Question. I was about to think that what a language is, is a great connector. But this last story makes me wonder, these are five men really sharing and connecting on details. So is the difference that language makes just efficiency or does it affect your heart or your whole body of I can't tell. I'm not sure anymore. Well, I'll give you Ildefonso the answer, which

Speaker 9:          15:42          when I saw him, um, a couple of years later after this incident, I asked him about his friends and he said he couldn't talk to them anymore. He wasn't willing to go through that tedious effort of all the miming anymore. But the interesting thing that he said was he can't even think that way anymore. He said he can't think the way he used to think. And when I pushed him to ask about what it was like to be languaged Lis, he, the closest he ever came to any kind of an answer was exactly that. I don't know. I don't remember.

Speaker 2:          16:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          16:18          I think differently now.

Speaker 2:          16:23          Uh, [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         16:34          Susan Sharla is author of the book a Man without words. Go to radiolab.org for more info. And if you go there, or if you're subscribed to our podcast, you'll get this automatically. But there's a beautiful short film directed by two really talented guys, will Hoffman and Daniel Merca Dante, that is all about words.
