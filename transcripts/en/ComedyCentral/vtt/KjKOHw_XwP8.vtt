OKAY, I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:34.434 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS GOING
THROUGH HER MIND.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.335 align:start position:0% line:85%
ROBIN, EXPLAIN TO ME.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THINK WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH
HER MIND.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.471 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WANT TO BE BLACK.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:42.608 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HATE MY FAMILY. BEING BLACK
LOOKS COOL.

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.844 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU THINK THERE WAS A
HATRED THING THERE?

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.612 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HER FAMILY?

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:47.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:49.148 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; FOR SURE.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start position:0% line:85%
HER FAMILY OUTED HER.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.086 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL WHITE KIDS HATE THEIR
FAMILIES.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.522 line:85%
&gt;&gt; DO THEY HATE THEM THAT MUCH?

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:01.260 line:85%
&gt;&gt; HER PARENTS HATED HER TOO.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.629 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: THERE ARE DEFINITELY
ISSUES THERE.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.900 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY SHOWED UP IN THE WHITE
SHAW, WHITE SHAW.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:13.005 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DIDN'T CLAIM CHEROKEE INDAN
OR ANYTHING.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:13.940 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE ARE WHITE.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.208 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE ARE GERMAN.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.342 align:start position:0% line:85%
I AM GERMAN.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:21.981 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET'S SEE -- WOULDN'T YOU
RATHER BE BLACK THAN GERMAN?

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.818 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; OH --

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: I THINK IT DEPENDS ON
THE TIME PERIOD.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.124 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; 2015.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.726 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: I DON'T LIKE HOW
BLACK IS THE BAD THING.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.263 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE, YOU KNOW I'M REBELLING AND
I'M GOING TO BE A BAD THING

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.431 align:start position:0% line:85%
CALLED BLACK.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:41.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS INTERESTING ENOUGH I
WAS IN GERMANY LAST YEAR.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAD A DRIVER WHO WAS
OBVIOUSLY A MIXED KID ME.  AND

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.206 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY WIFE.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:51.210 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MIXED WITH GERMAN --
&gt;&gt; AFRICAN AND GERMAN.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start position:0% line:85%
CURLY HAIR, WIDE NOSE.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.348 align:start position:0% line:85%
BEAUTIFUL BROTHER.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.684 line:85%
ME AND MY WIFE WERE ABOUT TO GO.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:02.922 line:91%
I SAID I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHICH
ONE OF YOUR PARENTS IS BLACK.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.291 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HE SAID HOW DO YOU KNOW.

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:08.060 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY SAID SAID BECAUSE WE [BEEP]
LOOKED AT YOU.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.331 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS LIKE YOU DON'T -- SO OTHER
PLACES I GUESS IT'S EASIER.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DON'T FOCUS ON THAT THE WAY
WE DO THIS THIS COUNTRY.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:19.672 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HERE IS THE PROBLEM IN THIS
COUNTRY.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:23.943 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY FATHER IS GERMAN.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY MOTHER IS BLACK.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.346 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT ME.
BLOND HAIR, GREEN EYES. 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.352 line:91%
ARE YOU BLACK? AND I'M LIKE,
LAST WEEK YOU KNEW I WAS BLACK

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO I NEED TO CARRY A PICTURE OF
MY MOTHER AROUND? 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.890 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE LEVEL OF BLACK
THAT RACHEL IS TRYING TO BE.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:43.863 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; SO TRUE.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.666 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: IT'S PROBABLY --
PROBABLY A DIAL WHERE

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.937 line:85%
SHE IS LIKE OKAY, BLACK ENOUGH.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.906 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBVIOUSLY SHE DID THINK ABOUT
THAT, NATASHIA, RIGHT.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.309 line:85%
WHERE DID THAT TAN COME FROM?

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.244 line:85%
IS THAT SOMETHING ON HER SKIN.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:02:59.512 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THE MALL.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S A MALL TAN.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:08.421 line:91%
I LIVE IN A WHITE SUBURB AND I
SEE 50-YEAR-OLD MOMS IN TRUE

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
RELIGION JEANS AND THEY'RE ALL
JUST BASKETBALL ORANGE.

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:15.194 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S KNOWN AS LEVEL THREE
MYSTIK TAN.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.263 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU HAVE TO EXFOLIATE GREAT.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:21.901 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WIG SHOP
IN SPOKANE WASHINGTON SHE GETS

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.703 align:start position:0% line:85%
HER WIGS FROM.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:27.540 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LET ME ASK YOU, IF WE
TALK ABOUT THIS, IF SHE'S DOING

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:30.376 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOOD THINGS FOR THE GROUP ARE WE
MAD AT HER.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.781 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I COULDN'T BE MAD AT HER
UNTIL I FOUND OUT SHE WAS IN

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:36.448 align:start position:0% line:85%
SPOKANE.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.317 line:85%
NOTHING HAPPENING IN SPOKANE.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY HAVE TO IMPORT THE
BLACK PEOPLE FOR NAACP THERE.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:48.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SHE HAD TO GO TO
CANADA FOR THE MEETINGS

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.663 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOING TO VANCOUVER.

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; TRY.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:53.966 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHE GAVE QUICK ANSWERS.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.735 size:78% position:39% line:85%
ARE YOU AFRICAN-AMERICAN?

00:03:55.768 --> 00:04:01.674 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF
AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.910 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I CONSIDER MYSELF BLACK.

00:04:04.943 --> 00:04:11.183 align:start position:0% line:91%
BLACK PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN WHITE
PEOPLE A LOT OF PASSES.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:17.490 line:91%
BILL CLINTON, COLONEL SANDERS
AND TIGER WOODS A SUPER PASS.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.824 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SHE DID GROP UP 4 BLACK
SIBLINGS AND HER PARENTS 

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:23.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEEM MEAN. THEY'RE LIKE "WE JUST
LOVE TELLING THE TRUTH AND

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:26.432 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE HATE OUR DAUGHTER."

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:28.501 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY CAME OUT AND SAID THAT
ABOUT HER.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:32.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS HORRIFYING.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: PUNISHMENT: YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE BLACK SIBLINGS

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.409 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LARRY, I FEEL A HUNDRED
PERCENT SURE OF THE NUMBER ONE

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.977 align:start position:0% line:85%
HALLOWEEN COSTUME IS

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.444 align:start position:0% line:91%
GONNA BE THIS YEAR
&gt;&gt; Larry: HER?

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:38.978 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.946 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; TRUE.

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.949 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE WON'T BE INVITED TO ANY OF
THOSE PARTIES.

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:45.184 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:48.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE SAYS SHE IDENTIFIES AS
BLACK.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.289 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS BLACK JUST A THING NOW? A LOT
OF YOUNG PEOPLE  

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:54.327 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE EQUATED HIP HOP CULTURE
WITH BLACK.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.062 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY SAY HIP HOP CULTURE IS
BLACK.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOT ALL BLACK PEOPLE SAY IT'S
OUR CULTURE.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:01.133 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S PART OF OUR
CULTURE.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:11.877 line:91%
IT'S NOT LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING
SAID YO, YO, YO, I GOT A DREAM

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
[BEEP].

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:13.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE WAS BLACK.

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.448 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
THOSE GERMAN SHEPHERDS KNEW HE
WAS BLACK.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.450 align:start position:0% line:91%
[AUDIENCE GROANS]
WHAT, IS IT TOO SOON?

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:20.252 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S JUST ANOTHER GERMAN
REFERENCE.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.355 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAYBE SHE'S BLACKISH.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.023 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAYBE SHE CAN SAY THAT.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:25.291 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ARE WE THINKING.

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:26.392 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT IS BLACK.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:27.793 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHEN YOU HEAR BLACK.

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:30.129 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WHAT DO YOU THINK, NATASHIA?

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:31.731 line:85%
WHAT DO YOU GO TO FIRST, COLOR?

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS OUTDATED.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.067 align:start position:0% line:85%
Larry: THE TERM.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.236 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YA.

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:38.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
Larry: MAYBE CHOCOLATE IS
BETTER.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.007 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, I MEAN WHAT DO I THINK
OF?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.077 align:start position:0% line:91%
I KNOW SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
OF BLACK PEOPLE.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.247 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ARE YOU GETTING
UNCOMFORTABLE NOW.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.248 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; KIND OF.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:50.616 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST GOT MY DNA TEST, AND I AM
6%

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:57.184 align:start position:0%
 SUB SAHARA AFRICAN AFRICA AND I
HAVE BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT IT
SINCE
