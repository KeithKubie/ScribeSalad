00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.250
In this playlist, we've been
constructing a monetary or

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.850
banking system that reasonably--
in the simplified

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.160
form, approximates the
system we're in.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.560
So we said, OK, we need
a banking system.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.340
And we went the fractional
reserve route.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.810
We said, we'll take deposits,
but we realize that most of

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.010
the deposits just sit there.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.200
People really don't use them so
let's re-lend out some of--

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.160
90% or 50% of the deposit--
some amount.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.580
So we have to keep some fraction
aside as reserves and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.370
that way we can use that money
to lend more, but in the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.850
process, we create a multiplier

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.860
effect and create money.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.105
So that's what we described; a
fractional reserve system.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.190
And when we talk about reserves,
what we originally

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430
talked about reserves
was gold.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.750
It was gold based.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.740
We started off with
the farmers.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.670
They had their gold.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.920
Gold was the unit of exchange
from primitive times.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.210
It was the first agreed
upon medium, and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.400
people kept with that.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.360
And then we eventually showed
that in a fractional reserve

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.050
system when you have this
multiplier effect and you

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.350
become kind of an advanced
Western industrial economy, to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.770
some degree the gold might just
sit in the central bank

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.240
vaults and just kind of
provide this kind of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.760
confidence in the system, but
really, it does nothing there.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.180
It just provides a confidence.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.990
And at some point we show--
I think it was in the last

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.650
video-- that you can actually
just go off the gold standard

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.380
and you could go onto a
non-hard currency-- or

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.520
not-backed by gold.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.540
And the point of that is really
to get to where we are

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.510
today and to show that
it isn't crazy.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.070
There's a lot of-- I guess you
could call them conspiracy

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.540
theorists who think that there
was kind of a negative intent

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.020
behind going off of the gold
standard and that it was

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.870
somehow stealing money.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.600
And you know what?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.550
I'm not 100% sure that they're
not wrong, but I'm just saying

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.410
since then, it's not like we've
had wealth destruction

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.660
and that we've turned
into some type of

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.699
post-apocalyptic society.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.520
Economic growth has been pretty
fast. There's been

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.450
innovation.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.570
Productivity has increased.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.440
So at least as far as I can
tell, it seems like you can

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.570
have a reasonable economic
system that's not backed by

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.540
gold, that's actually backed
by the actual wealth, where

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.650
the wealth is the productive
capacity of a country.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.690
So, not backed by gold.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900
And that's where we got
to in the last video.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.340
I think I struck a nerve a
little bit because the gold

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.080
really isn't fundamentally doing
something and it really

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.780
is just a medium of exchange.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.100
And some people said, how
can you say that?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.960
Gold is definitely
worth something.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.740
There's no reality
in which gold

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.830
cannot be worth something.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.290
Gold controls other assets.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.530
So it it's good to, I think,
one, think about what other

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.730
routes we could've taken
down this banking

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.580
system evolution tree.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.270
And then also think about-- I
guess, revisit the notion of

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.870
gold itself.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.670
So if we just think about--
let's revisit gold first

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.340
because I think that's what a
lot of people care about.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.910
So there's two things
that I was drawing

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.790
a difference between.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.800
And it's a philosophical
difference, but I think it's

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.420
an important one.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.410
It really helps, I guess,
get a handle on

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.600
things in the world.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.720
So there's money and then
there's wealth-- and this is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.080
tricky because at the end, these
are just definitions and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.130
definitions take on different
meanings as time goes on.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.360
I looked up wealth in Wikipedia
and it gave the Adam

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.550
Smith definition-- from The
Wealth of Nations-- and he

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.030
talks about wealth as the land
and-- I think it was the land

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.340
and labor that produce
utility for humans or

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.050
something of that sort.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.590
So essentially his definition
is, wealth would be things

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.910
like land, it would be food, it
would be shelter, it'd be

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.160
transportation, it would be,
I don't know, it would be

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.210
entertainment to some
degree, right?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.770
That provides some utility.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.020
It makes us happier.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.690
Or it could be things that help
produce these things like

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.470
factories or-- who knows what
else-- computers, things that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.000
help us produce all of these
things more efficiently.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.630
And if you stay in that mindset,
money is not wealth.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.950
Money is just a medium of
exchange for wealth.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.720
You could say money has value.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.200
The value of money really is the
oil or the lubrication of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.730
the economy.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.060
Without any form of money, you
would have to be bartering.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.640
If I was a a home builder and I
wanted to get bread, I would

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.560
have to exchange a house for, I
don't know, 10,000 loaves of

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.210
bread, which just is
not practical.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.410
Instead, I can exchange it for
money and then later exchange

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.330
that money for bread.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.790
And within this money medium of
exchange context, there's

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.070
different types of
money, right?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.460
There's paper money.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.880
There's hard currency,
et cetera.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.790
And gold would fall under
this context.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.450
And then there's a fundamental
question: Is gold

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.410
fundamentally, intrinsically,
worth more than paper money?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.860
And I guess it goes to
just, what do you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.230
think is going to happen?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.030
I mean, the benefit or the
negative of gold or a lot of

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.770
hard currencies is
that it's scarce.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.460
And by it being scarce, it's
not like you can just print

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.200
this stuff and there's
always going to be a

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.440
set supply of it.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.380
And so if someone took a
negative spin on it, scarcity

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.630
would mean less flexible.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.950
Or if you took a positive spin
on it, you could say it can't

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.200
be manipulated.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.780
And both of these are probably
true to some degree, right?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.130
But that's what it is.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.740
It's just a scarce
unit of exchange.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.870
And so I'm not saying that gold
will one day lose its

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.300
ability to control some of these
things or be exchanged

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.580
for some of these things.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.420
I'm just saying that money or
the unit of exchange is

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.420
fundamentally different than
these things that actually

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.320
provide utility.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.670
I mean, gold does have
some applications.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.130
Maybe you say it provides
entertainment

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.650
in the form of jewelry.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.590
Maybe does provide
some utility.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.010
It can be used as fillings
or in some industrial or

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.680
electronic applications,
but primarily

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.010
it's a unit of exchange.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.420
And as a unit of exchange, it
helps just facilitate the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.270
transactions amongst wealth and
helps the economy allocate

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.780
resources efficiently.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.470
Now, paper money is
not scarce, right?

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.720
It's controllable.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.590
And so you could take a negative
or positive spin on

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.320
that, right?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.730
You could say it's flexible.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.300
That would be the positive
spin on it.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.420
Or you could say it could
be manipulated.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.540
And there are times in history
where many governments, just

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.580
kind of push for populist
agendas or to somehow try to

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.870
defer problems maybe until the
next guy shows up, they did

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.660
manipulate currencies.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.910
And that did lead to
hyperinflation and eventually

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.190
the paper money becomes
worthless, but then there's

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.040
other examples where the paper
money, for the most part,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.650
really does retain its value.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.450
So that's another thing
to think about.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.200
And so just going back to the
question of whether gold will

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.070
or will not lose its value,
that's just really-- I mean,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.340
what is it going to lose its
value relative to and what

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.510
would be the catalyst for it?

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.520
So a lot of people right now,
they'll say, the dollar--

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.170
there's going to be
hyperinflation because the Fed

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.440
is being so proactive, so
I'm going to buy gold.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.610
And they might be right.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.440
I'm not sure about that.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.730
If I knew about that
I would go and

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.110
speculate on gold myself.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:05.170
But the main thing in any type
of investment is to realize

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.120
that you're making a bet on
what human beings will do,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.530
what the Federal government
will do.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.640
And just as an example, in real
terms, if you adjust it

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:23.130
for today's dollars, gold
in 1980 was-- this is in

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.650
inflation adjusted dollars-- I
think it was on the order of

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.450
$2,400, right?

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.520
So even today, even with all
of this talk-- I guess it's

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.210
2009 now-- even with all this
talk about hyperinflation, the

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.620
Fed being overly aggressive and
us pumping up the money

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.750
supply and the Fed's balance
sheet expanding-- even today,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.690
gold-- in today's terms-- this
is $2,400 in today's terms. I

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.440
think it's at $840
or something.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.280
And back in 1980, a very
reasonable person could have

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.530
said, my God, we have
hyperinflation, we just got

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.330
through these oil shocks,
inflation is going through the

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.980
roof-- inflation was already
much more rampant than it has

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.320
been in recent memory-- and
you're like, boy, the dollar's

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.370
going to be worthless
before we know it.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.070
I'm just going to buy gold,
although-- what

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.980
should gold be worth?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.860
Should it be worth $24,000?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.130
Should it be worth $2 million?

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.290
Who knows?

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.850
Does gold just go to infinity
in terms of dollars or does

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.370
the dollar just go to zero?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.790
So someone could've made a very
reasonable argument back

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.910
then that they should get out
of their bank accounts and

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.240
convert it all to gold and they
wouldn't have been able

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.110
to predict that Paul Volcker
would show up in the early

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.510
'80s and increase interest
rates despite all of the

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.380
political pressure to maybe
do the opposite and he got

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.410
inflation under control.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.870
And then by-- what was it?

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.190
By the late '90s, in today's
terms, gold was-- I think in

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.420
the $200 range or it might've
been even lower.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.280
We'll say approximately $200.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.850
And even if that person said,
even in the late '90s, I'm

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.480
going to hold to my bet and keep
holding gold, it would've

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.270
taken-- if they'd had it all the
way to today, they still

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.110
would have been better off in
1980 keeping their money in a

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.350
bank account that gets more
interest than inflation.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.530
So if you just got 3% or 4% on
your bank account starting in

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.250
1980, you still would have been
better off than holding

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.420
gold-- even though there was a
very credible argument for

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.270
inflation at that time.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.360
So it's just a very, very
hard thing to predict.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.470
And with any of these things
where you're really just

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.460
betting on the medium of
exchange, it's very

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.200
hard to price it.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.650
It's very hard to say
what that unit of

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.580
exchange really is.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.920
So now gold has ran up from
the late '90s to $840.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.420
It's based on a lot of people
thinking that the dollar's

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.110
going to lose its value,
et cetera.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.260
It's completely possible.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.000
We might have an irresponsible
government.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.920
Inflation looks like it's under
control right now, but

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.670
who knows what happens
in a year or two?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.670
Maybe all this liquidity starts
to get a multiplier

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.460
effect and the dollar
gets debased and

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.850
gold jumps up to $8,000.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.140
Then those people just have made
a great bet, but maybe

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.170
inflation isn't the problem.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.210
Maybe it's deflation and
maybe people don't lose

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.030
faith in the currency.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.250
Maybe a Paul Volcker-like
character shows up and tackles

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.610
inflation and then gold
goes back to $200.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.340
But the bottom line here is
that it's really hard to

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.080
predict because it's actually
not generating utility itself,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.730
it's a measure of utility.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.430
But anyway, I don't want to
fixate on that too much, but

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.370
it's an interesting
discussion.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.080
But anyway, just going back to
the original thing, there's

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.980
other ways that we could have
gone down the evolutionary

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.080
path of banking systems. I just
wanted to go over the

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.550
path that we've gone.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.170
Instead of a fractional reserve,
you could have a full

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.420
reserve system.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.230
That's-- instead of me taking a
deposit and saying that you

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.840
can demand the deposit at any
given point, but still lending

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.170
90% of it out-- that's what I do
in the fractional reserve--

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.600
I would tell you, 90%
of your money, you

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.620
can't take it out tomorrow.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.770
It's going to be locked
in for six months.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.610
It'd be like a CD and the money
that you want to have

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.100
tomorrow, I'm just going to put
it aside, you're not going

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.040
to get any interest on it, and
you might have to even pay me

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.660
a little bit of money to keep
it safe and to be able to

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.780
access it from an ATM.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.600
That's completely fine.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.870
Someone could argue that
this is less flexible.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.720
That would be the negative
spin on it.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.580
But then the positive spin on it
is maybe it's less subject

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.830
to manipulation.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.910
Or maybe there will be a few
less booms and busts, right?

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.020
Maybe these bubbles
won't form.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.210
I'm not so sure about that,
but I think it's

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.190
a reasonable argument.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.230
And then even within full
reserve, we could have gone

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.890
gold or not gold.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.520
And once again, that would
have just been a question

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.320
about how much flexibility you
have. The most restrictive

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.310
system would be a full reserve
system based on some type of

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.170
hard currency that can't be
printed or can't be controlled

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.860
by humans to some degree.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.940
Or you could have something that
is printed and then to

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.510
some degree this could be
manipulated a little bit.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.240
And just like on the fractional
reserve--

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.520
fractional reserve backed by
gold-- little less flexible,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.270
but maybe that's good.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.240
Little less game-able as well.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.160
Anyway, I just wanted to give
you this kind of overview of

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.560
everything.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.700
Because I think I maybe struck
some nerves in the last time.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.030
I didn't want to in any way
insult gold and I don't think

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.830
that tomorrow gold will
be worthless.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.190
I just wanted to make it
very clear that from a

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.840
philosophical point of view,
there's a difference between

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.000
gold and the things that it can
be exchanged for, just as

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.240
there is a difference between
money or-- any kind of money--

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.680
paper money and the things that
it can be exchanged for.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.410
And in general, I think gold
does have a special place

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.160
relative to any other
hard currencies.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.400
Relative to diamonds, or
nanotubes, or anything else--

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.340
and that's just because it
has a history, right?

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.020
From the beginning of recorded
history, people used gold as a

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.040
medium of exchange, so it's
almost ingrained in our

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.690
cultural DNA and that's what
gives it its robustness as a

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.490
unit of exchange, but other
than that, it's really no

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.110
different than diamonds,
or carbon

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.170
nanotubes, or moon rocks.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.480
Anyway, I've used
up all my time.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.520
I'll see you in the
next video.
