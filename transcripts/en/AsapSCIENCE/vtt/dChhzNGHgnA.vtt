00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.290
We all have a fascination with muscles and
strength - whether we want to be stronger,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.930
feel better, or look like superman; and there
are many proposed strategies and exercise

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.630
regimens to get this done. But what if I told
you that it was out of your control, and that

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.220
your genetics may be entirely holding you
back? Conversely, what if there was a secret

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.039
out there that could lead you to super human
strength?

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.239
The truth is: your muscle size has a limit.
Sure, it may seem obvious when you hear it,

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.769
but your muscles are under the strict control
of a protein called Myostatin, which determines

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.320
exactly how large a muscle can become. And
this limit is different for everyone depending

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.510
on their myostatin levels. As a muscle reaches
this limit, myostatin prevents any further

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.950
growth. But if the myostatin itself is limited
or absent, this muscle limit suddenly goes

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.700
away.
This phenomenon was first noticed in Belgian

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.620
Blue Cattle. These cows developed 2-3 times
more muscle mass than a normal cow, and it

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.780
was later discovered that they had a deletion
of the gene GDF-8, which just so happens to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.720
create myostatin. As a result, without any
exercise or special diet, these cows have

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.220
incredible muscle mass. Similar cases have
been documented in dogs, mice, and even a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.360
few cases of human babies lacking the GDF-8
gene.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.380
These findings have helped scientists understand
why some people bulk up easily, while others

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.810
struggle to. Lower levels of myostatin = more
muscle mass. In fact, some studies have even

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.070
shown that many champion body builders have
naturally lower levels, or even entire deletions

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.781
of the myostatin gene. If you look at somebody
like Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a teen, he

00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:38.060
just looks naturally muscular. As such, perhaps
many champion bodybuilders owe their success

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.240
more to genetics than their training or drug
use.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.479
Eventually, it may be possible to develop
drugs which deplete or block myostatin. Of

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
course, it's a double edged sword; On the
one hand, patients with muscular dystrophy,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.230
or muscle loss from aging could regrow and
restore muscle. On the other hand, the potential

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.120
for abuse as performance enhancers seems...inevitable.
But, the prospect of seeing a real-life human

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.410
Hulk...seems kind of cool. Besides, should
those who already have low levels of myostatin

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.750
be considered to have an unfair advantage?
It's hard to say. Regardless, be weary of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.540
anybody selling or promoting this unproven
and unregulated treatment.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.560
At the end of the day, whether you have naturally
low or high myostatin levels, remember - this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.959
is the level that is optimal for your mechanical
and metabolic efficiency. With proper exercise

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.840
and general health, you'll reach your own
unique physiological peak. And while you may

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.690
not be destined to pack a punch like Superman,
you can push your own limits through training

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.630
and hard work.
But, what if you could punch as hard as Superman?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.989
Our friend Jake over at Vsauce3 has the answer
to this smashing superhero question, which

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.580
you definitely need to check out.
And if you want to know how much myostatin

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
you have...there's only one real way to find
out. Get working.
