00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.370
More than 20 million children worldwide are
suffering from severe malnutrition.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.160
And just giving them food is not going to
help.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.529
Hey Everybody, I'm Carin for DNews with some
stunning new information on the long-term

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.980
effects of malnourishment.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650
In the Western world we are not accustomed
to dealing with severe cases of starvation;

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.579
however, in South Central Asia and many other
first world countries it is a problem of epic

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.579
proportions.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.350
In Bangladesh, more than 40% of children under
the age of 5 are affected by either severe

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.600
or moderate malnutrition.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.290
It's well known that undernourished children
suffer its ill effects into later life and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.890
even adulthood.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.610
Long term symptoms include stunted growth,
cognitive problems and weakened immune systems.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.640
Scientists have recently discovered that these
health issues are rooted in lingering, underdeveloped

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.500
collections of gut microbes.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.699
We have a lot of of 'friendly' microbes in
our digestive systems, tens of trillions of

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.699
them!

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:09.659
These microbes help us to efficiently harvest
energy and calories from food.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.780
They also help to regulate our metabolism,
synthesize vitamins and shape our immune systems.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.979
It's almost like a massive digestive machine
located within our guts, and the components

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.700
of this machine are established during early
childhood.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.380
Malnourishment in small children means that
the machine doesn't form correctly, and it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.439
can't simply be synthesized later in life
by supplying a diet of nutrient-rich food.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.509
A recent study looked at the gut microbes
from fecal samples from children in under

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.020
the age of 5, both well nourished and malnourished.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.499
From this data, researchers were able to identify
groups of bacteria that assemble in the gut

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.159
within the first two years of life.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.399
Further, study subjects were then given therapeutic
foods that are generally used for treatment

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.459
of starvation, and fecal samples were continuously
monitored.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.679
Once the children had gained sufficient weight,
they were removed from food supplements but

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.429
fecal samples were monitored for a further
four months.

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.950
Researchers found that once the therapeutic
foods were removed from the diet, gut bacteria

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.960
regressed back to a more immature community.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.120
So, critical next steps will include the development
of therapies to replace a mature gut bacterial

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.340
community on a long-term or permanent basis.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.239
What do you think about the fact that 20 million
children around the world are malnourished?

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.790
How can we do more to help?
