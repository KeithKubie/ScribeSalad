00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:03.191
 Here we have two hypothetical amino acids. 

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:05.987
 We recognize the hallmarks of amino acids. 

00:00:05.987 --> 00:00:08.727
 We have an amino group at this end, 

00:00:08.727 --> 00:00:10.980
 which gives us the "amino" part of the amino acid. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.393
 We have a carboxyl group at the other end. 

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:15.831
 This is the acidic part of the amino acid. 

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:17.527
 Among them we have a carbon atom, 

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.084
 which is called alpha carbon. 

00:00:21.084 --> 00:00:22.983
 This alpha carbon is connected 

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:26.444
 with a hydrogen atom and some kind of side chain. 

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:28.882
 We will call this side chain R1, 

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.342
 and this side chain R2. 

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:33.177
 We will look into this video 

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:36.172
 how two amino acids 

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.286
 form a peptide bond to each other. 

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.157
 I remind you that the peptide is simple 

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.150
 chain of amino acids. 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.786
 How from these two amino acids 

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:01.992
 we can form a dipeptide. 

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:03.920
 The dipeptide contains two amino acids. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.963
 This is the smallest possible peptide, 

00:01:05.963 --> 00:01:07.797
 but we can continue to add amino acids to it 

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:09.631
 and get a polypeptide. 

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.761
 In short, 

00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.181
 this nitrogen atom uses its free electron pair, 

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:20.012
 to form a bond with the carbon atom of the carbonyl group here. 

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:24.143
 This free electron pair and the carbon atom of the carbonyl group 

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:27.278
 form a bond and then this hydrogen atom, 

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:31.432
 this hydrogen atom and this oxygen atom can together 

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:33.738
 to form a water molecule. 

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:39.235
 The molecule of water is separated from these two amino acids. 

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:41.161
 We get this reaction 

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.319
 bond between nitrogen and carbon atom 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.732
 and releasing a water molecule. 

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.356
 Since we have a molecule of water, 

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:52.818
 this type of reaction, as we have seen before 

00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:55.698
 with other types of molecules, 

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.995
 is called condensation 

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:00.178
 or dehydration. 

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:03.314
 Condensation, 

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.764
 condensation reaction 

00:02:07.264 --> 00:02:10.134
 or dehydration. 

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:12.820
 We saw this type of reaction, 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.681
 when we linked glucose molecules to each other, 

00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.351
 when we got carbohydrates. 

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:21.484
 Dehydration. 

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:23.133
 Whenever you see a reaction like this, 

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.874
 it is very satisfying to be able to 

00:02:24.874 --> 00:02:27.057
 to calculate and say, "So, this will be related to this," 

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.170
 "we see the connection here" 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.305
 "I will get rid of an oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms," 

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.950
 "which collectively equals H2O, the molecule of water." 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.854
 How can we imagine the mechanism of the reaction? 

00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:39.178
 Can we displace electrons? 

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:42.306
 Can we explain a little organic chemistry, 

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.309
 to understand how the reaction actually takes place? 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.374
 I will do this now. 

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.560
 I will not go into much detail about the mechanism of the reaction, 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.928
 but I'll just explain what's going on. 

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:51.994
 As we have said, the nitrogen atom has one free electron pair, 

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.433
 it is electronegative. 

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.663
 And this carbon atom here is connected 

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.450
 with two oxygen atoms, they are more electronegative. 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.049
 Oxygen atoms can attract electrons. 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.210
 And this nitrogen atom may want to do 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.950
 something known in organic chemistry as a nucleophilic reaction, 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.294
 with this carbon atom here. 

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:09.849
 When this happens, 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.102
 if we explain the mechanism more carefully, 

00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:13.657
 we can say, "Hey, maybe one 

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:16.978
 "of these double bonds is dropped," 

00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:19.346
 "her electrons return to oxygen" 

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:23.177
 "and then the oxygen gets a negative charge." 

00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:24.316
 But this free electronic pair 

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.484
 may form the double bond again. 

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:30.505
 When this happened, 

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:35.415
 this oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group accepts 

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.087
 these two electrons. 

00:03:37.087 --> 00:03:40.940
 He accepts the two electrons 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.088
 and now has an additional free e-pair. 

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.884
 Let me delete this link 

00:03:47.884 --> 00:03:50.972
 and give the oxygen another free electron pair. 

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:54.344
 There are already two free couples, 

00:03:54.344 --> 00:03:55.430
 and when he accepts the electrons from this connection, 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.467
 there will be a third free e-pair. 

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:01.234
 And there will be a negative charge. 

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:02.489
 Now you can guess, 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.554
 that he will snatch a hydrogen proton from somewhere. 

00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:06.274
 It can accept any hydrogen proton, 

00:04:06.274 --> 00:04:09.082
 but perhaps the most comfortable one would be here, 

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.472
 because if the nitrogen atom uses its free electron pair, 

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:14.006
 to form a bond with the carbon atom, 

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.303
 he will have a positive charge 

00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:18.951
 and can accept these electrons. 

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.041
 You can imagine that when one 

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.966
 of these free pairs is used to bind to this hydrogen proton, 

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:27.796
 the nitrogen atom can accept these electrons, 

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:29.576
 to take these electrons back. 

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:31.652
 I hope this was not too confused, 

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:32.581
 but I always love to ask, 

00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:33.881
 what can actually happen here? 

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.038
 And as you can see, the free electron pair 

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:39.849
 of the nitrogen atom forms this orange bond with the carbon atom. 

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:44.421
 Let me paint it in orange, 

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:46.140
 if I call it an orange connection. 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.950
 This orange connection is formed. 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.409
 This orange tie 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.821
 is called a peptide bond, peptide binding. 

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:59.418
 Peptide bond 

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:01.228
 or 

00:05:03.508 --> 00:05:05.378
 peptide coupling. 

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:10.238
 Then we have a molecule of water. 

00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:12.676
 This oxygen atom is one, 

00:05:12.676 --> 00:05:16.089
 you can assume that this hydrogen atom is one, 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:19.897
 and this hydrogen atom is here, 

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:21.802
 generally equate to a water molecule. 

00:05:21.802 --> 00:05:23.380
 When I first saw this reaction, 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.447
 you are polysmith, "Yes, it seems logical." 

00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:28.906
 But under physiological conditions, 

00:05:28.906 --> 00:05:32.203
 amino acids are not in this form. 

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:35.792
 Physiological pH is more likely 

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.635
 to discover this form of amino acids, 

00:05:38.635 --> 00:05:42.489
 to discover them as bulls. 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:44.557
 Zwitterions. Let me write it. 

00:05:44.557 --> 00:05:45.829
 A fun word for pronouncement. 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.828
 One word is, but I will write both of her parts 

00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:50.616
 in different colors to see them. 

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.404
 Zweeterion. 

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:53.425
 What does this mean? 

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:55.702
 Zwitter in German means hybrid. 

00:05:55.702 --> 00:05:56.769
 The hybrid ion 

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.647
 is an ion which has a charge in its distal ends, 

00:06:00.647 --> 00:06:03.781
 parts of the molecule have a charge, 

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:06.776
 but when you collect them, it becomes neutral. 

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.446
 The parts are loaded, but the whole is neutral. 

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:14.974
 At a physiological pH, the amino portion, 

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.481
 the portion of the amino acid containing nitrogen 

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.940
 grabs an additional proton and gets a positive charge, 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.306
 and the carboxyl group yields one proton 

00:06:25.306 --> 00:06:27.048
 and becomes negatively charged. 

00:06:27.048 --> 00:06:29.462
 This will be consistent with 

00:06:29.462 --> 00:06:31.343
 the forms we saw at the beginning, 

00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:33.781
 but at physiological pH, amino acids are more common 

00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:37.240
 such as zwitterions. 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.006
 How do we get a peptide bond 

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:42.094
 of this form of amino acids? 

00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:46.342
 You can imagine that this atom here, 

00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:49.407
 after giving his hydrogen proton, has an additional electronic pair. 

00:06:49.407 --> 00:06:53.888
 There are one, two free electronic pairs, 

00:06:53.888 --> 00:06:57.962
 will color the additional electronic pair 

00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:00.152
 in purple. 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.000
 There is an additional free e-pair. 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.540
 Can use the extra electronic pair, 

00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:08.123
 to grab a proton from the solution 

00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:10.793
 or to be more comfortable, we can say, 

00:07:10.793 --> 00:07:12.140
 "Maybe he meets the right proton," 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.807
 "this one, and cheers on the nitrogen atom" 

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:21.612
 "to accept these electrons." 

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:25.305
 If this happens, 

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:27.604
 when we look at this carboxyl group 

00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:29.391
 and this amino group, 

00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.319
 we come to the form we saw at the beginning. 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.526
 If this atom gets hydrogen, 

00:07:32.526 --> 00:07:34.313
 we will get a hydroxyl group, 

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:37.588
 if this nitrogen atom receives two electrons, 

00:07:37.588 --> 00:07:39.980
 from this bond, NH2 will be obtained. 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.625
 So at least that part of the molecules 

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.737
 it will be just like the ones we started with. 

00:07:45.737 --> 00:07:47.921
 Now you can imagine how we get there 

00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:51.756
 to peptide coupling, 

00:07:51.756 --> 00:07:53.966
 what we have here. 

00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:55.421
 This is the peptide bond. 

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:59.460
 Then the only difference between the resulting peptide 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.759
 in this reaction, 

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.246
 and the previous one is, 

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:05.195
 that this is a zwolle. 

00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:09.212
 The form of zwitterion in which the carboxyl group 

00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:12.579
 has given a proton in the solution, 

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.575
 and here the nitrogen 

00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:17.850
 has taken a proton from the solution, 

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.383
 so the total charge is neutral, 

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:22.029
 although the two ends of the molecule are loaded. 

00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:24.282
 I hope you were fun.
