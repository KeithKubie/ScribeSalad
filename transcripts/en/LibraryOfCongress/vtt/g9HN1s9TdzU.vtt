00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.110
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.410
I'm John Cole.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.480 position:56%
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.260
which is the Library's reading
and literacy promotion arm.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.010
And I'm happy to welcome you
to one of our noontime talks

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.640
about new books that
have special relevance

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.160
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.420
And this is how we kind
of define the books

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820
and beyond noontime series.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.310
The Center for the book itself
promotes books and reading,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.760
not only here in these talks,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.990
but also through the
National Book Festival.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.850
How many people here were at last
weekend's, was it two weekends ago?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.850
The national was two weekends
ago, National Book Festival,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.590 position:56%
which this year moved to the
convention center for the first time

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.700
with pretty good results, and
so we are evaluating that,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.680
and the Book Festival itself
is certainly a going concern.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.400
And I'm hoping that we can remain

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.120
in the convention centers,
as a matter-of-fact.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.280
We also have state centers
for the books in all states,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270
which are hosted by different
kinds of institutions.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.940
But wherever they are, and
however they're hosted their job is

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.110
to stimulate public interest in
books and reading and literacy

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.970
in libraries in their states.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.280
All of our Books and Beyond
talks here at the Library

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.240
of Congress are filmed
for the Library's website

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.720
and so I'm asking you to please
turn off all things electronic,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.750
and we will have a format that
includes a chance for questions

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.130
and answers and some
discussion with our author.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.210 position:56%
And so please be aware of that, that
if you involve yourself in that,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.620
you have a chance of also being
part of our website broadcast.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.590
We will also have a book signing.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.530
I'm delighted that this beautiful
book has arrived just in time.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.890
Our speaker last night
was at Politics and Prose,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.810 position:56%
as some of you know, and he tells me
the books had just arrived the day

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.140
before Politics and Prose.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.270
So we are in luck, and
the book will be --

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.010
it has a price of $35 and
we're selling it at the Library

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.170
of Congress price today of $30.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.210
So I hope you take advantage
of that, and the timing is

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.090
such that we will need to move
to the book signing no later

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.490
than 1:00 :00 depending on how
the questions and answers go.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.010
I am very pleased to be able

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.350
to introduce an old
friend, Ezra Greenspan.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.410
Ezra is, and I'm going
to read this out.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.420
Now the Edmund J. And Louise
W. Con Professor of English

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.580
at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.030
He holds a PhD from Brown
University, and when we first met,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.430
Ezra was teaching at the
University of South Carolina.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.120 position:56%
And the vehicle through which we've
known each other is the organization

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.390
called SHARP, that many of you hope
know about or hope you are members.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.170
SHARP stands for the
Society for the History

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.790
of Authorship, Reading
and Publishing.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.070
And Ezra came to the two
SHARP meetings that the Center

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.990
for the Book has hosted at
the Library of Congress.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.940
The first one was the second
year of SHARP, and I can't come

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.290
up with the date for certain,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.580
but I know the last one was three
years ago, and here in Washington

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.620
when we collaborated with a
number of other organizations,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.040
and had more than 250 scholars
who are interested in the history

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.560
of books, libraries, and
the history of reading.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.680
Ezra has been the editor
of book history,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.530
which I meant to bring an example
of it, which he has co-edited

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.790
for many years with Jonathan Rose,
who is another scholar who was

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.230 position:56%
in on the -- well actually,
Jonathan I think we call the founder

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.600
of SHARP.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.450
And it's a remarkable
international organization

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.330
that really has come a long ways
in promoting the history of books

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.430
and the history of print culture.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.110
And Ezra will be giving
another talk this afternoon

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.510
to our Mid Atlantic group that
is in charge of the culture,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.660
or not in charge of, but
studies book culture.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.350
And that talk will a little
bit more on the archival side

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.750
of things will be at 4:00
o'clock held in the Clugey Center.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.930
Ezra is among other
things, a Whitman scholar,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.920
who in 1990 published Walt
Whitman and the American Reader.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.430
And in the year 2000,
he published a biography

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.210 position:56%
of the publisher George Palmer
Putnam, which was always of interest

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.830
to me, because Herbert Putnam,
who was the Library of Congress

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.970
from 1899 until 1939 was
George Palmer Putnam's sons.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.930
One of his sons, right, Ezra?

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.440
But Ezra is onto a
very exciting topic

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.070
that he's going to
share with us today.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.510
He's done some pioneering
research on the important

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:00.470
and versatile 19th century author,
writer, William Wells Brown,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.370
and it's my pleasure now to
present to you Ezra Greenspan.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.510
Ezra. [inaudible]

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:15.480
[ Applause ]

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.170
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Thank you, John.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.540
It's a delight to be back
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.830
Those two books that John
mentioned, the books on Whitman

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.230
and GP Putnam were
Library of Congress books.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.650
They could not of been done had
this spectacular collections

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.750
of this library not been available.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.540
I'm not going to say
this in a sour way.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.460
Don't misunderstand me, but one
can't write a biography by contrast

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.310
of William Wells Brown by relying
on the Library of Congress.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.380
We have a number of his
books here, but Brown,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.360
like most African-American figures,
pre-20th century is elusive,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.370
hard-to-find, difficult to
track down, and in part the lack

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.710
of a central archive was
really the central problem.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.960
There are other problems as
well, but that was a crucial one.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.500
And that's just by way of preface.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.990
If I have time I'm going to
circle back to Washington,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.830
and give you William Wells
Brown's view of Washington

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.210 position:56%
from the 1850s before the Civil War.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.870
But I'm very happy to be here.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.780
The center of the book is
a wonderful institution.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.290
I really feel at home
coming back here.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.480
I'm going to read a fairly formally
for I think about 10 minutes

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.460
and then more loosely get
to a slide presentation,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.350
which I think is the
more interesting part.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.080
But there is a little bit of
work that needs to be done,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.860
and I can do it more
effectively if I read from script.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.280
When we talk about the lives of
great American writers, Franklin,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.320
master of the press, offspring of
the platonic conception of himself,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.270
father of the city that he
adopted before it adopted him,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.950
his patron saint.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.770
Whitman, son of a broken
family, six grade education.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.650
Master of self-promotion,
incarnation of the body electric.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:28.630 position:56%
Melville another six grade dropout,
wandering sailor, no-show at Harvard

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.780
or Yale College, but graduate
of the school of Wales.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.920
Dickinson, daughter of difference
who rose to no man's requirements,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.780
mistress of self-reliance.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.840
The only kangaroo among the beauty.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.440
Fluoro bachelor of nature, enemy
of conformity, lover of himself.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:56.310
Twain riverboat pilot, Confederate
Yankee, self educated with a major

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.200
in humor, and a minor
in contrariness.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.160
We think of lives that were
unprecedented, unpredictable,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:12.220
unscripted, yet outlandish as these
lives are, none can quite compare

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:18.290
with the life of William Wells
Brown for sheer implausibility.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.940
Brown was the master
of the implausible.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:30.500
For the full account I invite you
to read the 600 page biography,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.810
but for today's purpose you need
only an introductory sketch.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.770
William as he was known
in his earliest years.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.290
We don't even know his familiar
name, Bill, Billy, Will, Willie,

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.910
we don't know was born in 1814.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.620 position:56%
This is his Bicentennial, but raised
on the Missouri frontier on a farm

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.430
in an area associated
with Daniel Boone.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.380
He was really raised
in Boone country.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.840
He spent his teens rented out as
a contract laborer in St. Louis,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.320
working chiefly, and most
memorably on the first generation

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.480
of Mississippi and Missouri River
steamboats, miserably unhappy,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.380
especially as his family
members were sold off one by one.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:26.250
Brown staged three escapes from his
masters during his St. Louis years.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.180
On the third attempt initiated as
he disembarked his master steamboat

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.650
at the public landing in
Cincinnati on New Year's Day 1834,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.550
he finally gained his
freedom and ran northeastward

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.190
across Ohio towards Lake Erie.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.970
Illiterate, in all likelihood,
certainly functionally illiterate

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.560
and innumerate at the time of his
escape, he quickly made himself

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.830
over into a new man after settling
in Cleveland and later Buffalo

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.970 position:56%
where he used his unschooled
hard-earned literacy to make himself

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.280
over the next five decades,
the most prolific, pioneering

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.910
and accomplished African-American
writer

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.400
and multimedia figure
of the 19th century.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.030
His many books include the first
known African-American novel,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.120
published play, European
travel book,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.380
history of black military
service in the Civil War,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.160
and antislavery songbook.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.470
His futurative slave
narrative is one

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.010
of the seminal works in the genre.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.750
The antislavery moving
panorama he took on tour

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.760
across the British Isles
in the early 1850's,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.110
was a major achievement
in the history

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.760
of African-American visual arts.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.270
And is three histories

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.970
of the African-American
experience earn him the position

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.870
of the leading historian in
the field during his lifetime.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.470
Although, we may today see him

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.160
as the first African-American
literary professional,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:07.000
he actually led a high profile
multidimensional professional life

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.710
as a public speaker, antislavery
and civil rights activist,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.990
temperance reformer,
and medical doctor.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.560
That's a bare-bones
sketch of Brown's life.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.600
The plan of this talk, however,
is to focus not on the life,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.010
but on the reconstruction of the
life as a biographical project.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.440
To do that I want to take
you behind the scenes

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.310
on a biographical journey.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.350
Writing biographies
is always a journey.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.940
Sometimes it's a multiple stage
journey, and this one occurred

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.970
through selected archives.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.980
For my purposes in search of the
major writer and social activist

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.240
who disappeared largely
from public view

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.090
for a century after
his death in 1884.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.770
So this project was, at least
in part, a project of recovery,

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.210
specifically about Brown it his
larger dimensions, because I tried

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.310
to write Brown into the
larger American context.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.260
His life demands that.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.050
It's too big and to [inaudible]

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.840
and important not to
be treated that way.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:24.330
And so it was a recovery
project on a fairly large scale,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:30.110 position:56%
on not to say that there hasn't been
a great deal of work done on many

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.760
of the topics that I work on,
but to bring Brown to the center

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.200
to my mind was an absolutely
crucial part of the project.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.850
The fundamental research question
concerning William Wells Brown is

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.170
how does one access his life?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.090
How do you get at him?

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.510 position:56%
Even to recent literary and cultural
historians, Brown is proven one

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.110 position:56%
of the most elusive figures in the
entire field of American literature.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.330
As two of the leading
21st-century scholars

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.070
of African-American
literature, and the [inaudible]

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.120
and John Ernest have
posed the question,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.820
where in the world is
William Wells Brown?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.800
There's no easy answer,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.590
because there's no central
archive there's virtually never is

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.070
for members of any pre-20th
century minority groups.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:28.830
The standard sources biographers
work with, personal libraries,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.600
manuscripts, letters,
albums, scrapbooks,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.600
memorabilia almost never exist.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.040
Not even for Brown,
author of numerous books

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.790
that were widely reviewed,
frequently reprinted,

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.130
and his name was frequently
in the news.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.450
As a younger man, five years
less senior than I am today,

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.920
I initially had high hopes of
finding ample new documentation.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.050
I was young and naïve.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.980
After five years of diligent work
I've not found a single family

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.020
letter written to or by Brown
or with one exception to

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.110
or by any other member
of his family.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.180
And actually they're three
different families that Brown had

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.630
over the course of his lifetime.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.190
That's part of the personal
story, which I'm not going

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.190
to be talking about today.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.170
I don't even have a single
specimen of the handwriting

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.710
of his second wife, and I
seen only one useful specimen

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:39.240 position:56%
of his literary manuscript, and that
a couple of cheap sheets of paper

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.530
that came to light two
years ago by serendipity.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.340
But for all the difficulties,
there was a way

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.770
to locate William Wells Brown and
his world, or way that I thought

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.990
of it, William Wells
Brown in his world.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.790
I thought it has to come together.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:01.570
And I want to retrace with you
some of the steps my wife, Ricky,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.370
who was a central part
of this entire project,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.980
and I made in pursuing his legacy
over the course of five years

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.500
and trips covering thousands
of miles across the US, Canada,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.030
the British Isles, and Ireland.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:24.610
Our journey began in June 2009 when
we packed up our home in Dallas,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.410
loaded up our car, and set out
on a 14 month research trip

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.290
with home base located at the
American Antiquarian Society

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.800
in Wooster, Massachusetts.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.550
We took the long route
getting there.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:41.660
Following the trail that
tracked along the northern arc

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:46.650
of Brown's life, which for us
included visits to archives

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.170
in Missouri, Michigan, Ontario,
all across New York State,

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.660
and a long trek across
England before we settled

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.180 position:56%
into our sabbatical home in Wooster.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.420
Our first stop was Missouri,
where Brown spent nearly all

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.070
of his boyhood in adolescence.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:10.590 position:56%
What we were looking for, I realized
only later was our trailhead.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.710
The point of entry along the trail
I could not at the time identify.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.100
I couldn't even see my
way, I couldn't find

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.440
that the main trail
through the narrative.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.660
It was something that had to be
discovered as we pushed forward,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.180 position:56%
and this I think is not uncommon
for difficult biographical projects.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.840
Driving from Texas
northeastward and dodging a tornado

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.400
as we entered the show me state.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.630
We made our first stop in
Columbia, the historical Society

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.380
of Missouri, but made
little headway.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.470
That is until I happen
to notice hanging on one

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:52.030 position:56%
of the libraries walls a decades-old
Missouri state highway map.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.030
In examining it closely, I noticed
that the town of Marthasville,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.950
a place that resonated in my memory
was located more or less on the way

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.090
to St. Louis, our main
destination in the state.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.620
So after a couple of relatively
fruitless days of research

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.420
at the Historical Society
heading eastward toward St. Louis,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.850
we cut off the interstate,
drove down a country highway,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:24.230
and wound up at the following spot,
totally unaware that we had arrived

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.660
at the trailhead of this
biographical journey.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.960
Notice the date.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.460
The date is important.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.910
Marthasville 1817.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:42.580
We parked, I think you can actually
see behind the signage there's a

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.070
little parking lot.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.520
And I can't make out
whether that's our car.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.010
It may be.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.970 position:56%
We had no idea where we were, except
that we were on the edge of the town

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.410
of Martinsville, basically
a farming community

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.930
of about a 1,000 people today.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.820
And as we walked from the
car we saw historical signage

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.300
around this municipal
park everywhere.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.090
And that's really the
first part of the story,

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.000 position:56%
and I'll get to it in just a moment.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.070
But let me just mention this is the
Katy Trail, which is part of the --

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.650
for a Dallas site this
should've registered as an omen.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:29.100
The Katy Trail is the old Missouri
Kansas Texas railway right-of-way.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.340
And on the other end it passes

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.570
within about a mile
of my office at SMU.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.790
The railroad doesn't exist anymore.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:43.600
This is now a public
trail, lots of walkers,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.530
runners, bicycle, bicyclists.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.930
And I will say on the near side
toward me about half a mile

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.180
from this spot is the graveyard

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.330
in which Daniel Boone
was originally buried.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.590
He's since been reclaimed,
[inaudible] and reputation

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.900
by the state of Kentucky.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.130
Now, take a look at
some of the signage.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.570
First of all, there's a little
bit of the narrative of this area,

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.650
but I want you to notice is behind
me there is a restored cabin,

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.770
which you're going to see
more closely in a second.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.170
The path is actually a paved road

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:31.280
by it has additional
historical signage.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.440
And that signage, it turned out,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.480
became a crucial part
of the entire biography.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.120
All of this completely by surprise.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.210
That's the restoration,
[inaudible] with the plaque.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:52.870 position:56%
What it makes clear is that this was
a reconstructed cottage dating back

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.670
to 1804.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.990
It was put up by the Lewis and
Clark Bicentennial Committee

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.460
of the local area commemorating
the fact that Lewis and Clark

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.280
on their voyage of
expedition westward,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.020
began in effect their voyage
after leaving St. Louis.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.610
They came to this particular town
before it really it entered its

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.640
American phase.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.090
And here is one of the historical
signs right by the cottage

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.570
and it gives the history

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.320
of this area going back
to the French period.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.180
Remember it enters the US as part

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.060
of the Jefferson's
Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.050
Previous to that, it
was French-speaking.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.770
The name of it was La Charrette.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.110
By the time Lewis and Clark got
there it was Charrette Village,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.280
and the sign gives
the early history.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.490
So light bulb number
one went off in my head.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.620
This is Lewis and Clark territory.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.180
This is a story about
the westward frontier,

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.330
about manifest destiny
in the next generation.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:13.590 position:56%
But another interesting piece on the
signage at the bottom is the fact

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:19.180
that this was also Boone country,
that Rebecca Boone died at the home

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.690
of her daughter, Jemima Calloway.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.550
Jemima Calloway was married to
a man named Flanders Calloway.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.770
That's of minor importance.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:34.370
On the backside of the same sign,
we have the American version.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:39.520
The town now called
Marthasville, and the explanation

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:46.500
that it was settled by a man
by the name of Dr. John Young.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.470
Dr. John Young was
the master and owner

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.860
of the young William Wells Brown.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:23:00.810
So this is not just Lewis and Clark
country, and Daniel Boone country.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.670 position:56%
This is William Wells Brown country.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:09.360
And as you read the history
starting with Young's purchase

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.070
of the land it was
a very big purchase.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:19.860 position:56%
On the death of Daniel Boone at the
home of his brother-in-law, his son,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:27.160
and sister-in-law, Young's
sale of the land in 1826

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.610
on what you'll notice
is absent is any mention

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.880
of the name William Wells Brown.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.370
This was the situation as we
saw it in the summer of 2009.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.540
So three major pieces of
historical information.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.730
Lewis and Clark and the narrative
of American progress, Daniel Boone,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.960
the great figure of
the American frontier.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.530
And it's still to this
day Boone country.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:24:00.130
And third, Dr. Young's presence
and William Wells Brown's absence.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.260
And I realized this has
to be the trailhead,

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.870
and this is a major
part of my story.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.160
It's a biography of a young
African-American who grew

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.370
up on the American frontier,
who would spend his early years

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:20.300
as an adolescent on the first
generation of American steamboats.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.610
This was somebody with really
an extraordinary background.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:30.760
I don't know if you can read
it all the way in the back,

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.980
but here's another really
interesting little piece

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.280
of information.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.740
The red arrow is pointing
to the information.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.350
It says "Charrette
Village adjoining the land

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:46.730
of Flanders Calloway
and James Bryant."

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.360
I think Bryant is a
misprint for Brian

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.360
who was the son-in-law
of Daniel Boone.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:57.180
But more to the point, Flanders
Calloway was Boone's son-in-law,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.810
and if Rebecca Boone died in
the cabin of Flanders Calloway,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.420
and another piece of information
made it clear that Boone lived

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:10.170
for part of his last
six years, 1814 to 1820,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:15.460
in Flanders Calloway's house,
well then William Wells Brown grew

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.130
up next door to Daniel Boone.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:26.570
I looked hard for physical evidence
of what that area looked like.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.960
Of course the most wonderful,

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:35.440
but nonexistent photograph would've
been a likeness of the young cabin,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.710
but this is Flanders
Calloway's homestead.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.930
No date. I don't know
when it was taken.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.100
Looks to me to be 19th century,
but this would be very close.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.470
Young's house would've been
much larger, and much fancier.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:57.290
A year later Ricky and I after
a year or eight or nine months

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.190
in Wooster, on our
drive back to Dallas.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.840
We're now in the summer of 2010,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.620
decided that we would come
back via the southern route.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.010
And that was primarily an
attempt to find both the white

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.890
and the black sides
of Brown's family.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.550
Brown's father was a white
man, and we found his father.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.320
We found out a lot about him.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.210
We found Dr. Young, who was
a first cousin of the father,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:30.460
and we looked very, very hard
for Brown's mother, Elizabeth.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:36.400
And that I have to say was a
labor of ultimate frustration.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.710
We got we thought very
close in Virginia.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.050
We think she was born in
Virginia, but we never found her.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:49.870
In any event, we decided on the
last day of that 13 month trip

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.840
that we would return as
kind of rounding a circle

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.670 position:56%
that we would return to Martinsville

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.940
and by this point how does
one write a book like this.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.840
One relies on a lot of professional
friends, librarians, archivists,

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.500
scholars, and we by appointment
met up with the director

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.500
of the local historical society.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.630
That's Kathy Sharpinwars,
as well as the head

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:19.340
of the Missouri State archives
from St. Louis, Mike Everman,

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.150
and his wife Diane, a
professional archaeologist.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:29.550
And by the time we met up
with them in July of 2010,

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.420
we realized that we were
standing the whole time.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:40.850 position:56%
The moment we got out of her car the
year before, all the land around.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.940
The place of the restoration, the
municipal park, the parking lot,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.700
the cornfields all around, and the
town of Martinsville on the top

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.290
of the hill that all of this was
the original John Young estate.,

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.870
Which is to say, the moment we got
out of our car, we were walking

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:03.350 position:56%
on the same land on which William
Wells Brown had spent his childhood.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.020
So we came back we hoped
to see what we could see

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.230
through the eyes of professionals.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.320
And so, Ricky's taking
the photographs.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.600
Here we are walking the grounds,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.800
and it probably hasn't
changed all that much.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.390
The lower lying land.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:28.550
This is very fertile land is
very close to the Missouri River,

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.230
midsummer, lots of corn growing.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:36.060
So we walked the land
looking for marks

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.500
like survey marks of
the original plot.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:49.670
Here we are further along, and
I'm afraid not much really to see.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.320
A restoration.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.310
This is actually in the
center of Martinsville.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.340
We did find some of
the original spots

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.420
where Young owned property
in Marthasville.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.540
We don't know where
the original house was.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.330
You know, I suppose that somebody
with supersonic technology,

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.290
you know, maybe Henry Louis
Gates could get an aircraft fly

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:18.680 position:56%
over this area, you know, with
sensory devices, and find, you know,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.440
where the bones, you know,
of the historical past were.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.250 position:56%
We did this, you know, the hard way.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:31.060
And just to update the historical
narrative, because we are talking

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.740
about one of the pioneers
of African-American history.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.030
Four years later I think, thanks

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.770
to Kathy Sharpinwars
they've put up a new sign.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.890
This went up in the
last four months.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.750
Sorry, it's not a very
good photograph.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.300
But finally, in the year
of his bicentennial,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.780
William Wells Brown has
entered the official narrative

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.990
of Marthasville and
Missouri history.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.980
I'm going to skip over a segment.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.470
Sorry, we just don't
have enough time.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:15.080
I want to talk a little
bit about archives.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.200
That was our first archive,
in a manner speaking.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.650
The remains of a physical location

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.950
and the narrative that
got attached to it.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:30.320
William Wells Brown spent
five years in England,

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.560
technically is a fugitive
slave from 1849 to 1854.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.730
While in England he brought

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.940
out an Anglo-Irish
edition of his narrative.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.150
He brought out a new
edition of his songbook.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:50.550
He wrote the first African-American
travelogue three years in England.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.570
And he brought out --
he wrote and brought

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.980
out the first African-American
novel.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.610
He was a busy man.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.470
All of that he did on the side.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:02.120
He was the best known
African-American lecturer

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.150
in the British Isles in the 1850's.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.210
He was a phenomenon.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:13.910 position:56%
The reason he went in the beginning,
besides his sheer interest

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:20.040
in spreading his wings, was
that even though a noncitizen,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.190
technically a nonperson
in the United States.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.930
He was an official delegate

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:32.120
to the third international peace
Congress meeting in Paris, France.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:37.910
And while there, he was one of the
most electrifying speakers there.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.370
He made some very important
contacts.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.010
One was with an English
aristocrat by the name of John Lee.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.820 position:56%
The strangest kind of an aristocrat.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.560
An aristocrat who leaned left.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.240
And Lee, who was by way a
cousin of the Lee's of Virginia,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.520 position:56%
including Robert E Lee, took a quick
interest in Brown and invited him

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.740 position:56%
when they got back to England, as
well as some of the other delegates,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:14.980
to come visit at his country estate
about an hour north of London.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:23.640 position:56%
And here you have a measure of a
live person born in the slave shanty

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:29.080
in the bluegrass country of
Kentucky, an honored guest at one

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.510
of the finest mansions
in all of England.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:39.550
This, by the way, was the site
of Louis XVIII court in exile

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.410
in the early 19th century.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.470
It's an absolutely
magnificent house.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.160
The back view.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.210
What makes it most interesting
and really the reason that Ricky

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:57.000
and I went up there was Brown
mentions in his travelogue

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.870
that Lee had his name inscribed on
a brick, and the brick installed --

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:07.930
Lee was one of the leading amateur
astronomers in the British Isles.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:12.030
In the vault of Lees Observatory.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.840
It was the firmament
of great people.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.020
I don't know who the other
folks were, and we were hoping

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.520 position:56%
that we would actually get a chance.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.930
We had to figure out how
to get into this house.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.600
But once we had done that,

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.590
get a chance to see this
remarkable testament

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.000
to the young William Wells Brown.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.370
Well, it turns out, everything we
looked for physically in England,

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.740
from Brown's period, just about
everything, no longer existed.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.940
This great house suffered a
major fire in the early 1960's.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.170
They restored it, but
they had no reason

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.870
to restore the observatory,
so that part was gone.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:57.930
We figured though it would have
been the corner that abut outward

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:02.360
on this side, on the left side.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:10.360
Now, very quickly I want to
circle back to the United States,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.910
and to Brown's view of Washington.

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:20.140
And as I said, it's not
an entirely happy view

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.000
of our nation's capital
in the 1850's.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.330
While in England, Brown
had Washington on his mind.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:43.380
He read the American newspapers.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.420
He knew what was going on
with the Fugitive Slave Bill.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.290
It basically meant he was staying
in England for a good long time.

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.950
He couldn't come back,
too well-known.

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:59.760
And so he dug in and did
quite a lot of writing.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.660
Two particular works by Brown
that relates to the portrayal

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.170
of Washington, and they're both
very interesting and very powerful.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.980
Brown produced the first
African-American panorama

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.270 position:56%
that was shown in the British Isles.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:19.530
The panorama was an enormous
narrative painting done

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:26.210
on heavy canvas, rolled up on
scrolls, and presented in a way

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.860
that might remind one
of moving pictures.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.780
It was a form of visual technology
that basically was the precedent

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:38.070
to the predecessor
to moving pictures.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:43.720
Brown apparently commissioned
250 yards of canvas

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.750
in 24 views, and he would perform.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.820
He would show it at night
in a dimly lit room.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.330
He would often sing.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.980
He was a wonderful singer,
and he would tell the story.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.800
One of the 24 views was
his view of Washington.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:06.070
And basically what Brown was doing
was rewriting American narrative

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.980
history from an African-American
point of view,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:15.230
as well as the visuals that went
with it turning them into a kind

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:20.920
of visual art that was
suitable for the presentation

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.380
of African-Americans and
African-American history.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.820 position:56%
This was enormously ambitious tasks.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.030
Virtually none of the old
panoramas have survived.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.400
But Brown's had a catalog,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.940
so we know from the
catalog what the panorama,

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.960
what the 24 views looked like.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.700
One of them is very reminiscent.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.390
For those of you who have seen 12
Years a Slave, you may remember

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:52.530
that the director made a point
when Northrop is being held

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.740
in a Washington prison of
cutting out and showing the tops

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:04.390
of buildings with the top
of the capital sticking

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:09.080
up to give the viewer a
sense of the proximity,

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.860
in a manner speaking
of slavery and freedom.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:18.750
The problem of American democracy,
and that was one of Brown's scenes.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.880
Brown's is even richer.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.740
Brown's takes place in 1848
when there's a mass celebration

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.550
in Washington of the
revolutions for freedom

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.990
that had broken out across Europe.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.670
And in the backdrop,
are the slave pens.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:40.880
And for Brown this was the correct
way of presenting American history,

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.410 position:56%
and especially our nation's capital.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.400
At that point, Brown had
never been to Washington.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.780
He would come actually
only after the Civil War.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.110
He was a generalization

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:55.780
of the Freedman's Monument
to Abraham Lincoln.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:02.500 position:56%
The other work, visual work that
Brown produced, this may be familiar

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:08.280 position:56%
to least a few of you is the famous
illustration from his novel, Clotel.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:14.070
Clotel, the story, fictitious,
but not entirely an accurate story

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.250
of the slave daughter
of Thomas Jefferson

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.470
and Jefferson's slave girl Sally.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:28.400
At the end of the story Clotel
returns to rescue her daughter held

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.220
in Virginia, is recaptured, sent
off to Washington to be held

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.690
in a slave pen until she
can be transported back

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.120
to her master in Mississippi.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:44.290
Escapes the slave pens, runs
across Washington and is running

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:49.090
across the long bridge from
Washington to Alexandria.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.690
She's cut off on both
ends, and in desperation,

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:58.770
as this illustration
shows jumps to her death.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.680
For William Wells Brown,
historian of America

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.030 position:56%
and the African-American experience,

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:11.090
Washington DC was the
nub of the problem.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.290
And from his perspective.

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.660
Remember, he's still
in London unable

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.030
to get back to the United States.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:23.510
This was the situation in the
United States through the 1850s,

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.810
and perhaps I should close
on a more hopeful note.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:31.900
As I mentioned, after the Civil
War, Brown would come to Washington

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:38.050
for the first time and he was,
I think it was in 1867 he came

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.130
to Washington, Maryland
and Virginia.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.920
He met officials.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.800
He took in the city.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.110
He met the African-American
community,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.040
and he went out into the country to
meet the real people, his people.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.280
The people he'd grown up with,
for the most part in Missouri.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.060
And he came away enormously
optimistic.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:04.000
And as generalizations of
the Freedman's Memorial

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.370
to Lincoln thought this was the
proper way that we can pay respect

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.370
to the great emancipator.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:17.970
That actually was a project that
had a very complicated history,

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:22.010
but Brown eventually came
around to seeing Washington.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.590
You know, as we say today,

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:27.640
is Washington the problem
or the solution?

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.710
William Wells Brown
would say yes, and yes.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.510
Thank you for your attention.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:44.540
[ Applause ]

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:55.140
&gt;&gt; I have a few questions Ezra.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.840
Yes.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:12.010
&gt;&gt; So how did you -- I've never

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:19.760
until today I never heard
of William Wells Brown.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.590 position:56%
So did you discover him and what led
you to, you know, take on this task,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:30.410
you know, uncovering
his life and trying

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:36.950
to put together this little bits
of information of, you know,

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.500
of putting his story together.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.710
Thank you so much for doing so.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.540
&gt;&gt; This is a question
I've been asked many times

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.110
as I was working on the project.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.930
Why write a biography of Brown?

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:57.190
And, you know, I think the way
you're posing the question leads

00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:59.300
to part of the answer.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:07.150
That this was a story, a life
story that needed to be written.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.080 position:56%
This was an absolutely amazing life.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.490 position:56%
You know, in one sense Brown was
the most inventive cultural creative

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.670
figure in the United
States in the 19th century.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.540
And I'm a lover of Whitman.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.840
I put in a lot of time on
Whitman, but Brown did more things

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.980
in more ways, and that's
part of the answer also.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.280
I knew of Brown as
the author of Clotel.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.800
American Lit scholars have known
about Clotel for a long time.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.570
When I read his play, his
historic play, The Escape,

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.470
I was absolutely stunned.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.210
It was to my mind, to
my sense immediately one

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:44.350
of the best American
place of the 19th century.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:47.120
And almost totally unknown,
and almost totally unstaged,

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.750
except when in his own life
Brown took it on the road

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.290
and did one-man recitations
of all the roles.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.750
All the white roles, all the black
roles, so I thought, you know,

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.870
all these works by one
person, a narrative of a life.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.030
One of the most amazing lives of
the 19th century, and, you know,

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.650
you always have to ask yourself
is this something that I can do.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.950
You know, does it fit my skill set?

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.290 position:56%
And then I guess the final
ingredient was his sensibility spoke

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:09.590
to my sensibility.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.890
You know, in a basic
way, I get Brown.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.430
&gt;&gt; Was he self educated?

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.870
&gt;&gt; Right. No formal education.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.030
We think he was functionally
illiterate

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.700
when he escaped at the age of 19.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:34.050
You know, and so by our standards
when our kids are often colleged.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:37.040
Brown could not read or write.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.980
I'm going to be in
Lexington, Kentucky next week.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.890
Lexington believes that
Brown was born there,

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.740
and that's unfortunately
not correct.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:47.840
Close, but not correct.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.720
And I'm going to be speaking
at a number of high schools

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.950 position:56%
and I think one of the things I want
to say to the kids is, you know,

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.270
everybody here reads and writes.

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:04.760
You have prospects, but Brown, by
contrast, like the vast majority

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.370
of American slaves was illiterate,

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:11.420
and in spite of a prodigious
intelligence,

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:17.950
just extraordinary capacities,
he was a victim of slavery.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.460
And in many regards
a typical victim.

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:26.230
And so part of the question
for me as a biographer,

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.550
once he escaped was how
did he educate himself?

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.580
How did he get educated?

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.780
And there's no real evidence.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:40.580
I mean you have to make a lot of
guesses, and the answer that I came

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.270
up with, which I'm pretty happy

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.210
about until the negative
criticism starts coming in.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:50.380
I may have to rethink this, but
I think two things happened.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.730
Part of it was self-education.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.380
And this was a young man just
bursting with creative energies,

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.850
and he wanted to learn, and
he had that inner spirit.

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:06.080
But the other part, which I think
was actually also typical among

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.490
African-Americans freed
or self freed

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:13.740
from slavery was he was
educated by the community.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.200
The people around him, and
there actually is one tiny piece

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.260
of evidence that Brown was
taught in part by his wife.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.400
He married a young woman in
Cleveland within six months

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.100
or eight months of his escape.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:37.910
And I think it was a
communal enterprise,

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:43.330
common that African-Americans
helped one another in many ways,

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.500
but once chief way was
to become educated.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.670
And so I did look for
things like, you know,

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.880
I looked up every African-American
in the city of Cleveland.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:58.580
There were only 50 or 60
when Brown got there in 1834,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.590
and looked for philanthropic
self-help organizations

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:03.890
in Cleveland.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.860
In fact, African-Americans
were trying to start a school,

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.500
so I think the story is
partially one of, you know,

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:18.860
of individual initiative and the
other is communal responsibility.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:27.660
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question for you

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:37.760
about the article sources
that you used.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.600
Were there a lot or what did you
find and where were they located?

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.000
Were they in Kentucky?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.450
Were they in Ohio?

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:54.280
Because it sounds like
there weren't a lot.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.850
There wasn't a lot of
traces left to find.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:01.460
&gt;&gt; They're never enough,
first of all.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.150
That's just the way it is.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.490
About the questions about
the archival sources.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:12.670
How ample they were and
where they were to be found,

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.680
because there were
no central archives,

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.760 position:56%
and because Brown presumably -- this
was an important research question.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.680
What happened to Brown's archives?

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.620
Brown was one of the best
read African-Americans

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.180
in the United States.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.480
He read prodigiously.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.460
He must've had a large
library at home.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:36.540
He was a professional
writer for 40 years.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:40.780
He went from book to
book, and he updated them,

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:49.470
which meant that he was
probably using earlier editions

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:51.390
as manuscript copies.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:56.920
He had a prodigious correspondence.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:03.040
He was well known, lots of
friends, interesting friends.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.280
What happened to it all?

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.120
And the answer is, we don't know.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:13.250
But the necessity therefore
was to go everywhere

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.380
that there were Brown associations.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.520
Also to research his
friends, and colleagues.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.640 position:56%
And I said earlier that I tried to
write Brown into the larger context.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.750
They're powerful reasons for
doing that, and one was that,

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.340
that was Brown's basic premise.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.890
I mentioned Whitman.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:33.550
Whitman thought of himself
as utterly exceptional,

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:38.220
and his exceptionalism
allowed him to turn himself

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:41.390
into a representative figure.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.690
It's a paradox.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.580
Brown never thought of
himself as exceptional.

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.660
He thought of himself
as an African-American,

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:53.780
and so what he wrote, even how
he wrote was part in parcel

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.690
of being one of the people.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:00.920
And therefore a way to get at
Brown was to go through the lives

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.950
and sometimes the archives
of his fellows.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.160
The obvious figure is
Frederick Douglass, and Brown

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.100
and Douglass are look-alikes
in many ways.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.430
You know, they're both
white father, black mother,

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:16.330 position:56%
exceptional prodigious young people.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.010
Authors of two of the great
fugitive slave narratives,

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.750
print-based figures, public
speakers, and, in fact,

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.050
they often worked in concert.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.350
So I would work, if I couldn't go
into Brown through the front door,

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.650
you know, I'd have to
find an alternative way.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.000
And a lot of that meant just going
archives wherever Brown lived.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How about the [inaudible] papers?

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:41.870
I mean did you find much in
the way of correspondence?

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:46.010
&gt;&gt; Well, we are the Library of
Congress, and the great archive

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.050
in the field is the
Frederick Douglass papers.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:55.270
And their relationship, I found
scattered bits and pieces.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.890
It's actually a little
bit disappointing.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.530
There are no personal letters.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.430
And by the way, personal
letter from Brown

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.040
to Douglass would be, how dare you.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.070
It would start with an
antagonistic statement.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:11.330
Douglass and Brown had a
very difficult relationship.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.270
In some ways it shouldn't
be surprising.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:18.170
These are big men, and when
big men or big people get

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:22.030
into a room there's just not
enough oxygen to supply to,

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:27.000
you know two major
breathing apparatuses.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.280
But there were professional
connections.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.150
Brown probably began his European
travelogue as a series of letters

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.990
that were written to
first to the Northstar,

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.660
Frederick Douglass's paper.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.960
And then when that switched

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.480
over to the paper called Frederick
Douglass's Paper they were

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.990
in a professional relationship.

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.660
That was probably the first stage

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.690
and then Brown probably
figured these are really good

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.890
and I can turn it into a book.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.400
And there are documents
relating to that.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.580
And there are a couple
of scattered letters.

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:08.420
One of the coincidences is that
the family that bought the freedom

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.490
of Frederick Douglass,
a family from Newcastle

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:14.600
in England was the same family

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.790
that bought the freedom
of William Wells Brown.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.090
Their name was Richardson.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:23.330
These were remarkably fine people.

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:27.370
Ellen Richardson is really
remarkable human being

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:31.440
and both Douglass and Brown were
very close to Ellen Richardson,

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.820
and Richardson's correspondence
with Douglass is here

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.750
in the Library of Congress.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:44.870 position:56%
And when she wrote Douglass she
often associated Douglass with Brown

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:48.770
and would ask, you know, what's
new with my old friend William

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.040
who hasn't written me
in X number of years.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.870
So, you know, there are some very
small, but very cherished moments.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:06.790
&gt;&gt; We have one more and then
we'll do the book signing.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:11.190
When I saw Ezra earlier today
of course I was thinking

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:13.330
and I'm telling him now
that a number of people

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:18.320
who are here are associated with
the Daniel Murray connection

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.190
with the Library of
Congress, which is the name

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.650
of our staff association.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:26.250
And so I had to ask Ezra
little bit about Daniel Murray,

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:30.780
and the original book I had was
the publishers advance copy.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.380
And I just got it yesterday,
and I hadn't looked --

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.410 position:56%
this had had no index and so I
looked today and there was something

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:39.900
about Daniel Murray in your book.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.690
Do you want to say just a few
words about Murray and, you know,

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.480
his significance, and a
little bit about, I mean,

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.370
do you think he ever
met, have they ever met?

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:56.050
&gt;&gt; I don't think --
Brown died in 1884.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.350
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible]

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.480
&gt;&gt; To early, but, you know, this
really raises the question for me.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:09.480
Murray was a way of finding a
central figure in the history

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.570
of the reputation

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:14.710
of African-American
literature and culture.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:19.800
And of course the date of the Paris
exposition, 1900 was very nice.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:24.670
I said in my introduction that
Brown's reputation faded virtually

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:28.190
into obscurity after
his death in the 1880's,

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:32.080
and the reason was Jim Crow.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.710
That's an overstatement.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:37.300
Brown's reputation remained
alive in the black community,

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:43.130
and Daniel Murray was very much
aware of Brown and Brown's peers.

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:47.940
This was an amazing
generation, Brown, Jacobs,

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.740
Taubman, Garnet, Delaney.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.470
One can go on and on,
and they were all born

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.690
within five years of each other.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:54:01.250
And it's the same generation that
gives us Melville, Hawthorne,

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:05.180
Whitman, and one can go on.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:08.190
We know what happened to the
reputation of white writers,

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.430
that they became canonized.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:14.570
For me, Daniel Murray was
a way of trying to figure

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:19.920
out what official status
did African-Americans have

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.310
as Jim Crow was taking
over the American North

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.300
and the American South.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:30.050
The Library of Congress
was a bit of an asylum,

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:32.820
a haven from much of that.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:38.730
In any event, I wanted to know
what books did Murray take over?

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.010
You know, what African-American
monuments were going to be put

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:46.160
on display, and remember the
idea was to put them on display

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.280
in two national capitals.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.810
In France and then bring them
back to the Library of Congress

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.640
and put them on display
in Washington.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.550
&gt;&gt; For the exhibition of 190 --

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:57.850
&gt;&gt; 1900. The [inaudible]

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:59.150
&gt;&gt; 1900.

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:01.390
&gt;&gt; The great French Exposition,

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:05.610
one of the world's
greatest world's fairs.

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.750
And he took five titles by Brown.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:13.640 position:56%
Brown had written over a dozen
books, and this was interesting too.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.530
What part of the African-American
experience did Murray want

00:55:17.530 --> 00:55:19.450
to present in Paris?

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:25.210
And interestingly, he did not take
many fugitive slave narratives,

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:26.510
for example.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.810
He did -- I don't believe
he took Douglass's.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.110
I'd have to check that.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.960
He certainly didn't take Brown's.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.700
He did take Harriet Jacobs,

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.360
but he didn't know
Harriet Jacobs real name.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:42.590
But that was a moment where
people like Dubois and Callaway

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.890
and Murray thought this
is our opportunity.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.960
And unfortunately it was
a very short-lived moment

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.240
of brilliance, and --

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.540
&gt;&gt; They blew it.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.840
[laughs]

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.160
&gt;&gt; As far as I know Murray's
collection didn't even come back

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.190
to the Library of Congress whole.

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.980
Part of it is now at
Howard, for example.

00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:09.340
&gt;&gt; Well that's true, and I was
telling Ezra one of my first jobs

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:13.070
when I came to the Library
of Congress was to sort out,

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:16.710
and I was an intern before the
Center for the Book was created

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.210
and interested in collection
development.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.260
And I was asked to help sort

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.340
out what was then called the
Colored Author Collection,

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.830
that was the leftover part
of the Murray Collection,

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.240
and with these labels across them.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.030
But I did it in conjunction

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.420
with a wonderful woman named
Dorothy Porter at Howard.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.110
And the agreement was that
if we came across duplicates

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:44.930
that Howard wanted, they went
there and so I was part of that.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:49.670
And the other part of it was
to take the wonderful pamphlets

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:55.280
that somehow had come back from
Paris and index them and put them

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.420
as the Murray Collection
in the rare book

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.600
and special collections division.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.670
So they're bound together in
several different volumes,

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:10.850
but that's what's left of their
heritage in terms of materials.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.730
But, of course, his heritage
lives on through the association

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:19.000
and the fact that there's now a
new scholarly interest in Murray.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.340
And you mentioned to me a
book that someone had done

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.690
about the exposition and I know
of someone who is now doing --

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:31.020
and I have wrote a letter of
recommendation for her fellowship.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.830
A full-time time, not full-time,
but full biography of Murray

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:40.760
and his family in Washington,
and the role that family played.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:46.630 position:56%
You know, in terms of what is a form
of the author thinks of, you know,

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.720
black elitism in a way, but
it has to do with the families

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.440
and the growth of Murray in
his family and is not as much

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.580
about Murray at the
Library of Congresses.

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.890
I would like to see, but maybe
she'll get to that as well.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.900
So I'm glad that we
introduced the topic again

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.410
and we can follow up on it.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.870
Well, please join us for
the book signing outside,

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.720
but in the meantime, join me
in thanking Ezra Greenspan

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.310
for a wonderful presentation.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:17.540
[Applause] Thank you.

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:21.170
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:23.550
Visit us at LOC.gov.
