[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:08.694
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.253
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Thanks
for the introduction.

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:15.580
Thanks to Barb and to Ginger
for bringing us both out here.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.164
And I just want to say, you
guys have a great building,

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:20.830
workspace, whatever
you want to call it.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.650
I'm just bummed I didn't get
invited for the full day.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.940
So I could make use of
the massage facilities

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.550
and your video games
and everything else.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.076
VU TRAN: I just
want the tea thing.

00:00:32.076 --> 00:00:32.950
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
Yeah, the Teabot.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.866
That's pretty amazing.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.440
VU TRAN: Yeah, the
Teabot, yes, yes.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.430
I would like to have that.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.263
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I
could get used to that.

00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:41.150
VU TRAN: Well, it's great to
be talking to you again, Viet.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
And thank everyone for coming.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.060
I thought we would begin our
conversation with "Crazy Rich

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.470
Asians."

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.910
You mentioned it
during our tour,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.490
and I thought that would
be a good place to start.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.180
I think by the movie and
the book's definition,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.840
I don't believe either of
us are crazy rich Asians,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.015
but you're doing quite well.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:02.290
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yes.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.540
I think we're only
one out of three.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.184
We're Asians.

00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:04.767
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:06.173
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.960
But the movie is a
starting point for an op-ed

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.410
you wrote recently in
"The New York Times"

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.360
about narrative plenitude.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.960
About how a movie as popular
as "Crazy Rich Asians"

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.950
can never be on its own.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.610
It can never, on
its own, vitalize

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.660
the presence of
Asian-Americans on the screen.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.770
And that we need as many
of those kinds of movies

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.920
to do that.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.430
And this idea you kind of
came up with in your book,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.690
"Nothing Ever Dies,"
and speaks to a scenario

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.450
where stories featuring
certain races or communities

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.290
are in abundance.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.080
And in that abundance,
allows for not only

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.450
a range of portrayals, but
also a range of quality

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.610
of portrayals, right?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.200
It bestows upon
them the privilege

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.800
of being mediocre
because there aren't

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.300
enough high-quality portrayals
to absorb the low-quality ones.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.790
Whereas, you say,
narrative scarcity

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.970
does not allow for something
like that-- for mediocrity,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.199
for example.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.050
And that its narrow or
inhuman, or simply mediocre

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.500
portrayals ends up defining
that race or community.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.190
So I wanted to ask you
if you could talk more

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.370
about this idea of
narrative plenitude,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.190
and how it affects the
Asian-American community,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.097
and your own personal
confrontation with it.

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.430
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, you
grew up in Oklahoma, right?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.620
VU TRAN: I did.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.010
VIET THANH NGUYEN: So
I think you probably

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.590
had an even harder
time of it than I did,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.350
and I grew up in San Jose,
in northern California

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.760
in the '70s and '80s.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.899
And San Jose, in
northern California,

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.440
it's a diverse, multicultural
place and everything like that,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.939
right?

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.980
And I grew up in a
rougher part of town,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.020
and so I was surrounded
by Vietnamese refugees

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.970
and Mexican immigrants
and people like that.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.960
But even so, at a
certain point, I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.300
had a very personal
confrontation with this idea

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.700
that there weren't enough
stories about people like us.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.365
And that is, I went to a
very elite high school.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:02.990
It was mostly an
all-white high school,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.760
except that there was
a handful of us who

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.790
were of Asian descent.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.610
We knew we were different,
we just didn't know how.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.290
But every day at
lunch, we would gather

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.890
in a corner of the campus
and we would call ourselves

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.420
the Asian Invasion.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.170
And this was the
mid-1980s, right?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.220
So the only language we had for
ourselves was this racist term.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.920
And obviously, instead of being
crazy rich Asians at the time,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.300
we knew we were the Asians who
were threatening to take over.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.370
And the funny thing
was, last year, I

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.770
had a chance to go back
to visit that campus

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.350
and give a talk to
all 1,600 students,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.360
and we really have taken over.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.080
But that's another story.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.960
But looking back at that time,
I think what I realize now

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.360
that I didn't know
then, is that we were

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.980
living in narrative scarcity.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.250
That we didn't have
enough stories about us,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.610
and that the only stories
that we could refer to

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.930
were these racist stories
about Asians who were invading.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.240
Obviously, the idea of
Asian wars and things

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.200
like that, which many of us
had come from, or fled from.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.350
And looking back, I know
that what I needed--

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.490
what we all needed--

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.839
back then were more
stories, right?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.820
And we needed more writers.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.140
We needed more filmmakers.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.250
We need more artists.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.390
We needed more politicians.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.420
We needed more journalists who
would be getting our stories

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.030
and our voices out there.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.800
And that is the difference
between narrative scarcity

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.080
and narrative plenitude.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.930
Narrative scarcity means
very few of the stories

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.500
out there are about you,
whoever you happen to be.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.380
Whatever kind of minority
you happen to be coming from.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.130
Narrative plenitude is
when almost all the stories

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.000
are about you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.270
And that's one of the
sure signs that you

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.940
are part of some kind of
majority, when you can take it

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.520
for granted that some
fundamental part of who you are

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.124
is being shown to you in the
stories that you encounter.

00:05:04.124 --> 00:05:06.040
And when you live in an
environment like that,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.900
you totally take it
for granted, right?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.154
So when somebody makes a stupid
Hollywood movie, you can say,

00:05:11.154 --> 00:05:12.070
that's just Hollywood.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.170
That's just a movie.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.240
That's a story.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.710
My students say it all the time.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.150
I say, you're right.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.780
One story that's a bad
story is just a story.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.386
But when all the stories
are saying the same thing,

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:25.760
then it's more
than just a story.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.250
It's actually saying something
fundamental about the culture.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.291
And so again, when all
the stories are about you,

00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:31.820
it's saying something
about who you

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.680
are as a part of this culture.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.190
And when most of the stories are
not about you, or not about us,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.030
then when the one story
comes out that is about you,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.944
enormous weight is put on that.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.110
So for better or for worse--

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.980
VU TRAN: You can't
casually dismiss it.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.021
VIET THANH NGUYEN: You
can't casually dismiss it.

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:52.010
So when "Crazy Rich Asians"
came out, the reason why there

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.730
was so much pressure put on this
is because Hollywood had not

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.190
made a movie with
Asian-American leading

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.760
actors in about 25 years,
since "Joy Luck Club," right?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.500
And so everybody was
like, this better

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.206
be a good movie because
if it's a good movie,

00:06:06.206 --> 00:06:07.580
it'll change all
of our fortunes.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.080
And if it's a bad
movie, we'll never

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.180
get another movie
for another 25 years.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.750
That's a totally unfair
expectation to put on a movie.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.900
But this is what narrative
scarcity is about.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300
And I think the
ramifications of that simply

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.610
beyond the world of
artists and storytellers

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.510
is that it's true pretty much
everywhere else, if you're

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.460
a part of a minority,
you're not allowed

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.030
the luxury of mediocrity.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.770
If you succeed or if you fail,
your success or your failure

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.267
is somehow tied to
your entire group.

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:37.850
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.600
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.142
I'm assuming-- I
don't know if it's--

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:41.766
and it's true in a
lot of corporations.

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.190
I don't know how
true it is here.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.910
But you feel this
weight, this burden,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.800
of being representative
for your people, whatever

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.970
that people happens to be.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.860
And so I think, to go back,
just talk about writing,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.818
I don't know if that's
something that you feel,

00:06:55.818 --> 00:06:58.650
but certainly I think
I felt that way.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.130
VU TRAN: And was it immediate?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.140
What was the evolution of
that kind of confrontation

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.420
with this scarcity?

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.620
Did it always come to
you in political terms,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.810
or was it just you noticing,
oh, I'm not on the screen,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.210
I'm not in books, I'm not on TV?

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.502
How did that evolution kind of--

00:07:20.502 --> 00:07:22.460
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well,
when I was growing up,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.697
it gradually dawned on
me that I'm Vietnamese,

00:07:25.697 --> 00:07:27.530
I come from a family
of Vietnamese refugees.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.210
I'm a Vietnamese refugee.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.550
And that pretty much the
only way my experience,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.780
or my family's experience,
or the experience

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.790
of all these Vietnamese
refugees in San Jose

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.340
meant anything to the
rest of the country

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.997
was through the Vietnam War.

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:43.580
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.060
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right?

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.670
That's the only reason
anybody had anything to know--

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.510
that's only reason anybody else
had to know anything about us.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.440
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.065
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
The problem, though,

00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:55.580
is that, in this country, when
people hear the word Vietnam,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.431
they don't oftentimes think
of the country right away.

00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:00.680
Maybe things have changed now.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.560
Maybe now, when you
say Vietnam, in 2018,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.780
people would think banh mi or
pho, or something like that.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.442
But in 1984, when
you said Vietnam,

00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:09.650
people meant the Vietnam War.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.280
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.540
VIET THANH NGUYEN: And
when they say the Viet--

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.250
when people say the
Vietnam War, they really

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.270
mean the American War.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.630
So it gradually dawned
on me that there

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.430
were no stories
about us, and there

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.050
were very few
stories about Asians,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.560
in general, in the 1980s.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.650
So I remember going
to a bookstore

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.020
when I was about 18 or 19,
and finding the "Joy Luck

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.400
Club" by Amy Tan, which had
just gotten published that year

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.770
or the year before.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.140
And just being amazed that
there was a book, a novel,

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.029
by someone who was
Asian or Asian-American.

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.070
That was a mind-blowing--

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.820
VU TRAN: And that
it was popular.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.690
VIET THANH NGUYEN: And
that it was popular,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.315
and it was actually
a pretty good book.

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.110
So I was blown away by that.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.470
That made a huge
difference to me.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.520
It made me think, where
has this book been?

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.380
Or where have other
books been like this?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.497
And that set me down
the road as a student,

00:08:56.497 --> 00:08:58.580
as a college student, of
trying to find everything

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.530
that had been written by
Asian-American writers, first

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.030
of all.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.159
And then, secondarily,
by Vietnamese and

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:05.825
Vietnamese-American
writers, and there's

00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:09.232
a handful of that
work out there.

00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:10.940
So sometimes I think
about the very first

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.100
Vietnamese-American
writer to get published,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.510
which was around the 1960s,
and how lonely that person

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.200
must have been.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.730
Now you and I come out
and there are literally

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.620
dozens of Vietnamese-American
writers out there.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.240
But you couldn't
make that assumption

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.060
two or three decades ago.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.410
VU TRAN: Well, I want to
talk about the Vietnam War,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.290
especially in terms of its
portrayal on the screen.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.840
But I was first curious,
in what realm or mode

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.210
of representation--
whether it's movies, books,

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.760
or other art forms--

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.470
do you think narrative
scarcity is most dangerous?

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.477
And in which mode around
the representation

00:09:48.477 --> 00:09:50.810
do you think narrative plenitude
can be most beneficial?

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:51.727
Does that makes sense?

00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:54.018
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, I
go around the country giving

00:09:54.018 --> 00:09:56.360
talks, and one of the things
I try to tell everybody

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.310
is, look, people like
you and me, we're

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.480
professional storytellers.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.210
We write books for a
living, or I write op-eds

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.070
for "The New York Times."

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.560
But we're all storytellers,
in the sense that we've all

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.500
absorbed some stories
that we take for granted,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.970
and we tell these stories
to each other all the time.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.394
Most often, for example,
about what this country is.

00:10:18.394 --> 00:10:19.060
What is America?

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.143
What is it supposed to be?

00:10:20.143 --> 00:10:20.768
VU TRAN: Right.

00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:22.267
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
These are stories

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:23.300
that we tell each other.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.700
And so when the
current president

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.650
says, make America great again,
that's a story in four words.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.192
And it's an enormously powerful
story for a lot of people.

00:10:35.192 --> 00:10:37.400
Even if there are people
who disagree with the story,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.350
it's an enormously
powerful story.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.310
So we go home and we tell
those kinds of stories

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.090
to other people.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.730
Here's a story that
I encountered when

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.410
I was growing up in San Jose.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.350
My parents had opened the
second Vietnamese grocery

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.714
store in San Jose, downtown.

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:54.130
I remember walking
down the street

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.440
from my parents' store
when I was around 10 or 11,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.360
and seeing a sign
in a store window.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.660
And it said, another American
driven out of business

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.180
by the Vietnamese.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.140
That's not just a sign.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.060
That's a story in nine words.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.207
And it's a story that,
in fact, Americans

00:11:09.207 --> 00:11:11.290
have been telling each
other for a very long time.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.331
It's just another American
driven out of business

00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:15.610
by "fill in the blank."

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.750
It's been told before.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.490
It was told during
my parents' time.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.650
It's being told again
with different populations

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.010
for "fill in the blank."

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.610
So that's an example
of narrative scarcity

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.680
and narrative plenitude.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.390
Because at that
time, in the 1980s,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.120
we Vietnamese people
didn't have the access

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.407
to try to contest that story.

00:11:32.407 --> 00:11:34.490
I didn't know how to make
sense out of that story,

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.680
or how to fight back against it.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.284
And meanwhile,
narrative plenitude

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:40.450
means that there are people
out there with the power

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.070
to go around telling
these kinds of stories

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.153
and spreading them around.

00:11:43.153 --> 00:11:45.300
Asian invasion is
a story like that.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.130
VU TRAN: And it's a story that
can be disseminated much more

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:51.790
widely, and reinforced
more powerfully now

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.700
with social media.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.080
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.620
VU TRAN: A five-word story
like that can spread much more

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.870
powerfully nowadays.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.350
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.750
VU TRAN: Which
underlines their power.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.100
VIET THANH NGUYEN: That's a
good example because, obviously,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.641
some people--

00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:05.950
I'm not very good at Twitter.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.670
I have, like, 16,000
followers, which is nothing

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.140
in the world of Twitter.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.307
There are 15-year-old kids out
there with 100,000 followers.

00:12:14.307 --> 00:12:15.640
I don't know what they're doing.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.014
They know how to
use that medium.

00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:21.087
They know how to tell stories in
140 of 280 characters or less.

00:12:21.087 --> 00:12:21.670
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.086
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
So there are so

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.790
many ways to tell
stories out there, not

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.470
just through the world of
books or movies and so on.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.200
And that's one of the things
that social media has done,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.920
is actually they've
transformed that landscape.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.211
And I think that's been
empowering for a lot of people.

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.620
As they realize they
actually are storytellers,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.366
they can bypass all the
established gatekeepers

00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:40.240
that you and I have to
rely on, like New York

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.020
publishers and the like.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.240
So hopefully, that
brings to people

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.970
this sense that,
in fact, all of us

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.770
are engaged in narratives
in different ways.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.670
VU TRAN: Well, you talk
about, in "Nothing Ever Dies,"

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.140
video games.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.530
That is another
narrative that is--

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.150
I don't think some
people realize

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.290
how powerful video games are,
in terms of how they represent

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.107
the worlds in those games.

00:13:04.107 --> 00:13:06.190
You talk about first-person
shooters, for example.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.180
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.210
Particularly, I'm interested in
how, in a first-person shooter,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.900
the points of view--

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.540
when you're trying
to kill the enemy,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.940
you have to distance
yourself from that enemy,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.070
and you can't bestow
that enemy any humanity

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.780
because your absolute goal
is to destroy your enemy.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.110
And something like a
first-person shooter game

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.690
can really present a
very dangerous narrative.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.690
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well,
the video game industry

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.040
is more economically profitable
than Hollywood, I think.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.310
It's billions of dollars
and all that kind of stuff.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.070
And we who are writers--

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.320
oftentimes, when we're only
in a room full of writers,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.030
we'll make huge,
grand statements

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.640
about the power of literature.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.360
Oh, literature will
save us, writing

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.950
will save us, blah, blah, blah.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.080
I'm like, yes, it's true for
those people who read books.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.850
OK?

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.630
Or an even smaller population
of people who read novels.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.880
But almost everybody
plays video games.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.020
And so the reach of
video games, and the way

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.740
that they disseminate
stories, is really powerful.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.900
VU TRAN: You call it
seductive, which I think is--

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.560
I never thought of
it in those terms.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.060
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
You're not seduced

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.920
when you play video games?

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.336
VU TRAN: I don't
play video games.

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:22.429
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Oh.

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:22.970
Good for you.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.950
VU TRAN: I don't
know why I don't.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.386
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:14:24.386 --> 00:14:25.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.880
VU TRAN: But yeah, seductive
is a very good word for it,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.544
more so than any book
or movie, I feel like.

00:14:30.544 --> 00:14:32.710
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I speak
as someone easily seduced

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:33.490
by video games.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.100
So throughout stages of
my life, I have gone out

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.160
and bought the latest
game console on credit,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.440
played it nonstop for
a week, then got sick

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.020
and disgusted with myself,
and then returned it, OK?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.280
Because I know that if
I kept it in the house,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.640
I would just never stop
playing those things.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.223
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:49.330
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
But what I say

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.480
is that yes, novels
and Shakespeare

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.700
and so on, these
are stories that--

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.460
if they're good or
if we like them--

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.790
seduce us through the
power of storytelling,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.910
and get us to empathize with
the characters in the plays

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.770
or the books and the
stories and so on.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.900
But that's what video
games do, as well.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.681
They get to empathize--

00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:11.680
and we're talking about
first-person games here.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.630
They get us to empathize
with these characters

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.240
and these narratives
that have been created.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.560
And people spend more time
playing these games than they

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.700
would reading Marcel Proust.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.160
OK, he wrote four volumes
of "In Search of Lost Time,"

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.254
this thick.

00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:29.170
Your average teenager,
never going to read it.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.378
Your average adult, never
going to read these things.

00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:33.010
But your average
game player will

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.340
spend dozens of hours
playing these games,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.494
and they're artificially
created worlds.

00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:39.910
And yes, I think
they're powerful,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.368
and yes, I think
they're seductive.

00:15:41.368 --> 00:15:44.560
And what happens there is
that stories can really

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.144
have implicit meanings.

00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:47.560
How many people
here actually play

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.060
first-person shooter games?

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.060
Some.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.260
OK, good.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.372
Unfortunately, that's
the kind of game I like.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.830
I don't know what
it says about me.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.704
That's the only game I
like playing, shooting

00:15:58.704 --> 00:16:00.490
and destroying and
killing things.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.000
VU TRAN: Actually, me, too.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.291
I say I don't play video games.

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:04.920
But when I did, those are
the only games I would play.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.410
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.666
And on the one hand,
yeah, you can probably

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:07.380
say they're harmless.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.546
On the other hand, are they?

00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:10.840
I mean, what are they
actually training us to do?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.000
What are they-- how are they
training us to see the world?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.950
And the reason it comes up
in a book like "Nothing Ever

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.450
Dies, Vietnam and
the Memory of War"

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.230
is that I'm trying to make
this connection between that

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:25.234
and, in general, as Americans,
our perspective on the world.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.650
When we think about
the world, how

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.510
do we think about the world?

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.470
Americans are involved
all over the world.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.960
And when we talk strictly
about war and the military,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.810
we have over 800 bases
around the world.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.580
This is a reality that most
Americans are not engaged with.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.420
And our military presence
is all over the place.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.077
But usually, when
we think about it,

00:16:45.077 --> 00:16:46.660
we think about it
from the perspective

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.440
of American soldiers or
American pilots or whatever.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.350
And when we actually
see the world,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.990
oftentimes, it's
through, literally,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.250
the gun scopes of
American weaponry,

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.500
or the cameras of drones.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.990
That, to me, seems like
a direct connection

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.869
to the first-person shooter.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.900
Not to say that everybody who
plays a first-person shooter is

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.020
going to be going out
there piloting a drone,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.200
but that's part
of the connection.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.839
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:21.130
It's a quite subliminal
conditioning.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.890
So I guess my
question for you then

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.250
is, how would you then
advise Asian-Americans,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.780
or any American, in their
effort to build on something

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.870
like "Crazy Rich Asians"?

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.860
Beyond just creating and
engaging in these narratives,

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.815
what else can we do?

00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:44.440
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, I look
back on that time in the 1980s,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.140
when there were very few stories
by and about Asian-Americans,

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.150
and I think, yes,
part of the problem

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.060
was structural racism, that
we're preventing our stories

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.170
from getting out there.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.630
But part of the problem
is Asian parents.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.130
Those of you who
are Asian parents--

00:17:59.130 --> 00:17:59.350
VU TRAN: Oh, please
talk about this.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.640
VIET THANH NGUYEN: --or going
to be Asian parents, and so on.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.931
VU TRAN: Asian parents, please.

00:18:01.931 --> 00:18:03.070
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.420
Asian parents bear some
responsibility in saying

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.330
don't be writers, don't
be artists, to their kids.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.710
Don't be creatives.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.950
Go into tech or
medicine or whatever.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.140
And all of that is very
laudable and understandable

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.340
and everything like that.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.747
But I go around--

00:18:21.747 --> 00:18:23.830
again, I'm convinced of
the power of storytelling.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.622
I'm convinced of the
power of narrative.

00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:27.580
You don't have to breed
your kid to be a writer

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.080
or something like
that, but you have

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.639
to be open to the possibility
that stories really matter,

00:18:32.639 --> 00:18:34.180
and that there's
only so many doctors

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.910
and lawyers and pharmacists and
nurses that we need out there.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.330
We need other people doing
different kinds of things, too.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.740
So that is an op-ed I want
to write for "The New York

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.467
Times," saying, Asian
parents, do your bit

00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:46.300
to change the world.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.220
And one of the most rewarding
things that's happened to me

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.260
when I go out and I
speak-- a couple of times--

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.360
has been when an Asian
parent has come up to me.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.910
I was at Brown University,
and this Vietnamese woman

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.650
came up to me.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.580
She's like 40-something.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.745
And she said, oh, I--

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:01.120
she either worked
at a nail salon

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.203
or she owned a nail salon.

00:19:02.203 --> 00:19:05.320
And she said, my son
goes here to Brown.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.510
And I said, what
does he major in?

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:12.050
And his major was so weird.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.410
It was like the stereotype
of a Brown humanities major.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.940
I don't even know what it is.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.380
It wasn't English, it
wasn't women's studies.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.640
It was freakier
than those things.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.490
It combined them.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.073
And I said, what do
you think of that?

00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:23.120
And she said, I'm
so proud of him.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.864
And I was like, that's
a story I want to hear.

00:19:26.864 --> 00:19:28.780
So hopefully, there are
more parents out there

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.017
like that, who believe in these
possibilities for their kids.

00:19:32.017 --> 00:19:33.100
VU TRAN: I agree with you.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.650
In a word, I would say I
wish Vietnamese parents would

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.020
embrace weirdness.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.670
As a culture, we
don't like weirdness.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.326
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:19:41.326 --> 00:19:42.990
VU TRAN: In whatever
form that is.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.610
To be OK with it, to be
somewhat comfortable,

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.490
or at least comfortable with
your discomfort with weirdness.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:48.660
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.120
VU TRAN: Right?

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.287
VU TRAN: And allow your
kids to embrace it, as well.

00:19:52.287 --> 00:19:54.119
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I
think that part of that

00:19:54.119 --> 00:19:55.960
is due, obviously,
to Asian-Americans

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.580
being a relatively
small minority

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.575
in the last few decades.

00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:01.450
And so of course, when
there is fewer people,

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.780
there's more pressure because
of the scarcity issues, right?

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.700
And the narrative
scarcity, this idea

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.250
that you have to go out there
and represent your people

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.410
and all of that, so you've got
to be a good boy or good girl,

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.160
whatever, and go out
there and be a doctor

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.620
and do all those
kinds of things.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.210
But we--

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.251
VU TRAN: The model Asian.

00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:18.040
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
Yeah, model Asians.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.300
But if we're speaking
just about Asians,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.716
we've crossed the
magic threshold.

00:20:20.716 --> 00:20:23.590
I think we're 5% or 6% of
the national population.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.000
There's more of a
critical mass out there.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.160
I don't know if the
problems with Asian parents

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.450
are any different than
any other parents.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.250
I'm assuming if you take
a cross-section of America

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.833
as a whole, a lot
of parents out there

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:37.270
want their kids to be doctors
and lawyers and engineers,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:41.371
in order to foot that $60,000
tuition bill and so on.

00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:43.120
But again, just with
a smaller population,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.026
there's just more
pressure on us.

00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:46.900
VU TRAN: I was also
thinking of something you

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.280
said in "Nothing Ever Dies."

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.290
You refer to Little
Saigon in Orange County

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.380
as the greatest work
of collective memory

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.640
these defeated people--

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.290
Vietnamese people--
have created,

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.960
in the sense that this
recreation of home

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.910
in Southern
California in America

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.700
has allowed us, particularly
southern Vietnamese,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.660
to control our memories of
ourselves from back home,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.870
and also, our own
presence here in America.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.770
And I guess it's
economic success

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.030
as a mode of cultural capital.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.890
And it made me think that,
at the center of this

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.250
is Vietnamese cuisine, and all
those Vietnamese restaurants

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.620
that have come out of-- that
started in Little Saigon,

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.490
and have spread out
all across the country.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.050
The fact that Vietnamese
cuisine is taken seriously now,

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.730
Vietnamese food, everyone
not only knows what pho is,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.510
or most people do, but
they also even know

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.690
how to pronounce it now.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.474
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.220
And I wonder, have you thought
of this as a kind of narrative

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.225
itself, Vietnamese cuisine?

00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:49.600
VIET THANH NGUYEN: So there's
a Little Saigon in Chicago,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.310
right?

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.220
I don't know what you call it,
but there's a neighborhood--

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:51.960
VU TRAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.450
Argyle, Argyle, yeah.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.750
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.370
So for those of you who have
not been to Little Saigon

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.911
in Orange County, that's that
neighborhood, 100 times larger.

00:21:56.911 --> 00:21:58.440
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.150
VIET THANH NGUYEN: And
so yeah, basically,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.330
one of the ways that you
become American in this country

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.820
is that you own real estate.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.340
And it's through owning
real estate that you make

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.610
your presence felt. And so these
so-called ethnic neighborhoods

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.105
are a very important way of
Americanization because you

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:17.480
drive to Orange County, you
drive to Westminster or Santa

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.330
Ana, you cannot help but see
streets and streets and streets

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.970
full of Vietnamese businesses
with Vietnamese signage and all

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:25.670
of that.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.380
It's a very bold proclamation
that we are here.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.830
And it is an enormously
important part

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.490
of telling that narrative.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.160
And from out of
that concentration--

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.470
this is a very American thing.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.090
I've been to Paris, for example,
and in France, the French

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:43.900
don't like this.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.349
They don't like
ethnic concentrations.

00:22:46.349 --> 00:22:48.640
But in this country, because
of our particular history,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.410
we do, or we allow it, anyway.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:51.910
And so we tell that
kind of a story.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.784
And then, of course,
besides the real estate,

00:22:53.784 --> 00:22:55.930
there's the food that
you're talking about.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.690
And food is an important story.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.930
How do we go from a moment
in the 1970s and 1980s

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.920
where the American racist
perception of Vietnamese

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.930
is that we ate dogs?

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.630
These were stories that
were circulating back then.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.870
And now we've gone
from that to pho.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.820
We've gone from that moment to
Rachel Ray making horrible pho.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.160
OK?

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.780
I was like, you've
just taken something

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.980
and put the word pho on it.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.010
It has no relationship
to the actual food.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.690
I'm sort of OK with that.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.732
I'm sort of OK with that.

00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:31.231
Because it means
that we've actually

00:23:31.231 --> 00:23:33.250
changed the vocabulary,
we've changed the story.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.540
VU TRAN: We've gotten
far enough for someone

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.430

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.496
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:36.954
We've gotten far
enough for someone

00:23:36.954 --> 00:23:40.880
to debase us in our
food, appropriate us.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.090
Trader Joe's has-- oh, my god.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.780
Trader Joe's.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.071
I went there, I made a mistake.

00:23:45.071 --> 00:23:46.680
I just wanted to try it.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.040
Goi cuon, the spring roll.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.560
They have it at Trader
Joe's, the vermicelli

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.770
wrapping around vegetables.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.790
It was horrible.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.782
It was horrible.

00:23:53.782 --> 00:23:55.240
But at least we've
gotten that far.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.640
VU TRAN: That's what you mean.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.090
That kind of plenitude allows

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.895
stuff like that.

00:24:01.895 --> 00:24:02.200
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.460
VU TRAN: And it's
kind of a good thing.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.000
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.200
Because I think most
people will know

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.040
that if they go and they get
pho from Trader Joe's, it's

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.770
going to suck.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:07.950
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.560
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
I think people

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.820
are smart enough to know that.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.310
So that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.721
It's actually a good thing.

00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.720
For example, when "The
Refugees," my short story

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.279
collection came out, I went to
Costco once, and they had it.

00:24:20.279 --> 00:24:22.070
They had a pallet full--
not a pallet full.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.730
They had several stacks of
"The Refugees," and I thought,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.240
I'd made it.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.259
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:26.800
I've made it.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.280
VU TRAN: You've
made it to Costco.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:27.960
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
And so it's the same.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.590
You made it to Costco, you
made it to Trader Joe's.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.360
That's what we're striving for.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.570
And this goes into the
whole authenticity thing.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.600
Nobody in their right minds will
think they're getting good pho

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.650
from Trader Joe's.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.420
But the point is that,
then, people will know--

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.230
people will say, I know
where to get the good pho.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.920
I'm in the know, so I know where
the authentic Vietnamese food

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.700
is.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700
And so that's part of the
dynamic of narratives, as well.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.350
Oh, these people
over here, they don't

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.760
know enough, the difference
between good banh

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.330
mi or good pho and bad
pho, and bad banh mi.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:58.830
We do.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.038
We don't have to be Vietnamese,
but we're really hip.

00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:02.060
We know what's going on.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.570
And so that's true for
narratives of all kinds,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.120
whether it's movies
or books or food.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.570
Because now, very hip and
smart Americans will go,

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.540
yeah, I know about fish sauce.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.625
I was at Brown.

00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:16.800
I was just joking around.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.150
It was a continental
restaurant in Providence,

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.750
and I was just looking at my
plate of fish, whatever it was.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.150
And I thought, it'd be
better with fish sauce.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.120
And the waiter said,
we have fish sauce.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:28.754
And he did.

00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:29.670
He was not Vietnamese.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.730
This was not a
Vietnamese restaurant.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.850
So I thought, we made it.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.850
In this continental
European kind of restaurant,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.040
they have a bottle fish
sauce for people who ask.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.170
But we have a secret ingredient
beyond that that most Americans

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.972
do not know about--

00:25:41.972 --> 00:25:42.680
VU TRAN: Do tell.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.320
VIET THANH NGUYEN: --that's even
more authentic than fish sauce.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.032
Shrimp paste.

00:25:47.032 --> 00:25:47.740
VU TRAN: Oh, god.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:47.900
Yeah.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.580
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.540
VU TRAN: Are we going to
get there with shrimp paste?

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.600
VIET THANH NGUYEN: That
is the nuclear option.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.090
VU TRAN: Oh, wow.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.090
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:58.230
VU TRAN: But back to
this kind of model Asian,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.110
especially the kind of
economic model of success

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.880
that a lot of immigrants,
particularly Vietnamese, really

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.040
celebrate.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.470
And it comes out of the success
of a place like Little Saigon.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.040
And I wonder about the
problematic aspects of that.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.550
For example, it does
reinforce this notion that

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.790
to be a success, it has
to be an economic success

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.310
or financial success.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:28.230
And that also, more
deeply, I think this is--

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:33.780
it seems to me this is
how Vietnamese also end up

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.820
supporting arguments
against immigration

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:45.190
and against the newer
refugees coming in.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.030
It's this kind of
contradiction where--

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.050
people always wonder
like, why would--

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:55.130
OK, so my parents
voted for Trump, right?

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.240
And when you have an
example like that,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.160
people ask, how could
they, as refugees,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.560
now support someone
who does not--

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.130
who's so against
immigration and refugees?

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.560
Why do you think we do this?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.190
I feel like it's kind of
founded on this idea of what

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.450
is a successful immigrant,
don't you think?

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:13.710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.980
VU TRAN: Does that make sense?

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.790
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah,
it totally makes sense,

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.373
and it's true.

00:27:16.373 --> 00:27:19.870
There are a lot of fervent
supporters of Donald Trump,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.210
for example, in the
Vietnamese-American community,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.250
and they will wear the red Make
America Great Again hats also.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.830
And I think there's a number
of different narratives

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.550
that are happening there.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.760
One is the idea of
the American dream.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.540
The Vietnamese
refugees really believe

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.373
that they've succeeded
in the United States,

00:27:36.373 --> 00:27:37.860
and they've done
it the right way,

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.380
and everybody else should
do it the right way.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.230
And therefore, that means going
through the legal procedures

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.610
and everything.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.220
They also participate in a very
important American narrative,

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:58.740
too, which is that this is
a country in which people

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.100
get the right to forget
where they came from.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.180
VU TRAN: Yeah, right.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.555
VIET THANH NGUYEN: If you're
an American of three or four

00:28:06.555 --> 00:28:08.490
generations, you may
have a very fuzzy notion

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.880
of who your ancestors are,
how they came here, and so on.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.310
And just because they were
immigrants two or three or four

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.870
generations back
doesn't mean you're

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.460
going to be empathetic with the
new immigrants that come in.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.850
You're an American now.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.910
And part of what it means
to be an American-- part

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.640
of our history-- is that we
have barriers and borders

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.680
and exclusionary acts
and things like this.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.560
And the
Vietnamese-Americans now,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.780
who want to maintain
that border and so on,

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.710
they're participating in
that same American narrative

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.860
to become American
and to forget where

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.670
it is that they came from.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.070
So it's not surprising.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.170
It's ironic because
we're intimate with it,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.580
and it's more recent history.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.420
But it's completely American
to do these kinds of things.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.426

that the secondary goal

00:28:53.426 --> 00:28:55.800

this is in "Nothing Ever Dies"

on the horizon."

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.610

it's too easy for us.

I think we're all
capable of empathy.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.790
Again, this is what narratives
and stories are supposed to do.

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:19.170
It's supposed to
teach us empathy

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.544
about people who
are not like us.

00:29:20.544 --> 00:29:22.140
We read books and
we watch movies

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.210
about people who
are not like us.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.800
But where do we draw
that circle of empathy?

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.520
How far out does it extend?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.250
Obviously, hopefully, most of us
are empathetic to our families,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.420
for example.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.940
We're empathetic
to other Americans.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.610
But who counts as an American?

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.450
So it's totally possible to
say I empathize with Americans,

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.780
but my definition of Americans
excludes certain kinds

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.780
of people in this country.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.770
So I think that part of
the political tensions

00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:00.390
in our country is that there are
competing projects of empathy

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:01.510
that are happening here.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.180
And competing projects
of storytelling

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.770
about what America is.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.880
There's some people
who want to say

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.190
we should expand those
borders of empathy

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.294
to include the undocumented
or refugees or immigrants.

00:30:14.294 --> 00:30:15.960
And there's other
people who are saying,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.950
no, we just want to
take care of Americans,

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.114
whatever Americans mean.

00:30:21.114 --> 00:30:22.530
And I don't think
these people who

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.770
advocate for that would
say they're not empathetic.

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:26.160
They think, I am empathetic.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.916
I'm just empathetic with the
people we need to take care of.

00:30:28.916 --> 00:30:29.790
VU TRAN: To a degree.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.300
VIET THANH NGUYEN: To a degree.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.230
The near and the dear.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.220
VU TRAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.000
VIET THANH NGUYEN: And I
feel that we, as writers,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.149
our project is about approaching
the far and the feared, whoever

00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.940
that happens to be.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.000
This could be literal
populations of people--

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.680
foreigners, immigrants,
undocumented,

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.780
the people we're at war with.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.510
Or the far and the fear
could be what's inside of us.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.550
That's what we, as writers,
are supposed to do.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.100
And so I think that's why,
today, the literary community

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:04.140
is in such an uproar against
the current administration.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.990
Because it just feels as if
our definitions of empathy

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.850
are radically,
radically different.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.224
And it is partially
based on different ideas

00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:13.140
of storytelling, different
ideas of narrative,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:18.420
different ideas of who should
be at the center of our stories.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.280
VU TRAN: But with this
new-found empathy,

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.820
where people do have a
language to both express

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.060
why certain
representations of them

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.690
have been either not
satisfactory or dangerous,

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:42.180
how do you then deal
with products of the past

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.800
once you see them
in this new light?

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.930
For example, you go back to--

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.580
you were talking
about the Vietnam War

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.490
as portrayed in
movies, and you've

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.054
written at length on that.

00:31:52.054 --> 00:31:53.720
That was the kind of
narrative plenitude

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.110
that Vietnamese-Americans
did have, but in the bad way.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.560
For example, you've written
about "Apocalypse Now,"

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.060
and how that became a
space for white Americans

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.900
to deal with both their
humanity and humanity.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.310
But in doing so, it left
the Vietnamese only inhuman,

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:17.100
and distanced them.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.389
An example like
"Apocalypse Now"--

00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:21.180
and there are many
other examples of that--

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.420
what do you then do with that,
now that you have this new

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.476
insight?

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:26.350
Does that make sense?

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.020
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.540
How many people here have
actually seen "Apocalypse Now"?

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.430
Oh, you come from the
generation that has.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.670
I go around now, and people are
like-- teenagers and college

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.260
students, they've
not seen this movie.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:37.840
VU TRAN: Really?

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.700
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
Yeah, they haven't.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.741
I'm shocked they haven't.

00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.410
They haven't.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.880
VU TRAN: It used to be
a cool thing in college

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.593
that you had this
poster on your dorm.

00:32:43.593 --> 00:32:44.170
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
It's been a long time

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.336
since we've been in college.

00:32:45.336 --> 00:32:47.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.080
It's a very generational shift.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.830
So you know what the
movie's about, right?

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:57.930
And I think that,
for those of us who

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.940
feel like we've been
excluded from narrative

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.790
plenitude for whatever reason,
there's oftentimes an impulse

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.340
that we need to tell
our own stories,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.810
we need to get our
voices out there.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.770
And we've seen that
we've been depicted

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.767
as inhuman or as stereotypes
or whatever in mass media.

00:33:14.767 --> 00:33:17.100
So we're going to tell a
story-- once we have the chance

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.520
to tell the story, we're going
to tell a story about how human

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:26.360
we are, about how
empathetic we are.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.670
And that's powerful.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.990
But I also think it's actually
very limited at the same time.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.550
Because what it means to
have narrative plenitude,

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.320
and to be a part
of the majority,

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.500
is that you can take for
granted that you don't

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.260
have to prove your humanity.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.470
That's why, in an economy
of narrative plenitude,

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.970
you can have movies
about white people

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.654
who are serial
killers, for example,

00:33:53.654 --> 00:33:55.070
and people are not
going to go out

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.486
of that movie theater saying,
oh, my god, all white people

00:33:57.486 --> 00:33:58.500
are serial killers.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:33:59.340
You don't, right?

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.080
You get to immerse yourself in
the world of the serial killer

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.790
and think, yes, bad person,
but I can empathize.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.639
If it's a well-done
movie, you empathize

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.219
with the full range of human
possibility, from the inhuman

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.041
to the human.

00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:15.540
OK.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.320
So that's why, for
example, the TV shows

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.810
that I was watching when I
was writing "The Sympathizer"

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.004
were TV shows like "The
Sopranos" or "The Wire."

00:34:26.004 --> 00:34:27.420
These are shows
that are not going

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.449
out there trying to prove
the humanity of Americans.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.760
It's simply looking
at these people

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.440
who are capable of a range
of good and bad things,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.100
as we all are.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.330
That's what we have to do.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:40.080
That's how I feel.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.110
When we have the opportunity
to tell our own stories,

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.540
we have to proceed
from the assumption

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.880
that we're already human,
which means we're already

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.350
inhuman at the same time.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:51.909
And my response to
"Apocalypse Now"

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.570
was not to write a
novel that simply

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.000
shows the tragedy of
Vietnamese refugees

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.470
and our human
story and all that.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.970
No.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.980
"The Sympathizer"-- for those
of you who haven't read it,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.800
shame on you.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.260
But it is a story about a
spy who has to do bad things.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.160
And he's an alcoholic,
and he's a womanizer,

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.180
and he's a murderer and
all this kind of stuff.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.640
It's a really good story, OK?

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.294
Precisely because it doesn't
try to prove any humanity

00:35:17.294 --> 00:35:19.710
or try to make the Vietnamese
people look good or anything

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.209
like that.

00:35:20.209 --> 00:35:22.380
It does the same
kinds of gestures

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.710
that these stories like "The
Sopranos" or "The Godfather,"

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.360
and so on, take
for granted, which

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:33.510
is that you can have antiheroes
as your representatives,

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.980
and no one's going
to mistake them

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.100
in somehow telling the entire
story about, in this case,

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100
Vietnamese people.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.610
VU TRAN: But how do you
reengage with something

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.367
like "Apocalypse Now" or
"Platoon," or "Deer Hunter"--

00:35:45.367 --> 00:35:46.950
the kinds of things
that are not going

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.580
to go away from the culture.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.150
How do you re-engage it,
especially if you had--

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.580
previous to this
new insight, you

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.310
had a positive
relationship with it?

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.890
I mean, I think a lot of
the response nowadays,

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.419
well, I'm canceling it out.

00:36:02.419 --> 00:36:03.960
It's a larger
question, too, but what

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.330
do you do with Woody
Allen, for example,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.470
now that you know what
you think you know?

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.700
Have you thought about it?

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.500
How should the culture--

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.950
if it sees a movie
like "Apocalypse

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.390
Now" in this new light, how
should it reengage with it?

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.920
Should it reject it completely?

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.169
VIET THANH NGUYEN: No, no, no.

00:36:24.169 --> 00:36:26.180
I have never gone out
there and said-- just

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.290
to use "Apocalypse Now" as an
example-- we shouldn't watch it

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.310
or we should ban it or
something like that.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.390
Never, never.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.437
My way to respond to it was to
make fun of it, to satirize it.

00:36:33.437 --> 00:36:35.520
There's a big chunk of the
novel "The Sympathizer"

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.810
that is basically a satirization
of "Apocalypse Now."

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.710
And it's a part of our culture,
canonical texts like this,

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.360
and we need to respond
to it like that.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.310
But it's a very
intimate question for me

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.360
because, for example,
I grew up a huge fan

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.980
of the "Tintin" comics.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.450
I don't know if any of you have
read "Tintin," for example.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:55.920
OK.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.128
I go back and I look at it
as an adult, and I'm like,

00:36:58.128 --> 00:37:01.400
oh, there's some racism
in the "Tintin" comics

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.350
that I enjoyed so much.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.235
But I actually have pretty much
bought the complete collection

00:37:08.235 --> 00:37:10.860
in French and in English for my
son, who's like five years old,

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.390
and we read it together.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.940
And I have to think about,
well, these are great stories.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.320
He's really into them.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.890
But he's also being exposed
to a certain idea about race

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.680
from the 1930s to the 1960s.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.200
And Hergé was a liberal.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.217
He had some liber--

00:37:26.217 --> 00:37:28.050
by the standards of the
day, he was actually

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.900
sympathetic to the colonized
and things like that.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.900
But there's no doubt
that visually, there

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.255
are some racist--

00:37:35.255 --> 00:37:39.030
what we would now consider to
be racist images in these books.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.780
And I send my son to a
school in which, apparently,

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.100
the year before he
enrolled, a parent got--

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.100
it's a French school, so
they're very intimately

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.690
aware of "Tintin."

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.856
A parent got so mad
about this issue

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:53.230
that she wanted to have "Tintin"
pulled from the shelves,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.590
and then she took her
kid out of the school.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.100
She was white, all right?

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.720
And I wouldn't do that.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.920
Because I think my
son, sooner or later,

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.200
is going to see these
kinds of images,

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.940
and I want to be the one to
expose them to him first.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:13.590
I don't want him to be
on a school playground

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.550
and have someone say
racist terms to him,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.630
or do racist gestures
or something like that.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.340
And then he's going to be all
confused and come home to me.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.180
That's probably going
to happen anyway.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.850
But these images are
already out there.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.220
We have to confront them.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.490
And so that's why I read
these books with him.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:34.894
And he'll look at it
and he'll say, oh,

00:38:34.894 --> 00:38:36.060
there's a black man in here.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.370
I'm like, that's a
very racist depiction

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.880
of a black man in here.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880
And he's five years old.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.740
He's not going to come back at
me with some kind of discourse

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.800
about this.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.700
But I know he's absorbing
it, so we have this capacity

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.769
to talk about that.

00:38:48.769 --> 00:38:50.310
And I think that's
what we have to do

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.200
with these kinds of stories.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:51.640
VU TRAN: Allow for
that confrontation.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.940
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah, right.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.320
VU TRAN: Before I give
it to audience questions,

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.290
I do want to ask you
about the book you're

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.960
writing-- you're working on
now, or at least the one book.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.330
I don't know if you're
working on multiple projects.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.580
But it's a sequel to
"The Sympathizer."

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.290
You're calling it
"The Committed."

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.807
Is that a pretty definite title?

00:39:09.807 --> 00:39:11.140
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Pretty close.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.310
VU TRAN: OK.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.520
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.590
VU TRAN: And you've
been working on it.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.090
It takes place in
Paris, and you've

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.310
been working on it in Paris.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.350
And I have a couple
of questions,

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:25.290
in terms of how your work
in fiction, in many ways,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:28.890
dramatizes many of the
ideas that you worked out

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.620
in your nonfiction works,
your critical works.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.250
And I wonder, working
on "The Committed,"

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.670
have you moved beyond
some of those ideas?

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.770
How have your ideas
evolved, especially

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:44.550
in light of the success
of "The Sympathizer"?

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.950
And how Paris has
affected it, actually

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.690
living there and working there.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.370
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
Well, like most of--

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:51.911
many people in this
room, probably, I

00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:54.450
have very romantic notions
of Paris and France,

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.460
and my wife and I spent
seven months there

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.520
on our honeymoon in 2003.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.605
And then, France is a
part of our heritage

00:40:02.605 --> 00:40:03.480
as Vietnamese people.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.130
We were colonized by the
French for 70 or 80 years.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.160
And so I wanted to
confront that heritage.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.987
And "The Sympathizer"
is about a guy

00:40:09.987 --> 00:40:11.570
who's half French
and half Vietnamese.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.610
So "The Committed," setting
that in Paris was an opportunity

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.540
to engage with that, and
deal with a country that

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.720
has a very different sense
of race and difference

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.310
in culture than the
United States does.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.220
And I wanted to
challenge myself,

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.690
and it has been challenging.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.020
Because the experience
of the French,

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.850
in regards to all
these things, is

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.790
so different than the Americans,
and even for the Vietnamese

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.680
who are in France.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.710
I go to France and I'm like,
racism, racism, racism.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.680
That's not racist.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.490
They were just being stupid.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.120
And the Vietnamese people
here are doing great.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.440
We're so well-adjusted.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.440
It's very hard to wrap--

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.880
VU TRAN: Wait, these are--

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.370
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
--my American mind--

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.660
VU TRAN: --these
are French saying

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.770
this, or Vietnamese French?

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.470
VIET THANH NGUYEN: French
people of Vietnamese descent.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.970
OK?

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.725
So they wouldn't say
French-Vietnamese

00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:00.600
or Vietnamese-French.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.260
They don't have hybrid
identities, supposedly.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.840
So it's a learning
experience for me

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.980
to try to figure out
how to acknowledge

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.430
the legitimacy of these
French perspectives,

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.430
and yet also be critical.

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.350
I can't help but be critical.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.980
And so the narrative
is partly about that.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.560
It's mostly about drugs
and sex and violence

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.570
in Paris of the early
1980s, and politics.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.330
But underlying all of that,
there is also a concern--

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.760
VU TRAN: But have you
found yourself questioning

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.450
your own stance on
certain things because

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:38.820
of these Vietnamese in Paris,
and their casual reaction

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.447
to racism?

00:41:39.447 --> 00:41:40.530
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I have.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:44.520
Because we're Americans.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.400
We're very used to how the
American system of differences

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.930
work here, right?

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.080
And it's a system that gives
us opportunities, but also

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.430
gives us traps.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.584
So I knew--

00:41:55.584 --> 00:41:57.750
I don't back away from being
Vietnamese as a writer.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.700
I say I'm a writer, but I also
say I'm a minority writer,

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:00.390
I'm a Vietnamese writer.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:01.870
I'm all these kinds of things.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.820
But I also knew that
the way by which I

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.520
am perceived in this country
is through being Vietnamese.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.712
And that the way
to tell my story--

00:42:10.712 --> 00:42:12.420
the story that people
expected me to tell

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.640
would be about Vietnam
or the Vietnam War,

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.310
and that's true for all
minorities in this country.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.070
We're only allowed one
historical experience

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.100
that the rest of the
country knows about.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.140
That's the opportunity,
and it's also the trap.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.060
Because then you're like,
oh, he's Vietnamese.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.060
He's going to write
about the Vietnam War.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.060
And so what I had to
do there was simply

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.080
to take up that opportunity,
but to do it on my own terms.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.750
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:37.470
VIET THANH NGUYEN: OK.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.886
So in France, the
difference would

00:42:38.886 --> 00:42:41.700
be that at least the
French would say,

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:47.790
that is a total trap to be
stuck on your own difference.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.610
You should, instead, try
to be universal, tell

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.380
the universal story.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.720
And I personally think "The
Sympathizer," for example,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.410
is a universal
story, but it's read

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.850
through a Vietnamese
history here.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.331
So I have to look
at France and think,

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:04.830
would I be different
if I was there?

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.140
Would I actually
simply be French?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.190
Would that be a possibility?

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.479
Do the French-- are they--

00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:12.270
do the French have
something that we don't?

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:16.140
Is it actually true that race
is not such a big deal there,

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.450
et cetera?

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.150
Personally, I don't think so.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.250
But I understand why
they think that way.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.440
And I want to acknowledge
that in the book,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.400
but also show how
it's also really

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.537
limited by the French
experience, as well.

00:43:32.537 --> 00:43:34.620
VU TRAN: Well, what people
don't realize sometimes

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.950
is that the universal is
actually very specific.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.075
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Exactly.

00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:39.360
VU TRAN: Yeah.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.300
It's not about getting everyone
to recognize themselves.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.180
It's about being specific
enough so that it resonates.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.458
We should have time
for audience questions.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.300
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.101
I'm Matt again.

00:43:56.101 --> 00:43:58.600
So I think your talk was really
interesting because I'm-- we

00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.820
were talking about this
earlier, during the tour,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.530
that I'm from the North Midwest.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.650
And part of my family, I have
several members that came back

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.969
from Vietnam with great uncles.

00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:08.760
And so you're [INAUDIBLE]
by this identity,

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.420
but they kind of
did the opposite.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.520
They assimilated in a very,
very, very non-diverse culture.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.130
And so I don't know when
you see people who do that,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.540
if you have certain views or
is that anti your own culture,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.730
or is that appropriate?

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.600
Just wanted to get
your thoughts on that.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.760
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
You're talking about--

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.900
so they're not white.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.566
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:30.780
They came back from Vietnam,
but rather than hold

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.310
on to any of their culture,
they completely gave it up

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.040
to become completely
American and mirror

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.415
the small communities
they're in.

00:44:36.415 --> 00:44:37.710
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:41.250
It's hard for me to say because
I had the luxury of growing up

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.770
in California, which
is obviously much more

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.350
diverse than North
Dakota, and San Jose

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.320
is the second-largest
Vietnamese population

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.630
in the United States.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.330
So if I was in that
situation, and I

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:55.950
was the one Vietnamese
person, or one

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.900
of a handful of Vietnamese
people in that environment,

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.983
or any kind of minority
that you're talking about,

00:44:59.983 --> 00:45:02.040
that's a survival
strategy to do that.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.890
It can't come without costs,
though, at the same time.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:12.711
So I've met more second
generation Vietnamese-Americans

00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.460
who've emerged out of
those circumstances,

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.240
and they migrated to a bigger
city or a more diverse state.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.610
And usually, they're
pretty regretful that they

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.620
were raised in that
kind of environment

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:28.020
where their history and their
specificity was denied to them.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.820
And the situation that
you're talking about

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.740
looks a lot more like France.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.350
Because most of the Vietnamese
I met there were like, well,

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.620
we ended up in a
place where there

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.700
is no other Vietnamese
people, so we had

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.720
no choice but to assimilate.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.070
They were OK with that
because that's the only option

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.660
that they really had.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.970
And then they became
assimilated, functional members

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.220
of French society and
everything like that.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.750
But at the price--

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.130
if it is a price--

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.610
of not feeling
comfortable associating

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.610
with other Vietnamese
or Asian people.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.690
I would see that as a cost.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:08.520
That wouldn't necessarily be
the case in France or in North

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.960
Dakota if people never left.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.490
So in other words, I don't want
to make a judgment about people

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.250
who don't have any
other option when

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.571
they're put in that situation.

00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:19.695
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:46:19.695 --> 00:46:21.260
[INAUDIBLE] That
makes perfect sense.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.010
VIET THANH NGUYEN: But
the culture that we

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:25.020
do share, though, is
something like Hollywood.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.370
We all have Hollywood, right?

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.860
So that's what the issue
of narrative scarcity

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.070
and narrative
plenitude is about.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.810
You could be the only
Vietnamese person

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.870
in North Dakota, or
that particular city,

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.710
and if you don't see yourself
at all in mainstream culture,

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.940
you're encouraged to
forget your differences.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.300
But what if that mainstream
culture was different?

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.160
You could still be the only
Vietnamese person in that

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.440
particular place, but if you
had access to all these books

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.550
and all these movies and
so on-- all these stories--

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.310
it would completely
change your perception

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.774
of who you are out there.

00:46:58.587 --> 00:46:59.420
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.110
Thank you for coming
and joining us.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.390
My name is Nelson.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.439
My question is, I'm Cuban.

00:47:04.439 --> 00:47:05.480
I was born on the island.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.730
I grew up in Miami,
which is basically Cuba.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:12.260
But outside of
that area in Miami,

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.000
what I come across
in conversations

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.550
when I meet someone and they
figure out, or I tell them,

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.340
that I'm Cuban is older
generations immediately

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.040
think of Cold War, communism.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.450
Younger generations just go
immediately to tourism, food,

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:27.650
maybe.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:33.050
I'm just curious, seeing
parallel situations

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:35.930
between Vietnam,
maybe in a more--

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.390
for lack of a better word, a
violent history with the US,

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.940
but kind of similar with
communism and the struggles

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.819
they had there, do you find
a more nuanced conversation

00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.860
when you meet people when
you talk about Vietnam?

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.370
Or is it basically sticking to
what older generations think

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:51.450
about Vietnam and what
younger generations think

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.219
about Vietnamese food
or going to visit

00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:55.760
the Vietnamese part
of a neighborhood

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.077
and eating banh mis, or
whatever it might be?

00:47:59.077 --> 00:48:00.660
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
It's a big country,

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.820
so there's so many different
experiences that people have.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.810
So when I go to speak
to college campuses,

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:12.680
it's a very different experience
than going to Palm Springs

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.720
and speaking to a
retirement community,

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.550
or going to Idaho, which
is 87% or 89% white.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.470
So I can sort of feel
the differences there,

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.737
in terms of responses.

00:48:22.737 --> 00:48:25.070
So when I'm on a college
campus and the people are young

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.900
and they're diverse,
and they're obviously

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.710
being college educated,
the level of responses

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:30.650
is really different.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:33.260
Because they already know about
pho and banh mi and all this,

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.090
and they're hungry for these
more nuanced statements

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:41.340
about what America is, and
what our stories should be.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:49.510
For example, if I
go to Palm Springs--

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.730
just to use that example--

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.440
and the average age is like
60 or 70 in the audience,

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.030
it's a totally
different experience.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.760
It is more like what
you're talking about.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:08.890
The notions of awareness of
the stories that we're talking

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:12.130
about is much more limited.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.490
So for example, I
went to Palm Springs.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:19.090
First question from
the audience was--

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.080
this was several months ago--

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.000
have you seen that new
Ken Burns documentary

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.493
about the Vietnam War?

00:49:26.493 --> 00:49:26.992
OK?

00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:32.035
And in my mind, I was like,
that's an 18-hour documentary.

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:33.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.420
I don't have 18 hours.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.500
And if you have 18 hours
to watch a documentary,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.080
you have enough time to read
a book by a Vietnamese person.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.790
Because whoever asked me
that question-- whenever

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:44.665
that question came up
in audiences like that,

00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:47.050
they had never read a book
by a Vietnamese person,

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.090
or seen a movie from a
Vietnamese point of view.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:53.380
So it's a radically
different set

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.050
of experiences from one end
of the country to the next.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.270
I went to Clemson University.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.884
First question from
the audience was

00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:01.300
a guy who looked
like he literally

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.610
was a Confederate
veteran, and it

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.210
was about the Confederacy, which
had nothing to do with my talk.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:11.585
So the beauty and the challenge
of a country like this

00:50:11.585 --> 00:50:13.960
is that you will have people
who know exactly what you're

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.501
talking about, and
you'll have people

00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:17.380
who have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.160
And again, what we're doing with
trying to expand our stories

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.990
and our narratives
is to eventually get

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.364
to all of these
different people.

00:50:24.364 --> 00:50:27.639
But also, especially, to the
next generation, as well.

00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:28.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.430
Thank you so much for speaking.

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:32.560
As a Nigerian-- a person
who was born in Nigeria--

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.140
I can definitely hear my story
and my parental experience

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.276
reflected in a lot
of what you say,

00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:38.650
although Nigerians
are a bit more

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:42.290
invisible, in the sense of how
we blend into American society.

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.950
But what I hear a lot
about writing from you

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.670
is this idea of the
need for vulnerability.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.800
So in order to
really tell the story

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.350
that you want to
tell in your books,

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.560
you have to face the idea
that you're not necessarily

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.930
going to talk about the
Vietnamese experience in a way

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.340
that people expect.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:03.460
So I just want to know, what
influences did you have,

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.040
as far as books that you read,
experiences that you had,

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.440
that allowed you to step
fully into that state

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.110
of vulnerability
as a writer, young

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.850
and then moving through your
career, that kind of shaped

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.850
the way you thought about,
these are the stories

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.340
that I'm going to tell,
regardless of what people think

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.548
that I should be talking
about, or what they're going

00:51:20.548 --> 00:51:22.660
to try to engage me
on, even though it

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.460
has nothing to do with
my book or the talk

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.229
that I came to give.

00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:28.270
VIET THANH NGUYEN: One of
my writing instructors,

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.940
when I was in college,
Bharati Mukherjee

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.290
read one of my short stories.

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.800
And he said, you're not cutting
close enough to the bone.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.640
I was like 19 or 20.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.360
I was like, what does that mean?

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.960
If it literally means cutting
to the bone, I can do that.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.944
Taking a knife to
cut yourself is OK,

00:51:42.944 --> 00:51:44.610
and most writers would
do that, I think.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.150
If you could get a good
story by cutting yourself,

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:47.608
you would totally
do it, all right?

00:51:47.608 --> 00:51:49.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.090
But what she meant, I
think, was that I wasn't

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.020
getting vulnerable enough.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.430
I wasn't going
deep enough inside.

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.935
That's really hard to do.

00:51:58.935 --> 00:52:02.440
Because I think most of
us don't want to do that.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.840
We've built up these protections
against the things that

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.790
have hurt us, the things
that make us most vulnerable,

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.665
in order to function.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.534
And I didn't know how to do
that as a person or as a writer.

00:52:13.534 --> 00:52:14.950
And you asked for
a list of books,

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:16.040
and I can give you a ton.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:20.244
All great books are about
writers getting vulnerable,

00:52:20.244 --> 00:52:21.910
whether they're
autobiographical or not.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:24.990
You may not see the mechanism
in operation, but maybe--

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:27.240
I don't know if you feel
this way, but to be a writer,

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.050
you have to be
vulnerable to yourself.

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:31.490
Because the experience
that matters

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.280
the most is not going out
there and chopping lumber

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.655
or working in a nail salon,
or whatever-- or going to war

00:52:36.655 --> 00:52:38.290
to accumulate experience.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:40.960
The most important experience
is your emotional experience.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.376
That's what you
draw from in order

00:52:42.376 --> 00:52:45.090
to imbue feeling into your work.

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.620
So Toni Morrison, let's
say, writes "Beloved."

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:50.130
She was not a slave.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.480
She had to somehow find those
emotions within herself.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.970
So I don't know what emotional
journey she undertook.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.010
In my case, the stories
that I had to confront

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.920
were not the stories in books,
although I read a lot of those.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.957
The story I had to
confront was my own,

00:53:02.957 --> 00:53:05.290
to confront my own family's
refugee experience, confront

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:07.090
my own refugee experience.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.270
Stuff that I had lived through,
that we had lived through,

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.485
that I had just--

00:53:11.485 --> 00:53:15.040
I had never forgotten them, but
I had sort of steeled them off,

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.530
and not felt those emotions.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.920
That was difficult
to go back there,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.410
and to look at
those experiences.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.870
There's no one who can teach you
how to do that except for maybe

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.560
your therapist.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.654
But in my case, it was--

00:53:36.654 --> 00:53:38.070
thank god I never
saw a therapist.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.040
I had to do it through
my writing instead.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.790
So hopefully, that
answers the question.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:47.640
SPEAKER 1: We have
one final question.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.215
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:48.215 --> 00:53:50.790
I have a question in 20
parts, so this is great.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:53.970
So my name is Andy [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:57.390
I'm a first-generation
Vietnamese-American, born here

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.557
in Chicago.

00:53:58.557 --> 00:54:00.390
And I actually wanted
to talk to both of you

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:04.320
about your view of ethnic
enclaves, I'll call them.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.510
So growing up in Chicago,
I actually didn't grew up

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.480
in Argyle, or Vietnamese
people call it "Ah-guy."

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.140
That's where the
Vietnamese area is.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.490
VU TRAN: And "Chi-kah-go."

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:14.323
AUDIENCE: It's true.

00:54:14.323 --> 00:54:15.817
And "Chi-kah-go," yeah.

00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:17.400
And so I grew up
kind of away from it.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.640
So we would come
here and think, wow,

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.440
there's 1,000 Vietnamese people.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.620
So cool.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.860
And then, when I was
18 or 20 or something,

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.270
I went to Westminster,
and I was blown away.

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.750
It was like Vietnamese
flags everywhere.

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.360
I thought I was in
Vietnam, frankly.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.140
So I wanted to get your
POV because I'm torn.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.620
Because there is the power of
having all of the people in one

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.460
place, but that also breeds
different types of prejudices.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.100
There are areas in
Vietnamese towns

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.820
where there's just a lot
of prejudice in the area.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:55.080
So I was going to say, what
do you think the balance is?

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.905
My wife and I went to Paris and
there is different types of--

00:54:58.905 --> 00:55:01.480
you don't really see all these
Vietnamese all in one place

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.240
because they have a
different sense to identity.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.985
So just your POV would be great.

00:55:07.985 --> 00:55:10.240
VU TRAN: Well, I can
only speak for myself.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.730
I feel like I have to constantly
fight the need to be special

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:19.050
because I grew up in Oklahoma.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.670
I was the only Vietnamese
person I ever saw.

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.004
And yes, that comes with
feeling like an outsider

00:55:25.004 --> 00:55:25.920
and feeling alienated.

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.130
But also, I always had a
feeling of specialness,

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:31.620
too, if that makes sense.

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.150
And when you start
engaging with your--

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:38.300
when I start engaging with
Vietnamese communities,

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.650
I had to fight that urge--

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.780
that desire to be special.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:46.290
And it made me try to break
down what that actually means,

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.700
and why I felt the
need to have it,

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.950
and what was the cost of that.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:55.950
That's been my
experience with it.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.150
I'm only now engaging more
with the Vietnamese community.

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:04.770
And it's brought perspectives
to me that I've never had.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.142
I'm 43.

00:56:07.142 --> 00:56:08.850
It's very meaningful
to me, but I'm still

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:13.440
finding that need to be the only
Asian person in the room, which

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.212
is weird that I
would even want that.

00:56:16.212 --> 00:56:17.670
VIET THANH NGUYEN:
Well, to pick up

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:20.320
on one element of
what you said, Andy--

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.650
maybe the implication
of what you're saying--

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:26.167
Vietnamese people
can be racist, too.

00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:27.750
And a matter of fact,
they're pretty--

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:28.690
we're pretty racist.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:29.190
OK?

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.940
Just judging from--

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:30.270
VU TRAN: Very much so.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.850
VIET THANH NGUYEN: --from
the comments that I hear

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:34.710
in Vietnamese, in
Vietnamese-language

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.450
communities, and so on--

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:39.990
the casual racism, the
deeply embedded prejudices

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.040
that people have.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.870
What it goes to show
is that it doesn't

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:44.565
matter if you are a minority.

00:56:44.565 --> 00:56:46.440
Just because you've been
the victim of racism

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.690
doesn't mean you can't
be a racist yourself.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:50.400
And as a matter of
fact, oftentimes you

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.530
are a racist yourself.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:57.330
These are the unfortunate
dynamics of human experience.

00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:59.944
And what that meant for
me, both as a writer,

00:56:59.944 --> 00:57:02.110
but also as someone who's
Vietnamese and someone who

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.440
thinks about politics
and political stories,

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:08.290
is that my commitment
as a writer is twofold.

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:10.920
One is that it is certainly
to the Vietnamese community,

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.570
and to tell our stories
and all that kind of thing.

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:17.250
But the second obligation
is to truth and justice,

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:18.960
to use these grand words.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.280
And if your community is
doing something wrong,

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.950
you need to stand up against it.

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:28.230
That's the role of the writer.

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:30.450
The role of the
writer is complex.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:34.590
It's both to represent,
but it's also to oppose.

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:37.324
And again, the dynamics of being
a minority in this country,

00:57:37.324 --> 00:57:39.240
or any country, oftentimes,
is you feel simply

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.430
the desire to represent.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.150
We've been misrepresented.

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.810
There's not been
enough representation.

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.290
Therefore, we have to represent.

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.550
But again, if your community
is doing something wrong,

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:53.400
you have to represent that.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.900
Now, that is the real
challenge, I think.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:01.320
And if we think of
ourselves as Americans,

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.060
many American writers do
not go out there thinking

00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.510
we have to represent America.

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.930
That's not the first thing
that most American writers

00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:11.350
or artists are thinking about.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.700
They're thinking, my first
obligation is to the art,

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:15.760
and then it's to the
truth and justice.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.942
And it's oftentimes in
opposition to America itself.

00:58:18.942 --> 00:58:21.150
Either America, in terms of
what it's doing overseas,

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:24.750
or America, what's happening
wrong within our country today,

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:26.550
whatever that happens to be.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.370
That's part of what it means
to be a part of the majority.

00:58:29.370 --> 00:58:31.650
And that's also, if you're
a minority writer, that's

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.210
what you have to do, as well.

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:38.245
You cannot feel that your
first obligation is only

00:58:38.245 --> 00:58:40.620
to your ethnicity or your
culture or something like that.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.900
That's part of it, but
the first obligations

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.720
are to your principles,
your art, truth, justice,

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.960
things like that.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.340
And so that's part
of, I think, what's

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.450
going to happen with something
like Vietnamese-American

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:57.260
writing and so on.

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.010
They have to depict
those kinds of things.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:01.380
They have to depict both
the beauty of Little Saigon,

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.930
but also, of course, the
fact that it's a deeply--

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.900
it's almost a fascistic
community out there.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:13.350
And you step out of line,
they will get in your face,

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.990
and make sure you
don't say another word.

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:18.510
Thank you very much, Google,
for coming out today.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:21.860
[APPLAUSE]
