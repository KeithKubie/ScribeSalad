00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; Edward Ayers will kick off
the Collections as Data Stories

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.390
with History Between the Lines
thinking about collections as Data.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.620
Ed is the Tucker-Boatwright
Professor of Humanities

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.140
and the President Emeritus of
the University of Richmond.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.250
President Barack Obama awarded
him the National Humanities Medal

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.150
in 2013 for his dedication
to public history.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.600
Over his decades of work Ed
has tried to find new ways

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.000
to connect people with
the American past.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.880
Current projects include the
BackStory Podcast, bunkhistory.org,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.330
the American Civil War Museum,
and serving as President

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.880
of the Organization of
American Historians.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.270
Please welcome Ed Ayers.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.570
[Applause]

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.870
&gt;&gt; Edward Ayers: Good morning.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.570
Good to see everybody.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.590
So I've been asked to cover several
decades of digital assessments.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.740
I've been at this for
several decades.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.500
And you might think I'd
have it figured out by now,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.550
but I don't because the
frontier keeps moving on us.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.520
And it's really exciting to think

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.030
about where we are
and where we've been.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700
And I think the revolution
that we're living

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.510
through now began before
the digital, though.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.810
I think it actually began, this is
a dangerous thing to say in front

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.860
of people who actually
know the truth on this,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.630
but there's no Q&amp;A right now so you
can't challenge me at this second.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.010
I believe that the
revolution actually began

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.610
with the microfilm revolution in
the 1930s and the 40s and the 50s

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170
when we unlocked this remarkable
technology that will allow us

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.600
to have all the newspapers
in American history

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.560
that would have the
United States Census,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.300
all these bountiful documents
available to researchers anywhere

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.680
for a relatively small cost.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.770
And even though microfilm
seems distinctly unsexy today,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.010
it was my introduction not only

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.410
to all things digital
but to history itself.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.110
I wasn't sure what I wanted to do
even when I was in graduate school.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.570
But one day I went
into the microform room

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.690
and started reading newspapers
on one of those big sort

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.080
of World War II era gray steel
things with the cranks on it.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.080
And there in front of me I
saw something remarkable.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.610
These newspapers demonstrated
something that I had not realized.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.110
People didn't know what was
going to happen the next day.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.130
And all this stuff was
happening at the same time.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.730
That you would see on one page the
news I recognized in the textbooks,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.230
and then on all the other
pages beneath all kinds

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.530
of fascinating things, evolution
of life before our very eyes.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.350
And I realized that's what I'm
interested in is all that resonance

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.170 position:56%
and interaction, that space between
the lines, that sense of possibility

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.720
that was on every screen of
that old scratched microfilm

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.820
on that archaic device.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.150
So I wrote my dissertation
partly on that.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.190
And when I became a teacher I
said, you know, it would be fun

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.640
to introduce all these young
people to the glories of microfilm.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.340
And so I sent them into the
microforms room in front

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.530
of these machines and they
were completely addled.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.030
This is in the 80s.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.410
And the entire assignment was read
a year of this newspaper and write

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.680
about something interesting in it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.080
And all the pre-meds and people

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.380
in the classroom were
just freaking out.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.140
But what's the assignment?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.440
That is the assignment.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.740
What's the question?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.300
That's for you to find
out and to answer it.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.700
And the course evaluations come
back at the end of the semester

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.420
and they said, well, we
didn't like Ayers that much,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.000
but seeing history raw was one
of the most exciting things

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.870
that I've done in my
college education.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.520
So I already knew that that magic,
that power lay in that medium.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.280
One day I was in the library

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.650
and I saw a gleaming black
NeXT machine in 1990.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.650
And I saw that as amazing as it
seemed at that time that images

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.300
of microfilm and census and letters
and diaries and maps could be seen

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.180
on a computer screen in color.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.830
Now, the web didn't exist
yet but look at that.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.860
So friends of mine in
the library told me

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.740
about a magical thing called SGML.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.920
I'm pandering to the
librarians in the room,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.830
so Standard Generalized Markup
Language, or as we called it,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.750
Sounds Good, Maybe Later.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.510
And we saw in that a
way to build something

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.760
that would identify all
these different objections

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.340
in the collections and
connect them with each other.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.480
So I had this idea, hey, we have
this capacity, what do you say

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.980
that we share with people
who don't have access

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.920
to a major resource library,
who don't have a bank

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.680
of microfilm readers or microfilm,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.580
a way to get that excitement
for themselves.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.410
Now, we didn't have any idea of
how we would distribute that,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.940 position:56%
some kind of tape, some kind of hard
devices, but we started building it.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940
And then one day a
friend called me down

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.390
and said you need to see this, Ed.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.070
Here's something they're calling
the World Wide Web, and it's based

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.200
on a baby version of SGML.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.570
We could make what
they're calling a site

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.980
for this World Wide
Web pretty quickly.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.280
And so we did.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.290 position:56%
And so we were out there at the
very beginning before we were ready,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.060
before we had really any
idea what we were doing.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.340
But what we did know is that
suddenly if you had plenty

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.210 position:56%
of patience you could watch an image
of a newspaper very slowly appear

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.460
on your screen over
that 2400 baud modem.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.120
And people liked it and
the letters and docs.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.900
So we started building a mountain.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.930
And we built this first project
that many of you may have heard of,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.230
The Valley of the Shadow.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.450
The short version of it is
every piece of information

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.670
about every person who lived
in a northern community

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.570
and a southern community throughout
the entire American Civil War.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.150
It really does exist.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.300
And you see what we did
is we emulated an archive.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.760 position:56%
And this was really, really hard to
build, it took us 14 years to do it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.090
Because what we were
doing is transcribing

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.550
by hand 10,000 pages of newspapers.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.850
And these convenient things
called pdf files didn't exist

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.150
when we started.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.530 position:56%
So we actually had to write a script

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.150
to show a group 4 fax
TIFF compression image

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.130
to be able to disseminate those.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.950
And then many, many thousands of
letters and diaries and all this.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.630
And this came out in the mid 90s.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.800
And then in 2003 I wrote
an analog book about it.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.160
At the beginning it says, by
the way, this is based entirely

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.760
on additional archive that you can
see every source that I've used.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.970
And that came out in 2003.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.250 position:56%
And then I became Dean of Arts and
Sciences at UVA, and then I left UVA

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.750
to become President at Richmond.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.250
And when I did, this is important
for all things we're talking

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.350
about today, University of Virginia
rather than being mad at me, said,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.880
wow, we've been happy to oversee
in the library the creation

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.000
of this big thing, what do you say
that we make sure that if Ed, say,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.730
gives a talk at the Library
of Congress in 2017 ten years

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.640
from now that it still works.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.860
Or that he writes volume two
out of The Valley of the Shadow

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.250
which I just did at bookstores
near you in October, The Thin Light

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.370
of Freedom, and here's the thing.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.020
I sat there and hit on this thing
as hard as I could for a year

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.970
and a half after it
hadn't been touched

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.230
for seven years and it still works.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.600 position:56%
That's because of the people at the
University of Virginia who went back

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.930
through and checked every linked
and made sure it all still works.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.830
That's important because
sometimes we wonder if the things

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.570
that we are making in this
digital environment are going

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.930
to endure the way that the
things, even microfilm,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.020
which I believe is right
there with cockroaches

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.480 position:56%
in durability is it going to endure?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.190
So The Valley of the
Shadows shows that it can.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.310
And I think that's important.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.060
But there are other things.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.100
When I left Virginia I
said, you know, okay,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.230
transcribing by hand an entire
intentional archive that was fun.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.900
But what do you say
that we take advantage

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:33.660
of all the pre-digitized sources
that have emerged since 1993

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.760
when we started The
Valley of the Shadow.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.710
I bet there are lots of things
that we could put to immediate use.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.690
When I went to the University
of Richmond I was a part

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.470 position:56%
of founding the Digital Scholarship
Lab where we have many new projects.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.670
And one of which is
American Panorama

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.090
which is a digital atlas
of American History.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.320
And the idea there was let's take
advantage of, say, two of these.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.530
This is the forced
migration of enslaved people.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.770
And I really do want to explore it.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.040
And what it does is based
on the United States Census

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.320 position:56%
which is already in machine readable
form, let's make a kind of map

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.580
of the slave trade and the
movement of African-American people

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.150
across the vast expanse
of the American South.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.350
The idea was to see things
that we could not see before

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.480
but that were already hidden
between the lines of the data.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.050
Being able to see the
areas of the south

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.010
that were losing enormous
numbers of people and others

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.230
who were gaining enormous numbers.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.230
And we built all this with
an open source set of tools

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.670
that can be shared
with other people.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.590
Other people can make these maps.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.420
And I would say that when I say
we I don't literally mean me.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.870
I mean my colleagues, Rod Nelson
[assumed spelling], Justin Madron

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.740
and Nate Ayers [assumed
spelling] who made these projects

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:06.190
and are tapping into the capacities
of collections we already have.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.070
The other one that we made was
the foreign-born population

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:14.980
of the United States
from 1850 to 2010.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:20.540
And in this case to
be able to see --

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.240 position:56%
okay, that gives you an idea of
what it looks like, and we can click

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.260
on a county, and it will show you
all the places that all the people

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.150
in that place came
from in that year.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.290
So what you'll see is that
we are displaying data

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.560
in four or five different ways.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.800
There's the very slow where
the people are coming from,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.870
and it will send out tendrils
into all these places.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.300
Back on the foreign- born --

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.190
I mean on the forced migration map
we could have clicked on thing,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.760
and it would have had
the narratives of people

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.120
who were swept up in all of this.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.420
So here's something.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:57.010
We were able to make a map
that got widespread attention

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.840
from sources that already exist.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.940
And we're able to make
these with some speed now.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.050 position:56%
And one we had last year and, again,
since I didn't make I can brag

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.340
on it, was named one of the
15 top maps in the world

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.630
by National Geographic
about mapping inequalities,

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.990 position:56%
a collaborative project of Richmond,
Johns Hopkins and the University

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.290
of Maryland, Virginia Tech,
too, to show how it was

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.500
that segregation became baked
into our culture and maps

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.530
of over 150 American cities.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.420
We have a new map coming
out about urban development

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.570
that will map all the information,
a lot of it here from Washington,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.290
about how it was that our cities

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.620
that we all know including very
small ones were transformed

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:47.160
in the 1960s by building
interstates through them

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.570
and bulldozing substandard housing
and all those kinds of things.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.990
So all these had the same idea
as The Valley of the Shadow.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.130
There is all this enormous
power within our reach

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.690
that we can make visible.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.490
We had these numbers about
where people came from

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.680
and all these places every year,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.570
but if you can't see it you don't
really know what it possesses.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.000
And my dream, too, is that
every middle school kid

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.170
in America will be able to
click on her county and see how

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.290
that has evolved over the
course of American history.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.810
To see that the United States has
always been together of people

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.280
from a broad range of places.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.980
The things we're talking about
today are just the latest stage

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.310
in a very long conversation.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.320
So with the American Panorama
Digital Scholarship Lab,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.570 position:56%
the idea there is kind of The Valley
of the Shadow turned wrong side out.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.250
Instead of taking an
archive that's scattered all

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.460
around peoples' attics,
neglected and making it visible

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.140 position:56%
which was a worthy thing to do, what
do you say that we take advantage

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.990
of enormous resources
that have been created

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.260
and making things machine readable?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.410
But that still didn't have
the newspapers I was dreaming

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.670
of over at my computer now.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.890
So maybe switch back
to the HP and see --

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.810
the network is doing funny things
with me here, so can you go back

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.040
to that and see if we can
get Reconstructing Virginia?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.340
Yes, we can.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.840
So you remember how much trouble
it was for people to set there

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.350
and read newspapers on microfilm,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.340
transcribe from scratch all the
articles, write a summary of them.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.980
Well, thanks to Chronicling America
there are over 2,000 newspapers

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.920
and millions of pages that
have already been digitized.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.260
What could we do with
that instead of just sort

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.640
of reading them in analog form?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.960
Well, using a Mecca [phonetic]
from our friends at George Mason

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.520
and 16 eager first year students
at the University of Richmond,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.430
and the Virginia Chronicle
which is the Virginia version

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.830
of Chronicling America, we said
let's go in and make visible

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.850
to the world the leading newspaper

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.280
in Virginia during this tumultuous
period of reconstruction.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:24.320
And so in one semester using
the expertise of Chris Kemp

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.290
in the library at the University of
Richmond we were able to transcribe

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:34.250
or actually correct 2,000 articles,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.030
and you can see what each
one of them looks like.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.860
And each student took
responsibility.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.710
Most of the transcription
had already been done by OCR,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.680
but they needed to be corrected.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.330
So they went back in
and corrected them.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.100
Then in sort of a form of crowd
sourcing contributed those back

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.360
into the archive making the
archive better while using it.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.180 position:56%
And we have elaborate time lines and
lots of different ways to see this.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.180
Basically in three months we did
probably what would take us three

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.830
years back on The Valley
of the Shadow

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.590
by using open source software,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.500
things that have already been
digitized, existing standards,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.620
a plug in, you see the time line
there is a plug in for a Mecca,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.880
we were able with freshmen
to do something

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.880
that had been almost impossible
just a few years before.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.100
We did an installation of this

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.490
at the Black History
Museum in Richmond.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.900
We did a preview of that.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.650
And so I had these
kids showing visitors

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.190
to the museum what it could do.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.260 position:56%
And we got together the next morning
and I said, well, how was that?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.290
And they said they wanted to know
if we were graduate students.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.630
We said, no, we're 19.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:51.980
And when we think about what a
collective effort to unlock all

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.390
of the power in these newspapers
by looking at them as articles,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.880
restoring the article structures
and the argument structure

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.830
and it's still a summary,
and then synthesizing them

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.480
into a week I think we're just at
the beginning of really seeing all

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.790
that Chronicling America can do.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.890
So all that's good, too.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.380
And we're getting ready to do
the Richmond Planet this fall,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.600
one of the leading
African-American newspapers

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.910
around the turn of the century.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:25.430
So I believe I need to go back
to the Mac now if I could.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.470
I'm trying to make maximum use
of the incredible facilities here

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.660 position:56%
at the Library of Congress and I am.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.560
So this is what we're
working on now.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.210
This is something called Bunk.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.870
And it's named after
the Henry Ford quote

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.450
that history is more or less bunk.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.360
Well, of course, we
don't think it is.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.660
And he has this other thing.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.960
He says the only history

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.440
that matters is the
history we make today.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.130
And what we think what matters a
lot is the history, the writing

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.510
and thinking about the history
that we are making today.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.070
I'm seeing some of you
pointing at the screen.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.370
That's awesome.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.030
That suggests that we're
engaging you already.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.330
What is this?

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:03.690 position:56%
We're curating everyday, all
representations of the American past

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.590
in all media and then putting them
in conversation with each other.

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:10.650
And this is not quite out yet.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.590
This will debut very soon.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:18.270
And we hope that you'll sign up for
Bunk Mail, the weekly newsletter.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.230
And it's about the same thing
that I had the idea back

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.770
in graduate school in the 1970s.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.260
Matter of fact you'll see
that I only had one idea

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.010
in my life actually which is,
hey, there's cool stuff here,

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.510
I wish other people could see it.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.770 position:56%
And maybe if I put it right in front
of you on your phone you would.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.180
And that the interesting stuff
is the connections in between.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.400
So what this does, Bunk we
are tagging all these things

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.930
as they come out.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.280
And you'll say this is a portrait
from the Library of Congress.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.490
But some of these things
are coming from the Atlantic

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.900
or the Washington Post, but
they're also coming from blogs

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.140
that people wouldn't
have seen otherwise.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.670
Or they're coming from
scholarly literature.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.830
Or they're coming from
newspapers and magazines

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.400
across the political spectrum that
don't talk to each other very much.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.780
And they're also coming and making
-- and here's the point of Bunk.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.320
That you realize that
there's history all around us.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.340
People on airplanes tell me,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.540
I'm [inaudible] I'm sitting
there grading papers or something

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.360
and they say, so, are
you a history teacher?

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.660
And I say, yeah.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.830
And they say, yeah, I
always hated history.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.130
All those names and dates.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.420
And I say, yeah, I know but
that's not what history is.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.720
And it's not really that.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.020
It's not just tests.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.480
And they don't realize that we're
saturated in representations

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.530
of the past all the time.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.660
So what Bunk is trying to do
is to make us realize that most

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.750
of our movies and television shows
unless they're science fiction are

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.720
history, are based on history.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.810
Most of them are navigating through
the complexities of our own time,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.950
are often looking for
historical coordinates.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.990
So here's Frederick
Douglass as a refugee.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.240
And you can see so that the first
link there is about the Civil War,

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.960
but the next is about
other refugees, Anne Frank.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.890
And then you can also see, okay,
now let's think about what happened

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.370
to insulate people
after emancipation.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.820
Here's a hidden history
of Juneteenth.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.000
And so this is Greg
Downs on Talking Point.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.030
So part of my instinct on all
this is why it is that there is

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.570
so much wonderful history being
written in so many venues,

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.140 position:56%
we've never touched more people with
American history than right now.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.830
But there's so much of it suddenly
in so many forms and so many media

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.760
that we can't really
see it as a whole.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.770
So Bunk is trying to do -- tried to
do with The Valley of the Shadow,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.140
tried to do with the
Digital Scholarship Lab,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.540
which is to gather the
power in collections

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.040
and then share them with the world.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.180
Now, one thing about this
you'll see share connection.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.500
So if you click on the
social media button

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.740
when this is actually available --
of course I realize that people are

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.740
out there with all kinds of laptops
now, who knows it may be available

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.750
at this very moment for all I know,
but I don't mean for it to be.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.300
It's going to be so much
more awesome pretty soon.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.150
But if you clicked on the
social media or the email,

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.450
what it says is look at this
cool connection I found on Bunk.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.290
It's the two things and the
relationship between them.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.110
And it's up to you to say isn't
that amazing how Frederick Douglass

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.660
and Anne Frank we think
of them both as refugees.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.870
Or look at the conversations
all about monuments.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.240
What were people saying about
this 15 years ago to be able

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.160
to understand that with some depth?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.290
So the idea is that people
will be their own curators.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.670
We'll tag all this.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.540
We describe it as it's
like wrapping each

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.160
of these entries like a protein.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.350
It can connect in lots
of different ways.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.750
The Frederick Douglass thing it's

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.630
about African-American
history, it's about slavery.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.570
It's also about refugees,
but it's also

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.900
about other kinds of
connections as well.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.130
So the back end that we've
built is allowing the students

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.460
at the University of Richmond
to help us tag all these things

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.020
so they can talk to other kinds of
things, so that we can recognize

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.820
that we live in history
the way we live in oxygen.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.680
That it is everywhere all the time

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.370
and that we can see
it in cool new ways.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.090
So in many ways my
inspiration through all

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.500
of this has been a guy
names Vannevar Bush

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:42.600
who in 1945 invented a
machine that was going

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.810
to revolutionize everything.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.110
Picture this.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.680
First of all you wear a walnut
size camera on your forehead.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.490
And then you have the
shutter running down your arm.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.160
And when you see something
cool you click it

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.240
and it takes a picture of it.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.470
And you're able to add that
archive that you're making

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.540
with all the archive of microfilm.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.240
And he calculates that if you
added up the entire written record

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.650
of humans in 1945 it would
be in the billions he said.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.550
But we could reduce this,
just extrapolating a bit

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.100
from current technologies and micro
photography into a moving van.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.410
And [inaudible] he said would
cost a nickle and would sit

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.050
on a tiny corner of your desk.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.540
And the device that would hold
all this together, the memex,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.340
would be a series of microfilm
screens that you'd call up in front

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.600
of you, and you'd see the
connection you wanted to make,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.720
then you'd take a picture of it.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.890
And then you would have
added to the network

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.420
of knowledge and information.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:51.860
Well, microfilm as awesome as it
is did not end up doing all that.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.600
Could not foresee obviously
the invention

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.520
of the digital technologies
that make all that possible.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.730
But he imagined in 1945 that there
would be a new profession of people

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:08.590
who make connections, of people
who are trailblazers he said

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:14.780
who will find all of the excitement
and the drama and the meaning

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.210
in the history between the lines.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.460
And that's what we're
still trying to do.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.870
And I hope all of you will
join that exciting adventure.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.090
The Library of Congress
makes it possible.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:29.040
A lot of these things are based on
the treasures that have been saved.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.250 position:56%
I like to think for just this moment
and how lucky we are to be at a time

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.090
where we have whole new ways
of envisioning this legacy.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.010
So thank you very much
and have a great day.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.000
[ Applause ]

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.220

of the Library of Congress.
