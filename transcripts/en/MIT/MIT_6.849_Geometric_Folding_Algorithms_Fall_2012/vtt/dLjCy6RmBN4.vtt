00:00:03.707 --> 00:00:05.540
PROFESSOR: I'm excited
about today's lecture

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.050
because there's so
many fun topics.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.790
This is like many fun
things all in one lecture.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.790
We're going to start with a
cool little problem, which

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.480
is about unfolding
and re-folding.

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:27.030
You could think
of them-- they're

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.900
kind of like hinged
dissections although they're

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.480
from between surfaces
of polyhedra.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.980
You can also think of
them as common unfoldings.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.841
So general idea is,
you have over here

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:56.090
in the left team you have
unfoldings-- polygons,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.640
let's say.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.572
Possible things that
could fold into polyhedra.

00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:04.934
And we'll think convex again.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.775
And when we were
thinking about unfolding,

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:11.650
we we're thinking about
going this direction.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.230
When we were thinking
about folding,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.850
we were thinking
about this direction.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.720
But what if we do
both repeatedly?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.290
So I start, say, with a cube.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.069
And then I unfold it
and then I re-fold it.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.110
That's sort of what the
metamorphosis of the cube

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.060
was about.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.143
And then I unfold
that and I re-fold it,

00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.860
and I unfold and I re-fold
and I unfold and re-fold.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.520
This is a fun tour to take.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.190
Is this space connected?

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.530
Can I get from any
polyhedral surface

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.580
to any other-- say, convex--
by unfolding and re-folding?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.820
We have no idea.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.460
So while each of
these operations

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.430
we know a fair amount about--
we know how to generally unfold

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.640
convex polyhedra,
we know how to find

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.790
all of the gluings of a polygon
into a polyhedron-- repeating

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.050
those processes,
we could explore

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.120
but actually no ones' every
tried that algorithmically.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.830
It'd be fun to see what
crazy things you get.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.870
But we have lots of examples
and partial progress

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.360
towards this question.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.660
So here's the first example.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.540
This appears in the book.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.660
It's by Hirata from 2000.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.710
He was one of the guys who
implemented a gluing algorithm.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.630
And this is an unfolding--
a common unfolding--

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.120
of a cube-- ah, not quite--
and a regular tetrahedron.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.520
So it's actually
a box not a cube.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.470
One of the big open
questions in this area

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.420
is, can you find
a common unfolding

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.506
of a perfect cube and a regular
tetrahedron that's open?

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:46.880
Marty posed that
question I think

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.270
in 1998, in the good old days of
the beginning of folding stuff.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.040
And this is almost an answer
but it's not quite a cube,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.750
as a result.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.708
You could see-- I think
it's pretty easy to see

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:03.230
how to fold it into a box just
with extending all the lines.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.990
And the dotted lines
show how to fold

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.185
into a regular tetrahedron.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.880
That's one example.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.930
You can also fold-- this thing
makes both a regular octahedron

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.280
instead of a regular tetrahedron
and some kind of tetrahedra.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.200
It's not regular.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.290
We call it a tetramonohedron,
meaning each of the sides

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.930
are the same.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.380
So it's just one type of side,
but there's four of them.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.670
And I guess the red lines
are folding into that,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.210
the green lines fold into
a regular tetrahedron.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.910
I feel like I'm
getting forgetful.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.830
I don't even remember where
this example comes from.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.955
But it's in the book, it's
not attributed to anyone

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:49.310
so I assume Joe invented it.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.810
But recently, like
just this year,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.880
inspired a whole bunch of
examples by these guys.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.370
I just saw the talk
last week in China--

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.180
that's where I was traveling,
it was a geometry conference.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.710
And Horiyama and Uehara
talked about a bunch

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.030
of different common unfoldings.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.780
This is, again, of
a regular octahedron

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.230
and a tetramonohedron.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.030
But a different example.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.040
But they kept going.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.210
Said all right, let's do
all the platonic solids.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.990
So this is a common unfolding
of a cube and a tetramonohedron.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.800
Cube-- actually two of them.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.480
You can see how it makes a cube.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.740
That's obvious.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.180
But the tetramonohedron
are the blue lines.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.590
Then I have the octahedron,
we have the icosahedron.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.440
I don't think they
have a dodecahedron yet

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.530
because all of these
approaches are actually

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.530
based on dissection
techniques where

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.330
you take a tiling of-- here
are equilateral triangles

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.990
for the icosahedron,
and you take

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.610
a tiling of some
triangle that's going

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.395
to make the tetramonohedron,
and you align them

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:53.010
so that things work out nicely.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.480
And that's not
always well defined,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.120
but it often leads
to good dissections,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.942
often hinged dissections.

00:04:57.942 --> 00:04:59.400
It's the way, for
example, you show

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.940
you can hinge
dissect a rectangle

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.100
into any other rectangle.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.880
You take tilings of
different rectangles

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.120
and overlay them appropriately.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.190
Here, same approach,
but with a dodecahedron,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.900
regular pentagons
don't tile so it's

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.110
very hard to use that approach.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.329
So this is as far
as they've gotten.

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:16.870
Here they've measured
the proportions

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.780
of the tetramonohedron
to give you an idea.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.320
It's close to regular.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.900
But again, open question,
can any two platonic solids--

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.100
do any two have a
common unfolding?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.680
They proved in this paper,
if you restrict one of them

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.870
to be an edge unfolding
and the other one

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.170
can be a general unfolding
then it's not possible.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.880
But if they're both general
unfoldings, who knows.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.170
Here you see it's edge
unfolding for the icosahedron,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.190
but general unfolding
for the other.

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:47.075
Cool.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.540
But very recently,
this is, like,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.990
hasn't even been released yet.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.840
This is the premier
of the following,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.190
I'll call it conjecture.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.930
I think it's not yet
approved or explicitly-- it's

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.180
not certain that it's correct.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.204
But the claim is this gray
shape, taken to the limit--

00:06:08.204 --> 00:06:10.120
so this is the first
iteration of the fractal,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.510
this is the second iteration
of the fractal-- in the limit,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.040
will fold both to a regular
tetrahedron and a cube.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.750
This would be an
amazing breakthrough.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.830
Still, the conjecture
is that it is not

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.570
possible to go from
a regular tetrahedron

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.335
to a cube with a regular--
like a normal polygon

00:06:28.335 --> 00:06:30.100
with a finite number of sides.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.530
But with an infinite number of
sides, it seems to be possible.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.500
Which is awesome.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.320
This is-- I haven't
met this guy yet.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.940
He's a professional puzzler
in Japan, Toshihiro Shirakawa.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:52.480
So stay tuned for maybe a proof
of that theorem, that claim.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.730
The next topic--
this started back

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.700
in '99, inspired
by this question.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.240
We thought well,
what about boxes?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.067
And this is a common unfolding
of two different size boxes

00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:06.650
which is cool.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.040
And it's generated in
a fairly intuitive way.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.690
You start with an
unfolding of a box.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.632
This makes a one
by one by three box

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.340
if you think about it
for a little while.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.400
Just wrap around-- this
is like one top side, 1

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.380
by 3 rectangle and wrap around.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.240
And then you-- you
draw the gluing-- here

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.690
I've labeled which edges
glue to which edges.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.010
And for every letter,
like the two Gs

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.250
here, I could imagine adding a
triangle here and removing it

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.450
from here.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.400
That will still fold to
the same thing, right?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.790
So I get to choose
for each letter which

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.370
guy goes in, which guy goes out.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.080
Then I get this shape as
a result of that process.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.210
And if I do it right,
when I rotate 45 degrees,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.475
I get a different orthogonal
unfolding of some other box.

00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:55.350
So here, if I started
with a root 2 by root 2

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.530
by three root 2 box, I
get a 1 by 2 by 4 box.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.450
So this is a common
unfolding of both.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.680
I guess here is like the
center core of the 1 by 2 by 4

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.570
and you wrap around again.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.994
Or this is probably center core.

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:11.910
So that's pretty cool.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.810
This is an idea by Timothy Chan.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.330
Of course, natural
question is, do I

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.420
need to do this rotation trick
or could I get away without it?

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.060
And you can get away without it.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.250
This is an idea
of Therese Biedl.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.390
This is my Waterloo days.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.250
We had an open problem
session, kind of like the one

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.740
we have in this class.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.070
It was the very
first one that I ran.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.370
I ran it with Therese.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.270
And she came up with this idea.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.159
This is a-- it's not obvious
exactly how this works

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.831
or where she came up with this.

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:41.789
It was kind of magical.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.790
But this the same polygon,
different creases, you

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.260
make two different size boxes.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.890
Now they're going to be integers
because they're orthogonal

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.910
aligned on the grid.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.670
Pretty cool.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.050
And for a long time, this
was the only example of this

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.860
that we had.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.660
There's still an open question
which I give you A by C by-- A

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.100
by B by C box and a D by E
by F box, is this possible?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.140
When is this possible?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.470
But at least now--
oh, here's, sorry.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.950
There are two examples.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.950
Of course, the surface
areas have to match.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.450
So the sum of A plus B plus
C equals D plus E plus F.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.465
I think that's right.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:21.194
Or no.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:22.110
It's more complicated.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.010
It's like A times
B plus-- and so on.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.382
Pairwise products.

00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:28.840
Now we know that
there are actually

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.130
infinitely many examples.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:35.020
This is another fairly
new result by Uehara,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.200
again in 2008.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.030
This is-- Uehara translated
our textbook to Japanese,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.100
by the way.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.340
Another connection.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.340
He does a lot of
fun folding stuff.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.480
Just saw him last week.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.650
So this is an
example of taking a 1

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.020
by 5 by 2k box and a common
unfolding of that with a 1

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.275
by 1 by 6k plus 2 box.

00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:58.740
Which has a very
regular pattern.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.820
And this one, little more
complicated to copy and paste

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.990
but it makes 1 by 1 by 8k
plus 11 box and a 1 by 3

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.040
by 4k plus 5 box.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.814
Which is pretty cool.

00:10:09.814 --> 00:10:11.230
I haven't studied
these carefully,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.602
but there's two different
ways to fold each.

00:10:15.602 --> 00:10:17.060
So now we know
there are infinitely

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.350
many of these examples.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.320
It's still not known
when it's possible,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.330
but also in this
paper Uehara came up

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.911
with a sort of random
generation algorithm

00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:28.660
where he would take a
box, randomly unfold

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.530
it, try to fold it
into other boxes.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:37.320
And he has now over 250,000
examples of this process.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.530
And I think these are maybe
inspired by his random search.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.330
I'm not sure, but this
is theory obviously.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.030
One particularly fun
example, this one

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.492
actually tiles the plane.

00:10:47.492 --> 00:10:49.200
So it'd be efficient
if you're cutting it

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.400
out of sheet material.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.320
You can make a common unfolding
of 1 by 2 by 5 box and a 1

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.810
by 1 by 8 box.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.750
I think this one he
made into a puzzle

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.526
with a paper manufacturer.

00:11:02.526 --> 00:11:03.890
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.890
Big open question
here that he asked is,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.790
are there-- is there a common
unfolding of three boxes?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.770
That remains open.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.830
And he feels like he's
very close to finding one

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.570
with his random search
but hasn't yet found one.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.740
It's like it almost
folds into the third box.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.990
But it's strange how
hard it is to find them.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.950
Maybe they don't exist.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.310
That would be surprising.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.430
All right.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:35.570
Next example on this theme,
common unfoldings, is this toy.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.950
So this is a 1 by 1 by 4 box,
also known as the-- as a tetra

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.980
cubes, four cubes
joined edge to edge.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.480
And-- oh, I should
have practiced.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.160
You can unfold it.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.340
This is a commercially
produced toy.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.930
It's called Cubigami.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.210
And it's one net, one unfolding.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.100
But it can fold into
all tetra cubes.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.560
So that was the tube and, let's
see, what else can I make here?

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.875
I should have practiced.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.840
Interesting.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840
It's fun.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.550
You can play with it later.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.200
Oh, that looks interesting.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.700
Almost.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.870
Not quite.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.900
It's almost-- it looks
like a Tetris piece, right?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.140
Except I didn't quite
cover it right at the end.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.220
It's a good puzzle.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.930
Obviously.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.830
Maybe if I do it like--
that doesn't work.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.540
Wow.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.040
All right.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.310
You're going to have to
play with it yourself.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.980
I lose.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.970
But you can make all of
the four cube joinings

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:06.595
except-- except for this one.

00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:10.760
See, the problem
with this example

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.430
is it doesn't have the same
surface areas the rest.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.710
And you have to
conserve surface area.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.570
But if you think about
all the other four

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:24.240
cubes-- like I was trying to
make this guy or this guy--

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:31.580
it's like Tetris
pieces-- but also things

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.484
like-- I can draw
better than I can

00:13:34.484 --> 00:13:35.650
solve the puzzle apparently.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.000
Like this.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.240
This is the one non-planar one.

00:13:45.713 --> 00:13:47.710
All right?

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.045
So you've got all the Tetris
pieces except this guy.

00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:51.320
It's the wrong surface area.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.660
So, in general, it's
all the tree shape ones.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.445
No cycles.

00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:56.320
Can make all of them.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.870
This is an example found by
Donald Knuth, famous computer

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.120
scientist.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.310
He sort of accidentally
at a cocktail party heard

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.770
about this problem from George
Miller who's a toy designer--

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.800
or puzzle designer.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.020
And so then Knuth
went back and he

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.010
wrote a program to numerate
all unfoldings of these things

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.410
and found there are a whole
bunch of common unfoldings.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.350
But it's found by
exhaustive search.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.750
This was the one that sort of
had the smallest bounding box,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.740
I believe, in terms of area.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.809
And so it's a nice
compact thing.

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:32.850
And then there are various
manufacturing's of it.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.640
This is the latest one that's
sort of relatively easy

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.760
to build I guess.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.660
So, play with that later.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.090
That's four cubes.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.050
What about five cubes?

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.920
Well, that was the subject
of a paper also presented

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.340
last week in China.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.620
And it turns out, there
is no common unfolding

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.770
of all 24 pentacubes.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.540
That's five cubes
joined together.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.280
But there is a common unfolding
of 23 out of 24 of them.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.220
So this is the paper.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.810
There was a bunch of authors.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.030
There were basically
three teams that

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.180
worked on this, two of
which were writing code.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.819
I was on one of
the coding teams.

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:17.360
And the third one
was trying to think

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.370
about the problem
using mathematics.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.805
And for a long time, the
thinkers were leading.

00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:24.680
But then, of course,
eventually the computers

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.100
win because after a couple days
of just solid computation on I

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.000
don't know now how many cores
with each of the groups,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.170
we numerated all
these unfoldings.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:40.570
And so now there's, I think,
over one trillion unfoldings

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.320
of the 1 by 1 by 5 tube.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.960
But one trillions not that bad.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.542
Now, we could not
do this for six.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:52.070
But for five it wasn't so bad.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.410
And this is-- there's a bunch
of unfoldings of 23 out of 24.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.150
But that's the max you can get.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.220
Little disappointing.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.115
AUDIENCE: Which pentacube lost?

00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:01.990
PROFESSOR: I don't know
which pentacube lost.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.090
I should find out.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.580
That's a good question.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.260
But I do have some
other answers.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.550
So in some sense,
the hard ones I think

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.180
are the non-planar guys.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.950
Like this guy.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.180
So they're planar
if all the cubes

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.900
lie in a thickened
plane, thickened by one.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.180
This guy will fold into
all the non-planar cubes

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.670
and also fold into
most of the pentacubes.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.110
There are only 24 total
so it's only missing two.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.310
And this'll fold into
all the non-planar guys.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.330
And what's cool is
this one is unique.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.210
There's only one common
unfolding of those guys.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.022
AUDIENCE: How many
non-planar [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:38.022 --> 00:16:39.730
PROFESSOR: How many
non-planar are there?

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.700
I don't remember.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.940
Maybe 10.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.680
I think it's a minority.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.180
But there are still
a bunch of them.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.929
And I think this would
make a good puzzle.

00:16:49.929 --> 00:16:52.075
If you're going to
manufacture-- if you guys want

00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:54.670
to do a start up, here you go.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.820
Freely available.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.800
If you want to do
the planar pentacubes

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.430
there are a lot of common
unfoldings of them.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.780
This is one of the
fairly compact ones.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.186
And this one, I have
an animation of.

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:08.560
Or, actually, not
this particular

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.130
unfolding, but this concept.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.359
And that is here.

00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:16.839
Yes, I trust myself.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.270
So here is unfolding
and re-folding

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.859
of that particular shape.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.849
And then I hit
Space bar and it's

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.260
the same unfolding but
a different polycube.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.470
And this is going to go
through all of the flat ones.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.930
And that animation is
done heuristically.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.520
I don't have any theory
that that's always possible.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.630
But always keeping
the same unfolding,

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.986
just changing where
the creases are.

00:17:42.986 --> 00:17:43.610
That's so cool.

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:48.290
It's funny, actually.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.850
The person who implemented this
was the guy who was thinking,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.340
not the coder-- coder teams.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.510
I guess he had free time.

00:17:58.732 --> 00:18:00.190
This is by [? Karim ?]
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.357
I guess you can count them
and then subtract from 24

00:18:06.357 --> 00:18:08.440
and you'll get how many
non-planar ones there are.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.150
But I've lost track
of where we are.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.580
Always same unfolding.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.494
This is a fairly nice,
simple unfolding.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:16.660
It's mostly one dimensional.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.840
All right.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.500
You get the idea, right?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.830
Pretty fun.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.840
All right.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.990
So, right.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.110
Do I have anymore?

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.450
I think that was the
end of my slides.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.510
I do have one more example in
the notes which is, if you just

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.200
want to make the flat
guys-- so just the two

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.030
dimensional
examples-- so we know

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:52.040
we could do that with five,
but you can also do with six.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.440
We wrote another
program that looks

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.150
at a very special
kind of unfolding.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.690
And in that special class,
it's possible to fold

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.060
all planar six
cubes-- hexacubes.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:11.700
But that class does not work
for septacubes-- seven cubes.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.730
Open question, is there
a common unfolding

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.030
of all planar seven cubes or
all non-planar seven cubes?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.440
Or how many can you make?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.475
There it was beyond exhaustion,
and we have to actually think.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:25.350
Unless you come up with
a good class and then

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.870
you can exhaust
it in that class.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.740
One nice open question here
is, if you go to large N,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.600
are there some two polycubes
that have no common unfolding?

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.180
At the moment, it
could be every pair

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.170
of polycubes has a
common unfolding.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.870
Certainly there
are-- for example,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.020
in this class there
are four polycubes that

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.260
do not have a common unfolding.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.370
I think we're not
sure about three.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.475
For size five.

00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:52.350
Of course, we don't even
know whether there's

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.634
any polycube that
has no unfolding.

00:19:55.634 --> 00:19:56.800
I think there should be one.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.870
But at the moment, it
could be every polycube

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.040
has an unfolding.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.470
But to make it a little harder,
what about two polycubes

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.382
at once you want a
common unfolding?

00:20:04.382 --> 00:20:05.590
All these questions are open.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.810
All right.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.510
This is common unfolding.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.840
We're going to stick
with unfolding stuff

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.550
but change around the
problem a little bit.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.790
So let me ask you a question.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.540
Can have a vote for those who
haven't read the notes already

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.700
and know the answer.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.510
So let's say,
orthogonal polyhedron.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.270
We talk a lot about
orthogonal polyhedra.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.790
See all this polycube
stuff is in that genre.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.480
And so way back when we
talked about grid unfolding

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.820
of orthogonal polyhedra.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.502
It's not known whether
that's possible,

00:20:48.502 --> 00:20:49.960
but we have epsilon
unfolding where

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.580
you cut exponentially
many times and so on.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.100
But how do you define
orthogonal polyhedra?

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.520
There are two
natural definitions.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.820
One is that the
angles are right.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.615
Right angles, let's
say, in the faces.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.560
The other natural definition
is that you look at two faces

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.320
and the angles between
those should be right.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:25.220
So I guess right
dihedral angles.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.985
Right face angles or
right dihedral angles.

00:21:31.985 --> 00:21:36.830
The question is, are
these the same thing?

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.830
Who thinks yes?

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.431
Who thinks no?

00:21:41.431 --> 00:21:41.930
Yeah.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:42.950
I kind of set it up.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.935
Everyone thinks no.

00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:46.810
They're not the same.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.720
But for genus zero
polyhedra, they are the same.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.990
That's maybe the
surprising thing.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:01.180
This is a genus
eight polyhedron.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.450
No, seven.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.950
It's always a little
tricky to measure genus.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.950
If it just had one triangular
face that would be-- well,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.410
anyway, that's genus seven.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.704
I'm not going to
try to convince you.

00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:16.120
This is an unfolding
of the thing.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.647
So you can see,
in the unfolding,

00:22:17.647 --> 00:22:19.480
it looks like it's an
orthogonal polyhedron.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.580
All the angles are right.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.550
It looks perfect.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.000
And yet, it folds into
this non-orthogonal thing.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.740
Kind of a thickened octahedron.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.960
It's kind of critical that it
has a genus more than zero.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.940
In this paper-- this
is the original paper

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:42.210
that considered this problem--
there's a lower bound of one.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.110
The genus 0 is not enough.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:50.730
Then we came along-- I don't
have the author list here.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:56.370
It's with the Waterloo gang, it
was Therese Biedl and others.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:03.050
And this is a smaller genus,
a genus six polyhedron.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:03.760
This guy.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.540
So it's almost the same
example turned inside out.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.210
So this like to half
octahedra and then joined

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.230
in this cubicle frame
and then you put caps

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.990
on the cubicle frame to make
there not be holes out there.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.120
And then you have
slightly smaller genus

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.610
because you can go
around the backside.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.830
So that's the best known,
is a genus six example.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.770
We proved that you need
genus at least three

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.031
in order for such
an example to exist.

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.030
I have a little sketch
of the proof in the notes

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.650
if you want to read it.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.610
It's a fun little boot
strapping argument but I would--

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.740
I'm going to go on
to other fun topics

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.810
here rather than prove this.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.589
Is that a good plan?

00:23:41.589 --> 00:23:42.630
I think that's good plan.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.330
OK.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.060
So this is a fun
kind of-- unfoldings

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.430
can be orthogonal while the
three dimensional versions are

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.055
not orthogonal.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.550
All right.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.135
Next topic.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.260
I'm going to go back to
Alexandrov's theorem.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.620
Turns out there is a
smooth version of that.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.310
So now we're going
to segue a little bit

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.215
into smooth foldings
and smooth unfoldings.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.140
So instead of thinking of
polyhedron objects-- polygons

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.180
and convex polyhedra-- I want
to think about smooth bodies.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:33.760
So, for example, suppose
I take a smooth convex

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.820
shape like an
ellipse or something

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.950
and I picked two
perimeter antipodes

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:49.191
and I do perimeter having
gluing where this is defines--

00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:51.190
as I walk along the
perimeter in both directions

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.460
it-- I obviously
didn't do it perfectly,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.474
they should meet at
exactly the same time.

00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:57.390
This defines a gluing.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:59.100
For every point there
is a corresponding point

00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.900
it gets glued to.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.780
This is a way to make what is
locally like a convex surface

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.200
because at any point, at
most 360 degrees of material

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.260
is glued there because
this thing was convex.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.020
And the same way as
for convex polygons,

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.474
does this make a convex
something in three dimensions?

00:25:15.474 --> 00:25:17.390
It's not going to make
a polyhedron because it

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.180
has this curve,
but indeed it does

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.700
make a convex smooth surface.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:40.660
So every convex metric
that's topologically a sphere

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:46.225
is realized by a
unique convex surface.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.860
So Alexandrov's theorem was
identical to this statement

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.430
except it also had
polyhedral up here,

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.740
that there were finite number
of points of nonzero curvature.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.890
Now we have
infinitely many points

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.550
of slightly positive
curvature because, again, this

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.950
is supposed to sum to 4 pi.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.230
That's still true.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.067
But it's now an integral
instead of a sum.

00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:15.650
So each of these things sort of
has an infinitesimal curvature

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:19.250
and if you integrate
them it adds up to 4 pi.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.190
You can check that.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.670
So this will make something.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.754
I encourage you to try
this out, again, with tape.

00:26:26.754 --> 00:26:28.545
You're going to
approximate it because tape

00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:29.830
is going to be polygonal.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.520
But it works.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.140
It will make something.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.620
I particularly-- I should
mention the idea of this proof

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.110
is just to take limits
of regular Alexandrov.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.599
Take closer and closer
polyhedral approximations.

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.640
In the polyhedral world
we can use that induction

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.170
that we talked about.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.720
In the smooth case, you
can't, but the smooth case

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.180
is the limit of the polyhedral
case so it works out.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.580
This is proved by a student
of Alexandrov Pogorelov

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.860
in the '70s, whereas he
proved his theorem in the '40s

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.558
or '50s.

00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:03.730
One really fun thing you
could do with this theorem

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.550
is, instead of using
just one convex shape,

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:12.389
you could use two convex shapes
and zip them to each other.

00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:13.555
And this is called a D-form.

00:27:13.555 --> 00:27:16.820
It was invented by an
artist, Tony Wills.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.572
So here I've taken
two-- in this case,

00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:20.030
two identical
convect shapes-- they

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.240
don't have to be identical--
picked two points to glue them

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.626
to each other and then you
just zip around the perimeter.

00:27:26.626 --> 00:27:29.250
And again, because you're always
gluing convex angles to convex

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.060
angles-- the smooth
convex angles--

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.840
but they're still less than
180, so you glue them together,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.760
it's less than 360.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.360
And in this case, it's-- we
could actually figure out

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.230
and think about what 3D shape
you get so we could build that

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.620
in Mathematica.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.060
But in general, you get
some weird convex shape.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.394
For a while there were
some examples of this

00:27:49.394 --> 00:27:51.310
but no one knew exactly
what they looked like.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.800
Then, I think it was a
project in this class

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.180
or it came out of the problem
session in this class three

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.900
years ago, Greg
Price and I proved

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.930
that these things
are nice in the sense

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.270
that the only place
you get creases

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.820
is along the seam,
the pink stuff.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.310
Both for-- these
are called D-forms,

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.960
these have another-- I
think these are pita-forms,

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.390
if I recall, where you take one
convex shape instead of two.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.060
Here you only get--
you can get the creases

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.910
along the seam and
one extra crease,

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.752
if I recall correctly here.

00:28:23.752 --> 00:28:25.460
And here you don't
get any extra creases.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.810
It's always smooth
except at the seam.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.020
And also, if you just take
the seam-- the pink part--

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.030
and take the convex hull of that
thing, you get the same thing.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.050
So it doesn't go outside.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.240
It's really tightly
wrapped around wherever

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.810
the seam happens to go.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.930
Remember, this thing is
unique by Pogorelov's theorem.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.060
So it's kind of nice to
know that structurally these

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.530
are pretty nice and smooth.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.880
If your original shapes
are smooth convex bodies,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.340
you will get a
nice, smooth shape

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.680
at the end that only has
creases at the seams.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.160
Cool.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.005
Again, please try to it at home.

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:04.509
It's lots of fun.

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:05.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.230
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.760
This point should glue to here.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.170
I mean, it's
perfectly symmetric.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.570
AUDIENCE: I'm looking
at the 3D form.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.690
PROFESSOR: The 3D form.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.200
So one of the two shapes
is here and the other one

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.170
is here and goes around
the back to there.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.340
And it's, again, symmetric.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.630
This is a nice example because
we have those parallel lines.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.330
Usually you wouldn't have that.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.126
And they're harder to
draw, is the challenge.

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:50.500
Here, obviously,
we're doing sort

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.710
of a polygonal approximation.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.330
You see all the lines.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.980
All right.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.230
This is a smooth version of
folding-- a smooth version

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.630
of Alexandrov's theorem.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.500
We can also think about
smooth versions of unfolding.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.520
So here there is
exactly one paper

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:17.150
by Nadia Benbernou whose in
the front row and Heather--

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:17.982
AUDIENCE: Patricia.

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.880
PROFESSOR: Patricia
Khan and Joe O'Rourke.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.720
So this is a prismatoid.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.440
It's a little hard to
see the bottom face

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.720
but there's a convex polygon on
the bottom, a parallel convex

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.890
polygon on the top.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.820
You take the convex hull--
sorry, they're not polygons.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.060
They're smooth convex bodies.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.640
So you've got one in the floor
plane, one in a parallel plane

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.440
up top.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.300
You take the convex hull, you
get this nice smooth thing

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.660
around the outside.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.570
Now, we have to generalize
our notion of unfolding

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.690
because normally with
unfolding this would take

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.410
an infinite number of cuts
to-- we have to cut everywhere

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.160
there's curvature.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.993
Which means we're going
to have to cut along

00:30:55.993 --> 00:30:57.250
all those black lines.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:02.490
Which means we slice the thing
into very infinitesimal pieces.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.530
But if you think
of it as a limit

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:11.630
of regular polyhedral things--
here I have a little example.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:16.370
Let's think about the limit in
a simpler example to start with.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.000
So imagine you want
to take a pyramid--

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.886
so the top poly-- the top
convex shape is just a point.

00:31:23.886 --> 00:31:25.645
I guess it looks like
a cone but down here

00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:32.180
it could be anything, could be
an ellipse or any convex shape.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.480
Well, we can think of this as
a polyhedral approximation.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.420
So, for example, we take
a hexagon on the bottom,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.590
we want to unfold that.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.160
And in particular, we
thought about these--

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.520
these are the
pyramids-- and we--

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.830
one of the unfoldings of
them is the volcano unfolding

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.894
if you remember back to
the unfolding lecture.

00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:57.560
Looks like that.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.210
All these triangles just fold
out, get all those parts.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.660
That never overlaps,
it's sort of trivial.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.430
You take the limit of that.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.510
In the limit, the floor becomes
whatever the convex shape.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.240
Maybe-- let's think about the
simple case where it's a disk.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.209
And in the limit you're getting
lots of really tiny triangles.

00:32:19.209 --> 00:32:21.500
You take that all the way to
limit, what you're getting

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.950
is actually a concentric
circle around there.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.100
So really, these
become segments.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.970
Now, what's funny about
this limit is, normally--

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.460
before you get to the end, you
see there's these big gaps.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.174
A lot of the area's missing.

00:32:40.174 --> 00:32:42.090
These things are getting
infinitesimally small

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.570
and yet they have to
spread over this big range.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.650
So most of this area
is actually absent.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.066
When you take the limit you
can't really see that anymore.

00:32:49.066 --> 00:32:50.250
It just becomes filled in.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:55.860
And so in this unfolding,
the area of the green stuff,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.120
if you just took that area
measured on the floor,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.600
it's going to be larger
than the area in the pink.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.720
So this is not an area
preserving unfolding

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.420
which makes it a little weird.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.920
But it's still well defined.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.311
I mean, you wouldn't
actually-- well,

00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:12.560
for example-- we're going
to get to this in a moment--

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.850
if you actually took material
like this out of, say,

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.570
tin foil, something
that can crinkle,

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:22.290
then you should be able to
crinkle it into this shape.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.020
I'll talk about
how to prove that.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.020
That's actually most of
the rest of the lecture,

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.090
is about that kind
of notion of folding.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.520
It's more like origami,
though, than unfolding

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.020
because you're sort of
over covering stuff.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.030
And here-- actually,
here the hard part

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.110
is not so much to show
these ribs don't intersect,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.110
although they don't and
it's not totally obvious

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.950
because here they're kind
of going towards each other.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.849
But they won't actually
intersect in the unfolding.

00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:51.390
One of the tricky parts is to
show that the top face actually

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.150
can fit somewhere,
so you actually

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.400
get an unfolding of this thing.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.220
And I forget, this is choosing
some kind of extreme rib

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.665
and putting it out there.

00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:06.240
It's a nice line of
separation if I recall.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:14.000
This is funny because here we
have a limit of some process.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.840
Now, for pyramids we know
the volcano unfolding works.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.850
For prismatoids,
regular prismatoids

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.429
are when you take
some convex polygon

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:30.250
and some other parallel convex
polygon, take the convex hull.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.620
We don't know whether
these have edge unfoldings.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.969
Still an open problem.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.440
And yet, for the
smooth case, we do.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.949
Kind of magical.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.219
I know why that's true.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.948
It's somehow the edge
constraint is harder.

00:34:50.948 --> 00:34:52.989
If you're not just worried
about edge unfoldings,

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.260
we do know how to
unfold those obviously.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.310
You can do star unfolding,
source unfolding.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.946
Here, edge unfolding--
well, we have

00:35:00.946 --> 00:35:02.820
to cut along all those
infinitely many edges.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.610
That makes it easier,
much smoother.

00:35:08.132 --> 00:35:10.090
But it's funny when the
smooth case is actually

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.160
easier than the discrete case.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.660
All right.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.872
The next problem I want to
talk about is chocolate.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.100
I have here a bunch of
spherical chocolates.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.650
The most-- apparently the only
perfectly spherical chocolate,

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.310
at least according
to the advertisement,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.640
is this thing called
the Mozart Kugel.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.230
Now, Mozart Kugel-- how many
people have eaten them before.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.671
Just a couple.

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:40.170
Good stuff.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.530
It's, I guess, more
a European thing.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.790
It's from Austria.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.150
It's invented in early
1900s, I forget exactly when.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.677
It was a big thing at the
time because making chocolate

00:35:51.677 --> 00:35:53.010
perfectly spherical is not easy.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.230
It's like, how do
you hold it and not

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.460
get little indentations?

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.620
This thing is
perfectly spherical.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.411
Here I'll show you.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:06.040
But, really, the question I
wonder, because as an origamist

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.270
you wonder, how do
you wrap this thing?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.065
Oh, I ripped it.

00:36:10.065 --> 00:36:11.595
I'll try to do this
more carefully.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.786
It's not how you usually
eat chocolate, is it?

00:36:18.786 --> 00:36:21.520
Open very carefully.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.020
It's OK.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.840
I have more in case I fail.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.475
More chocolate.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.801
Not enough for you, I'm afraid.

00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:32.800
So ignore the chocolate.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:40.360
It's not the Droid
you're looking for.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.330
It's not the chocolate.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.830
So it's a rectangle.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.455
I didn't do a perfect job.

00:36:44.455 --> 00:36:46.070
There's a few
little tears there.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.320
But they fold-- Mirabell.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.737
Mirabell makes the most
Mozart Kugel in the world.

00:36:52.737 --> 00:36:54.320
Mozart Kugel is very
cool because it's

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.900
built in-- built up
in concentric spheres.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.400
You have the marzipan layer,
then the milk chocolate layer,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.880
then the nougat layer, then
the dark chocolate layer,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.210
if I recall.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:08.530
Each brand has a
different recipe,

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.324
but they're always
spherical on the outside.

00:37:11.324 --> 00:37:12.990
It's kind of like
glassblowing actually.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.430
It's kind of fun.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.340
And each company has a
slightly different way-- well,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.190
I've studied only
two main companies.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:25.320
Mirabell makes the most of them
but they are not the original.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.694
They are called the
echta which is--

00:37:29.694 --> 00:37:30.490
AUDIENCE: The real.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.360
PROFESSOR: The real.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.160
The authentic.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.880
But-- now, these
are hard to come by.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.470
These are brought to me by
my student, [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.540
some of you know.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.519
Architecture.

00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:46.060
This is the-- oh,
it says in English.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.930
It's kind of easy.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.000
The original Salzburger
Mozart Kugel.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.790
Mozart was-- lived
in Salzburg, I guess.

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.510
And so this is named after him.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.460
Oh, 1884.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.580
Wow.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.310
So that's when they started.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:05.026
Now, these guys--
I think I've only

00:38:05.026 --> 00:38:06.400
had like one of
these in my life.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.420
I'm really excited.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.962
The Mirabell's are
OK, but this stuff?

00:38:09.962 --> 00:38:10.462
Wow.

00:38:14.884 --> 00:38:16.300
Oh, it's so much
easier to unfold.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.810
I like-- this is, I
think, probably handmade.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.450
Much more handmade.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.980
In fact, you can kind of tell
it's not perfectly spherical.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.730
It has a little nub at the top.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.626
So this is probably more how
they were originally made.

00:38:28.626 --> 00:38:30.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:30.594 --> 00:38:32.260
PROFESSOR: What, are
you getting hungry?

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.880
Now, Furst-- Furst
is the company

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.911
who made the first Mozart
Kugel-- they use squares.

00:38:41.911 --> 00:38:43.410
I claim they're a
little bit better.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.840
But interesting question is,
which uses more material?

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.160
Something to think about.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:56.430
Meanwhile-- I won't
torture you more by eating.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.000
All right.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.470
So this is a Mozart
Kugel problem.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:12.660
This paper started when-- I
think we are in New Orleans.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.200
Some part of the gang
was in New Orleans

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.620
and there was this
deadline the next day

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.536
and it was for this workshop
on computational geometry--

00:39:20.536 --> 00:39:22.160
the European workshop--
and it happened

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.500
to be in Austria that
year-- that coming year.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.330
We're like, what
paper could we write?

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.770
And we're sitting there
in the little cafe eating

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.040
these beignets of
doughnuts and thinking,

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.665
what could we write
a paper about?

00:39:34.665 --> 00:39:36.620
It's like, how about food?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.350
And what does Austria have?

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.950
Well, [SPEAKING GERMAN]
Well, how about Mozart Kugel?

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.440
So-- this is how
research happens.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.690
But it's really cool.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.410
It's really cool because
this is not your--

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.400
this is not the origami you
grew up with in this class.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.430
Because you can't fold a
sphere out of a square paper.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.970
And yet, this was a square
folded into a sphere.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:06.650
Somehow that was done using
a finite amount of effort.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.510
Whereas if you use regular
paper to fold something

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.650
that has positive
curvature everywhere,

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.760
you need infinitely
many creases.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.500
And yet this is fairly
practical to do.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.980
This is hand wrapped.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.910
In theory, I could re-wrap this.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.570
I've never actually tried.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.760
But something like this.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.215
It works pretty well.

00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:26.860
I even covered the tip.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.320
How did I do that
in finite effort?

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.840
Well, of course it's
not a perfect sphere.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.490
But we need to model
this mathematically.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.625
It's annoying to
take approximations.

00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:37.500
I would like a model of
folding that actually

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.470
does make it possible
to fold a sphere.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.490
So this is the idea of
contractive folding.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.210
We haven't been super rigorous
about defining origami,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.970
but I always say you
take a piece of paper,

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.890
you can't stretch the paper,
you can't tear the paper,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.400
and you can't self-intersect.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.980
We're going to relax the
you can't stretch the paper.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.770
You still can't
stretch the paper,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.060
but now the paper can contract.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.110
So it can't get longer
but it can get shorter.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.640
It's like cables from
tensegrity theory.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.470
So you take any pair of points.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.300
There's some distance as
measured on the piece of paper.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.540
When you fold this thing
into your awesome sphere,

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.750
you take the two points,
you measure the distance

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.890
along the surface of
the piece of paper.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.910
Now, I'll-- normally
with origami,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.850
these two distances
should be equal.

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:36.440
That's isometry.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.440
That's regular origami.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:45.190
But if I say that this one--
so write equal that way.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:51.490
If this one can be smaller,
then this is contractive.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.920
And that is paper that can
shrink but not stretch.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:06.364
So pairwise distances
don't increase.

00:42:06.364 --> 00:42:07.530
So they could stay the same.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.710
We could still do
regular origami.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.070
But we can also contract.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.140
And then it is possible
to fold a sphere.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.690
Now, intuitively,
what's going on

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:21.380
is, when you fold out of
tinfoil, you can crinkle.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:26.840
And that lets you not have
to worry about-- I mean,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.790
this is pretty good
approximation to a sphere

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.040
especially when I have
a good base underneath

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.090
to approximate against.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.250
I'm doing lots of little
tiny creases in order

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:43.080
to approximate that contractive
mapping, contractive folding.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.350
So, conveniently,
there's a theorem

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.590
that tells us this
is always possible.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.340
I'll tell you the theorem.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.350
This is another theorem
by Burago and Zalgallar

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.560
who proved the other
theorem that if you

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:04.380
have any polyhedral
metric you can turn it

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.230
into some polyhedron,
not necessarily convex.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.610
So they solved that problem
plus they solved this problem.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:16.580
If you take a contractive-- they
only solved the smooth case.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.650
I imagine this works
for piecewise smooth.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.070
You take a contractive
C2 immersion--

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.700
it's just some fancy
word for folding,

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.060
it has some extra constraints
but let's not worry about it.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.490
So C2 means continuous up
to the second derivative.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.440
So nice and smooth.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.450
Spheres are valid, for example.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:42.714
Then any one of those
things has a C0--

00:43:42.714 --> 00:43:44.505
I'll just call it
polyhedral approximation.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.090
And this is approximation
in the Hausdorff sense

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.300
meaning you want
to fold the sphere.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.200
If you just thicken that
sphere by some epsilon,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.570
then you can sort of stay within
that epsilon thickened sphere

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.290
and do some kind of wiggling.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.120
You'll be polyhedral
and you'll only

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.390
have finitely many creases.

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:10.180
So there-- if you have a nice,
smooth contracted folded state,

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.250
you could turn it into a regular
origami isometry folded state

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.610
that's arbitrarily
close to the sphere.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.460
So for any epsilon.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.560
So that's a convenient
theorem from 1996.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.730
So that's the model.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.870
Now we can think about, how
do I optimally wrap a sphere?

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:35.010
Now, there are
many possible goals

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.450
you might want to optimize
in wrapping a sphere.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.630
Presumably, you want your
shape to tile the plane.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.505
So you can cut out a
whole bunch of these out

00:44:42.505 --> 00:44:44.780
of one sheet of tinfoil.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.000
Obviously Mirabell
likes rectangles,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.590
Furst likes squares.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.430
Are those the
right things to do?

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.230
What about triangles?

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.230
What about other shapes?

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:56.104
These are the sorts of
questions we consider.

00:44:56.104 --> 00:44:58.220
We don't have a complete
answer to this question.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.642
But we have a lot of
fun-- fun things to do.

00:45:01.642 --> 00:45:03.100
What should I tell
you about first?

00:45:08.449 --> 00:45:09.240
I'm getting hungry.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.820
Maybe I'll have the
rest of that Mirabell.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.210
It's just sitting there.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.410
Half a Mozart Kugel,
can't have that.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:17.910
All right.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:19.165
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:19.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:21.105
Question?

00:45:21.105 --> 00:45:22.230
AUDIENCE: I was wondering--

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.790
PROFESSOR: You can have any.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.622
AUDIENCE: Because of
the fact that you've

00:45:26.622 --> 00:45:29.330
got this contracting
that occurs,

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:32.645
I was wondering-- it's obvious
that because of contracting

00:45:32.645 --> 00:45:39.920
you need more than 4 pi
r surface area of paper

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.590
to wrap a sphere--
a one unit sphere.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.790
I'm wondering, do you
know exactly how much

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.041
paper do you require due to
the fact that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:51.081
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:52.360
How much paper do you require?

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.950
Area is not being
preserved here.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:57.170
Just like the continuous
unfolding stuff,

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.790
you don't preserve area.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.040
This is really the same thing.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.075
I think you can prove
this is a contractive map.

00:46:02.075 --> 00:46:03.700
So if you had this
as a piece of paper,

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:08.510
you really could fold
that smooth pyramid.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.790
But you lose material when
you do a contractive mapping.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:17.880
And in the inverse, when you're
unfolding, you gain material.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.395
How much material
do I have to gain?

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:22.020
Think about it.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.830
You should be able to
answer that question.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.190
I'm going to tell you about some
stuff while you think about it.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:31.140
That was the original
question we started with.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.330
What's the minimum area
wrapping of a unit sphere?

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.847
The surface area of a
sphere is 4 pi, FYI.

00:46:38.847 --> 00:46:39.930
How much more do you need?

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.230
All right.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.960
To describe these unfoldings,
I guess they are, or wrappings,

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.434
whichever way you're
thinking about going,

00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:51.100
it's useful to have
some structure, kind

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.590
of a backbone to the unfolding.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.400
So we came up with this
idea of stretched path.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.770
And you can show that any
kind of optimal wrapping

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.260
will have at least
one stretch path.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.820
And our idea is
actually-- let me tell you

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.670
what a stretch path is.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:10.830
This is a, let's say, a
path between two vertices

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.990
whose length does not decrease.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:19.850
So it actually is
preserved in the folding.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:32.150
So I have my sphere,
I have two points,

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.960
take the shortest
path between them.

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:35.660
That shortest path
is exactly what

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.327
it is in the unfolding,
exactly the same length.

00:47:38.327 --> 00:47:39.910
So that's what we
call a stretch path.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.610
There's no crinkling
along that path.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:44.150
There maybe crinkling on
either side of the path,

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.550
but not on it.

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:50.500
Our idea is-- OK, that gives
you some kind of structure.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.740
Our idea is to completely
cover the surface

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.777
of the sphere with
stretched paths.

00:47:55.777 --> 00:47:57.360
There's a lot of
ways you can do that.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.270
Some of them will be valid,
some of them won't be.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.469
The simplest one is
the source unfolding.

00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:05.510
Or I guess you could call
it the source wrapping.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.090
Wrapping somehow means
contractive I guess.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:15.550
Which is, you take your
sphere, take some point x,

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.992
you take all the
shortest paths around x--

00:48:17.992 --> 00:48:19.200
it's a little tricky to draw.

00:48:22.697 --> 00:48:24.780
In other words, the Voronoi
diagram at that point.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.200
Just like we did with
source unfolding.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.180
And you call all of these edges,
all those straight lines--

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:36.020
geodesics, whatever-- they go to
this opposite south pole here.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.130
All of those lines you
call stretch paths.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.210
That determines an unfolding.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.720
And it happens to
be contractive.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.070
The unfolding will be a
big disk because you'll

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.750
have the center-- call this x.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.500
This is 3D, this is 2D,
in case it wasn't clear.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.250
They both look the same.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.850
But now all those
paths are straight.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.260
And it's clear what the
lengths of these paths are.

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.927
Each one of them is
half the circumference.

00:49:08.927 --> 00:49:09.510
Circumference?

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.551
Is that what you call it?

00:49:10.551 --> 00:49:13.050
Half of an equator
of the sphere.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.350
Which for a unit sphere is pi.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:24.020
So this is radius pi, which
means the area of this thing

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.750
is pi r squared.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.380
Sorry, the area is pi cubed.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:32.610
Interesting.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:38.910
But pi cubed, you can
compute, is more than 4pi.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:43.580
Pi squared is
almost-- is over nine.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.480
It's over nine times pi.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.130
We want four times pi.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.340
This is an example of
not preserving area.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.680
What's happening is
there's lots of crinkling

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.604
between these lines.

00:49:52.604 --> 00:49:54.520
Now, there are infinitely
many of these lines.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.340
Every point is covered by
one of these stretched paths.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.460
But again, when I
unfold them, if I

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.760
did a limiting approximation,
there'd be lots of holes here.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.326
But in the limit
there are no holes

00:50:05.326 --> 00:50:06.700
and that's where
I waste material

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.510
and that's where
I get contraction.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:09.495
Make sense?

00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:13.022
I actually brought a
sphere, a couple spheres.

00:50:13.022 --> 00:50:15.230
I brought some chocolate
spheres, but slightly bigger

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.120
sphere so we can
think about this.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:22.840
In this case, we're making
stretch paths all around

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.145
from the north pole
down to the south pole

00:50:25.145 --> 00:50:27.320
and kind of cutting
at the south pole.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.812
And that's it.

00:50:29.812 --> 00:50:30.788
All right.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.680
Has anyone solved the problem
of what the minimum area

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.480
wrapping of the sphere is?

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:42.980
Yeah?

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.720
You solved it?

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.570
Janine.

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.360
Or an idea.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.320
AUDIENCE: I think
it's 4pi plus epsilon.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.219
PROFESSOR: 4pi plus
epsilon is correct.

00:50:49.219 --> 00:50:50.260
How do you want to do it?

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.380
Exactly.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.810
AUDIENCE: An apple
core-- or peeling.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.480
PROFESSOR: Apple peeling, yes.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.860
Or I prefer to think
of it as lecturer--

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.670
I don't know which one--
the one about strip folding.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.630
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.470
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.260
Exactly.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.700
So we had this result
about strip folding

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:17.364
if you remember way back in
the folding anything lecture.

00:51:17.364 --> 00:51:19.030
We talked about this
and then orgamizer.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.450
This was the inefficient method.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:24.580
But if you started with a
very long rectangle of paper,

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.490
we could show that the
area of that piece of paper

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:30.540
is arbitrary-- could
be made arbitrarily

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.805
close to the area
of your polyhedron.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.036
So that area plus some epsilon.

00:51:38.036 --> 00:51:39.410
And you can make
epsilon as small

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:43.650
as you wanted just by
making this polygon longer.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.780
If you take a polyhedral
approximation of a sphere

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.180
and apply this theorem, you'll
get very close to the surface

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.770
area of that approximation which
is very close to the surface

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.960
area of the sphere,
which is 4pi.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.170
And then, if you take
an outer approximation,

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.430
then you can just sort of
crinkle all those vertices down

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:05.920
against the sphere.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.460
And you'll do-- it's
maybe not totally obvious,

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.887
but it's not that hard.

00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:12.470
You get a contractive map that
actually wraps the sphere using

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:16.465
not much more surface
area than what you had.

00:52:16.465 --> 00:52:18.090
The same as what you
had, which was not

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.280
much more than the sphere.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.020
So you can get 4pi plus epsilon.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.860
So it turns out, minimizing
the area of your wrapping

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.272
is not that interesting
a question by itself

00:52:26.272 --> 00:52:28.230
because there's kind of
this cheating solution.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.146
Obviously, you don't
want to manufacture that.

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.380
I don't think.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.660
Maybe she built a robot, did
the inverse orange peeling,

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.229
it would be pretty cool.

00:52:38.229 --> 00:52:40.520
But if you're trying to sell
this idea to confectioners

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.499
around the world, I
wouldn't recommend

00:52:43.499 --> 00:52:44.540
attempting strip folding.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.030
So we would like
something that's

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:51.410
reasonably nice but-- yeah.

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:52.250
OK.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.695
AUDIENCE: So if
you're trying sell

00:52:54.695 --> 00:53:00.563
wrapper companies [INAUDIBLE]
square or rectangular amounts

00:53:00.563 --> 00:53:03.008
would these be 4pi squared?

00:53:03.008 --> 00:53:05.453
Because you're basically
producing something

00:53:05.453 --> 00:53:09.320
that maybe would expand
the circumference and--

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.320
PROFESSOR: Well, OK, an
interesting question is,

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.524
what is the surface
area of these wrappings?

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.440
These actually have
pretty special properties,

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.970
the rectangle and
the-- I'm getting

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:20.440
hungry-- and the square.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:28.236
Have you thought about which
of these has more surface area?

00:53:28.236 --> 00:53:30.030
The rectangle has more?

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.110
Who thinks the
rectangle has more?

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:34.474
Who thinks the square has more?

00:53:34.474 --> 00:53:35.640
Who thinks they're the same?

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:41.640
Seed you with that idea.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.220
Well, they're actually the same.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.199
I'll explain why
in a little bit.

00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:46.990
It's crazy, I know.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.845
I prefer the square because
it has less perimeter.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.920
There are obviously many
things you might not

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.750
like about this strip folding.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:06.740
It has high aspect
ratio, but in particular,

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.620
one way to characterize
why this is nasty,

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.630
it says high perimeter.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:14.915
Perimeter is annoying
because-- for a few reasons.

00:54:14.915 --> 00:54:16.706
Intuitively, if you
started with the sphere

00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:18.890
and you wanted to
cut it open, then you

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.070
need a lot of cutting
because the perimeter is

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.860
the amount that you cut.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.150
Or it's twice that.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:29.382
So conversely, when you're
trying to wrap a surface,

00:54:29.382 --> 00:54:30.840
if you have high
perimeter, there's

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.200
a lot to worry about, lots of
things that have to match up.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.740
So you've got to be very
careful in your crinkling.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.698
Whereas I really didn't
have to be very careful

00:54:38.698 --> 00:54:42.140
wrapping with the square
because it has low perimeter.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.310
Another sense in which
perimeter is annoying

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.870
is you're going to
have some error.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:51.400
So in fact, you can't just
perfectly wrap a sphere.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.740
Like, if I took a disk
of exactly this size,

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.100
I probably couldn't
wrap a sphere with it

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.762
because I'm going to
lose just some epsilon

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:00.220
and then there'll
be a little point

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.720
around the south
pole that's missing.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.030
If you're really going to
build confectionery-- build

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.890
confectionery-- if you're really
going to wrap confectionery,

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.860
you probably make this
a little bit bigger.

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.510
How much area do
you lose when you

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.010
make your thing a
little bit bigger?

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.637
Well, it's roughly the
perimeter times epsilon.

00:55:18.637 --> 00:55:21.220
It's a little bit different from
that, but basically perimeter

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.080
times epsilon.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.050
So if you minimize
perimeter, then

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:27.944
your area wastage from
double coverage will go down.

00:55:27.944 --> 00:55:29.360
So really what I
want is something

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.140
that's low area
and low perimeter.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.090
That's our new goal.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:37.820
And that's why I like
Furst better than Mirabell,

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.510
not just because
they taste better.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.222
I really should verify
that they taste better.

00:55:42.222 --> 00:55:45.010
Oh, yeah.

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.520
Now, they're very
different insides.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.580
Oh, but it's so good.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.230
Oh, much better chocolate.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.740
All right.

00:56:00.548 --> 00:56:04.160
Maybe I should have a
lottery for eating the rest.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:08.570
Petal wrapping.

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:16.010
This is going to be
another way to put stretch

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.450
paths on the sphere and
get an unfolding-- get

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.410
a contractive
wrapping from that.

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:23.391
Which actually
corresponds to this toy.

00:56:23.391 --> 00:56:25.140
I don't know if you
ever played with this.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.460
The Frisbee that's also a ball.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.940
These-- you see those cuts?

00:56:33.839 --> 00:56:35.630
Those are the shortest
paths from the north

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.200
pole to the south pole.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.030
But we're not--
before we were sort

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.650
of using-- kind of slicing
along but also preserving--

00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:47.780
that's kind of confusing--
all of them, infinitely many.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.280
Now I want to do
with finitely many.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.240
Here I only have six.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.800
Six?

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.450
Yes, six.

00:56:56.772 --> 00:56:57.730
Doesn't have to be six.

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.260
Could be any number k.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:07.070
So I'm going to look at k
stretch paths from north pole

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:07.850
to south pole.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.190
So I have my sphere,
here is my north pole.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:15.200
I do some constant number.

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.370
Here I've done five.

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:21.147
This is equally spaced
angular around the north pole,

00:57:21.147 --> 00:57:22.980
they all go to the south
pole on the bottom.

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:27.924
Something like that.

00:57:27.924 --> 00:57:29.340
It's going to start
getting messy.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.790
These are going to
be stretch paths.

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:38.910
I have to fill these orange
slices in between them.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.630
How should I fill them?

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.457
Here's an idea.

00:57:44.457 --> 00:57:46.040
It's kind of like
the Voronoi diagram.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:51.485
Voronoi diagram is you grow from
many objects simultaneously.

00:57:51.485 --> 00:57:54.550
With this sphere wrapping
we grew from a single point

00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:57.130
in all directions.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:57.800
That was it.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.380
Now, I've drawn these paths.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:04.120
What if I grew from all of these
finite stretch paths at once?

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.299
What I would get, these
would at some point converge.

00:58:07.299 --> 00:58:09.340
They would converge at
the angular bisector here.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.560
Along the way,
what's happening is

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.330
each of these points is kind of
tracing along a straight line,

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.910
so to speak, a
great circular arc

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.640
until it reaches that point.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.670
I'm going to make
these stretched paths,

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:31.794
and these are also stretched
pads, and basically cutting

00:58:31.794 --> 00:58:32.710
along the dotted line.

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:36.810
OK.

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:38.800
I won't draw all of them.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.860
But you get the idea.

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:43.015
When you unfold this thing, you
have these kind of wish bones.

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.430
These guys meet sort
of perpendicularly.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:57.702
So when you unfold you
preserve those angles.

00:58:57.702 --> 00:58:59.160
Remember these are
stretched paths.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.430
These lengths are preserved.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.780
The stuff in between,
it's really a curved thing

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.380
and it gets slightly
larger in this thing.

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.400
We call this thing a petal.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.590
But this is an
unfolding of this sort

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:14.580
of one fifth of the sphere.

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:18.660
This is the center line and
these are the two sides.

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:23.540
So that's the idea
of petal wrapping.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.950
Now, there's different ways
to join these petals together.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:31.020
One idea is join them
all at the north pole.

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:33.390
So then what you get--
it's a little hard

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:36.020
to imagine that these things
don't intersect each other,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.120
especially when I've
drawn them so fat.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.245
For five, it's going to
look something like this.

00:59:43.159 --> 00:59:44.200
I'm drawing it perfectly.

00:59:46.659 --> 00:59:48.450
They won't actually
intersect in the center

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.533
because the total amount
of material at the center

00:59:50.533 --> 00:59:52.660
is only 360 degrees.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.250
And this will actually have--
the tangents will actually

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:57.090
match up here.

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:59.380
So they will perfectly
mean in the center

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.810
without self-intersection.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.610
So it's only sort of
a vertex unfolding.

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:05.180
Because they're only
connected at the single point.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.710
But that's maybe necessary.

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:07.702
I don't know.

01:00:07.702 --> 01:00:09.410
And again, these are
the stretched paths.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.450
It's a neat way to
think about unfolding.

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:20.160
You can draw these--
ignore the yellow for now.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.734
That's if you might want
to actually cut these out.

01:00:22.734 --> 01:00:24.650
So we have the three
petal unfolding, the four

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:26.770
petal unfolding, five
petal unfolding, six petal,

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.920
you can go arbitrarily high.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.610
In the limit, the
area of the blue stuff

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.320
will converge to 4pi.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.279
This is another way to
get arbitrarily close.

01:00:37.279 --> 01:00:38.820
Because the smaller
these things are,

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.945
the less you're distorting.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.530
So this is two
families of wrappings.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.100
We call these-- the blue
stuff is the petal unfolding,

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.050
the yellow is the convex
hull of the petal unfoldings.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.760
Not quite, actually.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.090
So in the case of k equals 3,
we could think about a convex

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.110
hull, but what I've drawn
here is the smallest

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:04.880
enclosing equilateral triangle.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.060
Now this is the first
class of unfoldings

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.690
we came up with after
the obvious sphere--

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:16.860
or circular one which
had pi cubed over 9pi.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.090
One thing we wondered
is that triangle,

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:26.550
is it better than the
Mozart Kugel wrappings?

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.636
Or is it worse?

01:01:28.636 --> 01:01:30.010
One way or the
other, presumably.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.290
Or maybe it's the same again.

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:33.280
Who knows.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:33.780
Let's see.

01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:37.100
Yeah.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.624
Let me tell you, at this point--
so I need more techniques

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:42.040
to cover both of
those unfoldings,

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.980
but that square is
the first wrapping.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.274
This one.

01:01:48.274 --> 01:01:50.440
I'll have to unfold another
one just so you can see.

01:01:53.702 --> 01:01:54.640
All right.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.510
So you see-- I mean,
I did a few times

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.000
so maybe you already know.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.890
Here I have four corners,
four right angles.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.110
They meet at the top.

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:07.320
So that is-- that's
where the four

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.820
corners of the
square which are also

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.980
the four corners of the
petal come together.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.000
And then it's just
everything-- these lines

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.480
are stretched paths.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.330
There's no distortion around
them, they just kind of unfold.

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:26.010
The stuff in the middle is--
it's like undressing here.

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.890
It's so tantalizing.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.120
The stuff in the middle
is getting contracted.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.860
So if-- I don't know if you
could see, maybe in the video

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.040
you'll be able to see.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.900
Look closely at here.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.950
Along this path there
isn't so much crinkling.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.670
In between there's a
lot more crinkling.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:43.990
It's like here there's
a lot of crinkling.

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:45.460
When I unfold it,
a lot more stuff

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:49.121
happens in between
the four top paths.

01:02:49.121 --> 01:02:49.620
OK?

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.160
Now, they wanted to
cut very simple shapes.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.320
In particular, shapes
that tiled the plane.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.420
So they ended up using squares
instead of the sort of optimal

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:02.555
with that stretched paths
which are those four petals.

01:03:05.122 --> 01:03:07.080
So they used the yellow,
whereas you could just

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:07.770
get away with the blue.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:09.895
Of course, you want to add
a little bit of material

01:03:09.895 --> 01:03:12.680
in the center so it
doesn't fall apart.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.040
And you need to thicken
the edges a little bit.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.740
So they care about that little
yellow minus blue savings?

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.056
I'm not sure.

01:03:21.056 --> 01:03:24.330
But what about the triangle?

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.980
We spend a lot of time
computing these shapes.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.800
It's some weird trigonometry.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.360
It's in the notes.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.540
Arc sine of sine over square
root of 1 over sine squared

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.250
minus cos squared of
various parameters

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.435
is the description of
one of these curves.

01:03:39.435 --> 01:03:41.060
So we did all this
computation and then

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.680
we integrated it to compute
what these areas were and then--

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.690
or figure out exactly what these
shapes were, take the tangents,

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.780
say, well, is the smallest
enclosing triangle better

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:52.940
or worse than the square?

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:58.545
It turns out it's
better by 0.1%.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.780
Now, I think-- millions
of Mozart Kugel

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.430
are made every year.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:13.200
0.1% could equate
to huge savings.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.790
Dollars.

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.710
But just think of
the material wastage

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:20.830
that Furst is committing
by using the square.

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.090
If they used the
triangle instead,

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.830
I mean, this could
solve global warming.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.565
This could solve
chocolate melting.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.230
We actually talk about global
warming in the paper as a joke.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.830
It's a very funny paper.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:39.440
Very silly paper, I should say.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:39.940
Right.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.315
Let me tell you
another wrapping.

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.430
Chalk.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.440
The comb wrapping.

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:07.930
Comb wrapping, we're going
to use the same idea.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.730
Again-- do I really
want to draw this again?

01:05:14.825 --> 01:05:19.670
I'm going to draw those petals,
but instead of connecting them

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.610
at the north pole, we're
going to connect them

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:23.350
along the equator.

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:26.102
This is actually what
happens-- oh, no.

01:05:26.102 --> 01:05:28.560
This is not-- this connects
them at the north pole I guess,

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.840
and it folds them in half.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.350
Whatever.

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:35.060
But I have the equator
nicely denoted here.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.080
So I want to keep the equator
as a new stretched path.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.500
I want that to unfold straight.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.830
But then attached to
it perpendicularly

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.690
are all these
petals which unfold.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:52.400
So the result looks like this.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.150
Here's the equatorial stretched
path and here are the petals.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:59.820
Petals are exactly the
same shapes as before,

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:03.240
so we still have stretched
pads perpendicular like that.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.950
But it's a new way
to cover every point

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:07.340
on the sphere with
stretched paths.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.370
It leads to the blue unfoldings.

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.980
You can take the smallest
enclosing rectangle

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.076
and you get the yellow.

01:06:17.024 --> 01:06:18.440
What do I want to
say about these?

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.570
They're the same
area, of course.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:29.795
They look a lot like these
old cartograms, cartographs--

01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:34.200
whatever you call them--
unfoldings of the earth.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.410
I thought I brought an earth.

01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:37.080
Maybe we didn't bring the earth.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.349
A globe, that is.

01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:41.890
You've seen pictures
maybe like this.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:43.450
They're not unfolded
in the same way.

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.080
They don't have stretched
paths that are perpendicular.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.250
They use some other
projection, so their petals

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.650
are a different shape.

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:51.810
And I'm not sure that
they're contractive--

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.320
or inverse contractive maps.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.810
But same spirit anyway.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.040
Let's see.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:10.410
This one is the
Mirabell unfolding.

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:14.250
Should I unfold another
just to illustrate?

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:15.950
Going through chocolate
like crazy here.

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:19.180
This is the really
hard one to unfold.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.587
So here's one corner--
a little hard to see.

01:07:22.587 --> 01:07:23.920
Where's the equator going to be?

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.270
I think the equator
is around here.

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:28.690
That make sense?

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:29.190
No.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:32.210
Actually it should be
perpendicular to that.

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:34.619
Around here.

01:07:34.619 --> 01:07:35.910
This is a little harder to see.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.350
Here's a corner, actually.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.187
Tucked inside.

01:07:43.187 --> 01:07:45.020
I've been really curious
what kind of robots

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.241
they have to do this.

01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:46.740
All right.

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.531
Here's the equator.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:48.570
Now I can see it.

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:50.420
So this-- the long
edge of the rectangle

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.400
is wrapped around the equator.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.960
See it come off?

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.720
And then the corners
are wrapped up

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.130
against-- so there's
two-- well, yeah,

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:04.810
these guys go on one side,
these guys go on the other.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:06.860
That's the short edge
of the rectangle.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.580
Now we can actually compute how
big these things are, right?

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:14.780
So the-- where's the-- I
have a page about this.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.149
Not much.

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:22.380
The vertical length,
that is one half equator.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.160
So that's pi.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.040
The horizontal length is 2pi.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:36.990
So this is Mirabell
rectangle, pi by 2pi.

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:41.040
And we talked about
the Furst wrapping

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:52.600
which, let's see, this length--
so this goes like this.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.090
So this is 2pi, right?

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:57.649
The diagonal is 2pi.

01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:01.880
So that means this edge
length is root 2pi.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.439
By root 2pi.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:08.779
And magically-- I don't
really have a great reason why

01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.939
this should be the case
but-- well, maybe I

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.760
do-- but these
have the same area.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.790
Both 2pi squared.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.479
Which is like 6pi.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.689
So better than 9ish pi, but
still not quite as good as

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.250
4ish pi.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:29.210
I have some exact numbers.

01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:32.600
More exact numbers?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.220
Oh, I have the perimeters.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.170
So the first wrapping, the
perimeter is 5.7 times pi.

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.540
And the Mirabell
wrapping is 6 times pi.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.415
So reasonable
savings in perimeter.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:48.410
2pi squared.

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:52.359
The equilateral
triangle wrapping--

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:55.710
that one in the top left--
instead of 2pi squared,

01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:00.810
it has area 1.9983pi squared.

01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:06.430
That's the 0.1% improvement.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:07.887
Amazing.

01:10:07.887 --> 01:10:08.720
This was a surprise.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.600
We thought it'd be a fair
amount better or worse

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.641
or the same or something.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.140
But almost the same.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.100
It's not what we expected.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.680
Let's see.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.290
I want to go to packing.

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:25.300
What if you want to do better
than those simple convex

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:25.800
shapes?

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.700
Yeah, equilateral triangles and
squares and rectangles pack.

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.800
But what if I tried to-- what
if I allowed non-convex shapes?

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.040
I still want to tile
the plane, so I'm

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.990
going to lose some
material for that.

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:39.320
I could add some of this
material to the blue guy, some

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.750
to the purple, some to the red.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.980
You can compute the
area of this thing

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.780
and it does a lot better than
the equilateral triangle even.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.190
So now we're getting down there.

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:51.640
The perimeter goes up a
little bit, but not by much.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.690
Packing three petals gives
1.6 times pi squared.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:58.360
Getting better.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.240
By the way, 4pi-- because I'm
going to speak in pi squareds

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:08.050
now-- 4pi is about
1.27pi squared.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:08.550
OK.

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:10.620
So what we want
is 1.27pi squared.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:16.590
At this point, we're at
1.6033 times pi squared.

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:19.820
The comb does better.

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.530
In the limit, you don't
lose zero here in the limit,

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.310
but you lose quite little.

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.840
In the limit you get
1.333 times pi squared.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.089
Versus 1.27.

01:11:31.089 --> 01:11:31.880
That's pretty good.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.830
I think this is-- this is
what we should manufacture.

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:36.330
Maybe.

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:39.940
Of course, the perimeter
goes to infinity also.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.930
Slight problem.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:42.247
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:42.247 --> 01:11:44.080
PROFESSOR: You don't
lose zero in the limit.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.340
For awhile we thought we did.

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.590
You'll have to think about it.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:47.298
It's not obvious.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.630
Really, we have this
two dimensional space.

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.400
It's called the
Pareto curve or-- it's

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.670
a plot of perimeter on
the x-axis versus area

01:11:57.670 --> 01:11:58.350
on the y-axis.

01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:59.770
We want both to be small.

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:04.669
So two-source
wrapping, for example,

01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:05.960
is pretty good in both metrics.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.335
That's where you take the
Voronoi diagram, both the north

01:12:08.335 --> 01:12:09.920
and south pole.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.060
So you actually
have two disks-- one

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.870
for the southern hemisphere, one
for the northern hemisphere--

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:19.360
you get two disks and you
just attach them side by side.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.690
Although-- yeah.

01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:23.190
Let's see.

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.940
What's this one?

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.320
There's the Furst wrapping.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.194
So they're really good
in terms of perimeter.

01:12:28.194 --> 01:12:30.760
In fact, one of the
best perimeters we know.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.570
It's an open problem
how far left you can go.

01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:38.710
The stars are convex
hull of petal wrappings.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:41.540
Because the square was a convex
hull of a four petal wrapping.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.520
This is the convex of
the three petal wrapping.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.880
Now, that doesn't
actually tile, but it

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.344
has the smallest
perimeter we now.

01:12:47.344 --> 01:12:49.010
So it's where you
take the three petals,

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:50.801
but instead of completing
it to a triangle,

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:54.770
you actually make the sharp
turn around the petal.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:13:02.790
So we have three
petals like this.

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:05.460
And so the convex hull
is some tangent here.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.832
And then you follow
the petal for awhile.

01:13:07.832 --> 01:13:09.540
And then you take a
tangent, and then you

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.550
follow the petal for a while,
and then you take a tangent.

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:18.030
So that's the smallest
perimeter unfolding of a sphere

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:19.450
that we know.

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:20.050
Open problem.

01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.190
Can you do better?

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:23.170
Can you get arbitrarily small?

01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:25.120
Probably not.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.800
Some isoperimetry problem.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.060
You can get arbitrarily
low area, arbitrarily

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.100
close to the optimal of 4pi.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.770
That's like the strip wrapping.

01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:37.230
Let's see.

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.560
So that's one limit.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.500
That corresponds to the limit
of petal or comb wrappings.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.750
Petal and comb wrappings,
if you don't take any hulls

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:47.640
or anything, they are the same
area and the same perimeter.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.730
So I think out of
that you should

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:52.150
be able to see why, in the
special case of the square

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.900
and the rectangle, you
get the same stuff.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.750
There's a bijection
between all the parts.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:58.650
Not totally obvious.

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.860
You have to dissect
a little bit.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.230
Mirabell wrappings,
they're not so good.

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:04.890
What are those?

01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:07.880
The convex hull
of comb wrappings.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.880
So they're way out here.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.070
Clearly Furst is better.

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.520
Here's the equilateral
triangle, which you can't tell,

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.540
but it's slightly
below that dashed line.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.712
And pretty good perimeter but
not quite as good as Furst.

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:24.170
So actually, probably, you
don't want to use the triangles.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:25.990
You prefer the lower perimeter.

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.090
But this guy is interesting.

01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:29.550
Anyway, this is a fun space.

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.735
What we kind of really
care about is-- this

01:14:31.735 --> 01:14:32.860
is called the Pareto curve.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.740
It's the, if I give you some
bound on perimeter, what's

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.760
the smallest area I can get?

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.540
This is the best
bound we know so far.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.560
And we know the Pareto
curves below this thing,

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.480
but can you go lower?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.560
We don't know.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.550
So these are some fun examples,
but actually, the big questions

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.050
are still pretty
much unsolved here.

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:53.330
Even if you restrict
to-- I think

01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:56.700
it's fair to restrict to
wrappings of the sphere

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.460
where every point
on the sphere gets

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.850
covered by a stretched path.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:08.280
That seems like a nice,
natural class to think about.

01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:15.640
But we have no idea what
that hull space looks like.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.170
Can you do better than
these particular attempts?

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.140
Looks like we're
doing pretty good,

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.990
but we don't even know
how far left you can go.

01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:25.410
So a pretty neat question.

01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:26.790
And that is Mozart Kugel.

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:29.630
Any questions?

01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:32.558
Other than, can I have some?

01:15:32.558 --> 01:15:33.950
AUDIENCE: Where can we get some?

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.872
PROFESSOR: Where
can you get some.

01:15:35.872 --> 01:15:36.830
That's a good question.

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:40.606
Most European airports
sell Mirabell.

01:15:40.606 --> 01:15:42.980
So if you're flying through
Europe, it's the place to go.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.420
Does anyone know if you
can get them locally?

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.487
I think maybe.

01:15:48.487 --> 01:15:49.950
AUDIENCE: I think Cardullo's.

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:51.720
PROFESSOR: Cardullo's
that's a good place.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.420
In Harvard Square.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.850
They have a lot of
imported chocolates.

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.380
So, yeah, I think
they have Mirabell.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:55.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:55.855 --> 01:15:58.230
There's a lot of imported
chocolates and confectioneries

01:15:58.230 --> 01:15:59.760
in the Pru.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.260
PROFESSOR: In the
Prudential Center.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.200
All right.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.600
These I think you have
to go to Salzburg.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.590
Even in Austria
they're hard to get.

01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:08.462
So these are very special.

01:16:08.462 --> 01:16:12.191
I'll give Marty my second one.

01:16:12.191 --> 01:16:12.690
All right.

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:14.117
That's all for today.

01:16:14.117 --> 01:16:16.700
Hey, there's one thing I forgot
to talk about in lecture which

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.158
I think is really
cool so I'm going

01:16:18.158 --> 01:16:22.100
to add a little bit to
what we were talking about.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.840
We have all these
wrappings of the sphere

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.350
but I never proved to that
they're actually contractive.

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:31.790
How do you prove that all those
wrappings are contractive?

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:36.620
Well, there's a cool theorem we
proved just for this purpose.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:45.055
I'll call it the Cauchy Arm
Lemma on a growing sphere.

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:50.442
It's a nice little connection
to Cauchy's Arm Lemma

01:16:50.442 --> 01:16:55.930
which we talked about in the
context of Cauchy's rigidity

01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:58.920
theorem for polyhedral.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.630
Now, remember,
Cauchy's Arm Lemma

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:04.980
is about you have
some convex chain--

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.260
and actually it applies both
on the plane and the sphere.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.820
So we're thinking
of an open chain

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.153
but we had the property that
even if you add the closing

01:17:13.153 --> 01:17:14.970
edge it's convex.

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:17.520
And then we looked at
a flex of the chain

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.500
where all of the
angles increased

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.920
and we said, if all
the angles increase,

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.676
then this distance
increases, the endpoint--

01:17:25.676 --> 01:17:27.550
the distance between
the endpoints increases.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:30.800
That's regular
Cauchy's Arm Lemma.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.430
But now I want to look at
not growing the angles,

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:38.590
but growing the sphere
that the linkage lives on.

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:40.640
So think of this in
the spherical case,

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:46.570
which we'll-- imagine this
thing is on a sphere and now I

01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:52.030
transform it by taking a
larger sphere, larger radius,

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:55.900
and drawing exactly the same
edge lengths and angles.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.600
Here, I'll draw it
a little bit curved

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.710
because in reality these
edges are great circular arcs.

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:06.800
So this edge length here
matches this length,

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.990
this angle matches this
angle, this edge length

01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:12.350
matches this edge
length, and so on.

01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:15.680
But I draw it on
a bigger sphere.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.840
This theorem says, that the
distance between the endpoints

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.280
will increase also in that case.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.500
So that's kind of neat.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.640
And in the limit, if you take a
ginormous sphere, all the way--

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.170
if you take a really, really
big sphere, it becomes a plane.

01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:36.980
So if I take
something on a sphere

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:42.910
and then I actually draw it on
the plane with the same angle--

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:46.690
so this planar angle
matches this spherical angle

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:50.270
and this length matches this
spherical length-- then,

01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:53.310
in particular, this
distance will increase.

01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:57.460
And in the reverse, if I
take a planar convex chain

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:01.620
and I redraw it on some
sphere, the distance

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:05.070
will go down provided
this thing is also convex.

01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:07.250
So that's the Lemma.

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.882
Now, let me show you
how to use that to prove

01:19:09.882 --> 01:19:11.590
that all those wrappings
are contractive.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.073
It's really easy once
you have this Lemma.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.945
Let's start with
the source wrapping.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.570
So remember, we had a
sphere, the north pole,

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:33.340
and we took all these shortest
paths from the north pole

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.290
to the south pole.

01:19:34.290 --> 01:19:39.340
All of those lines-- I want
to claim that-- and when

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.000
you unfold this you get a really
big disk and all those lines

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.430
become straight.

01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:48.550
So what I need to show is that
between every pair of points,

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:53.502
the distance decreases when
I go from flat to sphere.

01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:55.210
Which is exactly what
happened over here.

01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:59.500
I went from flat to the sphere,
this distance decreased.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.220
So that's how it's
going to be useful.

01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:06.680
If I take two points, like,
say, this point and this point.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.710
Any two points.

01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:13.940
They live on one of these
spokes that goes to the center.

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.040
So draw those two
segments to the center

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.340
which was the north pole here.

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.740
So if I take the corresponding
two points up here,

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.690
I'm looking at that
path and that path.

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:28.146
Well, that's a convex chain
and the distance between them--

01:20:28.146 --> 01:20:31.260
between those two points that
I started with, say, x and y,

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:36.270
is exactly the closing
distance of that convex chain.

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.650
So here's a convex chain,
it matches the angles

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:41.200
and the lengths of this
convex chain and the plane.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.160
Therefore, this distance is
larger than this distance.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.980
And so this is a
contractive map because it

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.240
works for any two
points x and y.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.150
So that's the source wrapping.

01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:54.470
With slightly more effort,
slightly more interesting

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:59.550
example, is the petal wrappings.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.865
So think about one petal.

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:08.550
So let's say I just take-- in
fact, just think about half

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:10.420
of a petal.

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:14.240
So we had a petal look
something like that

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.960
going to the south pole here.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:23.340
And so we bisected this thing
and then we took lots of ribs

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.270
like that.

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:25.580
So that's one half petal.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:32.760
So when you unfold,
it looks like this.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.890
Take any two points
on the half petal.

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.920
I'll show, first of all, that
the half petal is contractive.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.710
So I take two points, say,
this one and this one,

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.170
call them x and y.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:52.100
Now I take this rib,
this rib and this rib.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.950
Those are the
stretched paths again.

01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.120
They map to whatever up here.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.880
Again, it's a
convex chain and so

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.760
this distance increases
when you go to the sphere

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.850
because it's convex
in both scenarios.

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:06.800
So that's half petals.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.830
Now, when you worry
about a full petal

01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:11.038
and you want to show the
whole wrapping is expansive,

01:22:11.038 --> 01:22:14.940
you actually use a
different method.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.850
So let's say we take
a whole petal here.

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:22.880
And I want to show not
only any pair of points

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:27.370
within a single half petal
contract but, in fact,

01:22:27.370 --> 01:22:30.440
any two vertices, any
two points contract.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.190
So I'm going to take x
and some other point.

01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:35.000
Now I'll call it z.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.360
If I did the-- just looked
at the stretched paths,

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.560
that's no longer convex.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.100
I can't use the same trick.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.400
But here's a new trick.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.075
I take a straight line, a
shortest path from x to z,

01:22:47.075 --> 01:22:50.570
which gives me a new
point y in the middle.

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:53.070
Now I know that this
distance contracts

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.700
because that's within
a single half petal.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.090
So by the previous
argument, and by looking

01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:01.820
at that little chain, I
know by this Arm Lemma

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:04.830
that distance contracts, I know
that this distance contracts.

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:06.840
So what about the
whole distance?

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.980
Well, if I look at the
distance from x to z--

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:15.790
that's what I care about--
let's say, in the plane,

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:18.460
this equals the sum
of those distances.

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.210
Because we drew a
straight line, it

01:23:20.210 --> 01:23:23.400
equals the distance from x to y
plus the distance from y to z.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.020
Now, I mapped these
onto the sphere,

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.540
call that d prime is
the spherical distance.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.320
I know that when I look
at d prime I contract.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.330
So d prime of xy is going
to be smaller for xy,

01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:43.000
it's going to be smaller for yz.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.930
What I really care
about is the distance

01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:47.800
of the sphere between x and z.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.840
But this is the
triangle inequality.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:57.570
If you have a triangle xyz,
the distance from x to z

01:23:57.570 --> 01:24:00.100
is always, at most,
the distance from x

01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.980
to y plus the
distance from y to z.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.841
That holds in any metric space.

01:24:03.841 --> 01:24:05.590
So, in particular, it
holds on the sphere.

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:06.714
So this is sort of trivial.

01:24:06.714 --> 01:24:08.550
This is triangle inequality.

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:12.950
And this was the contractiveness
that we already prove.

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:14.250
And this is just equal.

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.060
And so we get that
the new distance

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.550
is a contraction of
the old distance.

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:20.110
So that works on a full petal.

01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:22.150
It actually-- this
exact same technique

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:25.040
works if you have a
full petal unfolding.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.440
Maybe you have
something like this.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.170
And you take-- finish it off--
you take two points anywhere

01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:36.230
on any two petals,
like here and here, you

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:38.940
take the shortest
path between them

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.820
and again, you
could argue, well,

01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:44.015
this is going to contract
because it is in a single half

01:24:44.015 --> 01:24:45.890
petal, this is going to
contract because it's

01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:47.150
in a single have petal.

01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:49.770
Therefore, that sum
will also contract

01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:51.630
by exactly the same argument.

01:24:51.630 --> 01:24:53.960
And you can use that for
the comb wrapping too.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.870
This is kind of neat
with this little Lemma

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.370
about growing spheres and
showing the distances increase,

01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:01.880
you get to prove that all of
these wrappings are contractive

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.754
and therefore all these
things I was claiming

01:25:03.754 --> 01:25:05.090
were working really do work.

01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:09.170
You can formalize that
in a simple little way.
