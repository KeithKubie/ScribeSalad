The first thing we want to check is whether the sound manager is actually

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.902
enabled. We define default settings for looping and volume. And we reset them

00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:15.790
if they are actually defined. Next, we use the path that was passed in earlier,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.310
to locate the sound effect. We create a new audio buffer source. Next we tell

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.224
the source which sound to play, and pass in the volume, whether it's looping

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:37.741
and connected to the gain node. Finally, we simply play the sound clip. [MUSIC]
