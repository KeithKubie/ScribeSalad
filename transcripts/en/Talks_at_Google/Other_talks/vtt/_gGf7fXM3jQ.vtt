00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Today's speaker -- I'm
not going to go on and on about all of his

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.219
qualifications because you already know that.
So I'm going to turn it right away to data

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.540
because he likes data. In 2007, our speaker
came here and spoke about his book 'The Stuff

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:26.100
of Thought'. Now when that YouTube video went
up, it rapidly ascended the charts. He has

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.610
over 175,000 views now. For a talk that is
an hour 15 minutes, that is a lot of eyeball

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.870
time. I appreciate that. He's in the top 15
out of 1100 plus videos. And he's in the company

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:50.129
of Lady Gaga, Conan O'Brien, Christopher Hitchens.
Noam Chomsky and someone we all love, Randall

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.269
Monroe. Now, today we are fortunate enough
to have him come speak to us, the linguist,

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.070
psychologist, Harvard professor, I'll throw
that in, to speak about his new book 'The

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.690
Better Angels of our Nature: why violence
has declined'. Please welcome Steven Pinker.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.710
[Applause]

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:21.040
&gt;&gt; Steven Pinker: Believe it or not -- and
I know most people do not -- violence has

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.200
been in decline for long stretches of time.
And we may be living in the most peaceful

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.710
era in our species' existence. The decline
of

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.830
violence has not been steady. It has not brought
violence down to zero and it is not guaranteed

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.500
to continue. But I hope to persuade you that
it is a persistent historical development

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.810
visible on scales from millennia to years
from wars to genocides to the spanking of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.100
children and the treatment of animals. I'm
going to walk you through six major historical

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.890
declines of violence. Identify their immediate
causes in terms of particular historical events

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.450
of the era. And then try to tie them together
in terms of their ultimate causes. That is,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.051
general historical forces interacting with
human nature. The first historical decline

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:19.330
I call the pacification process. Until 5,000
years ago, people everywhere lived in a state

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.250
of anarchy without central government. What
was life like in this so-called state of nature?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.000
This is a question that thinkers have speculated
on for hundreds of years. Thomas Hobbes famously

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.510
said that an a state of nature the life of
man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.540
short. A century later, Jean-Jacques Rousseau
countered that "nothing can be more gentle

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.590
than him in his primitive state." Both men
were talking through their hats. Neither of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.209
them had any idea what life was like in a
state of nature. But today we can do better

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.820
because there are two sources of evidence
about rates of violence in non-state societies.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.500
The first is forensic archeology. You can
think of this as CSI Paleolithic. [laughter]

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.819
Mainly what proportion of prehistoric skeletons
have signs of violent trauma such as bashed

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:21.740
in skulls, decapitations, arrow heads embedded
in bones, or mummies found with ropes around

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:29.099
their necks? There are, I found 20 estimates
and they span quite a range, but the average

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:35.940
is 15 percent. That is, 15 percent of people
in these samples died violently. Let's compare

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.099
that 15 percent sample to those from some
more recent periods for example Europe and

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:49.709
the United States in the 20th century at 6/10th
of a percentage point. If we include the entire

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.629
century, the entire world and all violent
deaths including those from genocides and

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.050
man-made famines, we can get the figure up
to about 3% and if we look at the world as

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.060
a whole in the year 2005, the bar is less
than a pixel high. It comes in at 3/100ths

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.480
of a percentage point. The second source of
evidence of violence in non-state societies

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:24.030
comes from ethnographic. The wave of government
that expanded out of the first civilizations

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.240
left a few pockets on earth in which the people
still lived in anarchy until recently namely

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.500
hunter gatherers and hunter horticulturalists.
Ethnographers, in many cases, have tabulated

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.180
the various kinds of death in those societies.
Here are 27 estimates. And once again they

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.940
span quite a range, but their average is 524
per 100,000 per year. That is about a half

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.600
of a percentage point per year. Again, let's
compare that to some figures for states and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.500
I'll pick some notoriously violent states
in their most violent periods for comparison

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.810
just to stack the deck against states. Here
we have Germany in the 20th century, two world

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.090
wars, and the figure is 160 per 100,000 per
year. Here is Russia in the 20th century

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.020
two world wars and a civil war at 140. Here
is Japan in the 20th century a world war that

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.520
ended with two nuclear strikes at about 40.
Here is the United States in the 20th century,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.500
two world wars and half a dozen other foreign
wars, less than 4 per 100,000 per year. Here's

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.639
the world as a whole in the 20th century again
throwing in all the genocides and man-made

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.460
famines, indirect deaths from war and it comes
up to 60 per 100,000 per year. And here's

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:57.850
the world in the year 2005, less than a pixel
high, with a rate of about 3/10ths of battle

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.870
death per 100,000 per year. So when it comes
to life in a state of nature, not to put too

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.009
fine a point on it, but Hobbes was right Rousseau
was wrong. The immediate cause was the rise

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.800
in the expansion of states leading to the
Paxes or pieces that history students read

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.340
about, the Pax Romana, Pax Islamica, Pax Hispanica,
and so on. Where the conquest by a state or

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.830
empire tends to drive down rates of violence
in the subjugated people not because the early

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.919
kings and emperors had a benevolent interest
in the welfare of their citizens but rather

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.940
because tribal raiding and feuding is a nuisance
to imperial overlords since it just settles

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.180
scores among them
or shuffles resources at a dead loss to the

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.160
king or emperor who just as soon keep the
people alive to supply him with taxes and

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.970
soldiers and slaves. So just as a farmer has
incentive to prevent his cattle from killing

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.350
each other, so a king or emperor has an interest
in stamping out the nuisance of tribal raiding

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.650
and feuding. The second historical decline
of violence can be illustrated by this wood

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:22.070
cut of a day in the life of middle ages. [laughter]
And the process that brought this under control,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.949
for reasons that will soon become clear, has
been called the civilizing process. In many

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:32.430
parts of Europe homicide statistics go back
literally hundreds of years and historical

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.460
criminologists have plotted them over time.
Here we have a plot of the number of estimates

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:44.949
of homicide in England 1200 to the present
plotted on a logarithmic scale from a tenth

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:51.180
of a homicide per 100 thousand per year to
1 to 10 to 100. As you can see there is a

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.930
dramatic decline over the centuries so that
a contemporary Englishman has approximately

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:04.460
1/35th chance of being murdered as his medieval
ancestor. This process unfolded not just in

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.520
England but in every European country for
which we have data. This graph shows Italy,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:17.210
Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia.
Here we have the average of those regions.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.680
And for the sake of comparison, I've also
plotted the 524 per 100 thousand per year

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:30.080
for nonstate societies. This gap is what I
call the pacification process. This subsequent

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.640
decline I'm calling the civilizing
process. The name comes from a classic book

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.209
by the German sociologist, Norbert Elias,
who argued that in the transition from middle

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:49.060
ages to modernity, Europe underwent consolidation
of central states and kingdoms, out of the

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:56.570
patchwork of baronies, principalities and
duchies, with it criminal justice was nationalized

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:02.240
and the constant feuding among the war lords
of the era, otherwise known as knights, gave

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.910
way to the king's justice. At the same time,
there was a growing infrastructure of commerce.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:14.310
There were financial instruments such as money
and contracts that could be recognized within

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:20.410
the borders of the newly consolidated states
and there were advances in the technology

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.700
of trade -- better roads and carts and instruments
of time keeping -- which shifted the incentive

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.330
structure from zero sum plunder to positive
sum trade, a point that I will return to.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.810
The third historical decline of violence can
be illustrated by considering some of the

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:45.540
ways in which the early kingdoms enforced
law and order within their boundaries, punishments

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:54.120
such as breaking on the wheel, burning at
the stake clawing, sawing in half, and impalement.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.660
But in a process that's been called the humanitarian
revolution, these brutal, sadistic forms of

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.570
corporal punishment were abolished. They were
abolished within a fairly narrow window centered

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:12.160
in the second half of the 18th century.
Here we have a time line from 1650 to 1850

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.630
showing a number of major states in the era
that abolished cruel physical punishments

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:25.310
including the United States with its famous
prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.860
in the eighth amendment to the constitution.
Also abolished during this period was the

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:37.420
profligate application of the death penalty
for nonlethal crimes. 18th century England

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.600
had 222 capital offenses on the books including
poaching, counterfeiting, robbing a rabbit

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.250
warren, being in the company of gypsies and
strong evidence of malice in a child 7 to

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:56.709
14 years of age. [laughter] The death penalty
was not just on the -- in the law books, but

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:02.600
was exuberantly applied. Samuel Johnson writes
of a girl 7 years old who was hanged for stealing

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:09.330
a petticoat. By 1861 the number of capital
crimes had been reduced to 4. Likewise, in

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.620
the United States in the 17th and 18th centuries,
the death penalty was prescribed and used

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:20.920
for thefts, sodomy, bestiality, adultery,
witchcraft, concealing birth, slave revolt,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.810
counterfeiting. Here we have a graph that
extends from 1650 to the year 2000 showing

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:31.020
the percentage of American executions for
crimes other than murder. In the colonial

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:37.560
and early federal, period a majority of the
executions were for nonlethal crimes. In recent

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.589
years the only crime other than murder that
has been punished by death has been conspiracy

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:48.149
to commit murder. The death penalty itself,
of course, has been abolished throughout the

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:53.990
western world except in the United States.
This time line shows that just about every

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.750
European country has abolished capital punishment.
Most of the abolitions have taken place in

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:07.529
the last 60 years or so but well before that
European countries lost their taste for executing

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:12.230
people. The blue line shows the number of
European countries that actually execute people

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.769
whether or not they have capital punishment
on the books. And you can see that there's

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:22.130
been a steady erosion of the application of
the death penalty before it was stricken from

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:29.260
the law books. Now, the United States is famously
an outlier or I should say 34 of the 50 states

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.730
are outliers because 16 has abolished it a
number of that has increased by five in just

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:40.110
the last decade. But even in the United States,
the death penalty is a shadow of its former

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:46.579
self. Here we have a graph from 1625 to 2000
showing the number of American executions

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:54.890
per capita. The graph shows that the execution
rate has plunged. Today for all its notoriety,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:13:01.120
the death penalty is applied approximately
45 times a year in a country that has almost

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:08.110
17,000 homicides. Also abolished during the
humanitarian revolution were witch hunts,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:14.100
religious persecution, such as burning heretics
at the stake. . Dueling, blood sports, debtors

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:21.080
prisons and perhaps most famously, slavery.
Slavery used to be legal everywhere on earth.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.490
As you can see the number of states that abolished
slavery in the 1600. But in a process that

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.580
began in the second half of the 18th century
it was targeted for elimination in country

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:40.310
after country; a process that reached its
completion in 1980 when the last spot on earth,

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.450
Mauritania, finally abolished slavery. And
so, for the first time in history, slavery

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:51.510
is now illegal everywhere on earth. What were
the immediate causes of the humanitarian revolution?

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:58.589
One might guess that it was due to affluence.
Perhaps as people's lives become longer and

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:03.139
more pleasant, they put a higher value on
their own lives and, by extension, on life

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:09.660
in general. Unfortunately, the timing doesn't
work. If you look at per capita income in

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.500
England, you see that it really only took
off with the advent of the industrial revolution

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:22.330
in the 19th century. Prior to that, income
was largely flat barely above the middle ages.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:29.880
Yet these humanitarian reforms were concentrated
in the 18th century. A more likely hypothesis

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:37.990
i s that it was a gift of printing and literacy.
The only technology to have shown an increase

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:44.070
in productivity prior to the industrial revolution
was book production. This graph from 1500

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:53.070
to 1850 shows that efficiency in book production
went up by a factor of 25 prior to the 18th

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:58.800
century. The technology was put into use and
there was an exponential increase in the number

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:05.600
of books published per decade in England in
the 18th century. Kind of an early Moore's

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.690
law. And not surprisingly, there were more
people who could read these books. In the

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:16.680
18th century, for the first time, a majority
of Englishmen were literate. Why should literacy

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:23.550
matter? Well, there's a reason we also call
this era the Enlightenment. Namely with widespread

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:30.670
literacy, knowledge began to replace superstition
and ignorance. If a large percentage of the

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:36.870
population is disabused of certain notions
such as that Jews poison wells, heretics go

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.779
to hell, witches cause crop failures, children
are possessed by the devil, Africans are brutish,

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:49.800
and so on. That will undermine many rationales
for institutionalized violence. As Voltaire

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:56.990
said in this era, those who can make you believe
leave absurdities can make you commit atrocities.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:05.329
Also literacy is a technology of cosmopolitanism.
Of exposing people to new ideas and ways of

00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:12.630
life and perspectives. It is plausible that,
as people consume more fiction and history

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:20.480
and journalism, they tend to get into the
habit of imagining life from other people's

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.670
point of view. And it is also plausible that
that could expand their circle of empathy

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:32.790
and lead to less cruelty. That is, if you
habitually try to imagine what life was like

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:37.290
from other people's points of view perhaps
you take a little less pleasure in watching

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:44.550
them be burned to death. This is a point I
will return to later in the talk. The fourth

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:50.399
decline of violence has been called the long
peace. And it speaks to the widespread belief

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:56.550
that the 20th century was the most violent
in history. However, no one who makes this

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:02.790
claim, ever cites numbers from any century
other than the 20th. So it is a trend that

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:08.889
has been projected from one data point. In
fact, even if you just look at the proceeding

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:15.971
century often held up as a peaceful predecessor,
you see that it was far from peaceful. It

00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:22.289
is true that there were two interludes in
the 19th century in which Europe had a relative

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:27.199
lull in war. But, if you look at the entire
century and you look at the entire world,

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:33.279
you see there were many episodes of mass violence
including the Napoleonic Wars with 4 million

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:38.330
deaths, the Taiping Rebellion in China, the
most destructive civil war in history with

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:44.740
20 million deaths. The most destructive war
in American history the Civil War with 650,000.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.299
The conquests of Shaka Zulu in southern Africa
which killed perhaps one to two million people.

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:55.840
I don't want to leave any continent out so
here's one from South America. The War of

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.299
the Triple Alliance killed perhaps 60 percent
of the population of Paraguay which might

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:07.260
make it the most destructive war between countries
in history, proportionally speaking. And then,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.289
there were slave raiding wars in Africa and
Imperial wars in Africa, Asia and the South

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:19.720
Pacific whose death tolls are impossible to
estimate. Also, while it is true that the

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.950
Second World War claimed the largest number
of lives of any catastrophe in history, it's

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.669
not clear that it was the deadliest event
in terms of the proportion of the world's

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:34.979
population because many, many more people
lived in the middle of the 20th century than

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:42.200
in any proceeding century. Here I've plotted
the 100 worst things that people have ever

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:49.190
done to each other that we know of. The numbers
come from a man who calls himself an atrocitologist,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:56.539
Matthew White, from his forthcoming book,
"The Great Book of Horrible Things." [laughter]

00:18:56.539 --> 00:19:04.700
I've taken White's estimated death tolls and
scaled them by the population of the world

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.859
at the time. When you do that, you see that
World War II only comes in at ninth place

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:16.609
and World War I doesn't even make the top
ten. Moreover, the worst atrocities in history

00:19:16.609 --> 00:19:22.769
are pretty evenly sprinkled over 2500 years
of human history. Now of course you can't

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:29.840
help but notice there also is is a funnel
of data points as you get closer to the present

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.080
in the last 500 years. Presumably that does
not mean that in ancient times they only committed

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:40.940
massive atrocities [laughter] and more recently
we commit massive, medium sized and small

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:47.259
atrocities. A more plausible explanation is
that the historical record is far more complete

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:53.059
the closer you get to the present. So let's
zoom in on the last 500 years -- the period

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:58.859
for which the data can actually be plotted
more continuously. The political scientist

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:05.429
Jack Levy has assembled a data set of Great
Power Wars. These are wars that involve one

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:11.269
of the 800 pound gorillas of the day. Namely
countries that can project military force

00:20:11.269 --> 00:20:17.620
beyond their own borders and which account
for the majority of deaths in war from all

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:25.399
wars combined. The first time series shows
the percentage of years the great powers fought

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:33.639
each other from 1500 to the last quarter of
the 20th century. And as you can see, in a

00:20:33.639 --> 00:20:38.639
few centuries ago, the great powers were pretty
much always at war. The line hits 100 percent

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:43.590
a number of times. That's just what great
powers did. And more recently, they've hardly

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:50.229
ever been at war. Here we see the duration
of wars involving a great power from 1500

00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:57.950
to 2000. Which shows another decline. There
used to be things like the 30 years war, the

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:04.379
80 years war, the 100 years war. The 20th
century had the 6-day war. Here we have the

00:21:04.379 --> 00:21:09.460
frequency of wars involving a great power,
which again shows a decline in how often a

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.940
great power would pick a fight that ended
in war. However, there is a one trend that

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.549
goes in the opposite direction that gets worse.
And that is how many deaths could be amassed

00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:28.229
once a war began per country per year. And
here we have an increase -- it's plotted on

00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:34.849
a logarithmic scale. So it's an exponential
increase. Until 1950 when the curve does a

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:41.139
U-turn. So we are now living through a period
where for the first time in history, both

00:21:41.139 --> 00:21:47.599
the frequency of wars and the amount of damage
that they do per country per year, has been

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:54.289
in decline. If you combine these measures
into an aggregate graph of total number of

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:59.710
people killed in wars involving a great power,
you get a jagged line, but one that ends in

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:07.119
a point that is a minimum in this time series.
That is, we are living in a time that has

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:14.179
a record low number of deaths in wars involving
a great power. If we now zoom in on the last

00:22:14.179 --> 00:22:19.109
century for which the -- instead of plotting
it as four data points -- we get the following

00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:25.049
curve where undoubtedly the 20th century did
have two blood baths, corresponding to the

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:30.919
two world wars, but it was not an escalating
series or a new normal but rather more like

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:38.090
a last gasp. And the last 60 years the rate
of death in warfare is historically quite

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:43.389
low. This is the period that has been called
the long peace. The fact that since 1946 there

00:22:43.389 --> 00:22:49.610
has been historically unprecedented decline
in war between countries, that is, interstate

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:55.379
wars. There were zero wars between the two
biggest great powers the so-called superpowers

00:22:55.379 --> 00:23:00.909
the U.S. and the Soviet Union contrary to
all predictions by the experts of the era

00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:07.739
as those of us who lived through the era recall.
No nuclear weapon has been used since Nagasaki,

00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:13.330
again contrary to expert prediction. There
have been no wars between the great powers

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:20.070
since the end of the Korean War in 1953. No
wars between western European countries. A

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:26.629
fact that almost seems boring and banal like
who would ever expect say, France and Germany,

00:23:26.629 --> 00:23:32.859
to fight a war? [laughter] Needless to say
this is a historically unusual state of affairs.

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:41.179
In fact, prior to 1945, western European countries
started two new wars a year for 600 years.

00:23:41.179 --> 00:23:45.460
That went down to zero. And there have been
no wars between developed countries -- the

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.320
40 or so with the highest GDP per capita.
Again that might seem too obvious to mention.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.909
We think of wars as things that happen in
remote, poor parts of the world. But for most

00:23:55.909 --> 00:24:01.999
of history, it was the rich countries that
were constantly at each other's throats. Well,

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:06.879
what about the rest of the world other than
the great powers or the rich and European

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:12.119
states? Well there's a little appreciated
process that I call the 'new peace' that applies

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:18.190
to the world as a whole. Since 1946, as I
mentioned, there have been fewer interstate

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:25.429
wars. There have been however more civil wars
as newly independent states with inept governments

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:32.389
fought off insurgent movements in civil wars
with both sides armed financed and egged on

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:39.809
by the Cold War superpowers. Let me just show
you that time series. I'll show it as a stacked

00:24:39.809 --> 00:24:45.599
layer graph where the thickness of each layer
corresponds to the number of wars. And for

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:51.269
this graph a war is defined as a armed conflict
with a government on least on one side that

00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:58.559
results in as few as 25 deaths a year. So
it's an inclusive graph. The bottom most layer

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:03.980
shows the number of colonial wars and that's
a category of war that no longer exists as

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:10.029
the European empires gave up their colonies.
Here we have interstate wars a government

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:16.609
on each side and those have been tapering
off. Here, however, we see the number of civil

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:21.200
wars -- both the number of pure civil wars
and the number of internationalized civil

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:27.470
wars where some foreign power has butted in
to prop up the government against an insurgent

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:33.850
movement. But notice two things -- first of
all, even the the number of civil wars reached

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:41.389
a peek in the early 1990s and, with the end
of the cold war, has begun to fall. Also,

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:47.370
the crucial question is which wars kill more
people?" The many civil wars that the world

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:55.570
has seen recently or the small number of interstate
wars that have been tapering off? This graph

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:04.359
shows that the -- how much damage an interstate
war has done per war per year plotted decade

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:11.750
by decade. And it shows that the deadliness
of interstate wars has been in steady decline.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.559
Here we have the amount of damage done by
internationalized civil wars and pure civil

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:24.159
wars. And we see that civil wars of the recent
decades are far less destructive than the

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:30.259
interstate wars of earlier decades. So if
you now aggregate the total number of deaths

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:36.009
from all wars combined, you get a pattern
as follows. Again, I'll show it as a stacked

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:41.690
layer graph. Here we have the number of -- the
rate of death from colonial wars which has

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:46.929
petered out to zero. The number of deaths
from interstate wars which has followed a

00:26:46.929 --> 00:26:54.049
jagged, bumpy but yet downward trajectory
with peaks corresponding to the Korean War,

00:26:54.049 --> 00:27:01.139
the Vietnam War, and the Iran/Iraq war. And
here we have the pure civil wars and the internationalized

00:27:01.139 --> 00:27:07.679
civil wars. And you can see that, despite
their number, the limited damage they do results

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:15.139
in an overall trend that is bumpy but unmistakably
downward. Here we are in the last few years

00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:21.039
of the first decade of the 21st century with
a thin laminate showing that the world has

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:29.120
recently had a remarkably low rate of death
in warfare. So the dream of the 1960s folks

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:36.059
singers is starting to come true. Namely the
world has almost put an end to war. Well,

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:41.509
what about genocide? It's often claimed that
more people in the 20th century died from

00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:50.099
genocide than from war. In fact, the 20th
century has been called the Age of Genocide.

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:58.309
This is a trend based on one point. And historians
who look at genocide through the ages unanimously

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:03.359
reject the idea that the 20th century was
the age of genocide. I'll read to you from

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:10.000
page 1 the historian Kurt Jonassohn and Fred
Chalk's The History of Genocide. "Genocide"

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.559
they note, "has been practiced in all regions
of the world and during all

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:20.169
periods of history. We know that in ancient
times empires have disappeared and the cities

00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:24.229
destroyed, but we do not know what happened
to the bulk of the populations involved in

00:28:24.229 --> 00:28:29.489
these events. Their fate was simply too unimportant.
When they were mentioned at all they were

00:28:29.489 --> 00:28:34.330
usually lumped together with the herds, oxen
and sheep and or livestock. Looking at the

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.840
available evidence from antiquity one might
developed a hypothesis that most wars at the

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.080
time were genocidal in character." What do
they have in mind? Well, just think of the

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:51.519
Old Testament which has a genocide every few
pages commanded, by the way, by God. And so,

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:57.779
the Amalekites, Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites,
and so on were put to the edge of the sword,

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:03.639
every last man, woman, and child massacred.
Now I don't believe that these events actually

00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:08.779
took place. And archaeologists can find no
evidence of them. But they do record a common

00:29:08.779 --> 00:29:14.789
practice of the time. And a common attitude
of the time. Namely, there's nothing particularly

00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:20.509
wrong with genocide as long as it doesn't
happen to you. More historically plausible

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:26.990
are the massacres by the Athenians in Milos,
the Romans in Carthage, the Mongol invasions,

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:35.729
the Crusades, the European wars of religion,
and colonization of Americas, Africa, and

00:29:35.729 --> 00:29:41.009
Australia. What about the 20th century? This
is a period in which we can at least roughly

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:48.570
trace out a timeline. Do the genocides in
Bosnia and Rwanda prove that the world learned

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:54.050
nothing from the Holocaust as is often claimed
and that nothing has changed. Well here we

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:59.859
have a couple of time series on deaths from
genocide in the 20th century. And it is undoubtedly

00:29:59.859 --> 00:30:06.799
true that there was a horrific spike of blood
letting in the middle decades of the 20th

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:10.729
century. Nonetheless, this was not a new normal.
It is not the case that nothing has changed

00:30:10.729 --> 00:30:17.339
since then and the rate of death of genocide
has gone bumpily downward and in the last

00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:23.879
decade is in fact at a low for the century.
What would the immediate causes of the Long

00:30:23.879 --> 00:30:30.899
Peace and the New Peace? Three possibilities
were put forward by Immanuel Kant more than

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:38.059
200 years ago in his essay, Perpetual Peace,
where he argued democracy, trade and an international

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:44.610
community were all forces that would disincentivize
nations from warring with each other. More

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:50.130
recently Bruce Russett and John Oneal have
tested Kant's theory in a large regression

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:56.070
analysis, have found all three of these factors
increased in the second half of the 20th century

00:30:56.070 --> 00:31:02.190
and all of them are statistical predictors
of peace holding all else constant. Here we

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:07.969
see the trajectory of democracy from 1945
to the present. And you can see that the number

00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:12.910
of democracies has been increasing. The number
of autocracies has been decreasing. Today

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:19.549
there are many democracies than autocracies
in the world. This is by no means a foregone

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:26.119
conclusion. In 1975, not surprisingly, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan wrote an essay in which he

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:31.619
said democracy was going to go the way of
monarchy. It was an institution that had its

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:38.839
day in the sun but that was on its way out.
Fortunately, he turned out to be incorrect.

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:45.399
Here we see the trajectory of international
trade from the 1890s to the present. And you

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:50.109
can see that there has been a skyrocketing
of international trade since the end of the

00:31:50.109 --> 00:31:55.769
Second World War. Here we have membership
in intergovernmental organizations from the

00:31:55.769 --> 00:32:01.309
late 19th century to the present and that
has increased with a bump after World War

00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:07.159
II. And another kind of international community
consists of the closest that we have to an

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:13.369
international police force namely peace keeping
operations. Soldiers in blue helmets from

00:32:13.369 --> 00:32:19.570
the United Nations and other coalitions. Those
have increased particularly after the end

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:26.909
of the Cold War but more important than the
number of missions is the number of soldiers

00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:33.539
deployed to get in between warring parties
and other investigations have shown that although

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:38.879
peace keeping missions don't always keep the
peace and we can always think of some spectacular

00:32:38.879 --> 00:32:44.109
failures, statistically, they do keep the
peace more often than when the two sides are

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:51.959
left to fight it out to the bitter end. The
final decline of violence that I discuss,

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:58.580
I call the Rights Revolutions. The targeting
of violence on smaller scales, directed against

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:08.080
vulnerable sectors of the population such
as racial minorities, women, children, homosexuals

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:14.859
and animals. The Civil Rights Movement eliminated
the practice of lynching which used to take

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:22.779
place in the late 19th century at 150 a year.
By 1950, that had gone down to zero. More

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:28.200
recently, it has taken aims at the hate crime
murders of blacks which were never really

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.080
plentiful. They were about five per year when
the FBI started recording them. They have

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:39.869
now fallen to one per year. The number of
non-lethal hate crimes against blacks, such

00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:45.320
as intimidation and assault. have gone down
since the FBI first started recording them.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.039
And the kind of racist attitudes that could
erupt in violence against racial minorities

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:57.830
has been in steady decline. This graph shows
the percentage of white Americans that agree

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:03.279
with the statement that black and white students
should go to separate schools from 1940 to

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:09.409
the present or that say that they would move
out if a black family moved in next door.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:14.700
The responses now are in the range of crank
opinion and the questions are no longer asked

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:21.889
on the surveys because the answers are considered
to be noise -- indistinguishable from zero.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:27.649
This is a worldwide trend. Here we have a
graph showing the number of countries that

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:34.329
discriminate against ethnic minorities with
various kinds of Jim Crow or apartheid laws.

00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:39.490
That has been in steady decline since 1950.
The blue line shows countries that have done

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:44.849
the opposite, that have bent over backwards
to remediate the effects of past discrimination

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:49.629
with affirmative action policies. And now,
we have more countries with affirmative action

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:57.950
policies than with discriminatory policies.
The women's rights movement has seen an 80

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:02.539
percent decrease in the rate of rape since
it was first estimated by the FBI in the early

00:35:02.539 --> 00:35:11.599
1970s. A similarly dramatic decline in the
rate of domestic violence against women. And

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:17.900
a sharp decline in the most extreme form of
domestic violence namely uxorcide, the murder

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:24.040
of wives and girlfriends and mariticide, the
murder of husbands and boyfriends. Here we

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:29.460
have the rate of murder of female victims,
partners and male partners. You can see that

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:36.079
actually the decline is steeper for male victims
even than female victims. The women's movement

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:43.430
has been very, very good for husbands. [laughter]
The children's rights movement has seen a

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:48.260
steady decline in the number of American states
that allow paddling or corporal punishment

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:54.230
in schools. Every opinion poll has shown a
decrease in the percentage of people in western

00:35:54.230 --> 00:36:01.130
societies that approve of spanking. The rate
of child abuse both physical and sexual has

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:07.849
gone down since they were first measured in
1990. And the victimization of children in

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:13.940
school by fights and other nonfatal crimes
has also gone down since they were first measured.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:18.710
The gay rights movement has seen an increase
in the number of states that have decriminalized

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:26.119
homosexuality both nation states worldwide
and states with in the United States of America.

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:32.660
It is now at 100 percent following a Supreme
Court ruling. Every opinion poll has shown

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.369
antigay attitudes have been in decline such
as whether homosexuality is morally wrong

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:43.960
and should be made illegal. And hate crime
intimidations has been in in decline since

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:49.769
the FBI started measuring them. Finally the
animal rights movement has seen a decline

00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:57.740
in hunting. An increase in vegetarianism both
in the UK and in the U.S. And a sharp decline

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:05.430
in the number of motion pictures in which
animals were harmed. Now, we face the question

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:12.610
why has violence declined on so many scales
of time and magnitude? One possibility is

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:18.480
that human nature itself has changed and that
somehow all of our taste for violence has

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:24.990
literally been bred out of us. I consider
this hypothesis to be unlikely. For one thing

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:32.070
our children still seem to be plenty violent.
A large number of 2-year-olds kick, bite,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:39.799
and hit. Little boys, in all cultures, play
fight. Grown up little boys and little girls

00:37:39.799 --> 00:37:45.809
continue to take great pleasure in vicarious
violence such as murder mysteries, Greek tragedies,

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:52.920
Shakespearean dramas, video games, hockey
[laughter] and movie starring a certain ex-governor

00:37:52.920 --> 00:38:00.819
of California. And we all seem prone to homicidal
fantasies. Social psychologists have asked

00:38:00.819 --> 00:38:06.039
their subjects the following question, "have
you ever fantasized about killing someone

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:10.799
you don't like. Say someone who has stolen
your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone who

00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:17.920
has humiliated you in public?" The results
are that about 15 percent of women and more

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:24.119
than a third of men frequently think about
killing people they don't like. And more than

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:29.160
60 percent of women and 3 quarters of men
at least occasionally fantasize about killing

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:37.710
people they don't like. And the rest of them
are lying. [laughter] A more likely possibility

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:43.450
is that human nature is extraordinarily complex
and has always comprised both inclinations

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:49.030
towards violence as we see in the homicidal
fantasies and inclinations that counteract

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:55.140
them. What Abraham Lincoln called the 'better
angels of our nature'. The circumstances of

00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:02.039
increasingly favored our peaceable inclinations.
That is the ability to have a homicidal fantasy

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:09.599
but not act on it. Among the motives for violence
are raw exploitation -- the elimination of

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:16.150
a person that happens to be an obstacle toward
something that you want, resulting in violence

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:22.559
such as rape, plunder, conquest and the elimination
of rivals. The quest for dominance either

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:29.039
by individuals, to climb the pecking order
and become alpha male, or among groups, the

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:35.950
struggle for the supremacy of one's ethnic
group, race, nation, or religion. There's

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:41.460
a large category of moralistic violence. Violence
that's considered to be justified or even

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:49.019
mandatory namely violence committed in retaliation
for a prior harm resulting in vendettas rough

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:55.160
justice and cruel punishments. And then, there
are ideologies that license violence such

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:02.220
as militant religions, nationalism, Nazism,
and communism which justify violence by kind

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:09.509
of cost-benefit analysis having to do with
some utopia that they envision. If your belief

00:40:09.509 --> 00:40:16.319
system holds out the prospect of a future
world that will be infinitely good forever,

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:21.089
well, then you can commit as much violence
as you want in order to attain that perfect

00:40:21.089 --> 00:40:28.180
world and you're still ahead of the game.
The benefits outweigh the costs. Also, imagine

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.809
that you reveal your vision of an infinitely
perfect world and there are some people who

00:40:33.809 --> 00:40:39.450
don't get with the program and might even
stand in your way as you try to bring heaven

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:46.150
to earth. How evil are they? Well, you do
the math. They are arbitrarily evil and deserve

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:50.740
arbitrarily severe punishment which is why
it has been ideologies which have racked up

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:57.799
some of the highest death tolls in history.
What do we have on the other side to counteract

00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:02.799
these motives for violence? There's self-control,
the ability to anticipate the consequences

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:08.460
of behavior and inhibit violent impulses.
There's empathy, the ability to feel other's

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:15.890
pain. There's the moral sense, which comprises
a set of intuitions some of which such as

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:21.039
tribalism, authority, and puritanism can actually
increase violence but at least one of which

00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:26.789
-- a sense of fairness-- can decrease it.
And then there's reason, the cognitive processes

00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:35.369
that allow us to engage in objective, detached
analysis. The key question then is, which

00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:42.849
historical developments bring out our "better
angels" and stay our hand before they can

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:50.280
allow us to engage in bloodshed? One possibility
is that Hobbes got it right when he called

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:58.090
for a Leviathan, a state and justice system
with monopoly on the use of violence, which

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:04.960
can bring about peace. First of all by eliminating
the incentives for exploitive attack by punishing

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:11.359
any aggressor and canceling out his anticipated
gain. That can quiet everyone down because

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:16.349
not only are you deterred from aggression
but you know that your neighbors are deterred

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:22.619
from aggressing against you so you don't have
to maintain a belligerent stance. You don't

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:28.039
have to contemplate preemptive attack to do
it to them before they do it to you. You don't

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:35.609
have to have a hair trigger for retaliation
to deter others. And it circumvents self-serving

00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:41.840
biases by which both sides always believe
that their opponent's attacks are unprovoked

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:47.990
aggression while their own attacks are justified
retaliation when you have two parties both

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.529
intoxicated by these
self-serving illusions that can stoke cycles

00:42:52.529 --> 00:42:59.809
of revenge and bloodfeud which the Leviathan
can nip in the bud. Some historical evidence

00:42:59.809 --> 00:43:04.890
comes from the pacifying and civilizing effects
of the states that I mentioned from the outset

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:12.130
of the talk and the fact you can watch this
movie run in reverse when governments retreat

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:18.180
zones of anarchy such as the American wild
west where the cliché of the old cowboy movies

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:22.799
was that the nearest sheriff was 200 miles
away so you have to defend yourself with your

00:43:22.799 --> 00:43:29.460
6 shooter. In failed states, in collapsed
empires, and in Mafias and street gangs which

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:35.339
deal in contraband and so can't avail themselves
of the dispute resolution apparatus of the

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:40.299
state. If you've been cheated in a drug deal
it's not as if you can file a lawsuit or if

00:43:40.299 --> 00:43:46.559
you feel nervous you can't call 9-1-1. And
so, dealers in contraband operating in these

00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:52.500
economic zones of anarchy have to defend their
interests with the credible threat of violence.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:44:00.609
A second pacifying force is the concept of
gentle commerce. The idea that plunder is

00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:09.029
a zero sum game. The plunderer's gain is the
vanquished's loss whereas trade is a positive

00:44:09.029 --> 00:44:16.009
sum game one in which everyone can win. And
that as, over the centuries, technology improves

00:44:16.009 --> 00:44:22.780
to allow the trade of goods and ideas over
longer distances, among larger groups of people,

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:28.910
and at lower cost, more and more of the rest
of the world becomes more valuable alive than

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:37.540
dead. Much has been written about the rivalry
between the United States and China for global

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:43.109
economic supremacy. Nonetheless, I think it's
unlikely that the two countries will go to

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:49.730
war. Among other things they make all our
stuff and we owe them too much money [laughter].

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:55.000
Some historical evidence comes from statistical
studies. A number of regressions that show

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.590
that countries with open economies and a greater
dependence on international trade, holding

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:07.940
all else constant, get embroiled in fewer
wars, host fewer civil wars, and are wracked

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:14.119
by fewer genocides. A third possibility has
been called the expanding circle -- the idea

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:20.680
that evolution bequeathed us with a sense
of empathy but unfortunately by default we

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:28.880
apply it only to a narrow circle of good friends,
close relatives and cute, warm, fuzzy, little

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:35.359
things. But over history, one can see the
circle of empathy expanding to embrace the

00:45:35.359 --> 00:45:42.930
village, the clan, the tribe, the nation,
other races, both sexes, children, eventually

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:48.280
other species. It's not a coincidence that
the author of the book called The Expanding

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.650
Circle, Peter Singer, who's also the author
of the book Animal Liberation. They are both

00:45:53.650 --> 00:46:00.089
versions of the same idea. This just begs
the question of what expanded the circle and

00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:06.049
the technologies of cosmopolitanism that I
mentioned earlier are a plausible cause that

00:46:06.049 --> 00:46:12.319
namely the increased consumption of history,
literature, and journalism. And indeed a number

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:18.849
of laboratory studies have shown that if you
get someone to adopt the perspective a real

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:25.220
or fictitious person by reading a first person
account then you become more sympathetic not

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:31.789
just to that individual but to the category
that that individual represents. Some historical

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:37.650
evidence comes from the fact that the Humanitarian
Revolution of the 18th century was proceeded

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:44.581
by the so called Republic of Letters. The
exchange of information via print. The second

00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:49.019
half of the 20th century which had the Long
Peace and the Rights Revolutions occurred

00:46:49.019 --> 00:46:55.480
in the electronic global village. And though
it's too soon to tell what's going to happen

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:03.170
in the 21st century, if the Color Revolutions
and Arab spring end up successful it's long

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:09.210
been noted that they were fostered by the
rise of the Internet and social media. Finally

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:15.000
there's the escalator of reason, the possibility
that the expansion of literacy education and

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.420
public discourse encouraged people to just
more abstractly and more universally. People

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.950
would rise above their parochial vantage point.
They were less likely to privilege their own

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:33.690
interests over others. They replaced a morality
based on tribal authority and puritanism with

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:36.980
a morality based on fairness and universal
rules.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:43.970
It encouraged them to stand back and recognize
the futility of cycles of violence and increasingly

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:50.900
to see violence as a problem to be solved
rather than as a contest to be won. Historical

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:56.079
evidence includes the fact that abstract reasoning
abilities, believe it or not, as measured

00:47:56.079 --> 00:48:03.430
by IQ tests, has increased over the century
the so called Flynn effect where IQ scores

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:10.789
rose by three points a decade throughout the
20th century. Other studies have shown that,

00:48:10.789 --> 00:48:17.170
holding all else equal, people in societies
with higher levels of education and measured

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:24.420
commit fewer crimes. Cooperate more in experimental
games, have more classically liberal attitudes

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:33.150
such as opposition to racism and are more
receptive to democracy in the decade to come.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.509
The final question that I'll pose is why so
many of these forces have pushed in the same

00:48:37.509 --> 00:48:44.170
direction? My best guess is that violence
is what game theorists call social dilemma.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:50.329
It is always tempting to a aggressor to exploit
a victim but of course it's ruinous to the

00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:56.599
victim. In the long run since anyone can potentially
been an aggressor or victim, all parties are

00:48:56.599 --> 00:49:03.920
better off if all parties agree to avoid violence.
The human dilemma is how to get the other

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:09.880
guy to refrain from violence at the same time
as you do, because if you unilaterally renounce

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.780
violence, you will be a sitting duck unless
the other guy decides to do so at the same

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.329
time.
One can imagine that over the course of history

00:49:18.329 --> 00:49:23.910
human experience and human ingenuity have
gradually chipped away at this problem just

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:30.589
like we have gradually mastered other scourges
of nature like pestilence and hunger. In fact,

00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:36.819
all of the pacifying forces that I have mentioned
serve to increase the emotional, material,

00:49:36.819 --> 00:49:43.740
and cognitive incentives of all parties to
avoid violence simultaneously. Regardless

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:50.920
of the exact causes, I think the decline of
violence has implications that are profound.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.829
Among other things, it calls for a reorientation
of our efforts towards violence reduction

00:49:55.829 --> 00:50:01.470
from a moralistic mind set to an empirical
mind set. That is, instead of asking 'why

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:07.319
is there war' perhaps we should ask 'why is
there peace'. Instead of 'what are we doing

00:50:07.319 --> 00:50:12.359
wrong' perhaps we should ask 'what are we
doing right' because we have been doing something

00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:19.430
right and it seems to me it sure would be
good to know what exactly it is. Also I think

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:25.700
the decline of violence calls for a reassessment
of modernity of the centuries-long trend that

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:33.260
has eroded family, tribe, tradition, and religion
and seen the ascendancy of individualism,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:40.680
cosmopolitanism, reason, and science. Now
everyone acknowledges the gifts of modernity:

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.660
longer and healthier lives, less ignorance
and superstition. Richer experiences, but

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:53.560
there's always been a current of nostalgia
and romanticism that have questioned the price.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:59.460
Namely is it worth it if we have to suffer
from terrorism, genocide, world wars and nuclear

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:06.549
weapons. On the other hand, despite impressions,
I hope to have shown that the long-term trend

00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:12.670
--though certainly halting and incomplete--
is that violence of all kinds is decreasing.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:18.190
This I believe calls for a rehabilitation
of the concept of modernity and progress and

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:23.520
it's cause for gratitude for the institutions
of civilization and enlightenment that have

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:36.089
made it possible. Thank you very much. Thank-you.
Thanks very much.

00:51:36.089 --> 00:51:38.130
[Applause]

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:43.830
&gt;&gt; Steven: And there's a microphone over there.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.180
[inaudible]

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.630
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thank you for coming. I found
your book very interesting, how you look at

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.279
things they did in the past like slavery and
recreational cat burning that we just think

00:51:56.279 --> 00:52:00.480
as unthinkable. Hundred years from now what
do we do that they are going to look back

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.089
on and say how could they possibly have done
that.

00:52:03.089 --> 00:52:07.900
&gt;&gt; Steven: It's quite possible that our treatment
of animals in factory farms will fall under

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:14.329
that category. I think it's hard to predict.
Some people might argue that our tolerance

00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:21.490
of poverty in the developing world, the bottom
billion could fall into that category, depending

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:26.720
on what happens they might consider the indifference
to the state of environment and its effects

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.760
on future generations. Those are three possibilities.
What we're seeing now, by the way, catching

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:39.089
it in the act of something that was formerly
unexceptionable now becoming unthinkable,

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:44.140
is bullying in the schoolyard which used to
be just part of childhood. 'Boys will be boys'

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:48.699
all of a sudden that shifted into the category
of 'intolerable, primitive violence'.

00:52:48.699 --> 00:52:51.249
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thank you.

00:52:51.249 --> 00:52:58.190
&gt;&gt; Male #2: I was wondering what you think
of the role of religion across history since

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.930
many of the beliefs at the core of religion
seem to be quite peaceful and represent all

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:07.640
these values that we value and yet they've
been around a very long time by your own statistics

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:10.460
don't seem to show much correlation to anything.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.900
&gt;&gt; Steven: Most values of most religions are
not at all peaceable. They include the toxic

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:21.099
notion of the immortality of the soul which
means that, if you kill someone, you've just

00:53:21.099 --> 00:53:26.290
sent them off to a better world. Just a rite
of passage like a bar mitzvah or a midlife

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:30.750
crisis. If you believe this is the only life
we have, I think that increases the value

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:37.940
of life. Also the religions that hold out
the prospect of a future utopia, messianic

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:44.660
age, a kingdom of heaven on earth, often write
into their chronology one last spasm of violence

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:52.200
that brings about a perfect world and justifies
violence committed as a means to that end.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:59.749
Religions have also sanctified authority so
that the defiance of an ecclesiastical hierarchy

00:53:59.749 --> 00:54:07.279
is considered a heinous crime hence the burning
of heretics. It has licensed the maltreatment

00:54:07.279 --> 00:54:12.760
of animals, which in the Judeo-Christian tradition,
were put on earth for the benefit of humans.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.430
It's licensed the beating of children since
they're possessed by the devil or subject

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:22.310
to original sin and have to have the devil
literally beaten out of them to say nothing

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:29.559
of the treatment of homosexuality and other
punishment of violences of standards of purity

00:54:29.559 --> 00:54:36.030
-- sexual, dress, food, and so on. So, and
it's not surprising that religions have been

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:41.789
responsible for some of the worst blood lettings
in history such as the Crusades, the European

00:54:41.789 --> 00:54:47.400
wars of religion, the Taiping Rebellion in
China was religiously motivated. This is not

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:53.480
to say religions are always bad. There have
been some periods in history when some religions

00:54:53.480 --> 00:55:00.210
have done good. There is the Quaker movement
which was both pacifist and abolitionist.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:04.569
Although they were a little late to the party
because 100 years before they were already

00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:10.970
briefs against slavery by John Locke and others.
And of course, the opponents of the abolitionist

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:14.819
movements were themselves religious and there
were plenty of preachers who defended slavery.

00:55:14.819 --> 00:55:18.999
But at least that religion at that time in
history can be credited with having done some

00:55:18.999 --> 00:55:23.849
good. And there are some other examples as
well. So I would say that Christopher Hitchens

00:55:23.849 --> 00:55:31.489
went--, made an overstatement when he said
that religion poisons everything. That's going

00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:35.609
too far. But I think it has poisoned a lot
of things.

00:55:35.609 --> 00:55:42.430
&gt;&gt; Male #3: So your main metric for measuring
violence was deaths. The medical field has

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:47.489
grown lot over the centuries. So what was
death in the 17th century was just injury

00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:52.180
now. Can you say something about the correlation
between the growth in medical field and the

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.380
death and violence now.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:59.509
&gt;&gt; Steven: I think that the advance in medicine
has accounted for some small part of the decline

00:55:59.509 --> 00:56:04.539
in certain sectors like number of American
soldiers who have died in war. But I don't

00:56:04.539 --> 00:56:09.670
think it's been a major factor partly because,
until the 20th century, most doctors were

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:17.950
quacks who killed as many people as they saved.
And also there were many forms of violence

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:23.010
where there's just no -- medical treatment
was completely irrelevant. Capital punishment

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.460
-- the whole point is you kill the person.
Doesn't matter how well the doctors are at

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:33.900
saving someone who's been swinging from a
noose. Sieges in warfare. The doctors couldn't

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:40.279
get in no matter what you did. Massive bombing
like Dresden and Hiroshima. Medical care may

00:56:40.279 --> 00:56:47.349
help at the margins but for someone who's
been vaporized, medical care is kind of beside

00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:54.289
the point. And other cases where whatever
life saving care may have been available,

00:56:54.289 --> 00:57:00.599
they were kept away. Indeed, I think the application
of life saving medical care, particularly

00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:05.380
in wartime, is itself a reflection of some
of these humanitarian currents. It used to

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:13.230
be that soldiers were just expendable. They
were cannon fodder. Now at enormous expense,

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:18.489
modern countries have tried to treat every
soldier's life as precious and the deployment

00:57:18.489 --> 00:57:23.910
of medical care is in part a reflection in
decrease in tolerance for violence.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:30.180
&gt;&gt; Male #4: So do you think like the negative
effects of technology advancement of technology.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.150
&gt;&gt; Steven: So can you lower the microphone.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:36.799
&gt;&gt; Male #4: So do you think the negative effects
of advancement of technology such as like

00:57:36.799 --> 00:57:41.849
nuclear weapons and better weapons and all
that have their instilled sort of fear to

00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:47.559
do wars and violence in general and sort of
in in some sense resolving the human dilemma.

00:57:47.559 --> 00:57:54.489
&gt;&gt; Steven: That's sometimes called the theory
of the nuclear peace and one scientist proposed

00:57:54.489 --> 00:58:01.550
the nuclear bomb be awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize. [laughter] I'm skeptical because of

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:08.779
arguments by John Mueller suggested that the
trajectory of war would have unfolded in exactly

00:58:08.779 --> 00:58:13.320
the same way if nuclear weapons have never
been invented. Two reasons -- one of them

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.989
is: World War II proved that conventional
warfare with good old fashioned tanks and

00:58:18.989 --> 00:58:26.079
artillery and aerial bombardment could do
so much damage that it served as a deterrent

00:58:26.079 --> 00:58:32.810
that was plenty scary enough to keep the superpowers
away from any thoughts of having a rematch

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:39.260
any time soon. The other is that nuclear weapons
are so disproportionately destructive compared

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:46.460
to any strategic war aim other than in the
"Strange-Lovian" all out annihilation that

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:52.489
they've almost been irrelevant in the actual
conduct of wars and associated deterrents.

00:58:52.489 --> 00:59:00.299
They've fallen into a taboo category and are
just not considered an option, a live option

00:59:00.299 --> 00:59:07.170
on the menu of war fighting strategies. Countries
know that which is why, very often, a non-nuclear

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:12.660
power has defied a nuclear one. Just what
the situation you expect nuclear deterrents

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:19.239
to be most effective. When Argentina tried
to conquer the Falkland islands, they knew

00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:25.269
that Britain would not retaliate by turning
Buenos Aires into a radioactive crater. The

00:59:25.269 --> 00:59:30.030
nuclear effect had become, by all intents
and purposes, a bluff. And so, that's why

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:33.369
I think two reasons why I don't think it's
been the major factor.

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:40.759
&gt;&gt; Male #5: One quick question which is why
or what do you see in the projection of total

00:59:40.759 --> 00:59:46.769
peace keeping force head count given that
that was one of the stabilizing influences

00:59:46.769 --> 00:59:53.980
and seemed to be on a rather painful trajectory.
Have you extrapolated where that takes us.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.720
&gt;&gt; Steven: The number of peace keeping forces
on a painful trajectory.

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.130
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Well, in the sense that the growth
is very large at least over the last couple

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:08.759
of decades and it wasn't clear whether it
was asymptoting or needed to be a continuous

01:00:08.759 --> 01:00:11.459
increase in tax to maintain stability.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:17.309
&gt;&gt; Steven: Oh, I see. I consider it highly
benevolent development given the studies that

01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:23.690
show peace keeping works. And here I'm borrowing
from a book by Joshua Goldstein called Winning

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:29.480
the War on War where he argues that it's the
-- that exponential increase in number of

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:37.289
blue helmeted soldiers, where they're actually
seriously armed and prepared to use the arms,

01:00:37.289 --> 01:00:44.190
that drives down the total rate of death in
war. Kind of an international Leviathan. The

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:51.349
limiting step there is the reluctance of third
parties to put their own citizens at risk

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:54.990
to prevent wars involving other countries.
It's kind of an act of altruism.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:01:00.079
&gt;&gt; Male #5: And then the second question is
the previous one of the previous questions

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:06.710
was around medical science and the degree
to which it reduced death as opposed to perhaps

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:15.480
a more a metric of the damage to society not
just individuals but if you twisted that around

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:22.789
a little bit and you said that the survival
rate from more moderate wounds has increased

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:26.999
dramatically compared to say the civil war
where getting a splinter could kill you in

01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:36.020
the wrong environment. These people coming
back now diffuse an awareness of war that

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:41.589
previously wasn't available because it was
a critical discontinuous step function. The

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:46.730
person either came back or never came back
but they never came back injured. Is there

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:52.370
any correlation that you could consider there
&gt;&gt;Steven: Would that be a pacifying force

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.869
as people are reminded of the human costs
of war.

01:01:54.869 --> 01:01:59.869
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Well, and it's a really visual
force when you see people with amputations.

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:04.420
&gt;&gt; Steven: It's conceivable. I think there
are a number of technologies that make the

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.280
human cost of war more visible to more people
even if you don't know someone you might have

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.390
seen their story on television for example
which would not have been true in the past.

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:19.819
So war I think is less often an abstraction
something that's just glorious and thrilling

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:25.460
and spiritual and holy which was the attitude
towards war the end of the 19th century. The

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:31.151
realities of the first world war conveyed
by literature, first hand accounts, and so

01:02:31.151 --> 01:02:34.619
on did start to scare people straight.

01:02:34.619 --> 01:02:39.660
&gt;&gt; Male #6: So concurrently with the decline
in violence over the last century there's

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:45.859
been also an increase kind of alarming in
the number of people in the United States

01:02:45.859 --> 01:02:51.180
incarcerated. Is there any concern that some
of this decline in violence is coming at a

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:58.609
cost of decline in freedom. Sort of like a
strange impasse we come to where what to do

01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:01.709
with this space left by violent uprisings.

01:03:01.709 --> 01:03:10.979
&gt;&gt; Steven: I think that is a valid concern.
The American incarceration binge has probably

01:03:10.979 --> 01:03:17.019
been one of the factors that has led the rate
of violent crime to plummet since 1992. It

01:03:17.019 --> 01:03:22.900
almost has to just removing that number of
risky people from the streets. But it's obviously

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:27.540
well past the point of diminishing returns
to a point of decreasing returns in terms

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:33.220
of societal welfare. So yes, I think that
is a major concern. It's one of several areas

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:38.270
by the way in which the United States is a
misleading example of what's happening to

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:44.130
the western world. That in many regards the
United States is not on the cutting edge of

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:49.200
the reproduction of violence but kind of a
pulling up the middle.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Yep.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200
[laughter]

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.430
&gt;&gt; Female presenter: Thanks Steven for coming.
It was a great talk.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.879
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Steven: Thanks
