00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.300
You know, I used to be terrible at talking to people.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.280
- So... what do you do?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.620
- I umm....

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.380
I do original content creation for a third-party platform

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.460
in which I perform monologues to camera

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.440
that fuse comedy and mental health awareness

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.720
that are then interrupted sporadically with cut-aways

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.720
to illustrate or negate the points that I'm making

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.120
within the monologue—either for comedic sake or to emphasize what I've just said.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.220
- So...

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.700
YouTube videos ?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.640
- Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.200
And in an effort to get better at that, I took improv classes...

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.740
- Freeze!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.420
- Alright, I'm gonna stop you guys right there. Okay, this is not a gun.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.920
This is a gun.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.500
Okay? This is just your hand.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.460
This is how we shoot a gun.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.080
- Um actually... that's... that's...

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.420
a really.... uh...

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.940
bad misconception.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.780
You don't wanna ever put your finger on the trigger

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.440
until you're actually ready to shoot.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.940
Uh, for safety reasons you keep it straight along the gun.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.380
*deep thud*
- Oh wow

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.240
I... I've never used a firearm

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.960
and that's abundantly clear now.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.280
I'm-I'm so sorry, my... uh... my entire improvisation philosophy has been built on lies.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.440
Read books...

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.320
- Hi! Can I help you find anything?

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.280
- Yes, I'm just looking for a book

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.480
that will tell me how to like...

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.420
win friends...

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.420
and like not manipulate, but... but influence people ?

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.080
- Oh, by Dale Carnegie? Yeah, we have that! Follow me!

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.900
- OooOo

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.940
I made a real effort in conversations to try to ignore my own self-consciousness

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.840
and really put the focus on them.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.360
- So...

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.220
Are you...

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.100
a...

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.320
Taurus ?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.920
- No.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.540
- [whispers] Damn it...

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.240
- I've been reading this amazing book lately

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.140
called 'How To Talk So Kids Will Listen &amp; Listen So Kids Will Talk'

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080
by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.600
and right off the bat—like the first chapter—the authors describe

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.800
that there are 7 ways we respond to people that deny connection,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.920
make the other person feel unheard, and are ultimately just bad ways to respond.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.400
And I am guilty of all of them!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.860
They are: Denying People's Feelings...

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.240
- Uh... it's so hot!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.220
- Really ? It's like, so cold in here, I feel like I'm in Antarctica.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.900
Philosophical Response...

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.800
- It just sucks that I got fired.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
- Maybe the universe is telling you that this job isn't where you were meant to be.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.140
Maybe rejection is divine protection.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.680
- Ugh

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760
Questions...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.580
- I can't believe he just dumped me out of nowhere!

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.440
- Did you guys fight right before-hand?

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.420
- No, we were fine.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.540
- Did he give any hints?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.560
Defense Of The Other Person...

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800
- Dude, my boss was being such a jerk today.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
- Maybe she was having a bad day or something.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.140
I mean, we never really know what's going on with people.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.760
*sigh*

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.360
Pity...

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.160
- Oh my god you poor thing! That is just so terrible!

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.439
I am so sorry for you! I could just like, cry!

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.000
Amateur Psychoanalysis...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.440
- Have you ever thought that maybe you get upset because your boss represents your mother,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.300
and so when she tells you what to do it triggers your rebellion against authority ?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.540
And the one I'm the biggest off ender of... *drumroll*

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.100
Giving Advice! -

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.400
- You know what you should do? Therapy.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.420
Everyone

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.440
should be

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.760
IN THERAPY.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.200
Though all of these responses come naturally to us in conversation,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.660
ultimately, they make the person you're talking to feel worse.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.580
And the authors say that the best response is

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.580
—you guessed it—

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.520
an empathetic one.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.760
Acknowledge the other person's feelings,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760
give them a chance to really talk through what's upsetting them,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.960
and... listen.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.720
- Wow, that must have been so hard,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.300
to be yelled at like that in front of all those people,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.560
especially when you've been putting in all this extra work.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.260
That must have felt, like, humiliating!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.860
As kids, we're raised, and often our feelings are denied,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.560
so it makes sense that as adults, our automatic responses in conversation

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.720
ultimately deny the feelings of others.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.640
But knowing this also made me so much more aware of how often I do it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.560
just every day, in like every conversation with people that I love.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.180
And obviously, I want to cultivate connection and let people feel heard,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.880
so now I'm making a very conscious effort

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.780
to make my responses empathetic in nature,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.920
and it is oddly harder than you would think!

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.760
I'm Anna Akana, and so thank you to Audible for sponsoring today's video.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.580
Listening makes us smarter, more connected people,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.800
and there's no better place to listen than Audible.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.280

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.720

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.320

and browse their unmatched selection of audio content.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.040
So today's video is all about the book I'm currently listening to:

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.060
'How To Talk So Kids Will Listen &amp; Listen So Kids Will Talk'.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.560
As you guys may know, I'm currently on this HUGE non-fiction binge,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.080
specifically with books that pertain to relationships of any kind.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.480
And though I don't have kids

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.040
and my cats cannot talk,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.280
I have had so many people in the comment section recommend this book to me,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.920
so thank you because it has highlighted

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.840
the many ways that I deny people's feelings on a daily basis,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.740
and I can't change that unless I'm aware,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.160
so this book has just brought so much great awareness to conversation,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.200
and how I can be a better listener and acknowledger of people's valid experiences and emotions.
