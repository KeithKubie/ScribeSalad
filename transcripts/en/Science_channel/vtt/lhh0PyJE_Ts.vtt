00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.406
Narrator: THERE ARE MORE
THAN 600,000 BRIDGES

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.342
CONNECTING ROADS ACROSS THE USA.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:12.678
BUT OVER 65,000 OF THEM
ARE STRUCTURALLY FAULTY

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.947
AND NEED TO COME DOWN.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.416
WHEN THEY DO COME DOWN,
EVERY OUNCE OF STEEL

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.987
CAN BE RECLAIMED
AND RE-ENGINEERED.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.088
AND SOME OF THAT TWISTED METAL

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:25.825
WILL BE SPINNING
A BRAND NEW SOUND.

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.396
THE BRIDGE'S STRUCTURAL STEEL
WILL GET AN EXTENDED PLAY

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:33.299
AS A HEAVYWEIGHT
CAST-IRON TURNTABLE.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.736
Narrator:
IN VIRGINIA, METALWORKERS

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:40.473
SHEAR AND MELT BRIDGE PARTS
AND BRAKE ROTORS.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.977
ALL THAT'S LEFT IS A FURNACE
FULL OF MOLTEN CAST IRON.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.949
THE FIRST STEP
IN CREATING THE TURNTABLE

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.751
IS TO MAKE THE BASE.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.991
A FOUNDRY WORKER ROLLS
A SAND MOLD INTO PLACE.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.294
SAND MOLDS ARE HELD TOGETHER
AND HARDENED WITH RESIN.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:05.097
AT 3,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.768
THE METAL IS READY
TO BE POURED INTO THE MOLDS.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:23.649
A FOUNDRY WORKER SWINGS
A LADLE OVER AND HAND-POURS

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.586
THE CAST IRON INTO THE MOLDS.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.326
THE HOT METAL FILLS A CAVITY
INSIDE THE MOLD,

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.796
FORMING THE SHAPE
OF THE TURNTABLE BASE.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:40.467
IT HARDENS FOR 15 MINUTES
BUT IS STILL NOT COOL.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.470
A WORKER ROLLS THE MOLD

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.340
OFF THE END
OF THE CONVEYER BELT.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.542
WHEN IT HITS THE FLOOR,
THE MOLD BREAKS,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.745
AND THE RESIN AND THE SAND
BURST INTO FLAMES.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.183
A FRONT LOADER SCOOPS UP
THE RED-HOT BASE

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.819
AND SETS IT ASIDE
TO COOL IN SAND.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:09.161
A WORKER FERRIES THE BASE
TO A SHOT BLAST TUMBLER,

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.999
A MACHINE THAT SCRAPES AWAY
THE CAST IRON'S ROUGH TOP LAYER.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.308 line:0%
AN ELECTROMAGNET
LIFTS THE CAST IRON BASE

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.111
ONTO A COMPUTER-CONTROLLED
CUTTING MACHINE.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.814
THE MACHINE MILLS HOLES

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.850
TO ACCOMMODATE
THE TURNTABLE'S COMPONENTS

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.084
AND WIRING.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:36.289
NEXT, A MACHINIST MILLS
A 35-POUND BRASS PLATTER.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.129
NOW THE COMPONENTS
ARE READY FOR ASSEMBLY.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.797
HE PLACES THE BRASS PLATTER

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.199
ON A SPINDLE
AND ATTACHES A BELT.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.170
THE BELT DRIVES THE PLATTER
AND CONTROLS THE SPEED.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.641
THEN THE TECHNICIAN DYNAMICALLY
BALANCES THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.110
TO FINISH THE ASSEMBLY,
HE ADDS THE TONE ARM

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.380
AND THE STYLUS.
