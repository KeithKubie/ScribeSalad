00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:02.601
- Let's say that there
are four people in a room.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:03.638
And you're probably tired of me

00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:05.143
naming the people with letters,

00:00:05.143 --> 00:00:07.093
but I'm going to continue doing that.

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:12.093
So the four people in the room
are people A, B, C, and D.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.297
And they are all told,
"You don't know each other.

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.537
"So I want you to all meet each other.

00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:22.474
"You need to shake the hand, exactly once,

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:25.875
"of every other person in the
room so that you all meet."

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.616
So my question to you is,
if each of these people

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:34.989
need to shake the hand of every
other person exactly once,

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.905
how many handshakes are going to occur?

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.886
The number of handshakes
that are going to occur.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.026
So, like always, pause the video

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:43.322
and see if you can make sense of this.

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:47.492
Alright, I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:49.291
So one way to think about it is,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.409
if you say there's a handshake,

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.313
two people are party to a handshake.

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:57.179
We're not talking about
some new three-person

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.792
handshake or four-person handshake,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.712
we're just talking about the traditional,

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:02.885
two people shake their right hands.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:04.507
And so, there's one person and there's

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:05.994
another person in this party.

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:10.026
There's four possibilities of one party.

00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:11.570
And if we assume people aren't
shaking their own hands,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.868
which we are assuming, they're always

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:14.569
going to shake someone else's hand.

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:19.417
For each of these four
possibilities who's this party,

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:22.737
there's three possibilities
who's the other party.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:24.503
And so you might say that there's

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:27.668
four times three handshakes.

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:32.662
Since there's four times
three possible handshakes.

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.087
And what I'd like you to
do is think a little bit

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:36.599
about whether this is
right, whether there would

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.073
actually be 12 handshakes.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:43.143
You might have thought
about it, and you might say,

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:46.934
there's four times three, this is actually

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.418
counting the permutations.

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:50.564
This is counting how
many ways can you permute

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:54.933
four people into two
buckets, the two buckets

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.401
of handshakers, where you care about

00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:58.564
which bucket they are in.

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:00.896
Whether they're handshaker number one,

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:02.881
or handshaker number two.

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:07.881
This would count A being
the number one handshaker

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.109
and B being the number two handshaker

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.830
as being different than B
being the number one handshaker

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.797
and A being the number two handshaker.

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:18.526
But we don't want both
of these things to occur.

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:20.840
We don't want A to shake B's hand,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.952
where A is facing north
and B is facing south.

00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:26.510
And then another time,
they shake hands again

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.188
where now B is facing north
and A is facing south.

00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:30.591
We only have to do it once.

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.261
These are actually the same thing,

00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.013
so there's no reason for
both of these to occur.

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.602
So we are going to be double counting.

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:42.337
So what we really want to do
is think about combinations.

00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:45.196
One way to think about it
is, you have four people.

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:48.760
In a world of four people
or a pool of four people,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.081
how many ways can you choose two?

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:02.247
Because that's what we're doing.

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:04.325
Each handshake is just really a selection

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:05.835
of two of these people.

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:07.204
And so we want to say, how many ways

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:08.935
can we select two people?

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:12.625
So that each combination,
each of these ways

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.500
to select two people
should have a different

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.166
combination of people in it.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:19.362
If two of them have the same, AB and BA,

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:21.283
these are the same combination.

00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:24.211
And so this is really
a combinations problem.

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:26.509
This is really equivalent to saying,

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.842
how many ways are there
to choose two people

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.398
from a pool of four?

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.173
Or four choose two.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:39.669
And so this is going to
be, well how many ways

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.236
are there to permute four
people into three spots?

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:47.187
Which is going to be four times three.

00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:49.843
Which we just figured out
right over there, which is 12.

00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:51.110
Actually want to do it in that green color

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.104
so you see where that came from.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.288
So four times three.

00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:57.424
And then you're going to divide that

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:02.045
by the number of ways you
can arrange two people.

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:03.504
Well you can arrange two
people in two different ways.

00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:04.403
One's on the left, one's on the right,

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:05.389
or the other one's on the left

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.700
or the other one's on the right.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.010
Or, you could also view
that as two factorial,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.600
which is also equal to two.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.282
So we could write this down as two.

00:04:14.282 --> 00:04:19.282
This is the number of ways
to arrange two people.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.695
This up here, that's the permutations.

00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:39.020
That's the number of permutations

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.547
if you take two people
from a pool of four.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.709
So here you would care about order.

00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:46.440
And so one way to think about it, this two

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.793
is correcting for this
double counting here.

00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:51.733
And if you want to apply
the formula, you could.

00:04:51.733 --> 00:04:54.134
I just kind of reasoned through it again.

00:04:54.134 --> 00:04:55.596
You could literally say,
four times three is 12.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.292
We're double counting because there's

00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:58.752
two ways to arrange two people.

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.972
So you just divide it by two.

00:05:03.418 --> 00:05:05.729
And then you are going
to be left with six.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.090
You can think of it in terms of this,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.932
or you could just apply the formula.

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:13.569
You could just say, four choose two,

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.705
or the number of combinations of selecting

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:17.447
two from a group of four.

00:05:17.447 --> 00:05:21.880
This is going to be four
factorial over two factorial

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.338
times four minus two factorial.

00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:26.918
And I'm going to make this
color different just so

00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:30.561
you can keep track of how
I'm at least applying this.

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:32.145
And so what is this going to be?

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:36.984
This is going to be four times
three times two times one,

00:05:36.984 --> 00:05:41.984
over two times one times
this right over here is

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.946
two times one.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:49.196
So that would cancel with that.

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:52.307
Four divided by two is two.

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:56.208
Two times three divided
by one is equal to six.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:58.167
And to just really hit the point home,

00:05:58.167 --> 00:06:00.349
let's actually draw it out.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.356
A could shake B's hand.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.248
A could shake C's hand.

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:09.160
A could shake D's hand.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.781
Let me just do what we
calculated first, the 12.

00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.665
B could shake A's hand.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:17.267
B could shake C's hand.

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:21.853
B could shake D's hand.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.395
C could shake A's hand.

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:26.252
C could shake B's hand.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:30.304
C could shake D's hand.

00:06:30.304 --> 00:06:31.906
D could shake A's hand.

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:33.729
D could shake B's hand.

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.086
D could shake C's hand.

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:37.712
And this is 12 right over here,

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:38.906
and this is the permutations.

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:41.507
If D shaking C's hand
was actually different

00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:45.145
than C shaking D's hand,
then we would count 12.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:47.228
But we just wanted to say, how many ways,

00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:49.146
they just have to meet each other once.

00:06:49.146 --> 00:06:50.748
And so we're double counting.

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:54.669
So AB is the same thing as BA.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.510
AC is the same thing as CA.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.964
AD is the same thing as DA.

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.172
BC is the same thing as CB.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.803
BD is the same thing as DB.

00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:07.325
CD is the same thing as DC.

00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:08.823
And so we would be left with,

00:07:08.823 --> 00:07:11.551
if we correct for the double counting,

00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:16.551
we're left with one,
two, three, four, five,

00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:18.401
six combinations.

00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:23.401
Six possible ways of choosing
two from a pool of four.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.011
Especially when you don't care about

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.268
the order in which you choose them.
