00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:34.090
Calling our parents anything other than mom,
dad or one of the many variations thereof

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.110
is an almost alien concept to many (and in
some cultures is considered downright rude).

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.470
So why is it we refer to our parents in this
way?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.540
Where did it come from and perhaps, more curiously,
is there any culture that forgoes this seemingly

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.079
universal nickname custom for parental figures?

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.290
The words can be traced back to the 1500s
for “dad” and the 1800s for “mom”.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.040
As with so many etymologies, where these words
were first uttered and by whom is a mystery.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.619
Even the Oxford English Dictionary has admitted
that they have “no evidence” on where

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.240
the word “dad” originated.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.470
The word “mom”, on the other hand, is
a slightly different story and it’s widely

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.990
believed that the word was born from the much
older word “mamma” which itself can be

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.380
traced back to the 1500s in English.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.650
This, in turn, can be traced back to Latin
where “mamma” meant “breast” or “teat”.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.380
From this word, we also got the word “mammalia”
and later “mammal” to describe animals

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.200
that suckle their young.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.950
This brings us to the amazing part- a word
extremely similar to “mom” occurs in almost

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.490
every language on Earth.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.659
We don’t mean that there is a word for “mom”
in every language; we mean that the word for

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.749
“mom” is shockingly similar across nearly
all of the most commonly spoken languages

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:44.829
on Earth.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.969
For example, if you wanted to address your
mother in Dutch you’d say “moeder”,

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.689
if you were to travel to Germany on the other
hand you’d call her “mutter” while over

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.130
in Italy you’d refer to her as, “madre”.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.390
Now we know what you’re thinking, those
are all European languages.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.319
So let’s mix things up a bit and list the
words for mom or mother in some more, shall

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.340
we say, “exotic” languages, from an English
speaker’s point of view, and see if you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.710
start to notice a pattern:

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.610
Chinese: Mãma
Hindi: Mam

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.290
Afrikaans: Ma
Ancient Egyptian: Mut

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.090
Swahili: Mama
As you can clearly see from this list, there’s

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.049
a very peculiar trend with “mom” in various
languages in that it’s nearly universally

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.129
pronounced with an “m” sound.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.950
If you’re still not convinced or think that
we’re perhaps cherry picking examples, here’s

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.140
a pretty exhaustive list of ways to say “mother”
in a number of languages for you to peruse

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.150
at your leisure.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.530
With a few exceptions, our favorite of which
is the Mapunzugun “Ñuke”, you’ll note

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.349
that they pretty much all employ an “m”
and often a “ma” sound.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.990
As for the word “dad”, while there is
certainly more variation in the ways to address

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.959
your man-mum in foreign languages, similar
trends can be observed.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.140
For example, the word “Papa” is present
in several languages including Russian, Hindi,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.969
Spanish and English, while slight variations
on it appear in German (Papi), Icelandic (Pabbi),

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.530
Swedish (Pappa) and a number of other languages
across the globe.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.239
Likewise in Turkish, Greek, Swahili, Malay
and several other languages the word for dad

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.719
is “Baba” or a variation of it.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.890
The current working theory to explain this
fascinating phenomenon is that the words parents

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.310
use to refer to themselves are derived from
the babblings of their child during its “baby-talk”

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.310
phase.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.500
It has been observed that babies, regardless
of where in the world they’re born, naturally

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.470
learn to make the same few sounds as they
begin to learn to speak.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.530
It has also been noted that during the babbling
stage, babies will create what is known as

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.739
“protowords” by combining nonsensical
combinations of consonants and vowels.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.379
The really interesting part about these protowords
is that they’re consistent across different

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.280
cultures for reasons that aren’t quite clear.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.891
The words babies make in this early babbling
stage tend to use the softer contestants like

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:54.239
B, P and M, often leading to the creation
of otherwise non-words like baba, papa and

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.370
mama by the child in question.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.109
It’s further theorised that as these are
often the first sounds babies are able to

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.220
make consistently, parents came to use them
to refer to themselves, which explains why

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.510
words like “mama”, “papa,” “dada”,
“tata” and “baba” are present in so

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.359
many languages as a way of addressing one’s
parents.

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.209
It’s usually less complex to say than the
parent’s real names and works as a substitute

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.770
that ultimately sticks.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.840
As to why the “ma” sound in derivations
like “mamma” came to be assigned to women

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.490
instead of men, it is generally thought that
it derived from the sound babies make while

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.590
suckling or feeding.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.490
It’s noted that the only sound a baby can
really make while its mouth is full of his

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.300
or her mother’s life giving bosom is a “slight
nasal murmur” or a repeated “m” sound.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.090
Further, when the baby is hungry and sees
the object of its foodie desires, it is not

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.340
uncommon for the baby to, as linguist Roman
Jakobson put it, “reproduced [it] as an

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.030
anticipatory signal”.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.760
While no one can prove this is how “mom”
and its predecessor “mamma” came about,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.780
it would at the least explain why there is
an almost universal trend of the word for

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.880
mother in varying languages utilising the
“m”, and often “ma” sound.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.090
There is no such precise theory for why the
word “dad” was specifically chosen (presumably

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.590
from “dada”), but this lack of a good
reason to assign “dada” to male parents

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.350
over other variations like “papa”, “tata”,
“baba”, etc. is perhaps why there is such

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.230
variation on this one in terms of which repeated
consonant is used to go along with the a’s

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.020
in a given culture.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.230
So is there any culture in which this nicknaming
practise isn’t observed?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.770
There are certainly examples of cultures that
don’t adhere to the idea of a nuclear family,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.650
but as far as applying similar types of nicknames
to parental figures, not really…

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.340
At least as far as we could find and we’re
usually very good at this sort of thing and

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.660
spent more hours than we care to admit trying
to find the obligatory exception.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.320
But if you happen to be an anthropologist
or just someone who knows different and you

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.380
know of an exception where children don’t
commonly give their parental figures (whether

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.740
truly their biological parents or not) some
sort of nickname, please do let us know.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.750
We came up empty on it, which makes us a little
uncomfortable as there seemingly always is

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.770
at least one exception somewhere for just
about any issue.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:14.880
Is this an exception to the rule that there
is always an exception?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:35.810
It would seem so.
