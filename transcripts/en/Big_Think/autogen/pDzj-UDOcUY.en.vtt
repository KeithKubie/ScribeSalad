him a bunch of questions and and one of

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380
him a bunch of questions and and one of
 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.070

group and the number one reason by far
 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.200
group and the number one reason by far
fifty-four percent of people said that

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210
fifty-four percent of people said that
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.719
fifty-four percent of people said that
the reason they leave a group is because

of a lack of leadership so what I
believe is happening is that the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740
believe is happening is that the
 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.919
believe is happening is that the
Internet is connecting everybody at a

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929
Internet is connecting everybody at a
 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.569
Internet is connecting everybody at a
scale that's just unprecedented I'm

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579
scale that's just unprecedented I'm
 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.429
scale that's just unprecedented I'm
everybody knows that um if you think

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439
everybody knows that um if you think
 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.980
everybody knows that um if you think
about it right every hugely successful

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990
about it right every hugely successful
 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.039
about it right every hugely successful
technology has fundamentally connected

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049

even the wheel right and so so the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170
even the wheel right and so so the
 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.660
even the wheel right and so so the
internet is just an amazing version of

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670
internet is just an amazing version of
 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.149
internet is just an amazing version of
all of that and so all these people are

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159
all of that and so all these people are
 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.399
all of that and so all these people are
connecting but then because of a lack of

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409
connecting but then because of a lack of
 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.940
connecting but then because of a lack of
leadership all of that energy is going

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950
leadership all of that energy is going
 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.059
leadership all of that energy is going
to waste so if we can somehow connect

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069
to waste so if we can somehow connect
 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.449

need leadership we connect those two
 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.459

things together that's how we can sort

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469
things together that's how we can sort
 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.359
things together that's how we can sort
of dramatically increase the impact of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
of dramatically increase the impact of
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.699
of dramatically increase the impact of
humans and our ability to create things

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709
humans and our ability to create things
 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.909

that were sort of never possible before
