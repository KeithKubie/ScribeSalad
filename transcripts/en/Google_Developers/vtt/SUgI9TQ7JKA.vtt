TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.870
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.036
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:08.260
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.220
We recently launched a global
series of events for Actions

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.290
on Google that include
tutorials on how

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.200
to build your first action
and advanced sessions

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.104
on how to use the more complex
features of the platform.

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:20.520
By the end of the
event, you'll be

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.340
able to build an action
for your community,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.070
such as your hometown,
your professional network,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.660
or perhaps your interest group.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.940
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.260
below for an intro video and
a link to the event site.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.020
Resonance Audio, or
spatial audio SDK,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
enables you to create more
realistic VR and AR experiences

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.105
on mobile and desktop.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.020
To accelerate adoption of
immersive audio technology

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.480
and strengthen the developer
community around it,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.970
we're open-sourcing
Resonance Audio.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.800
Take a look at the
post for more details

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.450
and a link to the
GitHub project.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.930
Firebase Remote Config
is a simple way for you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.720
to change elements of
your app on the fly

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.730
just by using the
Firebase console.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.090
And now you can update your
Remote Config values directly

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
through the new Remote
Config REST API.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.910
Details and a link to
the docs are on the post.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.860
Agones is an open-source
dedicated game-server hosting

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
and scaling project built
on top of Kubernetes

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.880
with the flexibility to meet the
needs of your multiplayer game.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.090
The post has code and links
to get started with the alpha.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.600
You can now connect to the
Google Cloud platform Cloud

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.700
Shell directly from
your terminal using

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.620
the gcloud command-line tool.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.080
Check out the post for
some cool usage examples.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.320
Hyperparameter tuning
on Google Cloud

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.880
uses a Bayesian
optimization approach

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.820
that can be applied to
auto-tune parameters

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.060
of your machine-learning model
such as learning rate, number

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.830
of hidden nodes, and more.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.760
Recently it has advanced
to become smarter, faster,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.230
and more capable.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.140
Take a look at the post linked
in the description below

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.504
to learn how to take
advantage of this advancement.

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.420

Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.930
Thanks for watching,
and I'm going

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.730
to see you in the next
take, because we're

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.060
going to do at least one more.
