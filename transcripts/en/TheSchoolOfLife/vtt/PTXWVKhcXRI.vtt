00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.879
One of the great problems in the world is
also one of the most invisible, because – by

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.040
its nature – it asks to be hidden and saps
our ability to spot its symptoms. But, to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.230
generalise grossly, few things so undermine
human well-being as the sickness of shame.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.239
The guilty feel bad for something specific
they have done; the shamed feel wretched simply

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.649
for being. The affliction lacks borders. As
shamed people, we don’t connect the myriad

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:37.910
ways in which our behaviour and feelings are
driven by a base conviction of our own abhorrence.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.840
We just take it as a given that we are disgusting.
We lack the capacity to imagine that our shame

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.840
has a history and therefore, perhaps, a future
that could be curtailed. A first step in untangling

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.380
ourselves is to get enough distance to spot
and name the problem. We might make use of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.620
a little questionnaire. Out of 10, rate how
true the following statements feel: – I

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:12.030
don’t deserve to exist – I am defective
– I am unworthy of being known and loved

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:20.729
– I am a mistake – I deserve to be abandoned
– I should not be Anything over an eight

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.790
starts to indicate the problem, but if there
were an option, most of us in the shamed camp

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.510
would want to award ourselves a hundred or
more. This is the windswept barren land of

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.260
shame, where many of us have been living all
our lives, often without enough mental wellbeing

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.080
to know this is where we have been relegated.
We should probe at where our shame collects.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.200
Take the outline of a human figure. Image
resultWhat are we ashamed of? – our mind

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.690
– facial appearance – physique – genitals
– anus We were not born ashamed. We should

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.820
summon up the voices that gave us our legacy
and which we have then internalised and blended

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.640
with our own: You’ll never amount to anything
You’re the family idiot You disgust me.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.141
Others may wonder why people around us behaved
this way. The answer is clear enough to the

00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:19.420
shamed: because we deserved it. We wouldn’t
be truly shamed people if all it took was

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.561
a few simple questions to shake us from our
conviction of our detestable identity. We

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:31.010
were shamed because we were and are defective.
Our caregivers weren’t mean; they were – above

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.920
anything else – perceptive, even brilliant.
They could spot things that later, kinder

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.700
people cannot. They had the true measure of
us. Shamed children don’t blame their guardians.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.860
We protect them for a weird but logical reason:
so as not to feel entirely alone. We prefer

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.900
to think well of our caregivers than to take
on board how badly we have been let down – with

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
all the convulsive rage and sadness that would
entail.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.980
The consequences of

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.569
shame are written across our lives. We don’t
allow other people to get too close to us;

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.459
they would only be appalled if they knew the
true us. We’re not so good on physical intimacy.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.750
We get scared all the time (bad things happen
to bad people). We don’t like parties (why

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.770
would anyone be pleased to see us?). We have
a lot of secrets, for most of what we are

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.760
is unacceptable to other eyes. We go in for
addictive behaviour to escape our self-hatred

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.330
– then feel even more ashamed of ourselves
for the unholy things we’ve done. What is

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.120
the way out of shame? The sane popular answer
is to tell ourselves that we are beautiful

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.709
and good. But that won’t easily convince.
There may be a better, more oblique strategy

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.300
to bypass the defences of the shamed. We should
stress not that we are wonderful, but that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.550
every human being who has ever walked the
planet is in their own way radically imperfect

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.379
and broken when observed from close up. We
may be a bit wrong, but so – blessedly – is

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:13.440
everyone else who is and has ever been. We
can be stupid, perverted and uncouth, but

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560
that is wholly normal. Rather than implicitly
upholding an ideal of goodness by telling

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.740
ourselves that we do after all measure up
to it, far better to throw away ideals and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.971
all notions of achievable purity and goodness.
This is where the problem started. Better

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:35.390
to accept that we are, as a group, entirely
crazy and ill-tempered, wicked and odd, but

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.940
then to stress just how much this is a reason
for mercy and kindness (rather than censure

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.900
and condemnation). Let us stop judging ourselves
and others by unreal standards, that is how

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.090
we made ourselves ill; let us laugh and comfort
each other for the absurdity and horror of

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.770
existing in human form. The primary sin of
those who made us feel ashamed was not so

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.360
much that they spotted our flaws, it’s that
they forgot their own awfulness – and then

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.290
had the gall to blame us for our own. We should
give up on fascistic perfectionism in order

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.830
to make a generous home for our cracked reality
in our own and in the collective imagination.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.800
That’ll be the start of our way out of the
problem of shame.
