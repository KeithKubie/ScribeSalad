00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.045
Recall that the typical multi chronic
disease patient, like Marla here,

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:09.190
fills around 50 prescriptions a year,
because for

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.150
most chronic diseases medications
are the main treatment.

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:18.155
Misuse of medication, including in
particular duplicate medications,

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:22.625
because of poor coordination among
providers, is a major problem

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:27.335
that accounts for nearly a third
of all hospitalizations in the US.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:33.730
Surveys by the Commonwealth Fund
in 2008 and 2011 show progress.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.155
Here we see the United States improving.

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:41.450
But still,
28% of patients surveyed report

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.270
that no provider has reviewed their
medications with them in the past year.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.080
Such review could help ensure
that patients are taking

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.927
only the medications they need,
and are taken them properly.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.930
One reason for the absence of review,
is that physicians may not even know

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.560
the medications that other
physicians have prescribed.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.460
We'll return to it later on, but

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.630
this process called
medication reconciliation,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.280
is a clear opportunity for health IT,
once the underlying records are digital.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.640
Here's a screenshot from
an actual commercial HIT system.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.240
Showing the medications in this
physicians EMR on the right, and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.800
those out in other EMR's on the left.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.760
The system even highlights this
medication,which the patient is taking,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.730
but which isn't in this provider's EMR.
