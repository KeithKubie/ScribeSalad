CAT ALLMAN: Hi.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.560
I'm Cat Allman with
Google's Open Source team.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.850
I'm here today with one of my
favorite colleagues, Jeremy

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.660
Allison of the Samba Project,
to tell you all about Samba.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.340
Hi, Jeremy.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.100
JEREMY ALLISON: Hi, Cat.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.070
CAT ALLMAN: So starting in
general terms, elevator speech,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.970
what is Samba?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.030
JEREMY ALLISON: Samba is a
file print and authentication

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.530
server.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.265
And that sounds incredibly
boring, because it is.

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.710
It's basically part
of the glue that

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
allows computers to
connect to each other.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.470
Unlike the internet,
it's an older technology

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.750
that's designed for
local file sharing.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.400
So rather than being somewhere,
and connecting to your Wi-Fi

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.210
and wondering where a printer
is, with the SMB technology

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.960
that Samba implements,
which is commonly

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.690
used by Windows clients, you
browse your local network

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.810
and you would print or get
access to local resources.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.060
It's the technology used
behind the Microsoft's Active

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.225
Directory, if that helps.

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:13.600
CAT ALLMAN: You
mentioned Windows

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.330
and I always thought
Samba was all

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.950
about making Windows resources
available to everybody

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.000
else, and vice-versa.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.100
JEREMY ALLISON: It's about
making Linux and Unix

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.990
machines export resources
to Windows clients.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.130
But these days, SMB's actually
being quite widely adopted

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.860
by both Linux and Mac,
less so by Android,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.270
although there are many
apps that will talk SMB.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.110
So it's less of a
Windows only technology,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.020
and there people actually who
use SMB going between Unix

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.472
to Unix, which is very
strange from where it started.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:51.430
CAT ALLMAN: Yes, it is.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.570
How many people are
touched by Samba?

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140
I mean, is this something
that only developers use?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.640
Or is it under the hood?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.316
JEREMY ALLISON: I like to
refer to it as plumbing, which

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:05.690
is nice because it means I'm
the equivalent of a plumber,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.800
with a plunger
removing blockages.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.780
It's the technology that's
used behind many, many

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.530
network-attached
storage devices.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.620
As I like to joke, if
you go in to Fry's,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.550
or any other electronics
store, and you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.166
buy a disk that's advertised
as network-attached storage,

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.790
something that you'd
be able to connect

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.170
to over your wireless LAN
or over your wired LAN, that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.420
stores your music
medium or whatever,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.860
I like to say if it
costs under $10,000,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740
it's got Samba inside it.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.730
It's actually used in a
great number of products.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.862
CAT ALLMAN: Roku, set-top
boxes, things like that?

00:02:47.862 --> 00:02:49.320
JEREMY ALLISON:
Some set-top boxes,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.110
but they mainly use
the client piece,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.440
because the set-top boxes
want to access the resources

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380
and the client piece
is actually built

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.130
into Linux, which is commonly
used for those boxes.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.559
Samba itself, the project, is
more of the server-side piece,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.850
which is what runs on the
network-attached storage that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.050
exports to the clients.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.420
It's more like Netgear,
Western Digital,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.070
many of the
network-attached storage.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.530
Blanking on a lot of
there names right now.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.800
It's also started
to be used in what's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.020
called cloud gateway storage.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.020
People who want to get access to
resources stored in the cloud,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.540
but they want to use
local applications that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.240
think they're talking
to a local file

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.150
but are actually talking
to cloud storage.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.840
What quite a few
companies are doing now

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.300
is using Samba as a gateway.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.790
So they have a device
that they will sell you

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.300
that actually pretends to
be a local file server,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.930
but is actually accessing
resources that exist out

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.390
in the internet cloud.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.250
CAT ALLMAN: When
did Samba start?

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.920
How did you come up with this?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.300
JEREMY ALLISON:
It wasn't just me.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.250
It was actually
originally created

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.780
by myself and a friend of mine,
Andrew Tridgell in Australia.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.650
And it's actually older
than the Linux kernel,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.850
or around the same age.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.070
It's a very old,
established project.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.220
It's about 20, 21 years old.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.589
And essentially, he
was a PhD student

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.695
who was trying to find
something else to do rather

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.440
than these studies and
writing his thesis.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.670
And I was actually
working for a company that

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.260
needed to share files between
Windows and Unix machines

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.120
and was completely fed up
with the only thing that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.560
was being sold at
the time, which

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.120
was PCNFS, which was horrible.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.270
Essentially, we banded
together and started

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.820
to develop something better
that talked to the Windows

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.860
protocols.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.640
And it attracted more developers
and has grown from there,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.420
really.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.310
CAT ALLMAN: How many developers
are, generally speaking,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.677
contributing to the project?

00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:57.010
JEREMY ALLISON: Well, it varies.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.420
We have a lot of
alumni people who've

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.770
come through, worked
on the project,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.310
and gone on to better
and brighter things.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.170
Many of them actually
work at Google.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.340
And we have people
like myself, who

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.220
stayed working on the project
for its entire lifetime,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.960
and also [INAUDIBLE] who
has a German company that

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.710
supports Samba.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.850
I would say there
are probably about 10

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.720
to 15 active developers, so it's
actually quite a small project.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.970
There are many, many of the
peripheral developers-- people

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.520
doing testing, people
doing QA, people

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.740
who come in to fix a specific
bug that's really bugging them

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.290
and then go away again because
they've got the fix in they

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.859
need.

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:44.025
CAT ALLMAN: And Samba's
your full-time time job here

00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.160
at Google?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.860
JEREMY ALLISON: 80%.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.590
So most Googlers have 20% time.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.252
I have 80% time, but 20% of the
time I'm doing things for you.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.210
CAT ALLMAN: Nice, nice.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:57.930
JEREMY ALLISON: Appearing
on these interviews,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.156
these kinds of things.

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:02.530
CAT ALLMAN: I understand you
just released a new version.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.970
What, three weeks ago?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.180
JEREMY ALLISON: Actually,
the big new version

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.480
came out about a year or so
ago, and that was Samba 4.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.140
We release versions
fairly regularly,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:22.830
so unless it's a
major release, it's

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.890
mainly bug fixes of
interest to people

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.960
who are following the project
and need specific things fixed.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.450
But the big new release
we did, which was Samba 4,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.330
was our first implementation
of an active directory domain

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.270
controller.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.230
So for the first
time, you can actually

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.100
have Windows clients talking to
and cooperating with a domain

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.780
controller, an active
directory domain

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.630
controller, full
active directory, that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.630
is not made by Microsoft.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.440
And it will inter-operate with
Microsoft active directory

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.720
domain controllers
and, in fact, Microsoft

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.310
have worked with us actually
fixed some bugs on the Windows

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.040
client side to make
this work for us.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.010
I'm pretty happy about that.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.180
That's a really cool new thing.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.180
CAT ALLMAN: Are you looking
for new contributors

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.010
to the project?

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.550
JEREMY ALLISON: Always.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.570
As with most open source
projects, we're desperate.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.820
We could always do
with more contributors.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.180
The kind of things
that we need are,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.900
while Samba's written in C, so
it's kind of an old project,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.540
so if you really want to do
sort of down-and-dirty, very

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.290
hard technical work, Samba
is the place to do it.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.370
There's a lot of very
hard, very technical work

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.750
that needs doing.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.060
Lots of bugs that need fixing.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.830
You can learn about very
many core technologies

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.230
by working on Samba--
security technologies,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:48.120
file sharing technologies,
how to do encryption,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.900
all these kind of things.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.380
But we also need people
who can help document it,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.130
because like most
open source projects,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.170
it's terribly documented.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.620
We have a record for
the longest man page,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.120
I think something like 300
or 500 pages, all of which

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.450
are configuration options,
many of which are confusing.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:19.260
What would really help is
people who could write,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.500
technical writers, essentially.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.180
And also people who can do QA,
quality assurance, and also

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.830
people who could help market
it, people who can help

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.640
explain how it works,
write up scenarios.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.230
We have a wiki that
describes how it's used,

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.960
and how it can be used.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.470
It's so big and
it's so flexible,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.430
it's hard to describe
in a short time.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.160
But the great
reason for doing so

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.910
is that I get pinged
regularly by companies looking

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.100
for engineers who
have Samba experience.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.460
If you're looking
for a job, and you're

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.440
in the technical
industry, working on Samba

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.520
is a very, very
good way to get one.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.130
CAT ALLMAN: OK, so
where do people go?

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.640
JEREMY ALLISON: Samba.org
is our main website.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.060
And everything is under there.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.810
There's the wiki.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.620
There's the git repository.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.070
There's all the mailing lists.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.480
To get started I would recommend
joining the Samba mailing list.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.289
And that's mainly
for users of Samba.

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:24.080
If you want to get a
little more technical,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.970
we have a Samba
technical mailing list.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.390
And then we have a
Samba-technical IRC channel

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:40.714
on freenode.net, which is the
main open source IRC server.

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.130
CAT ALLMAN: Anything
else you want

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.340
to tell people
about the project?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.884
I assume it's fun
or you wouldn't

00:09:46.884 --> 00:09:48.300
have spent a long
time doing this.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.580
JEREMY ALLISON:
It's amazingly fun.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.550
The thing about it
is it keeps changing,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.060
and this is why I
still work on it,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.590
this is why I still find
it fun and interesting.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:04.080
You can work on as simple things
as parsing configuration files,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.150
very, very simple bug
fixes, all the way up

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.450
to research level projects
that are funded by IBM to do

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.550
with distributed clustered
file storage technologies

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.000
and synchronizing file
systems between many hundreds

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.710
of machines.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.060
And it's all there,
all there in the code.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.350
I won't say it's available
in small bite size chunks,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.950
but everything is there.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.550
This is the wonderful thing,
and the wonderful thing

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.490
about most open source, is
that by working on this stuff

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.040
you can see code that is
used in the real world.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.600
If you're a student, and
you're looking at this stuff,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.670
you're not working
on toy projects.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.440
You're not working
on tiny things

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.410
that your professors
have assigned

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.810
to solve trivial problems.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.360
You're working on real
problems that real engineers

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.100
are using in real
world solutions.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.960
You're actually seeing
the code, the glue

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.640
that holds the world together.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.777
And it's a real thing.

00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:01.860
You can make a difference.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.300
You can actually contribute
and change it yourself.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.840
And that's just intoxicating.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.350
That's kind of
how I got started.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.030
It's like, I send the
patches over here,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.290
and they turn up in the product.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.650
It's amazing.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.070
You can actually change
the world with this stuff.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.530
CAT ALLMAN: I'm totally
stealing that line about this

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.440
is the glue that holds
the world together.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.040
JEREMY ALLISON: Fair enough.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.250
It's absolutely compelling.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.146
If you're an
engineer, or if you're

00:11:27.146 --> 00:11:28.520
interested in
technical things, I

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.060
can't imagine anything
more fun to do.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.120
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.079
Thank you, Jeremy.

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.370
JEREMY ALLISON: Thank you, Cat.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.580
CAT ALLMAN: And thank all
of you for joining us.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.910
I urge you to go to
samba.org and check it out.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.420
And if it ignites even a
tiny fraction of the passion

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.050
that Jeremy has for
Samba, I'd encourage

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.366
you to consider
becoming a contributor.

00:11:50.366 --> 00:11:51.866
JEREMY ALLISON:
Thank you very much.

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:52.580
CAT ALLMAN: Bye.
