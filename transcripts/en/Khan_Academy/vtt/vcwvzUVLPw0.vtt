00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.830
What I want to do in this
videos is to make to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.325
parametrizations of essentially
the same curve, but we're going

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.710
to go along the curve
a different rates.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.610
And hopefully we'll be able to
use that to understand, or get

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.580
a better intuition, behind what
exactly it means to take a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.560
derivative of a position
vector valued function.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.080
So let's say my first
parametrization, I have

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.050
x of t is equal to t.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.990
And let's say that y of t
is equal to t squared.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.570
And this is true for t is
greater than or equal to 0,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.060
and less than or equal to 2.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.020
And if I want to write this
as a position vector valued

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.975
function, let me write this.

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:50.240
x1, call that y1, and let me
write my position vector valued

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.707
function; I could say r1-- I'm
numbering them because I'm

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:56.910
going to do a different version
of this exact same curve with a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.020
slightly different
parametrization --so r1 one of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.150
t, we could say is x1 of t
times i-- the unit vector i

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.300
--so we'll just say t times i
plus-- this is just x of t

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.410
right here, or x1 of t; I'm
numbering them because I'll

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.940
later have an x2 t --plus
t squared times j.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.940
And if I wanted to graph this,
I'm going to be very careful

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.860
graphing it because I really
want to understand what the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.090
derivative means here.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.040
Try to draw it
roughly to scale.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.080
So let's say that this is
one, two, three, four.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.240
Then let me draw my x-axis.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.430
That's good enough.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.000
And my x-axis, I want it to be
roughly to scale, one and two.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.500
And so at t equals 0, both my x
and y coordinates are at 0-- or

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.060
this is just going to be the 0
vector, so this is where we are

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.710
a t equals 0 --at t equals 1
this is going to be one times

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.800
i-- we're going to be just
like that --plus 1 times j.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.320
1 squared is j, so we're
going to be right there.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.470
And then at t is equal to 2,
we're going to be at 2i.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.410
So 2i-- you could imagine 2
times i would be this vector

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.560
right there --2 times i plus
4-- 2 squared is 4 --4 times

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.770
j, so plus 4 times j.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.610
If you add these two vectors
heads to tails, you're going

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.370
to get a vector that's
end point is right there.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.050
The vector is going to
look something like this.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.830
So this is what, just to
make it clear what we're

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.230
doing, that's r1 of 2.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.740
This is r1 of 0.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.130
This is r1 of 1.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.150
But the bottom line is the
path looks like this:

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.090
it's a parabola.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.040
So the path will
look like that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.840
Now that's in my first
parametrization of it.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.470
Actually, let me draw a
little bit more carefully.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.110
I want to get rid of this
arrows, just because I want it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.210
to be a nice clean drawing.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.185
So it's going to be a parabola.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.510
Let me get rid of that other
point, too, just because I

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.550
didn't draw it exactly where
it needs to be; it needs

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.170
to be right there.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.810
And my parabola, or part of
my parabola is going to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.360
look something like that.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.780
All right.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.290
Good enough.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.520
So this is the first
parametrization.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.390
Now I'm going to do this exact
same curve, but I'm going to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.160
do it slightly differently.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.660
So let's say I'll do it
in different colors.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.400
So x2 of t, let's it equals 2t.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.570
And y2 of t, let's say
it's equal to 2t squared.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.330
Or we could alternatively write
that, that's the same thing as

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.290
4t squared, just phrasing
both of these guys

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.340
to the second power.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.980
And then let's say instead of
going from t equals 0 to 2,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.110
we're going to go from
t goes from 0 to 1.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.460
But we're going to see,
we're going to cover

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.390
the exact same path.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:22.220
And our second position vector
valued function, r2 of t, is

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.740
going to be equal to 2t times i
plus-- I could say 2t squared

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.650
--4t squared times j.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.940
And if I were to graph this guy
right here, it would look

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.780
like-- let me draw my axes
again; it's going to look the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.000
same, but it's I think useful
to draw it because I'm going to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.170
draw the derivatives and
all that on it later.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.370
One, two, three, four.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.680
One, two.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.980
And then let's see what happens
when t is equal to 0-- or r of

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.100
0; all these are going to be 0,
we're just going to have the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.420
zero vector; x and y are both
equal to 0 --when t is equal

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.820
to 1/2 what are we
going to get here?

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.530
1/2 times 2 is 1.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.300
And then we're going to
get the point 1/2 squared

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.330
is 1/4 times 4 is 1.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.110
So when t is equal 1/2 we're
going to be at the point 1, 1.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.690
And when the t is equal
to 1 we're going to

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.730
be at the point 2, 4.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.595
So notice the curve is
exactly, the path we go

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:40.290
is exactly the same.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.840
But before we even do the
derivatives, these two

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.310
paths are identical.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.590
I want to think
about something.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.010
Let's pretend that our
parameter, t, really is time.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.230
And that tends to be the
most common, that's

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.210
why they call it t.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.260
It doesn't have to be time,
but let's say it is time.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.540
So what's happening here?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.290
In the first parametrization
when we go from 0 to 2

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.680
seconds we cover this path.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.900
You can imagine after 1
second the dot moves here,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.463
then it moves there.

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:10.310
You can imagine a dot moving
along this curve, and it

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.090
takes two seconds to do so.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.580
In this situation we have a dot
moving along the same curve,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.230
but it's able to cover the same
curve in only one second; and

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.530
half a second it gets here.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.390
It took this guy one
second to get here.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.810
In a one second, this guy's all
the way over here; this guy

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.610
takes two seconds
to go over here.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.960
So in this second
parametrization even though the

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.580
path is the same, the curves
are the same, the

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.585
dot is faster.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.790
I want you to keep that in
mind when we think about

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.030
the derivatives of both
of these position vector

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.630
valued functions.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.860
So just remember the dot is
moving faster for every second

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.616
it's getting further along the
curve than here; that's why it

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:51.930
only took them one second.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.410
Now let's look at the
derivatives of both

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.840
of these guys.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.540
So the derivative here, so if I
were to write r prime, r1 prime

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.320
of t-- let me do that in a
different color, actually,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.230
already used the orange; so let
me do it in the blue

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.320
--r1 prime us t.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.650
So the is the derivative now.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.190
It's going to be, remember,
it's just the derivative of

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.490
each of these times
the unit vectors.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.570
So the derivative of t with
respect to t, that's just 1.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.920
So it's 1 times i.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.940
I'll just write 1i plus-- I
didn't have to write the one

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.210
there --plus the derivative
of t squared with respect

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.132
to t is 2t plus 2t j.

00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:38.690
And let me take the
derivative over here.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.310
r2 prime of t.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.120
The derivative of 2t with
respect to t is 2, so

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.960
2i, plus the derivative
of 4t squared is 8t.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.520
2 times 4, it is rt.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.410
Just like that.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:10.400
Now the question is, what do
their respective derivative

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.050
vectors look like at
different points?

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.680
So let's look at, I don't know,
let's see how fast they're

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.350
moving when time is equal to 1.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.020
So let's take it at
a specific point.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.800
This is just the general
formula, but let's figure

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.150
out what the derivative
is at a specific point.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:31.240
So let's take r1 when
time is equal to 1.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.110
And I want to take this
specific point on the curve,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.320
not the specific point in time.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.750
So this point on the curve
here is when time is equal

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.090
to 1, you could say second.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.150
This point over here, which
is the exact corresponding

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.070
point, is when time
is equal 1/2 second.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.660
So r1 of 1 is equal to--
we're taking the derivative

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.950
there --is equal to 1i.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.270
It's not dependent on t at all.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:01.980
So it's 1i plus 2
times 1j, so plus 2j.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:08.720
So at this point the derivative
of our position vector function

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.440
is going to be 1i plus 2j.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.150
So we can draw it like this. so
if we do 1i is like this: 1i.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.670
And then 2j.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.390
Just 2j is like that.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.130
So our derivative right there,
I'll do it in the same

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.200
color that I wrote it in.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.040
It's in this green color; it's
going to look like this.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.240
And notice it looks like, at
least its direction is-- let me

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:39.820
do it a little bit straighter
--its direction looks tangent

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.900
to the curve; it's going in
the direction that my

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.700
particle is moving.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.270
Remember my particle is moving
from here to there, so it's

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.400
going in the direction.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.730
And I'm going to think about,
in a second, what this length

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.610
of this to derivative
vector is.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:54.210
This right here, just to
be clear is, r1 prime.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.610
It's a vector, so it's telling
us the instantaneous change in

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.540
our position vector with
respect to t, or time, when

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.970
time is equal to 1 second.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.400
That's this thing right here.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.390
Now let's take the exact same
position here on our curve.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.450
But that's going to occur at a
different time for this guy.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.960
We already said it only takes
him, he's here at time

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.320
is equal to 1/2 second.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.850
So let's take-- --I'll
do it in the same color

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.340
--so here we have r2.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.010
We're going to evaluate it at
1/2 half because this is at

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.570
time is equal 1/2 second.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.590
And this is going to be equal
to 2i-- this isn't dependent

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:36.510
at all on time --so 2i
plus 8 times the time.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.430
So time right here is 1/2.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.650
So 8 times 1/2 is 4.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.920
So plus 4j.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.610
So what does this look like?

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.220
The instantaneous
derivative here.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.640
Oh, and this is the derivative;
have to be very clear.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.130
So 2i-- let me draw some
more --so 2i maybe gets

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.510
us about that far.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.350
Plus 4j will get us up
to right around there.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.800
Plus 4j is that factor.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.950
So when you add those two heads
to tails, you get this thing:

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.800
you get something that-- let me
like --you get something

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.065
that looks like that.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.070
I didn't draw it as neatly
as I would like to.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.370
But let's notice something:
both of these vectors are going

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.820
in the exact same direction.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.550
They're both tangential to
the path, to our curve.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.340
But this vector is going, its
length, its magnitude, is

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.050
much larger than this
vector's magnitude.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.610
And that makes sense because I
hinted at it when we first

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.960
talked about these vector
valued position functions and

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.650
their derivatives; is that the
length, you can kind of

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.480
view it as the speed.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.420
The length is equal to the
speed if you imagine t being

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.900
time and these parametrizations
are representing a dot

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.320
moving along these curves.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.080
So in this case, the particle
only takes a second to go

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.390
there, so at this point in its
path, it's moving much faster

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.810
than this particle is.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.540
So if you think about it, this
vector right here, if you

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.715
imagine this is a position
factor, this is velocity.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.330
Velocity is speed
plus the direction.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.630
Speed is just you know,
how fast are you going?

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.930
Velocity is how fast you're
going in what direction?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.590
I'm going this fast-- and you
could calculate it using the

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.260
Pythagorean Theorem, but I just
want to give you the intuition

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.430
right here --I'm going that
fast in this direction.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.770
Here I'm going this fast;
I'm going even faster.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.340
That's my magnitude,
but I'm still going in

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.710
the same direction.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.240
So hopefully you have a gut
feeling now of what the

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.380
derivative of these position
vectors really are.
