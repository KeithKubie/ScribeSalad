00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.530
At this point, we need to have
finished installing X-Code.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.740
So if you haven't yet,
pause this video, and

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.450
take a moment to finish
the installation.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.410
Since I already have X-Code installed,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.850
I'm ready to launch
the Maze application.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.120
To launch the app, we need to first
launch X-Code, and you can do this by

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.980
clicking on the spotlight icon in
the top right hand corner of the screen.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.240
Or optionally you can hit command and
then space and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.410
that'll bring up the same spotlight
search and then type, xcode.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.980
This will bring up
the Xcode launch screen.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.640
&gt;From the launch screen you can
create new Xcode projects,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.110
open existing projects or
create a playground.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.580
We won't quite be using playgrounds yet.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.310
But they're a great tool for
experimenting and writing swift code.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.300
For now you'll want to open
an existing Xcode project,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
the Maze project to be precise.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.880
We've created the Maze project
ahead of time for you, so

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.130
if you haven't downloaded
it already go ahead and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.390
download it first before
continuing ahead.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.620
Once you've downloaded the project and
saved it somewhere on your computer,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.970
select Open another project and then
you want to navigate to the project.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.800
So I've saved it on my desktop and you
want to open up the xcode project file.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.310
And we'll give it a second to load,
and here we go.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.370
This is Xcode.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.950
It's a huge application, so we'll
start taking it one piece at a time.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.950
To run the Maze application,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
click on the play button in the upper
left hand corner of the Xcode interface.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.190
You may also hear this button
referred to as the Run button.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.250
This will launch the iOS
simulator with the Maze app.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.300
And there we go.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.420
Congratulations!

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.710
You've launched your first app.
