00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.931
Death and taxes are famously inevitable,
but what about decomposition?

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:16.559
As anyone who's seen a mummy knows,

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.863
ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble
to evade decomposition.

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:26.042
So, how successful were they?

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:28.897
Living cells constantly renew themselves.

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:32.271
Specialized enzymes 
decompose old structures,

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.612
and the raw materials 
are used to build new ones.

00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:38.730
But what happens when someone dies?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.591
Their dead cells are no longer
able to renew themselves,

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:45.179
but the enzymes 
keep breaking everything down.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.795
So anyone looking to preserve a body

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:52.225
needed to get ahead of those enzymes
before the tissues began to rot.

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:54.301
Neurons die quickly,

00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.996
so brains were a lost cause
to Ancient Egyptian mummifiers,

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.601
which is why, according 
to Greek historian Herodotus,

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:06.053
they started the process
by hammering a spike into the skull,

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:09.146
mashing up the brain, 
flushing it out the nose

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:14.954
and pouring tree resins into the skull
to prevent further decomposition.

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:21.122
Brains may decay first,
but decaying guts are much worse.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:26.648
The liver, stomach and intestines
contain digestive enzymes and bacteria,

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:32.089
which, upon death, start eating
the corpse from the inside.

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:36.675
So the priests removed the lungs
and abdominal organs first.

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.762
It was difficult to remove the lungs
without damaging the heart,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:43.258
but because the heart was believed
to be the seat of the soul,

00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:45.608
they treated it with special care.

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:47.819
They placed the visceral organs in jars

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.159
filled with a naturally occurring salt
called natron.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.840
Like any salt, natron can prevent decay 
by killing bacteria

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.251
and preventing the body's natural
digestive enzymes from working.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.783
But natron isn't just any salt.

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:07.991
It's mainly a mixture 
of two alkaline salts,

00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:11.013
soda ash and baking soda.

00:02:11.013 --> 00:02:14.814
Alkaline salts are especially
deadly to bacteria.

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:19.490
And they can turn fatty membranes
into a hard, soapy substance,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.839
thereby maintaining 
the corpse's structure.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.201
After dealing with the internal organs,

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.279
the priest stuffed the body cavity
with sacks of more natron

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.696
and washed it clean to disinfect the skin.

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:37.569
Then, the corpse was set in a bed
of still more natron

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.515
for about 35 days 
to preserve its outer flesh.

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:44.412
By the time of its removal,

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:47.589
the alkaline salts 
had sucked the fluid from the body

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.549
and formed hard brown clumps.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.661
The corpse wasn't putrid,

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:56.389
but it didn't exactly smell good, either.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.865
So, priests poured tree resin over
the body to seal it,

00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:04.329
massaged it with a waxy mixture
that included cedar oil,

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.987
and then wrapped it in linen.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:10.715
Finally, they placed the mummy
in a series of nested coffins

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:14.907
and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus.

00:03:14.907 --> 00:03:19.685
So how successful were 
the ancient Egyptians at evading decay?

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:24.853
On one hand, mummies are definitely not
intact human bodies.

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:28.826
Their brains have been mashed up
and flushed out,

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:32.876
their organs have been removed
and salted like salami,

00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:37.371
and about half of their remaining
body mass has been drained away.

00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:41.974
Still, what remains 
is amazingly well-preserved.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:43.768
Even after thousands of years,

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:46.344
scientists can perform autopsies 
on mummies

00:03:46.344 --> 00:03:48.685
to determine their causes of death,

00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:52.635
and possibly even isolate DNA samples.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:55.458
This has given us new information.

00:03:55.458 --> 00:04:01.370
For example, it seems that air pollution
was a serious problem in ancient Egypt,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.714
probably because of indoor fires 
used to bake bread.

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:11.691
Cardiovascular disease was also common,
as was tuberculosis.

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:16.302
So ancient Egyptians were somewhat
successful at evading decay.

00:04:16.302 --> 00:04:21.206
Still, like death, taxes are inevitable.

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:26.575
When some mummies were transported,
they were taxed as salted fish.
