00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; First it is my sincere pleasure
to introduce our main [inaudible] --

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.930
&gt;&gt; -- Rich.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.190
I think she is finally getting
her sound up and running.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.130
Thanks, Cindy.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650 position:69%
Cindy is Director of the Library of Congress
Teaching with Primary Sources Program

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.500
at Eastern Illinois University
in Charleston, Illinois.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.500 position:61%
She's also a faculty member in the
Department of Secondary Education there

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.510
where she teaches a course
on literacy, differentiation,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.490
and assessment for pre-service
teachers seeking certification

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.580 position:56%
in any secondary level content area.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.400 position:72%
I'm Cheryl Lederle, and I'm an Educational
Resource Specialist at the Library of Congress

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.640 position:70%
and I'll be supporting Cindy on this session.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.250
One of my jobs in that support
role is to collect questions

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.580 position:67%
and I will be giving those back to Cindy in
the last 10 minutes of our time together.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.980
So it looks like many of
you have found the Chat Box.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.900 position:58%
Please use that box again to enter
your questions and I'll collect them.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.770 position:72%
Now I'm going to turn this over to Cindy Rich.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.100
&gt;&gt; So I want to thank you
very much for taking time

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.760 position:69%
to join this session this evening, actually.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.440 position:75%
We're very excited to be here this afternoon for
the first Library of Congress Online Conference

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.470 position:75%
for Teachers, and we are going to jump right in.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.480 position:58%
During this session we're going to
talk a little bit about opportunities

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.610 position:59%
to increase content knowledge and free
students' minds and promote inquiry.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.610 position:69%
Strong literacy skills and content knowledge
free the mind for independence and inquiry

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.700 position:59%
and everytime I see this slide I think
of the En Vogue song, "Free Your Mind

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.370 position:58%
and the Rest Will Follow," because it
really -- it just happens naturally.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.940 position:63%
Once we empower our students to go after
information, the rest will just come.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.750 position:75%
We'll look at ways that we can make this happen,
and I hope you'll continue your discussions

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.360
and sharing ideas in the chat area.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.950
You won't offend us at all.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.540 position:64%
Teachers are great at multitasking, but I
would like to ask you, if you don't mind,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.080
just share in that chat box
what maybe state you're from

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.280 position:72%
and then also what content area you teach just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.760
so we can have an idea of
who's in the room with us.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.970
Math, civics, library.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.650
This is awesome.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.170
We have a nice mix of both
grade levels and content areas.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.060
And I think that's the beauty of
literacy, that we are all going

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.160
through the same steps trying
to help students learn.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.480 position:64%
And we're going to talk about that today.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.940
All right.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.550
We've even got pre-K through 12
represented with the library.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.660
Wonderful.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.610
This is a great mix.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.060
This is so exciting and I'm
so pumped to see this.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.080 position:72%
Okay. Well, hopefully, we'll hit something for
everyone, and while we're doing this, please,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160 position:69%
please, please be more than willing to share

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.300 position:69%
with your colleagues online here what you're
doing and how any of these things apply

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.250
to your classroom or anything
you want to contribute.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.220 position:67%
The first thing we're going to talk about
in this session is that we're going to talk

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.140 position:63%
about the value of engaging learners and
activating prior knowledge to establish

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.290 position:59%
that foundation within a content area.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.530 position:66%
Schools are a little bit unique because we
expect our students to leave one classroom

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.310 position:67%
and then enter another classroom while they
completely shift their focus, all right?

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.520 position:64%
And for those of you in the middle school
and the high school we won't even talk

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.120
about the adolescent brain
in asking them to do this.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.280
But we know that the real
world doesn't work that way.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.210 position:58%
Whenever we work with people and talk

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.770 position:70%
with people we're constantly crossing content
areas and, you know, what we're talking

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.230
about primarily in one meeting
may come up during other meetings,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.520
but it's sort of like the waves on
a beach where the topics come in

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.520 position:67%
and go out and just kind of crash together.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.220
And so we're asking our students to
switch just because a bell rings.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.840 position:66%
And so it's important that we get them all
on the same page when we start a class.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.090
We want everyone to be on that same
page but we know and we recognize

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.700 position:70%
that students have different skill levels and
interests when they come into our classrooms.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.610
And so we want to be able to
pull that out of those students

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.130 position:69%
so everyone can learn from what we're doing.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.400
The second part of this session
is going to be looking

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.590 position:70%
at how we can present key content information
while also supporting literacy skills

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.850 position:69%
and using primary sources as teaching tools.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.980 position:72%
Again, those multitasks that we're so good at.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.100
The key to this is making the
primary source work for you.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.240 position:56%
We all know primary sources are
really cool, but you want to be sure

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.680 position:73%
that you're getting something from that primary
source when you use it in a learning activity.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.600
And it needs to earn its
place in your classroom.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600
It's not just decoration.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.580 position:61%
It has to be, the primary source has to
be a tool that you're using to teach.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.090 position:64%
Of course this involves really thoughtful
planning before you even select a

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.710
primary source.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
And so those primary sources
need to be relevant,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.610 position:61%
appropriate, and best of all, engaging.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.280
Luckily, the Library of Congress
has millions of these,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.210
so we won't have a problem
finding ones that we can use.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.480 position:58%
As teachers within our content areas,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.600 position:73%
you already know which strategies are effective
during different points of the learning cycle.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.370 position:69%
And so we're going to choose strategies that
give opportunities for repeated exposure

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.790 position:67%
to vocabulary and concepts, expose
students to the nuances, academic language,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.320 position:58%
and discourse of your content area or
whatever topic you're talking about,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.400 position:70%
and encourage students to connect and
transfer information within our content area,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.970 position:70%
and in a perfect world outside of our content
area in what they're learning down the hall.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.920 position:72%
And I can't make the slides change, so I don't
know if Kathy or Cheryl can help me with that.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.240
Thank you.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.800 position:66%
We'll do a little game when it comes time.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.510
All right.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.460 position:61%
To start out, each of us bring a unique
perspective, background, our strengths,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.700
our weaknesses, and interest
into what we're doing.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.060 position:59%
And this is what makes teaching
amazing but also makes it challenging.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.180
So if you don't mind, in the
chat area, would you let us know,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.630 position:61%
is this your first year teaching, 20th
year teaching, or somewhere in-between?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.970
I'm very curious as to what
level of -- all right.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.970
Student teaching, pre-service,
22 years, 23 years.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.990
Great. I lost count.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.710
I get that.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.570
All right.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.120 position:58%
Well, each of us are bringing our own
level of expertise in anything we do.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.930
But no matter how long you've
been doing it, you speak teaching.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.440 position:66%
We know that, you know, just by looking at
this there are teachers who speak science,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.560
teachers who speak social
studies, special education,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.000 position:59%
and all these different content areas.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.920
But now my question for you
is, what else do you speak?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.180 position:58%
And so this may be a hobby, it may
be a content area, it may be a skill,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:29.230 position:64%
it may be a medical condition, anything
that you know well enough that you speak.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.970
Margaret speaks tech.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.230
Chris speaks politics.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.160
Mack speaks swimming.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.480 position:66%
Arnie speaks [inaudible] outdoors, tennis.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.690 position:59%
All right, we're seeing hobbies, we're
seeing work, we're seeing pleasure.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:55.640 position:61%
And this is awesome because it may come
from a desire to something you want

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.780 position:56%
to do or it may come from necessity.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.950
But you've learned the art
of discourse in that topic.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.640
Genealogy, athletics, very cool.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.710
What a great group.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.190
Man, I wish we were all together.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.100
This would be fun.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.050
All right.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.300 position:69%
So we know, though, for students who are
new to a concept or struggle with materials,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.210 position:56%
something as small as vocabulary
can be a -- we are together, Cheryl.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.620
You're right.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.000
All right.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.430
We could be -- something as simple
as vocabulary can be a hurdle.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.510
And so we want to take that
hurdle away for our students.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.720 position:75%
Have you ever been in a situation where everyone
in a conversation knows someone and is talking

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.420
about them, but you have
no idea who that person is?

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.410
That little piece of information
comes in really handy.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.950 position:64%
We want our students to be in a position
where they know what we're talking about.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.370
If they don't know what you're
talking about they can't take it

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.980 position:66%
to the next level and get the information.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.400 position:58%
So we're going to talk about these
terms on the screen in a few minutes.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.080
Have you ever heard any -- I mean
this is a rhetorical question.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.400
Have you heard any or all
of these terms defined?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.420 position:75%
In the chat I'm going to ask you to share either
a formal definition for any of these words

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:19.930 position:67%
that you've heard or just a -- in casual
conversation how you heard these described.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.870
There are no wrong answers here.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.070
I'm not asking you to define them.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:30.260
I'm asking what you have heard
in relation to these terms.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.970
So you can't get it wrong.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.910
Nice, Matthew.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.190
All right.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.970
Literacy and fluency.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.060 position:59%
Jenna says informational texts are
boring, which we all know they're not.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.950 position:70%
Sometimes we're convincing our students that.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.970
All right.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.630 position:66%
Well, not to rush you, but for the sake of
this presentation, these are the meanings

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.330
that I've assigned to these words.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.220 position:59%
It doesn't mean that other
descriptions or definitions are wrong.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.180 position:58%
These are just within the context of
this session what we're going to use.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:40.320 position:70%
So for informational text, remove this from
the fiction/nonfiction or genre conversation.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.610 position:56%
For this presentation, we're simply
going to refer to informational text

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.980 position:58%
as anything you get information from.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.490
All right?

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:56.250 position:63%
Common Core state standard documentation
says that informational texts are books

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:01.750 position:64%
about diverse topics, technical texts,
and digital sources on a range of topics.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.480
But we are talking big.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.570 position:58%
I want you to just think no limits as
to what an informational text can be.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:16.410 position:64%
Literacy. Once upon a time it was simply
defined as the ability to read and write.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.210 position:61%
But now the term literacy's heard all
over academic walls and means knowledge

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.820
that relates to a specific subject.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.980 position:69%
Literacy has become complete embedded in our
normal vocabulary to describe the ability

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.210 position:56%
to strategically understand and
communicate an act within a context.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:40.620 position:69%
And last week, I know I've heard the phrases
"financially literate, football literate,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.150
and cancer literate," because
these are different contexts

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:51.770 position:59%
where people learn a language, learn
how to both give and take information,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.700 position:72%
and how to perform or act within that context.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.850
So it's being aware.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.460 position:75%
And then fluency, if we think about being fluent
in a foreign language or a second language,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.300 position:59%
it's basically the ability to not just
be able to say the words and speak it,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.840 position:56%
but to go beyond just recognition
to comprehend and construct meaning.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.970 position:67%
We want them to speak science and be fluent
in science, or Shakespeare, or politics,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.250 position:69%
or the Harlem Renaissance, or whatever it is
that we're talking about in our classroom.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:32.500 position:72%
Once they're able to fluently speak the
content then they can really dig into the meat

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.950
of what we're doing in our class.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:44.770 position:72%
By mastering contextual awareness we can focus
on the deeper understanding and new knowledge.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:45.790
All right.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.600
From the Library of Congress
Teachers Page and experiences,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.970 position:61%
I know primary sources engage students.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.040 position:61%
Primary sources help students relate
in a personal way to events of the past

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.290 position:56%
and promote deeper understanding of
history as a series of human events.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.790 position:56%
Because primary sources are snippets
of history, they encourage students

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.720
to seek additional evidence through
research and first person accounts

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.830 position:59%
of events help make them more real,
fostering active reading and response.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:25.800 position:59%
A thoughtfully selected primary source
can be provocative and set a tone

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.810 position:73%
for a class activity or a learning environment.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.320
You chose something like this image
that we're looking at right now.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.570
It's a pretty casual tone.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.000
But it's interesting to us.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.950 position:73%
What part of this image grabbed your attention?

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.330 position:75%
We've got some fishermen and fisherwomen, right?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:56.860
Love this.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.070 position:69%
Especially the ME, the gas sign, the prices.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:09.390
Jenna noticed the font size
because it was large.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.370
Megan noticed the cactus.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.110
Very good.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.580
You guys are noticing it all.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.530
The U Drive It Cars.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.920 position:70%
They were texting a long time ago apparently.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.820
Alrighty. Well, as we look at
things that get your attention,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.140 position:75%
we're using our prior knowledge and experiences.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:33.530 position:64%
We put this new information into a schema
or context that's meaningful for us.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:40.720 position:56%
So we have our first impression,
but now let's closely read the image

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.810
for a specific purpose, all right?

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.320
Do you think this photo was
taken in your home town?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.140
Maybe or maybe not.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:57.950 position:56%
What context clues do you use to
determine a location for this photo?

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:05.860
All right.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:11.950
We're looking at plants, the
language, the spelling, the cactus.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.780
All right.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.990
Near a body of water.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.880
Very good.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.860
Also you guys are doing great.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.940
Well, we know this photo --

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.550
Oops, sorry.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.680
Put the arrow on the computer.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.410
All right.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.150
This photo is actually from
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:44.580 position:75%
It was taken in 1938 by Dorothea Lange, and
many of you probably know Dorothea Lange's work.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:52.980 position:61%
She did the Migrant Mother and a lot
of the iconic photos that we see today.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.050 position:73%
Anyway. The Post-its in this picture
represent the thoughts of one of my colleagues.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.930
We use what we know, our
background, to read this photo.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:06.180 position:56%
And then we use the vocabulary
based on what we know to discuss it.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.350
So, while my science friends can
talk about the plant species,

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.740
I can talk about the fishing worms.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.070
All right.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:19.670 position:59%
We each have strengths, and
interests that we bring to what we do.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:26.240
But we're putting it into a schema
or context that's meaningful to us.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.860
You know, the question, Maria, what
did they mean by U Drive It Cars?

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:36.480 position:61%
That's a really good question because
in 1938 I don't know what was happening

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.350 position:59%
with rental cars and things like that.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.790 position:59%
So that's a great question, all right?

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:48.530 position:70%
So we put this into a sense of place but it
may be something we're interested in the time

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:54.650 position:58%
that the photo was taken or even just
we're interested in the price of gas

00:17:54.650 --> 00:18:00.770
and how much it's changed and why
we can't go back to those prices.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:09.950 position:64%
But this explains how the image draws you
in and where you want to go from there.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.880 position:56%
So within this activity we just did
real quickly, and I won't define all

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:22.230 position:75%
of these every time because we will run out of
time, but we're looking at contextual awareness.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.750
This is the frame of reference.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.390
We're using explicit and
implicit clues to build knowledge,

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.430 position:59%
recognizing the evidence that's there.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.940 position:64%
But that we each use evidence differently
or find different types of evidence.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.410 position:58%
We're triggering our prior knowledge.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.150
We're using context clues,
both words and images.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.600
We're thinking about the
author purpose if we look

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.570 position:70%
at that sign and the breakdown of gas prices.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.640
And then the real life application,
bringing it into our lives.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.430 position:67%
What the heck does this have to do with me?

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.970 position:64%
Well, I know I complain about gas prices.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.450 position:63%
The next primary source I'm showing you.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.250 position:67%
We're going to look at mastering contextual
vocabulary and nuances because once we do

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:15.210 position:66%
that we can move into deeper understanding
and new information, all right?

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.480 position:64%
So as teachers we know introducing a word

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.370
in isolation is not an effective
way to teach vocabulary.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:27.010 position:73%
Our students benefit if we're able to reinforce
new terms through either morphemic awareness,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.390
breaking it down into those word
parts, my English teacher friends,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.460 position:56%
and that -- and using context clues.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.360
In the end we want them to be able
to decode new words on their own.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.850
That's a life skill.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.940
It's something we need to
empower them into doing.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:49.960 position:73%
If they aren't caught up in the mechanics of
reading, they gain independence and confidence,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:56.400 position:63%
and then can really focus on the
content and what else they want to know.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.610 position:72%
We need to know where students stand regarding
vocabulary and concepts in a specific content.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:09.200 position:75%
So instead of finding, you know, kind of content
area specific resources for this presentation,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.160
I picked some that were just kind
of interesting to me in that.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.570
So this is a piece of sheet music,
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame."

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.660
All right.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.220 position:75%
So within a new context it's demanding to
receive information while still trying to decode

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.430
or understand what the words mean.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.970
Look at the lyrics of the song.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.970
Which words catch your eye as we
discuss vocabulary and nuances?

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.640
Crackerjacks.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.970
We know that one.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.990
Everybody must be hungry.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.220
Root. Excellent.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.480
They know the word "root."

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.630
They know "home team."

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.350
What's another phrase maybe?

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.960
Very good.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.970
You guys are on top of it.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.280
All right.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.840 position:73%
So we see "Root, root, root for the home team."

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.720 position:72%
Students will know what the word "root" means.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:18.780 position:75%
But the fact that it's used differently here,
and it's used three times, has specific meaning.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.660
Home team, they should understand
that when we explain it.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.030
And then the same for "Three
strikes you're out."

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.530
That's a different context
in different settings,

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.450
and without understanding
what it means in this context,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.970 position:73%
they wouldn't get the gist of what the song is.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.480 position:59%
This time we're looking at vocabulary.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:49.760 position:64%
Words we know, old words that we already
know, but applying them to a new meaning.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.520 position:59%
Context clues and contextual language.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.040
And so, great.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.320
We're seeing in the chat how
people are using the word "root,"

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.490 position:63%
and how it can be perceived differently.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.750 position:61%
And these are little obstacles that can
slow our students down in the classroom

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.310
that we may not think to mention.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.980
All right.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.630
I've got another good one for you.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.970 position:61%
Do you know enough to know what to ask?

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.780 position:59%
An initial look at a primary source is
naturally going to inspire questions.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.940
But to formulate those questions
students use their literacy skills

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.750
to receive information while
[inaudible] -- start over again.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.040 position:66%
Students use literacy skills to receive
information while they're connecting again

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.810 position:58%
with that prior knowledge and schema.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:48.230 position:67%
So the question is, do you know enough
about the content to even know what to ask?

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.100
This is where fluency comes in.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.800
We want our classrooms to be a
space where students are encouraged

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.960 position:72%
to ask questions and are praised for doing so.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.170
We should nurture this.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:04.230 position:64%
This is why we as teachers love to
answer a question with a question, right?

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.260 position:63%
A thoughtful question requires a student
to determine what it is they want

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.320 position:58%
to know and why they want to know it.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320
Successfully establishing a purpose

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.620 position:58%
for a question requires comprehending
and critiquing a source.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.280 position:66%
So they have to know what they don't know.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.970
And that's moving to the
next level of understanding.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.440
If I add another photo, do
your questions change?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.310
Does your frame of reference shift?

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:48.880 position:70%
As we acquire new information it may answer
some questions we had from the first picture.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:55.490 position:59%
But now we may have even more
questions about what we're looking at.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.460 position:64%
This is where we draw upon our expertise.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:05.430 position:61%
And when we choose classroom strategies
we try to find things that are going

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.970 position:61%
to guide students through this process.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.960 position:63%
For example, if we use a primary source
analysis sheet that's going to lead them

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.610
from low-level thinking skills or
just observation to more synthesis

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.110
in using the information and
drawing their own conclusions.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.840
Or we may even use something like
a Venn diagram to do a compare

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.970 position:56%
and contrast with a photo like this.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:40.790 position:73%
The top photo, as you can see, were the Chicago
Cubs, National League Pennant Winners in 1929.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.470
The bottom photo was the first
Colored World Series opening game,

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.700 position:67%
October 11, 1924, in Kansas City, Missouri.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.850
So, as you can see, I'm partial
to the Midwest here.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:52.550
All right.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.770 position:64%
Again, we're using those literacy skills.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.580 position:70%
Looking at context and setting relationships.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.900
The implicit and explicit details.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.880 position:64%
Things like, why is there a huge crowd in
the bottom picture, but not in the top?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.300 position:69%
So we want to move through things like that,
that these skills are really important.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.450
This is why we thoughtfully
select our primary sources.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.760
All right.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:28.500 position:75%
Okay, we got started a little bit late so I'm
going to kind of rush through this a little bit.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:36.090 position:69%
By understanding text structure we can focus
on deeper understanding and new knowledge.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:42.310 position:63%
So we've talked about vocabulary and
we've talked about contextual awareness.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.320
But what about text structure?

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.740
The following slides are
a part of my own research.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.600
We had an ice storm here in
Illinois a few years ago.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.720 position:66%
And I thought, well, I'm going to look
and see what types of resources I can find

00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.080 position:56%
that I can use to talk about weather
from maybe a hundred years ago.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.520
And so went to Chronicling America.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.540
And Chronicling America is amazing.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.070 position:59%
There's a session going on right now
and hopefully some of you will be able

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:14.740 position:59%
to watch the recording of that because
it's just an unbelievable collection.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:21.680 position:75%
But as I was pursuing through all the front
pages and articles I found references to a storm

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.270 position:61%
in the early days of 1912, and it was
a horrific cold wave that went through.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.040
So once I found my date,
moved on with my search.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.480 position:69%
But before we even start looking at content,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.920
let's talk about the importance
of text structure, all right.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.110 position:59%
We know how a newspaper is structured.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.870
We know what it looks like.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:46.240
So remember our students today
may not have that knowledge.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.920
But we know that what are some
of the attributes of a newspaper

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.970
that you see in the text structure?

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.860
All right.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.020
Larger type in the headlines.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.880
Just the use of headlines at all.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.950
Great, Amy and Annette.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.970 position:70%
Right. And Janelle talking about the bylines.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.240 position:61%
The date's usually pretty easy to find.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.880 position:58%
Good. So all these little attributes.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.610 position:73%
And you know we want to talk about these things
when we work with students with their textbooks

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.790
about unit headings and font
size and things like that,

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.940 position:75%
but here in the newspaper we can see it as well.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:45.410 position:63%
But we also know that the text structure
supports how we acquire information.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:52.400 position:64%
And so, you know, we may look
specifically for just the main headlines.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:58.430
But we also want to look at smaller
text, different types of fonts,

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.490
and all that to see how much
information is shared.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:09.010 position:61%
So on the topic of text structure we're
looking at, how would structured --

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:18.820 position:73%
how one thing relates to another, how a story
develops through the use of the text structure,

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.740 position:70%
the relationships between text,
implicit/explicit details, and author intent.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.590
Why did a newspaper choose
that to be their headline?

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:37.820
If we have contextual fluency
and understand text structure,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.450 position:61%
we can then move into something called
author intent and diverse perspectives.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.910
All right.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:49.430 position:61%
So now, being confident in my ability
to maneuver around Chronicling America,

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:53.850
understanding text structure,
recognizing familiar vocabulary,

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.080
I stop thinking about the
mechanics of my search.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.300 position:63%
I was able to concentrate on the content
that I wanted to know what was happening

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:11.430 position:59%
with these storms in different parts
of the country on January 6th of 1912.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.240
This is where the real fun started.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.150 position:69%
But while getting lost in these pages of
old newspapers, and I mean hundreds of pages

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.970
of old newspapers, I made
two important discoveries.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.060
Take a look at these pages
and see what catches your eye.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.420
What do they have in common?

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.620
What differs?

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.970
What else do you want to know?

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:41.890
Weather.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.900
Cold.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:55.100
Right? And, of course, at the very
top of each one, right, geography.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.910
There you go.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.090
At the very top we see the
name of the newspaper,

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.970 position:59%
where it is, where this was happening.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.390
We also see that, you know,
the date is featured there.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.760
It's a little blurry on these
but it's also available.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:17.590 position:66%
But we see what different newspapers chose
to put its headlines on their front page,

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.970
and how important a front page is.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:30.380
So we see, again, text structure,
relationships, and recurring words.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.280
All three of these newspapers
talked about the cold.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.370
All three of these newspapers
referred to suffering

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:42.630 position:67%
and relief and distress that was happening.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.860
And so that is important.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.380
It was important to see how this
was reported from different places.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.720 position:73%
New York and Washington were experiencing this.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.040 position:64%
But really important, the <i>Hawaiian Star </i>.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.220
That one blew my mind, first
of all because 1912.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.510 position:59%
Was Hawaii even a state at that point?

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.150
Nope. Exactly.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.150
So they were curious.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.470
They were concerned of what
was happening in the mainland.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.530 position:56%
And I found that really interesting.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.580
And I am powering through these.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.510
I apologize.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.990
I'm going so fast.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.420
All right?

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.090 position:56%
This is a headline and the first few
sentences of one of the articles.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.390 position:69%
You can see the entire article on the right.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.630
But for now we're just going
to focus on this part.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.680
The one on the right is from
Chronicling America.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.100
You can do clippings of articles
and use them with students.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.740
It's an amazing tool.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:45.920 position:69%
But in these brief paragraphs do you see the
vocabulary that keeps recurring or themes?

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.000
All right.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.970
We see widespread weather.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:12.920 position:72%
If we look at the headlines, do the words that
we see underneath support those headlines?

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.970
Temperature, temperature, cold.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.240
All right.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:30.190 position:72%
Well we previously talked about -- remember we
saw the same words used in different context

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.930 position:58%
within "Take Me Out to the Ballgame"?

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:38.850 position:59%
In examples like this, we're using the
same words within the same context.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.350
But why are they used so many
times within the same context?

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.600
All right.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.940 position:66%
We see the word "suffering" several times.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.850
"Charity' and "aid."

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:55.090 position:67%
The reason this is mentioned so many times
is because this is a key plate in the text,

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:59.610
and so we want students to
understand that, that whatever,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.680 position:66%
you know, details are provided repeatedly.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.970 position:72%
That usually means it's an important point and
so we want them to focus on things like that.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.480
And Michelle said all of these are
hot-linked within this presentation

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.600 position:59%
and will be available at the end, too.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.270
All right.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.360
So students can see how to
construct arguments, all right?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.190
The headline is, "There's Much
Suffering Already in the City."

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.500
And they say, the suffering's
already widespread.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.010 position:64%
The next paragraph, widespread suffering.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:40.300
We can also focus and purposely
receive information.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:46.950 position:75%
Asking our students to focus on key points and
repeated words gives them a purpose for reading.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.370 position:69%
And as they're starting to look at something
they may create their own hypothesis

00:33:53.370 --> 00:34:00.070
and either confirm or contradict
the hypothesis that they had.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.710
So in 1912 snow was going to
be accompanied by zero weather.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.940 position:56%
Temperatures were scheduled to drop.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.000
Much suffering already.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.980 position:61%
However, the children in Washington see
a bright side in the skating prospect,

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.970
so at least the children were
looking on the bright side.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.560
All right.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.610 position:56%
So we looked at what was information
was reported on the same day

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.800 position:56%
and how it may have been fluctuating
from two different locations.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.080
We think about things like that.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.950 position:56%
When I think about events like 911
and how it was presented differently

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:47.210 position:67%
in different countries, or how people react
to events differently in different places,

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.530
letting students look at
information like that and compare

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:56.280 position:69%
and contrast those diverse perspectives, and
then also come up with their own conclusion

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:02.080 position:59%
as to why people in different
communities reacted in different ways.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.160
So we looked at that.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:09.730 position:66%
Now we're going to look at how information
is reported differently within two cities.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:14.230
This <i>Washington Times </i>front page
at the top left there, the big one,

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.220 position:72%
says "Charity workers are busy with the poor."

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.970
And so that leads us to think
this is a really important story.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.850
This is a major topic.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.160
But then the Chicago based
<i>Day Book </i>made little mention

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.000
of the cold ravaging the
city on their front page.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.420
And you have to go all the way to
page seven to find information.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.550 position:66%
But on page seven we have the whole story.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.340
All right.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.350
Now I'm embarrassed to admit this,
but it had never crossed my mind

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.930 position:67%
that a hundred years ago people were
concerned with what to do with the homeless

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.380
in the city during harsh winters.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.740
That had just never occurred to me.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.520
And so as I'm looking at this,
all of a sudden it's like wow,

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.190
I didn't even know what I
didn't know about this topic.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.540
It goes on about what the fire
departments and the police

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.870
and different charities were
doing for people at this time.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:22.660 position:67%
And so my fluency level with regards to
that topic in today's time I'm aware of it.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.110
But a hundred years ago I was not.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.990 position:61%
So I started drawing on what I know now

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:33.590
to understand what they were
talking about a hundred years ago.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.980 position:73%
This article details the plight of homeless men

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.780
and endangered women and
children in Chicago in 1912.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.410 position:56%
So beyond just looking at how things
are reported in different places

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:52.460 position:63%
or how things are reported at different,
you know, cities and perspectives,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.310
but here we're looking at
information a century apart.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:02.480 position:59%
And considering the perspectives in
that way, connecting it with our life.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:09.740 position:73%
And so one of the ways that we use this article
with some cities was through annotation.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.040
In using annotation, students
can, they can identify main ideas.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.010
And the awesome thing about Library
of Congress primary sources is

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:25.280
that you can print those items out
or pull them up on your SMART Board

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:31.770
and let students actively engage
with them, get hands-on involvement

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.600 position:56%
with it, but identifying main ideas.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.800 position:66%
Bright arrows to, you know, connect ideas.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.750
This happened first.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.470
This happened second.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.430 position:61%
It can go as -- and Jenna talks about
have you been able to teach annotation?

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.730
That's a great question, Jenna.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:50.920
And how people are using
this in their classroom.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:57.280 position:63%
It may be something very basic like just
highlighting main ideas and taking them

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.510
through the stages of developing
annotation skills

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.860 position:67%
because it isn't easy and it's not natural.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.130
It's something that we have to
think about while we're doing.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.720
But through the different colors
and I'm a very visual learner.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.340 position:58%
I like different colored highlighters
and Post-its and things like that.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.740
I like the arrows.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.820 position:69%
I like being able to interact with the text.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.640
Letting students circle words
that they don't recognize

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.450 position:75%
or anything that's new and giving them a chance.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.680 position:67%
So, you know, hopefully the rest of you are
using things like this in your classroom

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:39.160 position:58%
as well either through annotation or
just multiple texts at the same time,

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.360 position:73%
presenting information in those multiple texts.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:48.780
So I am like so proud of
myself right now because we --

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.760
yes, they can be downloaded
and most of them are available.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:57.230 position:56%
And whenever you go into Chronicling
America, Rebecca, you can clip them

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:00.740
and they come as a PDF or a jpeg.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.180 position:70%
Chronicling America has some very cool stuff.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:11.560 position:61%
So, to wrap this up, this is, you know,
one of -- what I preach all the time.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.460 position:56%
To be literate in a specific context
is the difference between existing

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:20.130
and thriving within that context.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:27.360 position:64%
And it's not good enough for our
students just to exist in our classrooms.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.960
We want our students to thrive.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:42.090 position:67%
And so on that note the next slide is going
to just be a list of -- oh, there we go.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.550
Cheryl's on top of things.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.720
And these are the resources
from this presentation

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.970 position:75%
and that's all I've got, so thank you very much.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.080
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Cindy.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.030
This was a whirlwind, but I think
you really hit some highlights,

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:08.800
and the chat conversation suggests
some wonderful lively conversation.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:17.370 position:72%
So the first question that I have for you is,
with so many different disciplines represented

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:26.260 position:72%
in today's webinar meeting, any starting
places or tips to people to integrate literacy

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:33.860 position:69%
into disciplines or classes where that might
not be a traditional part of the teaching

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.160 position:56%
but we all see -- read the standards

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.950 position:66%
and read the movements towards integrating
literacy across the curriculums.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.120
So, thoughts on how to get
started and especially

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.510 position:64%
if this isn't what is your central focus.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:56.840 position:67%
&gt;&gt; That's actually a great question because
so often, whenever we talk about literacy,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.750
people assume we're just
talking about the act of reading.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.150
And it's so much more than that.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:10.240 position:67%
And so the first step is to think beyond
the mechanics of reading letters on a piece

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.470
of paper, that there's so much
more to it, that it is vocabulary,

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:22.910 position:73%
that it's understanding what the topic is, that
it's reading, writing, speaking, and listening,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:29.010 position:56%
and be able to do it with a
purpose as opposed to just doing it.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.360 position:63%
And so, really what we're doing, it's --

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.590
literacy is so much more than
just getting information.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.900
It's actually -- it's understanding
and using information.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:45.360 position:69%
So it is as simple as teaching your students
how to speak within your content area.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.110 position:56%
It's the vocabulary and the nuances,

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.490
how information is organized
within your content area.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:58.020 position:75%
Information in science is organized
differently than it is in the history classroom.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:05.290 position:64%
And so little things like that are really
developing literacy skills from day one.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.680
Most teachers are doing it.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.360
They're just not calling it that.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.810
&gt;&gt; First I want to thank
everybody for joining us.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.980 position:69%
We do have a few minutes so go ahead and
put those questions in the chat box if you'd

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:27.060
like while we have Cindy Rich
and the combined experience

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.330 position:67%
and information of all of the participants.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.980 position:70%
This has been a rich and lively conversation.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:38.610 position:67%
For completing this session you have earned
a certificate worth one instructional hour

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.580
and you will receive an e-mail
within five business days

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.180 position:59%
with directions on how to access that.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.640
Amy has a great question.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.850 position:73%
Where would be a great place to start searching
for primary sources within your content?

00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:03.090 position:63%
One of the things that I know frustrates
some teachers is that the Library

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.130
of Congress website is not Google.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.430
And so I always tell students
and teachers that I work with,

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:14.170 position:73%
you have to know what you're looking for before
you start looking on the Library of Congress.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.190
This is not for the lighthearted.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:19.550
You have to have some knowledge
and understanding

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.190 position:58%
of the content area before you start.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:28.470 position:58%
And so, really, it's -- it, you know,
everybody knows that the Library

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:34.770 position:70%
of Congress site can be daunting because it
is just so huge and it offers so much for us.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:40.460 position:58%
But you can go into the Teachers
Page and look for primary source sets

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.150
that have already been created
and use those as an inspiration.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:52.580 position:72%
Or just, you know, my go-to move is going to
that Home Page and starting on that search box

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:58.120 position:59%
and just typing something in, and then
seeing what comes up in other subjects

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:04.110 position:63%
and other related terms and other places
that come up within those answers.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.580 position:72%
And so, you know, that's a great way to do it.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:13.110 position:59%
And, of course, Ask a Librarian which,
you know -- Dana, a foot out there.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.460
But I was going to say that, Dana,

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.140
because it always blows my mind
how quickly someone gets back

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.620
to me with the Ask a Librarian.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.770
I mean, you guys are so on top of
things at the Library of Congress

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.520 position:66%
and it is a wonderful, wonderful resource.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.880 position:67%
They're there to help you and, man, they'll
guide you in your search to save you

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.410
so much time, and just as,
you know, get your confidence

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.900 position:72%
up that you're heading in the right direction.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:48.450 position:75%
&gt;&gt; We have done a webinar on Chronicling America
for National History Day a couple of weeks ago,

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.180
and we have another one coming
up in mid-November.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:58.910 position:69%
One of the things that Lynn O'Hara says
over and over again when we work with NHD is

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:04.860
that any text in the hands and
mind of a creative student can work

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.690
for a National History Day theme.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:13.290 position:69%
They make those themes deliberately pretty
broad so that it's easy to make connections.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.200
So Dana's chiming in again.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.690
Dana is the Reference Librarian
for the Library's Education Team.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.090
Remember earlier, Cindy mentioned
that time when people are talking

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:25.610 position:72%
about somebody that most everybody else knows.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:30.710 position:61%
We had a little insider joke about Dana
who's chiming in about Ask a Librarian.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.820 position:59%
But we do have lots of starting places

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:40.500
for finding primary sources and
Cindy named a bunch of them.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.800 position:75%
And we also do have Ask a Librarian to help you.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:51.110 position:67%
We are now at the end of our time together,
so I want to say thank you so much.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:54.490
Thank you, Cindy Rich, for sharing

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.630
such a carefully crafted
presentation of so many strategies.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:05.060 position:75%
Thank you, again, to all of the participants for
sharing from your perspectives and experiences.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:11.120 position:73%
If you haven't taken a moment to go to the
Survey Monkey link, it's three short questions.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.790
Your feedback really does help
us shape future programming.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:20.240
So I am going to stop the recording
and then end the meeting with,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.590 position:59%
again, a word of thanks to all of you.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.250
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
