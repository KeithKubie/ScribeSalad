00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.960
Latin America is home to the biggest population
of Palestinians outside of the Arab World.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.440
And around one-fifth of them live in the small
Central American country of El Salvador.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.000
And many Palestinian Salvadorans come from
just one part of Palestine:

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.440
Bethlehem is home to around 29,000 inhabitants.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.600
Though exact numbers are unknown, there are
claims that almost 100,000 people of Palestinian

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.620
descent live in El Salvador.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.680
There are more Palestinians in El Salvador
than Bethlehem now, but how did they all get there?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.640
Palestinians came to El Salvador starting   starting the late 19th century.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.600
Since they arrived with Turkish-Ottoman passports,
Salvadorans called these newcomers “Turcos”

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.869
or Turks.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.680
The term “Turco” persists to this day
and sometimes carries a negative connotation.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.640
Palestinians in El Salvador faced significant
institutional racism and xenophobia, especially

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.000
from “criollos” or the elite of European
descent.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.240
In 1921, a change to Salvadoran immigration
law classified Chinese and Arab people as “pernicious.”

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.840
And in 1933, dictator Maximiliano Hernández
Martínez enacted an immigration law that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.270
banned the arrival of Black people, Asian
people and “new immigrants from Arabia,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.560
Lebanon, Syria, Palestine or Turkey, generally
known as Turcos.”

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.070
Three years later, the govt. went even further,
banning Chinese and Arab people from opening

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.239
new businesses to “protect national interests.”

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.519
Palestinian Salvadorans were badly affected
by the law because many of them were innovative

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.689
businesspeople.

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.530
Today, many prominent companies in El Salvador
are owned by Palestinian Salvadorans.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.800
Most Palestinian Salvadorans don't speak Arabic
and have fully assimilated into Salvadoran society,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.400
but they still celebrate their roots.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.360
For Nilsa Saca, she preserves her Palestinian
heritage through food:

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.440
She now runs a restaurant in the town of Santa
Tecla named Teklebab:

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.760
Simán Khoury is a former president of Salvadoran
Palestinian Associati on and committee member

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.400
of Club Árabe, a social club for Salvadoran
Palestinians that began in the 1950s.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.880
Simán isn't your average Salvadoran Palestinian
– he was actually born and raised in Palestine.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.440
His wife, like many Palestinian Salvadorans,
still maintains ties with the homeland a century later:

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.160
But Bethlehem, the ancestral homeland of many
Palestinian Salvadorans is threatened by illegal

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.440
Israeli settlements.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.240
The Israel-Palestine conflict plays out in
public spaces in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.440
Here's a plaza dedicated to the state of Israel.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.020
And here's a plaza dedicated to Palestine
just 200 meters away.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.750
And is dedicated to the occupied Palestinian
Territories.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.240
And on Jerusalem Avenue in San Salvador, there's
a plaza honoring Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.800
which the Israeli embassy has protested.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.440
Despite the large Palestinian population,
Israel has historically has exerted a lot

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.720
of influence on El Salvador, through the strong
relationship it's had with the far-right governments

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.509
that have ruled El Salvador for much of its
history.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.360
From 1975 to 1979, the years leading up to
El Salvador's 12-year-long civil war,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.600
83%  of El Salvador's military imports came from
Israel.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.360
Israelis also helped train ANSESAL, the secret
police that would lay the foundation for

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.560
death squads during El Salvador's war.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.319
Palestinian Salvadorans have shaped the country's
modern-day politics.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:37.379
El Salvador's first president of Palestinian
origin was the far-right leaning Antonio Saca.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:42.800
When he won the 2004 election, he beat Schafik
Handal, another Salvadoran of Palestinian origins

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.849
from the leftist party FMLN.

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:48.900
Handal had been a prominent guerrilla leader
who negotiated the 1992 Peace Accords that

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.099
concluded El Salvador's civil war.

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:56.389
Upon his death, Handal was buried with the
flags of Palestine, El Salvador and the communist party.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.280
Nayib Bukele won El Salvador's 2019 elections
to become the country's second leader

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.280
of Palestinian descent.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.440
He even played up his Bethlehem roots at Christmas:

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.520
But despite his Palestinian identity, he maintains
a cozy relationship with Israel.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.000
In 2015, when he was mayor of San Salvador,
the Israeli ambassador to El Salvador called

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.000
him a “partner for collaboration.”

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.810
In 2018, Bukele went on an Israeli govt-sponsored
trip to the International Mayor's Conference

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.880
in Israel.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.280
El Salvador still struggles with violence,
a legacy of its civil war.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.960
People are fleeing in the thousands in caravans.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.800
And so Salvadoran Palestinians represent the
human rights struggles of two peoples on opposite

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.080
sides of the world:

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.160
