00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.570
MICHAEL: Welcome.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
Thanks for coming or watching
the livestream or the broadcast

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.159
of this Talks at Google event.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.450
Today, we have a treat for you.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.510
We have Eric Liu here.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.040
So Eric Liu, he's the founder
of Citizen University,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.380
the executive director of
Aspen Institute's Citizenship

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
and American identity program,
a former Clinton administration

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
official, and a
columnist for CNN.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.350
He actually just came
out with a new book,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.570
which is called "You're More
Powerful Than You Think."

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.150
And he's going to tell us a
little bit about his philosophy

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.056
on influence and creating
change, and how we can do this

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:48.180
ourselves in the community.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900
So without further ado, I'm
going to turn it over to Eric.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.579
ERIC LIU: Great.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.120
I'm mic'd up.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.630
I don't need it.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.820
To

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.840
MICHAEL: Oh, you're good.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.631
ERIC LIU: Thank you,
Michael, and thank you

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.140
all for coming today.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.890
We're going to have a
nice focused conversation,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.640
because we'll get
to have a good--

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.450
so I'll keep my remarks
brief at the beginning

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.460
here, so that we can get
a really good, not just

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.250
Q&amp;A, but just actual
conversation here,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.060
including our folks
joining on the livestream.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.740
So I wanted just to
actually give you a sense--

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.640
and I know Michael has
gotten books for those of you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.896
who are here.

00:01:21.896 --> 00:01:23.770
This is the book that
I'm here to talk about.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.100
I'll pass this around here.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.440
And it's called
"You're More Powerful

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.710
Than You Think, a Citizen's
Guide to Making Change Happen."

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.020
And the premise of the book
is, literally the moment

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.831
that we are in today,
and not just what

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.830
the current occupant of
the White House is doing

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.480
and the response that
he's provoked, but just

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.000
this age that we
are in right now,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.800
which extends well
beyond the last 100

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.500
days to really the last
several years, and not

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.480
just within the borders
of the United States

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.160
but around the world.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.064
We're in this moment where,
across the left and the right,

00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:58.230
whether you're looking at
the Tea Party, Occupy Wall

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.520
Street, $15 Now, Black
Lives Matter, the Dreamers,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.910
you have all these bottom up
movements of citizens engaging

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.590
in basically wanting
to knock over

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.009
entrenched, monopolized,
concentrated power.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.860
And one of the
things that indeed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
so marks our time right
now is that folks from very

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.820
different points on the
political spectrum, people

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.150
who were cheering and
going to Trump rallies

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.940
and helped get him elected,
people who were hardcore

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.160
involved in the Bernie
Sanders movement,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.750
are part of this
same phenomenon,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.870
even if they might say that
their politics or policy

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.450
preferences are
widely divergent.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.010
And so this moment that we're
in is one where it's turbulent.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.234
It's exciting.

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.650
But what it really
is, is a moment

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.800
that is the natural
consequence, if you're

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
honest about it, the
natural consequence of four

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.910
decades in this country in
which wealth, voice, clout,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.630
and opportunity have
been concentrating

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.720
into fewer and fewer hands.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.140
And so the overarching narrative
in American life right now,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.220
that the game is rigged, and
that the system is broken,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.720
is not without basis.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.310
The game increasingly is rigged.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.890
Our public policy preferences
at the national level

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.190
are increasingly warped and bent
toward those with the greatest

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.690
amount of economic privilege.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.250
Even the last administration,
as much credit as one

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.200
might want to give it,
and as a Democrat, I do

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.620
want to give it credit,
but 95% of the gains

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.550
of the recovery
since 2008, 2009,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.370
have gone to the wealthiest
1% in this country.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.612
And so it is a not
unreasonable think

00:03:34.612 --> 00:03:36.570
whether you're a Democrat,
you're a Republican,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.580
whether you live in a
blue state or a red state,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.644
to feel like the
game has been rigged.

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:42.060
What marks this
moment, though, is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.030
that we are in the midst of this
incredible cross-ideological,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.240
cross-sectoral great push back.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.270
And what I wanted to
lay out in this book

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.320
is really, what do you do after
you have the primal scream?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.180
What do you do after you
say, "I want to push back.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.070
I'm mad as hell.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.930
I'm not going to
take it anymore?"

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.590
And what you do is, you
get literate in power.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.860
You get literate and fluent in
what civic and citizen power

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.399
is.

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.440
And I just want to take
a moment to unpack what I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.600
mean when I say citizen power.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.909
Because it's a way
of just framing up

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.700
some of the ideas and
the strategies that I

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.575
lay out in this book.

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.170
So when I say "citizen"
in the first place,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.434
and that's both in
my talk here but also

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:23.850
in the nonprofit
that I run, which

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.250
is called Citizen University,
I want to make clear.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.814
I'm not talking about
documentation status

00:04:28.814 --> 00:04:30.480
under the immigration
and naturalization

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.563
laws of the United States.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:35.070
I'm talking about a deeper,
ethical sense of citizenship,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.710
by which I mean
membership in the body,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.670
being a pro-social
contributor to a community.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.630
To put it very simply,
being a non-sociopath.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.420
And that conception of being
a citizen in this deeper

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.332
ethical sense is universal.

00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:53.790
It, of course, plays out-- and
in the work we do at Citizen

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.950
University-- plays out
here in the United States

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.430
in a particular
American context,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.090
which is about whether you
were born here, as I was,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.210
the child of immigrants, or
whether you are brand new here,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.250
every one of us here
is an inheritor,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.790
a steward of a particular
creed and a particular set

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.650
of promises that
this country made ,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.320
and frankly has never
yet fully lived up to.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.840
So citizenship in the
context of this country

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.520
is about being a pro-social
contributor to the body,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.200
but also a steward of that
particular set of promises.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.420
Power, let me just unpack
what I mean by power.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.870
When I say "power," I mean
quite simply a capacity

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.310
to ensure that others do as
you would like them to do.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.400
And that, too many people,
sounds a little bit menacing,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.310
a little bit creepy,
almost, that definition.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.860
But I think if
we're honest, again,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.140
about every dimension
of our lives,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.972
we as humans, as creatures with
will and seeking objectives,

00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:53.430
are always trying to get others
to do as we would like them

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.490
to do, whether in our family,
or workplace, or neighborhood

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.220
relationships, or
national politics.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.490
The question is, when you think
about power in the civic arena,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.980
on questions of public
and common concern, again,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.650
I come back to this
notion of literacy.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.670
Can you read and
can you write power?

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.640
Can you read what people think
of in a very colloquial way

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.530
as the power structure?

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.150
When people say the
power structure,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.770
they say the game
is rigged, they

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.660
have a very general
but very fuzzy

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.620
sense of a way in which things
are stacked against them.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.020
But I think to be
literate in power means

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.440
to understand that there are
different concrete sources

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.820
of power in civic life--

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.340
money power, people power,
ideas power, social norms power,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.790
the power of state action, the
power of force and violence.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.250
All of these are
sources of power

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.900
that then flow through a variety
of conduits throughout society,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.310
whether those are organizations,
networks, narratives,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.270
different conduits.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.920
Some are formal and recognized.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.950
Some are informal movements.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.470
But whatever conduits
they are, when you add up

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.780
this notion of
sources and conduits,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.760
that gives you what
you colloquially think

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.010
of as the power structure.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.770
And if you want to actually
be able to make change

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.692
in civic life in
our times right now,

00:07:18.692 --> 00:07:20.400
you've got to be able
and willing to read

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.890
that map of power.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.367
But power literacy, as it
is with actual literacy,

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:27.450
is not just about reading.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.908
It's about being
able to write too,

00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:31.410
and to write yourself
into the story

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.340
and write yourself or rewrite
that map or that array

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.960
of sources and
conduits of power.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.260
And so in this book,
I talk about there

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.680
being three laws of power
in civic life that are worth

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.310
probably just unpacking here
as grist for our conversation.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.610
Law number one--
power concentrates.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.620
That's just the
way of the world.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.150
Power, like almost any resource
in any physical or metaphysical

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.820
system, compounds.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.310
And those who have
some tend to get more.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.160
Those who have clout
tend to get more clout.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.870
Those who have visibility and
celebrity tend to get more.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.632
And that is the nature of life
in a complex adaptive system.

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:14.090
And I don't have
to tell people who

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.250
work at Google, that is the
nature of life on the network.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.290
Power compounds when the
system is left to itself.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.880
Law number two-- power
justifies itself.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.820
So at every turn,
people and institutions

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.490
that are incumbent
holders of power

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.610
will spin stories
about why that is

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.820
and why that ought
to be that way.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.570
And these stories take
a variety of forms.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:41.610
They can be dominant
narratives about explanations

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.380
of, for instance, why in a
different age and to an extent

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.920
still today white supremacy
was a good narrative,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.200
good example of a
narrative in which power

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.790
is justifying itself.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.130
To a continuing extent
today, male supremacy

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.610
is such a narrative.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.980
Another one that takes the
form of economic explanation

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.100
is what you might shorthand
as Trickle Down economics.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.050
Trickle Down
economics is a story,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.150
is a fable that has
relatively, actually,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.220
little to do with fact.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.140
But it is a nice
story about how if you

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.230
treat those who have
wealth really nicely

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.450
and coddle them in the tax code
and our policy preferences,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.860
their prosperity will leak its
way down to everybody else.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.290
That is a classic instance
of power justifying itself.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.160
So if you take these first
two laws, that power compounds

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.430
and power justifies itself,
you get into a pretty grim doom

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:40.050
loop, where fewer
and fewer people get

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.450
to hoard and monopolize
more and more of the power

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.670
and tell you why they should be
able to grind you down to dust.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.559
What breaks us out
of that doom loop,

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.100
at least theoretically,
and at least,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.040
again, in principle in a
country like the United States,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.010
is law number three, which
is that power is infinite.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.050
Here I mean this
very concretely.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.120
I don't mean this in a, "I'm a
Seattle guy coming to the Bay

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.620
Area."

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.010
I don't mean this in some
kind of new age, new agey way.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.660
I mean it very concretely,
that in civic life,

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.990
power, new power
can be generated out

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.770
of thin air, where it
did not previously exist.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.760
Unlike a physical ecosystem.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.260
The laws of physics
tell us that if you're

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.730
going to get more
heat or energy,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.090
then someone else in this
room has to get less.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.630
Law of thermodynamics.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.062
This is a zero sum system with
a finite amount of energy in it.

00:10:37.062 --> 00:10:38.270
And that is a law of physics.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.060
But what I'm talking
about here is not physics.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.260
It is civics.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.530
And in civic life, it is wholly
possible to generate power

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.210
where it did not
previously exist

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.960
through the simple,
magic act of organizing.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.130
Just inviting one other human
to engage in a common endeavor,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.770
with common purpose, toward
common objectives, where

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.650
you have to work out, even
among competing preferences

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.620
and priorities, a common set
of strategies and tactics

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.170
for going forward,
that work of organizing

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.350
generates power where it
did not previously exist.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.110
And this idea that
power is infinite,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.510
I don't mean it in a
Pollyanna way, which

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.087
is, I don't mean to say
that anybody at any time

00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:18.420
can be as powerful as they want.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.270
I don't mean that
anybody at anytime

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.090
can be as wealthy as they want.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.500
Nor do I deny that
there are, in fact,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.945
lots of momentary situations
in politics that are zero sum.

00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:31.820
The way we run elections
in the United States

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.070
is a zero sum deal.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.290
The first person to get 50%
plus 1 is winner take all.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.240
that's a function of
how we have set up

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.170
elections in this country.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.080
And there are plenty
of other situations

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.330
where things are zero
sum, but in general,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.120
this broad idea that
power is infinite

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.090
is both a matter of
mindset and more deeply

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.022
a matter of reminder.

00:11:57.022 --> 00:11:58.480
The title of this
book, that you're

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.300
more powerful than
you think, is really

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.160
meant to say that at
every turn in civic life,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.600
and indeed the Trump presidency
is a pretty good example

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.870
of it, most of the
time, most people

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.960
are incredibly unwittingly
giving away their power.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.960
They throw it away, either
by not participating

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.220
or by directing their
attention in certain ways,

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.830
or being unmindful of
the ways in which they

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.920
are being manipulated.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.080
And so one of the core
purposes of both this book

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.180
and the work we do
at Citizen University

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.870
is to catalyze people into
a sense of mindfulness

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.780
and awareness of
the ways in which we

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.700
are full of inactive,
dormant capacities

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.650
to make change in civic life.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:49.090
And again, I don't
need to say it twice,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.670
because we are
living through a time

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.680
where people are
waking up at every turn

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.580
in every corner of this country,
realizing it and remembering

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.600
it.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.130
One of the things that I've
said in a variety of instances

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.610
that I will give
Donald Trump credit for

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.640
is that he alone,
as he likes to say,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.580
he alone has been
responsible for, I think,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.440
the greatest surge
of civic engagement

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.300
and civic participation
in this country

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.636
that we have seen
in half a century.

00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:19.010
And that's not just women's
marches, and science marches,

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.540
and tax marches.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.520
It's not just those
big, visible moments.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.950
It is just this
incredible burgeoning

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.910
of an ecosystem of people
organizing clubs, creating

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.940
book groups, creating
civics 101 courses,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.160
creating all kinds
of citizen peer

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.632
to peer based ways
to teach each other

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:38.090
and remind each
other of the values

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.240
but also teach each other the
skills of being able to make

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.430
change in your community.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.250
You think about a
phenomenon like Indivisible,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.220
which, for those of
you who don't know,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.050
began as a 26 page
document that a group

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.800
of ex-congressional staffers
published as a Google doc.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.500
And it was an insider's
guide for citizens

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.320
about how to apply pressure
on your member of Congress

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.890
and make your member of
Congress bend to your will.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.780
And it was a good,
useful insider's guide.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.670
Because it was saying,
don't just flood

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.770
the fax lines or email
lines or the phone lines.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.730
Like, do this.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.320
Find this person on the staff.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.890
Show up at this kind of meeting.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.430
Ask for this kind of resolution.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.390
And that guide went super
viral online in social media.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.210
But what's even more remarkable
is that after the document went

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.600
super viral, citizens all
around the United States started

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.130
saying, you know what?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.520
I'd like to use this as an
excuse to meet my neighbors.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.020
And now over 6,000 chapters in
a completely spontaneous bottom

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.370
up way have organized to create
Indivisible the Network, not

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.070
just Indivisible the Document.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.900
This was not the
doing of the four

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.260
co-authors of that document.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.570
They had no direct hand in
making 6,000 chapters sprout up

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.430
around the country.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.605
They are very mindful--

00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:54.980
and indeed in
their document they

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.830
say explicitly that
this is quite a parallel

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.975
to the Tea Party.

00:14:58.975 --> 00:15:00.350
Because that was
the last time we

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.330
saw something like that happen.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.370
And whether or not your
politics are Tea Party

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.500
politics, as a person who works
in promoting and celebrating

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.130
bottom up, self organizing,
peer to peer citizen power,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.560
I tip my hat to the
origins of the Tea Party.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.570
Because it was just
the same kind of thing.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.320
At the beginning, groups
of pissed off citizens

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.910
deciding that they
were not just going

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.070
to sit and yell at the TV,
or yell at their screens,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.860
but they were going
to start organizing.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.276
And they're going to start
organizing through-- back then,

00:15:30.276 --> 00:15:33.020
I mean in 2010, old-fashioned
technologies like conference

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.520
calls.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.050
1,000 person conference calls.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.760
Facebook and Twitter
weren't even as

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.880
powerful mediums then as they
are today for organizing.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.630
And what they were
able to do to activate,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.560
again, not just dormant
outrage but dormant power,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.230
is in many ways the
explicit precursor for what

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.040
Indivisible is doing today.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.230
So with these three laws,
that power concentrates,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.440
that power justifies itself,
and that power is infinite,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.130
come three simple
imperatives for action

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.630
that I just want
to put on the table

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.690
here as a way to tee
up our conversation.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.270
So if power is always
compounding and concentrating

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.210
into these monopolistic,
winner take all games,

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.330
then our imperative in civic
life is to change the game.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.440
If in the second place power
is always justifying itself,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.560
spinning out new forms of
propaganda and narrative

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.010
and just so stories about
why it is the way it is,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.130
then our imperative is
to change the story.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.710
And if in the third
place, most people

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.570
forget that power
is in fact infinite

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.090
and they stay stuck
in these mindsets

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.880
that power is
finite and zero sum

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.380
and there's no point in getting
involved because the game is

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.050
rigged and I can't do
anything and I'm voiceless,

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.480
then our imperative is to
change the equation for them.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.690
And so these three imperatives
of changing the game,

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.470
changing the story, and changing
the equation both provide

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.186
the architecture for the
back half of this book.

00:16:56.186 --> 00:16:57.810
And each one of those
three imperatives

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.360
yields a set of strategies
for how you actually do that.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.970
And I think here
in conversation,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.020
I'd like to just talk about
both some concrete instances

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.960
of this, but also
hear your stories

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.849
and your thoughts
about movements

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.839
that you might be
involved in or change

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.780
that you'd like to see happen.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.790
But I'll tell you about one,
just a set of concrete examples

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.339
to make this a little bit
less conceptual for you, that

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.930
illustrate these notions
of changing game, story,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.250
and equation.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.220
So I'm from Washington
state, live in Seattle.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.730
And an example that I would
give you of actually all three,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.790
changing game,
story, and equation,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.480
emerged in the immediate wake
of the Sandy Hook Massacre

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.830
in Connecticut.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.960
When that massacre happened, a
group of friends of mine and I,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.740
just citizens of Seattle, none
of us was elected, none of us

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.390
held public office,
a group of friends

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.150
and I said, "we
gotta do something.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.832
We gotta do something
in our state.

00:17:58.832 --> 00:18:00.540
The United States
Congress is bottled up,

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.360
but we've got to be able to
do something in our state."

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.490
Washington state is
generally a democratic state.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.010
At the time, our legislature
was controlled by Democrats

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.350
and the governor was a Democrat.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.930
And so we said OK, we
got some folks together,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.710
we got some people
who were experts,

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.130
and we came up with a
proposal for a simple piece

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.342
of legislation that
mimicked what had long

00:18:19.342 --> 00:18:21.300
been on the floor of the
United States Congress

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.940
and had died there, a
proposal to institute

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.520
a system of universal background
checks for gun purchases.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.250
A common sense proposal
that is supported

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.010
by vast majorities of
American public, Republican

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.070
and Democrat, but even
majorities of NRA members.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.830
We thought this is
an easy thing to do

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.470
after Sandy Hook, a
responsible thing to do.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.840
And in organizing this
group of citizens,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.450
we actually gave ourselves the
name the Washington Alliance

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.730
for Gun Responsibility.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.990
Well, what we learned
in fairly short order

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.330
was that what seemed like
a commonsense thing to do,

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.010
what seemed like
a fairly easy lift

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:01.470
in a Democratic controlled
state legislature,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.500
was going to run up
against a particular game

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.300
that the gun lobby
had been playing.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.190
And their game
was an inside game

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.890
of politics in which they
weren't really trying

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.150
to appeal to a broader public.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.900
They were simply thinking
about finding three, four, five

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.620
members of the
legislature, Democrats who

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.872
represented swing districts.

00:19:20.872 --> 00:19:22.830
And if they could apply
enough pressure on them

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.620
to control those members,
they could bottle anything up

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.350
and keep any proposal
from actually ever getting

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.060
to the floor of the legislature.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.720
And indeed, the NRA has been
super successful in playing

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.990
this inside game
in the Legislature

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:40.490
and they were successful
in this particular case.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.380
They kept this proposal
from ever getting a hearing

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.090
or getting a vote.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.330
What we had to do as citizen's
then was to change the game.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.690
Fortunately, in our state,
as here in California,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.970
we have a particular set
of tools for doing that,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.190
and that is going to the people.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.610
And so we shifted
gears, shifted games,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.040
and said instead of just
trying to work the legislature

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.779
and lobby inside Olympia,
our state capital,

00:20:04.779 --> 00:20:07.320
we gotta go out there and start
getting hundreds of thousands

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.920
of signatures.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.870
We've got to get a
measure on the ballot

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.190
to do the same thing.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.900
And we decided, as a
matter of strategy,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.840
to bypass the inside game
and play an outside game,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.650
go to the public.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.370
And ultimately,
Initiative's 594 passed

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.860
and Washington became the
first state in the union

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.950
to pass by a vote of the
people universal background

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.110
checks for gun purchases.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.900
That story is an instance not
just of changing the game,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.760
but also of changing the story.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.700
Because well, it's actually
embodied in the name

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.410
of the organization.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.510
Washington Alliance
for Gun Responsibility

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.530
is a name that
makes an argument.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:47.340
Right The debate around guns
is a debate about gun rights,

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.310
and in the words of the
gun lobby, gun control.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.970
It's either gun rights
versus gun control.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.500
And we rejected that framing.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.660
We said, "look, we
respect the fact

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.868
that there is a Second
Amendment to the United States

00:20:59.868 --> 00:21:02.450
Constitution and that it
guarantees certain rights.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.224
But our view, as citizens, our
view as adults, as grownups,

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:07.890
is that there is no
such thing as rights

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.080
without responsibilities,
and that if you

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.230
have a worldview that just says
I get to have unfettered rights

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.840
and do whatever I have without
regulation, restriction,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.040
or encumbrance,
you're not a citizen.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.330
You're being a toddler."

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.800
And so that narrative
shift wasn't just

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.240
a matter of framing and spin.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.280
It was a matter of
making a bigger argument

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.620
that what we've got to
do as a grownup country

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.050
and certainly in the wake
of some like Sandy Hook

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.864
is to be able to balance our
rights with responsibilities.

00:21:34.864 --> 00:21:36.780
And that narrative was
one that was incredibly

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.660
compelling to people
who weren't usually so

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.380
receptive to measures
that might restrict or put

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.400
some kind of regulation
on the commerce in guns.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.370
NRA members, folks
in law enforcement,

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.550
people in more conservative
and rural neighborhoods

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.940
began to see the wisdom of
what we were talking about.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.880
I mean, the NRA rank and
file, most gun owners

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.890
are really big on
responsibility.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.270
They're really
big on gun safety.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.061
They're really big on
teaching their family

00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:07.850
how to and not to
handle firearms.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:14.010
It's the NRA leadership that
is dogmatic about not allowing

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.722
any kind of such reforms.

00:22:16.722 --> 00:22:17.430
That's the story.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.930
Well, how do we
change the equation?

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.560
We change the equation, not only
by winning in Washington state,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.960
but by setting in
motion now, in states

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.510
around the country, this
same kind of process,

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.970
where instead of the NRA
just being able to say,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.490
"we're going to play the
inside game in Washington DC

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.950
and control the Congress
the way that we controlled,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.330
say, the Washington
State legislature,"

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.290
we're now, by encouraging other
jurisdictions in other states

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.440
around the United States, to
put measures on the ballot

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.210
and go directly to
the people, we're

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.990
going to force the gun lobby
to start playing whack-a-mole.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.000
And the NRA is well resourced
to control a single inside game

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.519
in the United States Congress.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:57.060
They're not so well
resourced to play

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.770
whack-a-mole in
states and cities

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.050
all around the United States.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.840
And that changes the equation
from one in which they

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.020
get to dominate and one in
which actually the full breadth

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.510
of the people get to be
activated and engaged

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:15.120
in a way that makes their
voice heard and provides

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.440
countervailing power.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.110
So I give you that example
just as one way to make

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.850
concrete these notions, but I
think all around us right now,

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.380
whether it's guns, whether it's
economic inequality and jobs,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.770
whether it's the future
of the gig economy,

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.250
and things that are very vivid
here in the tech community,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.280
whether it's housing
affordability and inequality

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.250
in places like San
Francisco or Seattle

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.800
where I am, on all
these questions,

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.810
the fundamental issue in any
issue of civic power is this--

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.570
who decides?

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.980
Who decides?

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.660
And I just want to
close my remarks here

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.490
by saying that when
I'm telling you

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.380
that you're more powerful than
you think, when I'm giving you

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.630
this mental framework for
how to think about power,

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.379
when I'm laying out
some of the strategies

00:23:59.379 --> 00:24:01.530
for how to exercise power
and change the game,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.600
and change the story,
and change the equation,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.030
it's all about
directing it toward you

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.220
being part of the answer of
the question "who decides?"

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.930
And I think we're, again, in
this very exciting moment right

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.480
now, where lots of folks who
have been on the sidelines,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.880
who have not been
participating at all,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.880
are now starting to realize
that it's not enough just

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.490
to be a spectator, that
it is time to learn how

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.130
to participate, and
it is time to move

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.260
beyond just that primal scream.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.329
We now have the obligation,
those of us who have capital.

00:24:33.329 --> 00:24:35.120
Whether in this room
or in this livestream,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.190
you have capital of every kind--

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.070
social capital, political
capital, intellectual capital,

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.810
relationship capital.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.410
Those of us who have capital
now must choose to circulate it,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.367
must choose now to democratize
our understanding of how

00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:50.450
you get stuff done and how
you make change happen.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.412
Because that's the only
way, in the bottom up

00:24:52.412 --> 00:24:53.870
and from the middle
out, that we're

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.487
going to actually
heal the body politic.

00:24:56.487 --> 00:24:58.070
So thank you for
having me here today,

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.467
and let's just open it up
for a wider conversation.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for coming.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.410
So you were referencing the
Seattle and San Francisco

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.010
housing markets, which are
particularly difficult,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.600
difficult markets right now.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.380
And as someone that lives in San
Francisco, a lot of what we're

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.290
seeing, at least,
I guess the people

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.275
that are moving into
the city, they're

00:25:23.275 --> 00:25:26.152
what we call the NIMBYs,
the Not In My Backyard,

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:28.360
which are the more selfish
people that have purchased

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.140
houses in the past, when the
market was not as competitive,

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.980
and have their houses, and due
to the zoning laws in the city,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.417
it's almost impossible.

00:25:37.417 --> 00:25:40.000
Because they have a view of the
Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.052
They don't want to
give up that view.

00:25:42.052 --> 00:25:43.510
So you have this
voting bloc that's

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.968
pretty much blocking any new
apartment buildings from going

00:25:45.968 --> 00:25:47.800
in and stuff like that.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.079
I guess the question is,
can you change these people?

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:53.620
Are you able to change them or
is there a certain point where

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.950
you just need to give up and
look to Oakland or something

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.880
like that?

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.046
ERIC LIU: It's a great
question, and it's a question

00:26:00.046 --> 00:26:03.340
that San Francisco is
probably the hot embodiment

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.680
of in the world right now.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.980
But plenty of other cities
have, to lesser degrees,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.700
the same kinds of questions.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.420
And Seattle is
living it right now.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.300
So I guess I would say this.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.460
Of course it is true that
incumbent power holders, those

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:29.350
who have good views, those
who like the current zoning

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.370
system of single family housing
and who might oppose density,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.440
who might oppose
transit-oriented development,

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.850
who might oppose changing
the equation, not only

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.170
of residents but, again,
of power in the city, they

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.120
get the default setting.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.960
The question is whether
enough other folks in a city

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.840
can mobilize to shift
the terms of engagement.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.490
And I think the answer
is absolutely yes.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.770
I don't know San
Francisco city politics

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.610
as well as I know
Seattle city politics,

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.320
but we have a
socialist on the city

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:11.180
council, an avowed socialist,
a woman named Kshama Sawant.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:16.750
And she was one of the
loud, prime figures driving

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.600
the early days of
the $15 Now movement.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.670
And when she got elected, it
was the same election season

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.710
during which the
neighboring town of Sea-Tac,

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:31.300
the airport city near Seattle,
also enacted a $15 minimum wage

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.080
by vote of the people.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.750
That's a little
town of people who

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.350
are immigrants, who work in
the hotel and hospitality

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.635
and airport industries, and
who were being ground down

00:27:41.635 --> 00:27:44.440
and who voted themselves
a raise, basically.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.650
As that happened, Kshama Sawant
ran this campaign that was also

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.740
on $15, but it was
also on this idea of,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.910
we've got to reclaim
a city that is rapidly

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.100
becoming San Francisco.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.160
And we've got to actually
start shifting our debates here

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.610
on affordable housing.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.650
And so she won.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:06.100
And her victory, which
was only made possible,

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.630
not by a majority of Seattlites,
but by an active, motivated

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.100
minority.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.110
Her victory on the
city council completely

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:18.190
changed the frame of
debate in city politics.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.530
It shifted everything leftward.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.854
And I think one of the most
important things-- now, she's

00:28:23.854 --> 00:28:25.270
building more of
a bloc, and there

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.160
are other folks
in the council now

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.250
who have since been elected
who are increasingly

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.810
receptive to changes in
zoning, to restrictions

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:40.210
on development to make housing
more affordable in Seattle.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.690
In any city, it begins
in the same way.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.190
We think about
politics as something

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.370
that is operating
by majority rule,

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.650
but we have to remember
that majority rule is always

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.530
a function of minority will.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.160
All it takes is having a
super activated minority.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.720
And so it may seem
that what you're

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.240
calling the NIMBYs
in San Francisco

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.820
represent the majority of
power or votes or whatever.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.270
But right now, all it takes is
an activated minority of people

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.670
to organize and say--
particularly younger people--

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:13.060
to say, "we demand
a different vision,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.420
we demand a different way
of allocating opportunity

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.030
in this town, and we're
going to start organizing,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.340
and we're going to start
electing people who

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.340
want that same kind of vision."

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.230
And I think this is the thing.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.461
The keyword I just
used is "demand."

00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:31.460
Frederick Douglass said,
"power concedes nothing

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.140
without a demand."

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.780
All around Seattle, I've been
seeing these big posters,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.590
giant posters that say
"we deserve rent control."

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.980
And I look at that, and
I may be sympathetic,

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.670
policy-wise, to proposals
of rent control,

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:51.080
but as has been said in the
classic Western "Unforgiven"

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.480
the Clint Eastwood movie,
"deserve" ain't got nothing

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.956
to do with it.

00:29:54.956 --> 00:29:57.490
It's not a matter of deserve.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.890
It's about "demand."

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.840
Simply saying, we
deserve rent control,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.910
that we deserve more
fairness, that we deserve

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.790
a city that everybody
can live in,

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.930
is nice but completely
insufficient.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.350
Figuring out how you mobilize
people to apply pressure

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.930
on your supervisors, to apply
pressure on policy makers,

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.900
to apply pressure, again,
of money power, people

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.300
power, social norms,
and shaming power

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.750
on developers in this
community, to start

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.910
pushing for more opportunities
that actually make

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.790
it a more affordable place.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.404
I don't think the game
is rigged beyond repair,

00:30:34.404 --> 00:30:36.820
but it does involve actually
showing up and being prepared

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.970
to make demands that, again,
are literate in the power

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.900
grid of your city.

00:30:42.762 --> 00:30:44.220
AUDIENCE: OK, for
the next question

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.050
we have Russell
from the livestream.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.850
And the question
is, do you think

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.130
our current economic
inequality is related

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.320
to the decline of labor unions?

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.930
And do you think there could be
a replacement institution that

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.380
advocates for labor?

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.870
ERIC LIU: That's such
a great question.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.510
The answer is yes.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:06.240
Our economic inequality is
not just correlated with,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.890
it is causally related to
the decline in unionization

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.760
in the United States.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.060
And it's a very simple thing to
understand, that capitalism--

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.450
we've gone from a
notion of capitalism

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.080
that is about prosperity for
all to a notion of capitalism

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.620
that is about prosperity
for capitalists.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.150
And that is what
happens when you

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.250
have a system in which
there is no countervailing

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.710
power to capitalists.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.530
It is in the nature of
capitalism for capitalists

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.730
to want to drive
costs down to zero.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.090
Left to itself, capitalism does
drive things and wages down

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.510
to subsistence,
near slavery wages.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:52.300
The only question is whether
you have countervailing power,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.160
institutions have
countervailing power.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.640
Unions used to be that
kind of institution.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.440
And through a variety of
things, a variety of forces,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.340
including, by the way, the
corruption and ossification,

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.805
calcification of unions
themselves, they often

00:32:05.805 --> 00:32:07.180
have been their
own worst enemies

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.120
over the last
several generations.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.110
But I think that's
a secondary factor.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.720
The primary factor
was a concerted effort

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.960
in public policy
to break unions,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.470
to make it harder for unions
to organize, to make it harder,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.470
to make it easier for
employees to bypass unions.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.020
So we're at it, again,
that same four decade

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.100
stretch that I described
at the outset of worsening

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.780
and radical severe income
inequality is a four decade

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.780
stretch in which unions
have been ground down.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.530
The second part of the
question, though, I

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.571
think is super important.

00:32:39.571 --> 00:32:43.470
Because there is no
magic wand today to wave

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.090
that's going to turn
our economy back

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.700
into a major union economy.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.270
Private sector
unionization rates are 7%.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.530
7%.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.160
So the only place, the
toehold that unions have

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160
is in the public sector.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.160
And quite frankly, in
ways that are problematic,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.930
and that's because employers
in the public sector

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.640
are also politicians
who also depend

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.470
on contributions from unions.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.720
That's an inherently
messy situation.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.690
In the private sector, the
day in which unions come back

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.010
is not going to come.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:14.260
And so we've got to
start thinking, though,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.250
about new, innovative ways to
generate countervailing worker

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.120
power.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.953
There's actually one
that I want to tell you

00:33:20.953 --> 00:33:23.110
all about here that's
located here in the Bay Area,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.970
and I happen to serve
on the board of it.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.305
It's called the Workers Lab.

00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:27.820
It's based in Oakland.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.932
And the Workers Lab is this--

00:33:29.932 --> 00:33:31.390
you could think of
it, essentially,

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.900
as a venture capital firm that's
meant to incubate and seed

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:40.000
new ventures in activating
worker voice and work power.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.930
And so it has been
investing in apps

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.780
that help people
in the Uber economy

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.770
to be able to communicate
with one another.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.070
It's investing in
various other tech

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.650
tools that provide a whole lot
more transparency on things

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.520
like scheduling in retail.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.910
It's providing other channels
for freelancers and others

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.950
in the gig economy
to begin to pool

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:12.230
resources for collective forms
of insurance and so forth.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.239
And they're also just
beginning to seed research

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.964
into new forms of what you might
think of as social insurance.

00:34:20.964 --> 00:34:23.380
What you realize right now is
that if unions aren't coming

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.210
back, and we have an
increasingly gigified economy,

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.270
either we're just going to
let people like Uber drivers

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.600
or, frankly, contractors to
tech companies like Google,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.730
just be wholly on their own.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.033
Or we are actually
going to agree

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:41.199
that we're all better off
when we're all better off,

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.630
and that we together actually
have a responsibility

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.290
to create some
network of mutual aid

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.330
for people in the gig economy.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.810
My friend David [? Rolf, ?]
who actually does run a union,

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.330
he's one of the more creative
young leaders in the labor

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.560
movement today.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.310
He runs an SEIU local
in the Northwest

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.889
and I write about
him in the book.

00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:04.930
David was one of the
co-catalysts of this Workers

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.930
Lab, but he's also been
thinking and writing

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.590
with some interesting bedfellows
from the business world,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.410
from the reform conservative
movement, from the R

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.600
Street Institute
and other places,

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.540
getting people from
right and left to say,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.910
"OK, like it or not,
we're in a gigified world.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:27.100
Let's think about how we create
a system of portable benefits

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.020
in which corporations across the
board have to pay in to a pool,

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.520
and government maybe supports
and pays into this pool,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.630
but where any employee,
any worker who's

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:41.260
working in a gig economy
knows that she or he carries

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.500
with her or him a portable
set of benefits that

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.414
don't rely on the employer."

00:35:46.414 --> 00:35:47.830
That's a different
way of thinking

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.538
about the employer-employee
relationship,

00:35:49.538 --> 00:35:51.850
but it recognizes that
in this network age

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.280
we've got to come up with
new tools and new formats

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.900
for doing this.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.550
That requires some
wonkiness and trying

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:01.499
to figure out just how you
design and structure that.

00:36:01.499 --> 00:36:03.790
It's a great question for
people at a place like Google

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:04.664
to be thinking about.

00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:07.455
How do you design that?

00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:09.590
But before you even get
to the design question,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.710
it requires that fundamental
philosophical commitment

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:16.852
to the idea that countervailing
worker power matters.

00:36:16.852 --> 00:36:18.560
And it matters not
just because you don't

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.060
want workers to get screwed.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.797
It matters because you want
capitalism not to tip over.

00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:25.380
When there is no
countervailing power,

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.140
you get what we got in
the financial crisis.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.280
You get just ever more insane
forms of financial engineering

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.980
and financialization of an
economy that is unchecked

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.740
by these countervailing forces,
and the economy tips over

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.400
and it collapses.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.890
But what we've got
to do right now

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:43.919
is to pay attention to
these forms of creativity

00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:44.960
and countervailing power.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.630
Thoughts or questions?

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.280
Yeah, please.

00:36:56.249 --> 00:36:58.790
AUDIENCE: OK, so you explained
that it's axiomatic that power

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:59.720
concentrates, right?

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.370
ERIC LIU: Yeah.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:02.453
AUDIENCE: I think media
is a good example of this.

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.940
Six companies control 90%
of the media in America.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.984
So it's very concentrated,
very much an oligarchy.

00:37:07.984 --> 00:37:09.650
One thing I thought
that was fascinating

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.050
about the past election
cycle, whether you agree

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.660
with the outcome or not,
was Trump's use of Twitter

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.900
and also the social media to
a countervailing narrative

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.370
against mainstream media
was a huge game changer,

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.530
I think, and we'll see it
going for election to election.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.349
Could you speak about
technology's role

00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:28.890
is decentralization of power
and what more can be done there?

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.670
ERIC LIU: That's another great
observation and question.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:35.870
I mean, candidate Trump is
one of the most important

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.397
embodiments of all
three imperatives

00:37:38.397 --> 00:37:39.230
I was talking about.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:41.600
That man knew how to
change the game, the story,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.160
and the equation.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.500
And he knew it intuitively.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.020
He's not-- if you were
to ask him how he did it,

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.130
he might not be able to give
you a fully articulate playbook,

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.710
but he had a particular
kind of genius

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.340
for doing all those things.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.420
And I think the one that
you focus on in particular

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:04.000
is quite at the heart of
it, his sense of how to--

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.400
In every phase
change in politics,

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.310
the elected leaders
who rise to the top

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:17.720
are those who anticipate
the ways to exploit

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.640
new kinds of media.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.530
And that's as true
of a Trump as it

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:26.570
was true for an LBJ, who was
very skillful at exploiting

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:30.520
radio in the '30s and '40s
as he was rising in politics.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.930
It was of course true
of Hitler, but it

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.350
was true of politicians-- it
was true of Teddy Roosevelt, who

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.800
understood that the arrival
of tabloid newspapers

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.530
made it necessary for
someone who was indeed

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.780
a very thoughtful,
intellectual person

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.020
to basically make
himself into a cartoon,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.370
and to make himself
into this figure

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.900
that people could
tabloidize in the best way.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.240
So at any time, our politics
does respond to that.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.490
But your question about how
does technology and media

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:05.780
and the decentralization of
it change the power equation,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.860
I think profoundly.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.210
Look, I mean, all of the
debate and the anguish

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:14.120
about fake news--

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.440
fake news is a
consequence of two things.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.630
One is this multi-decade decline
in civic literacy and civic

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:24.230
education, where people
don't know their own minds

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.320
and they don't know how
to seek out knowledge.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.790
And so people, we
the people, are

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.280
super susceptible to fake news.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.890
But there's always
been fake news.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:37.264
Fake news is like a virus
that is in the body,

00:39:37.264 --> 00:39:38.930
but it only actually
takes over the body

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.511
when your immune system
is super compromised.

00:39:41.511 --> 00:39:43.010
We've been super
compromised because

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:44.240
of that civic illiteracy.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.610
That's force number one.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.570
But force number two
is the one that you

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:51.350
put your finger on, which is,
hey, everybody's a publisher.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:54.800
Everybody's a media outlet.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.860
We've leveled completely
between Infowars and CNN

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.220
and between Breitbart
and The New York Times.

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.230
And so there's just this
flattening, in a way.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.340
Much less individual
bloggers and people

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.360
who've built giant followings
just on social media.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.700
I actually think, quite
frankly, the net of that

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.060
is harmful to democracy.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:22.430
All the ways in which hierarchy
flattening media technologies

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:27.920
were meant to democratize and
revitalize democracy I think

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.980
have been swamped
and subsumed by all

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.240
the corrosive and corrupt
ways in which that very same

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.960
flattening has allowed certain
kinds of viruses to take hold

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.610
and to spread.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:41.360
What's the remedy?

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.160
I actually I think
the remedy is one

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:49.160
that is a hybrid of the most
old fashioned and the most

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.170
newfangled.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.670
I think we as people, as
citizens in that broadest

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:00.210
sense, really have to relearn
how to see each other again.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.456
We have to relearn
the face to face.

00:41:03.456 --> 00:41:04.830
And I think our
democracy is only

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.120
going to get revitalized by
people recommitting to the face

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.590
to face.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.290
However, social
media and technology

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:17.010
can be activated and
deployed in service of that.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:17.980
It can supplement it.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.040
It can provide--
again, Indivisible

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.080
is a great example of this.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.569
Pre-internet, Indivisible
would've been a nice thing--

00:41:24.569 --> 00:41:25.860
I actually write about a thing.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.510
In 1969, a group of 12 women
who were really ticked off

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.300
about the way that the health
care system was so oriented

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.390
around the male body, around
the male standard and everything

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.390
else like that, they
wrote this 69 page

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.239
document about proposing
ways that the medical system

00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:45.780
and the health care system be
paying more attention to women.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.590
They photocopied.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.090
It became this guerrilla thing.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.389
It spread over the
years in this way.

00:41:50.389 --> 00:41:51.930
It ultimately became
this famous book

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.969
called "Our Bodies, Ourselves."

00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:56.010
But it took them months
and years for that thing,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:59.350
literally, to get photocopied,
mailed, stapled, and spread.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.190
Indivisible- bam.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.600
Overnight, literally.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.310
But the beautiful
thing about Indivisible

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.991
is not the way in which
the document spread.

00:42:07.991 --> 00:42:10.365
It's the way in which the
document became the inspiration

00:42:10.365 --> 00:42:13.590
and the catalyst
for people in places

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.230
to say, "I'd like
to see my neighbors.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:18.970
I'd like to meet people face
to face and talk about this.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.450
I'd like to be able to feel
what it's like in a room

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.290
to sense if you're with me or
not with me, to feel if you're

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.810
starting to cross your arms and
give me body language about,

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.970
I don't like where
you're going with that."

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.730
These kinds of things
about the theater

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.670
of being citizens
together in a democracy

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:36.900
is what we've got to revive.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.050
And so I'm not being a Luddite.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:41.550
I'm not saying "turn off your
devices, turn off your screens

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.460
and just reconvene
in the town hall."

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.390
I'm saying, let's think
about how we activate Google.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.290
Let's think about
how all the folks

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.750
here in the civic side of
Google, who are developing

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.230
all kinds of cool tools,
and cards, and apps

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.139
that you can use in
mobile for voting

00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:59.430
and for understanding where
your district is, let's use

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.650
those same kinds
of smarts to help

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.040
activate the ability of
people to see each other again

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.530
and to organize
themselves again.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.500
The simple watchword that I
have for this moment right now,

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.750
this is a time when people
are saying, "what do we do?

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:13.230
What do we do?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.063
I went to the march.

00:43:14.063 --> 00:43:15.340
What do I do?"

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.980
And my answer is very
simply, be like Ben.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.020
By which I mean,
Benjamin Franklin.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.640
Benjamin Franklin was this
addicted, nonstop, inveterate

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.110
club maker.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.600
Stamp collecting clubs,
philosophical clubs,

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.910
artisan groups,
debate societies,

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.130
the first public library,
the first fire department.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.590
The guy couldn't
help but make clubs.

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.590
Either make a club
or join a club,

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:43.430
but reconnect with people
in a face to face way.

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:47.240
And then think about how we can
deploy decentralized technology

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.115
to accelerate that.

00:43:49.115 --> 00:43:50.490
If some of those
clubs are about,

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.310
"hey, let's have a fact club.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.450
Let's have a news club.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:57.666
Let's talk about--"
That's the way in which,

00:43:57.666 --> 00:43:59.540
again, from the bottom
up and the inside out,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.460
we're going to
revitalize democracy.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.370
Got another question?

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah, mine's
a follow-up to that

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.680
about the technology aspect.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.190
And specifically with the
Indivisibles movement,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.410
I thought that the Google doc
was a great way of finding out

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:16.790
how to contact people.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.770
The challenging thing
for me is, the best

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.200
way to contact a lot of
these local congressmen

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.510
and even at the senator level
was calling a landline phone,

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.440
sending a letter,
writing an email.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.770
From an operations and
technology perspective,

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.275
it just seemed very antiquated.

00:44:35.275 --> 00:44:35.900
ERIC LIU: Yeah.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.700
AUDIENCE: And I
was wondering, do

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.860
you think this is where a
third party needs to step in

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.590
and really introduce
that medium?

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.290
Maybe there's strategic
advantage at least

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.550
in keeping the status quo
for the politicians, where

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.200
you could easily
drown out like that.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.920
Or even in a town hall,
there's some selective bias

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.000
in the people that
show up and talk,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.840
and you can control the
access to the town hall.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.880
What do you see is as
the next steps here?

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.890
Is it something that
will fix itself,

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:15.140
or does it actively need other
people stepping in to help it?

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.050
ERIC LIU: So it's another
great observation and question.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:22.320
Let me be really clear--
nothing fixes itself.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.370
Indeed, systems left
to themselves, again,

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.864
things concentrate, things
tip over, things die.

00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:31.280
A prior book of mine is called
"the Gardens of Democracy,"

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.600
and it's just to that point
about complex adaptive systems,

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:39.200
when left to themselves,
tend towards these situations

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.720
of concentration, and that
to be a gardener means

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.290
to weed, and seed, and
feed, and recirculate.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:51.270
But your specific
question, I think, yeah,

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.270
the actions that Indivisible's
asking you to do,

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.400
do feel antiquated,
the modes of engaging

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.597
with Congress if you
go to a town meeting,

00:45:57.597 --> 00:45:58.430
or a public meeting.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.346
And not just Congress.

00:45:59.346 --> 00:46:02.630
If you go to your city council,
if you go to your town meeting,

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:07.970
if you go to your library board,
or your utilities commission,

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.320
they are incredibly antiquated.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.140
And I think there is
actually a great opportunity

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.210
for innovation there right now.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.830
Citizen University,
my organization,

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.800
is going to be working with
the Pepperdine School of Public

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.420
Policy in LA actually on a
project that we're calling

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.570
Reinventing the Public Meeting.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:28.760
Public meetings are torture.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.330
You go.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.936
You sit in a room
for a long time.

00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:33.560
You wait your turn
to stand at the mic,

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.470
and you get two minutes maximum,
while the members of the body

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.720
sit there, and they're not
really listening to you.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.340
They're doing their other work.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.640
It's just for show,
and then it's over.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.070
Sometimes, if enough
angry people come,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.470
they storm and they
flood that meeting.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.780
And they hold the mic for
more than two minutes,

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.710
but it's still this totally
suboptimal way of engaging.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:57.170
I think this is a great question
for us together right now.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:58.830
People who care
about civics, people

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.950
who care about tech, people
who care about power,

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.980
how do we redesign
the public meeting?

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.250
How do we redesign forms
of public engagement?

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.230
How do we hold
different elected folks

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.300
to account in different ways?

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.790
That said, I do
want to underscore

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:18.369
that certain old fashioned
things are necessary.

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:20.160
Another movement that
is really interesting

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:26.000
right now is #peoplepower,
which grew out of the fact

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.350
that, post-inauguration, or
actually indeed post-election,

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:33.680
the ACLU received this
unbelievable deluge, which

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.682
is still continuing, a deluge
of money, and volunteers,

00:47:37.682 --> 00:47:39.390
and people saying "I
want to support you.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:40.520
I want to help you."

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.610
And the ACLU, I mean, this
is a great problem to have,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:44.570
but it was a problem.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.850
Because the ACLU is
structured really

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:49.430
as an organization where
people in different cities

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:52.520
and their ACLU chapters,
mainly they're lawyers.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.870
They're lawyers litigating cases
or making policy proposals.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.200
They weren't really set up
to be a grassroots army.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.600
And so now that millions of
people were coming at them

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.100
and saying "I want
to join the ACLU.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.360
What can I do besides
write a check?"

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:09.170
they decided, "we'd better
make a grassroots army."

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:14.460
And so they hired folks
to actually organize this.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.130
And in the last
few months, they've

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.260
launched this
campaign, basically,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.820
with the hashtag peoplepower.

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.670
They catalyzed it,
but it's, again,

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.400
people in localities
running with it.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.460
And I just spoke this
weekend at ACLU People Power

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.260
gathering in Washington DC.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.150
And to your question,
they were not

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.860
just talking about Congress.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.200
They were talking,
actually, quite specifically

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.250
about what can we as
citizens do to make sure

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.550
that DC City government does
all that it can and should

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.060
be doing to protect
immigrants and refugees?

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.580
And there is a
concrete list of things

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.920
that DC government
can and should do.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.660
Pass this particular ordinance,
fully fund this project,

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.870
make this commitment
on sanctuary cities.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.340
Do this list of things.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.830
And a few things
that, even those it's

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.580
a progressive city government,
the government hadn't yet done.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:12.260
And so it was super useful for
the ACLU to gather these folks.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.150
It was a really great
intergenerational group

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.840
of people who were activists
in the '60s and then people who

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.470
were 20 somethings and Bernie
folks as well as OFA people,

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:25.550
all coming together to say,
"OK, how do we apply pressure

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.670
on the power structure
of DC City government?"

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.900
That's old fashioned, still.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.990
You still gotta go
and work the org chart

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:34.880
of DC City government.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.160
You can't just say, "I wish
I could make that go away.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.350
I wish we could make it
obsolete with a new app

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:40.630
or something like that."

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.680
That still is there,
and it behooves

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.190
us to be able to
engage that system.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:50.950
But the more of us
who are tech literate

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.680
choose to engage that
way, the more that system

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.009
is going to eventually
adapt and respond.

00:49:57.009 --> 00:49:58.550
The last thing I'll
say, because this

00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:59.966
was a note in your
question there,

00:49:59.966 --> 00:50:02.217
is it going to
take a third party?

00:50:02.217 --> 00:50:03.800
This goes to what
you were saying too.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.120
We already have a third.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.230
We already have a fourth.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.740
The Trump movement is not
a Republican movement.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.950
The Sanders movement is not
a Democratic Party movement.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:20.570
They each have been fit
uncomfortably into those boxes,

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.470
but technology and this
moment of the great pushback

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.770
are yielding already
new kinds of movements

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.867
that don't fit in the
boxes of our party duopoly.

00:50:32.867 --> 00:50:34.700
And I think that's only
going to accelerate.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.290
And again, one of
the things that I

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.750
think folks who have a sense
of technology and the fluency

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.840
that you have in using these
tools to both bring people

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:51.590
together, to educate people, and
to stir people to action is--

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.490
I would close by
extending this invitation

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.650
to you, which is, invite people
to use their imagination.

00:51:00.376 --> 00:51:02.000
It's literally where
we've got to think

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.430
outside the box or
the boxes that are

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:08.150
called R and D, red and blue.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:11.490
There is a wide open field of
new ways for us to engage here.

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.260
And some will be something
like a people's party.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.530
Some will be short lived
movements that arise for a bit

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:22.780
but then shape and push one
of the established parties.

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.750
Who knows?

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.550
I mean, had Donald
Trump lost the election,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.560
the Republican Party probably
would have shattered right now.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.140
We'd be talking about the
remnants of the Republican

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.290
Party, and how there would be
a nationalist party over here,

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.920
and a capitalist
party over here.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.070
And there would be a
traditionalist party over here.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:44.210
All of those clusters
of want and all

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.870
of these clusters of identity
are still in the ecosystem.

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:49.550
How can we exercise
our imagination

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.560
to give them fuller expression?

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.860
That's part of our opportunity
and part of the invitation

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.235
that I'd extend to all
of you here at Google

00:51:57.235 --> 00:51:58.360
in this moment as citizens.

00:52:01.594 --> 00:52:04.010
MICHAEL: With, that let's thank
Eric for coming here today

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.840
to join us.

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.150
ERIC LIU: Well, thank
you for having me here.

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.400
This has really been great.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.250
[APPLAUSE]
