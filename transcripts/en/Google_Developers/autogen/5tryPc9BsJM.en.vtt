00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.924
Welcome to our project
Google Developers Hackademy,

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:17.660
where Spanish-speaking experts
from Latin America

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.099
will show you some
of our tools,

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.660
developer products,
APIs and new tricks.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.990
This course is divided
into five parts

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.231
We invite you to watch it
and learn along.

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.660
Here we go.

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:39.231
Hi. Welcome back to the
HTML5 web development

00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:42.066
with Google Drive
introduction course.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.924
I'm Cesar Anton Dorantes,

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:47.099
Google Developer Expert
for the Google Drive platform.

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.792
In the previous lesson
we learned to connect

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:53.099
your Google Charts charts
with Spreadsheets data.

00:00:53.396 --> 00:00:56.165
In this lesson we'll see
the following themes:

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.099
Creating a new project
on Google Cloud Console.

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:01.462
Activating G+ API.

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:03.198
Registering an API.

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:05.165
G+ Login button.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.660
And Adding the G+ Login button.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.957
You ready? Here we go!

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:14.858
CREATING A NEW PROJECT
ON GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:19.297
Time to register our app
to the Google Cloud Console.

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:21.330
This is very important
since you need

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.099
a client identifier
so Google lets you

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.495
access the platform.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.528
You need to access
Google Cloud Console first

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:35.693
from cloud.google.
com/console#/project.

00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.726
Once in this onscreen,
select Create Project.

00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:42.561
A new window will open
in which to register

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.528
the name and ID you want
for your project.

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:48.825
Though later on you'll be able
to change the project's name,

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.693
you need to come up with
an ID you want for it,

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:54.957
because you won't be able
to change it later on.

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:58.627
ACTIVATING G+ API

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.066
That's it! Your new project
is now registered,

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.528
and onscreen you can see
the ID you chose

00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:06.594
and the project number
it was assigned to it.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:09.033
Time to activate Google+ API

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.231
so our app can use
the Login button.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.495
We click on APIs
and authentication to see

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:16.396
the list of Google's APIs.

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:19.693
Now we see a long list
with all APIs available

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.264
for developers.

00:02:21.264 --> 00:02:24.264
I invite you
to explore it later,

00:02:24.264 --> 00:02:27.726
just click on its name to see
the methods it has to offer.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.330
For now let's focus
only on Google+ API.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.033
We can find it
below on the list.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.099
Remember the APIs
are listed alphabetically

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.462
but a list with the active ones
is shown first.

00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:42.990
Once we find Google+ API,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.627
we click on the "OFF" button
to change its status

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:47.099
and activate the API.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.297
Once it's active,
you'll see it is brought

00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:51.297
to the upper part of the list,

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.330
that way we can always see

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.495
which APIs are active
for our project quickly.

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:00.297
REGISTERING AN APP

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:03.726
It's time to register our app
for this project.

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:07.033
Google Cloud Console lets us
keep our apps separated

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.858
for every different project.

00:03:08.858 --> 00:03:12.165
This will turn out to be useful
for you as a Google developer.

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.099
Let's click on the tab
"Registered apps."

00:03:16.495 --> 00:03:20.363
On this window we can see
the apps we already registered

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:22.264
and add some new ones.

00:03:22.264 --> 00:03:25.132
Let's click on the
"Register app" button.

00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:28.792
Now we can see the
new app registration display.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.330
You just need to give the name
you want to register

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.165
for this app in particular

00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:35.363
and what platform
it's designed for.

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:37.792
In this case we'll use
the by-default option,

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.429
which is Web App.

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:42.264
Once we've given a name
for the app,

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.066
let's click on "Register."

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.990
This will lead us
to a new window

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.726
with our app's properties.

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:50.924
You can also change its name
here later on

00:03:50.924 --> 00:03:52.429
if you want to.

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:54.957
For now, we'll click
where it says

00:03:54.957 --> 00:03:57.297
"OAuth 2.0 client ID."

00:03:57.726 --> 00:04:00.660
Here we can see the client ID

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.132
for our app.

00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:06.033
Keep it at hand, you'll need it
for the code in a moment.

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:10.264
G+ LOGIN BUTTON

00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:14.627
The necessary JavaScript
for the G+ Login button logic

00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:17.495
will always be the same
for all our projects,

00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:20.825
therefore we'll save
two separate files,

00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:23.990
which we will name G+login.js

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.858
and G+loginhandle.js.

00:04:26.858 --> 00:04:29.363
The best part is you'll be able
to recycle them

00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:31.132
for future projects.

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:32.792
Quite practical, right?

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:37.363
This simple code corresponds
to the G+login.js file,

00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:39.594
which will hide the button

00:04:39.594 --> 00:04:42.132
in case the user
has already signed in,

00:04:42.132 --> 00:04:44.396
and it is also in charge
of reporting to him

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:47.165
if a problem has happened
when signing in.

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.264
This JavaScript function

00:04:49.264 --> 00:04:52.528
corresponds
to the G+loginhandle.js file.

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:55.693
It'll make sure
the JavaScript button

00:04:55.693 --> 00:04:58.561
loads asynchronously
and therefore minimize

00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:00.990
the loading time in our app.

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:04.132
ADDING THE G+ LOGIN BUTTON

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:07.990
To add the G+ Login button
to your app,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.396
we first need to import
the code we saved

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:12.858
in the G+login.js file,

00:05:12.858 --> 00:05:15.627
by declaring its route
to the head tags

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:17.627
of our HTML5 code,

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:19.792
just as shown onscreen.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.297
Declare the route
to g+login-handle.js,

00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:25.561
right after the body tag.

00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:27.792
This will make sure
the script is asynchronously

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.165
executed in the browser.

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:32.330
Copy this code
where you wish the button

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.066
to show in your app. You'll
notice one of the parameters

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:37.132
is called "data-clientid."

00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:40.165
It's important to emphasize
the "data-scope" parameter,

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:43.363
which lets us use this button
to request access

00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:46.033
to other services
in future applications.

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:50.528
That's it, our app will now show
a G+ starting button

00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:54.396
when someone enters your app
without his account active

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.264
or if the app has no
authorized access

00:05:57.264 --> 00:05:59.198
to this app in particular.

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:01.858
This will turn out to be very
useful when you build apps

00:06:01.858 --> 00:06:04.759
requiring access
to user information.

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:08.660
I invite you to watch
this lesson again,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.132
this time pausing it
to follow the steps

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:13.198
and copying the code
that is shown.

00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:15.363
As a comparison, you can see
an already built example

00:06:15.363 --> 00:06:17.363
entering to:

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.660
This will be it for now.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.396
See you next time,

00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:27.990
where will do a review
of the previous lessons.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.495
I say goodbye for now
and remember:

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:32.132
keep on programming!
