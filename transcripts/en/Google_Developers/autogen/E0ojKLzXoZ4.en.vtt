to consider low vision hearing impaired
or deaf low motor ability so this is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
or deaf low motor ability so this is
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350

it's not interested in layout and so you
 

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:55.569

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.319
button and it comes out interact with a
sari with a JavaScript Dom object which

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:30.329
sari with a JavaScript Dom object which
 

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.819
sari with a JavaScript Dom object which
allows you to access all the attributes

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:31.829
allows you to access all the attributes
 

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:35.150
allows you to access all the attributes
you would expect for a button it also

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160
you would expect for a button it also
 

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.829
you would expect for a button it also
comes out with an accessibility tree

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839
comes out with an accessibility tree
 

00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:41.960
comes out with an accessibility tree
which is mangled because reasons that

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:41.970
which is mangled because reasons that
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.059
which is mangled because reasons that
tells the screen reader that as a button

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:44.069
tells the screen reader that as a button
 

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.179
tells the screen reader that as a button
and it has a press statement on pristy

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:47.189
and it has a press statement on pristy
 

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:50.210
and it has a press statement on pristy
and so on for custom elements you need

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220
and so on for custom elements you need
 

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.129
and so on for custom elements you need
to do a little more work so that in this

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139
to do a little more work so that in this
 

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:55.249
to do a little more work so that in this
case the customer element author has

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:55.259
case the customer element author has
 

00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:57.439
case the customer element author has
made it so that the custom element will

00:15:57.439 --> 00:15:57.449
made it so that the custom element will
 

00:15:57.449 --> 00:16:02.300
made it so that the custom element will
write these Aria role and attribute when

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.310
write these Aria role and attribute when
 

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.800
write these Aria role and attribute when
the custom element is rendered to the

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:03.810
the custom element is rendered to the
 

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.840
the custom element is rendered to the
page so then we end up with a similar

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:05.850
page so then we end up with a similar
 

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.470
page so then we end up with a similar
situation as we do for native elements

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480
situation as we do for native elements
 

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.240
situation as we do for native elements
where we have a visual rendering we have

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.250
where we have a visual rendering we have
 

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.490
where we have a visual rendering we have
a Dom object that lets us access the

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500
a Dom object that lets us access the
 

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.160
a Dom object that lets us access the
attributes that we want and interact

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:16.170
attributes that we want and interact
 

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.740
attributes that we want and interact
with them and get a good developer

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:18.750
with them and get a good developer
 

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.710
with them and get a good developer
experience but also have an excess

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720
experience but also have an excess

they obviously inaccessible it's going

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:09.870
they obviously inaccessible it's going
 

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.630
they obviously inaccessible it's going
to be a really confusing experience and

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640
to be a really confusing experience and
 

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.250
to be a really confusing experience and
what we want to do is make sure that

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260
what we want to do is make sure that
 

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.570
what we want to do is make sure that
everything that is hidden behind this

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580
everything that is hidden behind this

will hide it from a screen reader you

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.050
will hide it from a screen reader you
 

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.720
will hide it from a screen reader you
possibly also want to set the tab index

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:20.730
possibly also want to set the tab index
 

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.730
possibly also want to set the tab index
to negative one to make sure that it's

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740
to negative one to make sure that it's
 

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.000
to negative one to make sure that it's
not part of the tab water and then here

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.010
not part of the tab water and then here
 

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.810
not part of the tab water and then here
we have a it says text elements should

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820
we have a it says text elements should
 

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.150
we have a it says text elements should
have a reasonable contrast ratio so I

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160
have a reasonable contrast ratio so I
 

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.520
have a reasonable contrast ratio so I
was talking earlier about users with low

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:34.530
was talking earlier about users with low
 

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.520
was talking earlier about users with low
vision or even just anyone using a

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:37.530
vision or even just anyone using a
 

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.190
vision or even just anyone using a
mobile device in bright sunlight low

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200
mobile device in bright sunlight low
 

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.920
mobile device in bright sunlight low
contrast X is a real pain and so I'll

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:42.930
contrast X is a real pain and so I'll
 

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.630
contrast X is a real pain and so I'll
just demonstrate a neat feature that it

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640
just demonstrate a neat feature that it
 

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.360
just demonstrate a neat feature that it
has which is that I can look at this in

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.370
has which is that I can look at this in
 

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.980
has which is that I can look at this in
the elements panel and it'll actually

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:48.990
the elements panel and it'll actually
 

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.900
the elements panel and it'll actually
come up with suggestions for colors I

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:50.910
come up with suggestions for colors I
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.470
come up with suggestions for colors I
could use instead so yeah it's slightly

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480
could use instead so yeah it's slightly
 

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.940
could use instead so yeah it's slightly
darker and much darker and finally so

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:01.950
darker and much darker and finally so
 

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.250
darker and much darker and finally so
here I think that's always bugged me

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260
here I think that's always bugged me
 

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.110
here I think that's always bugged me
about using Aria is that when you write

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120
about using Aria is that when you write
 

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.600
about using Aria is that when you write
incorrect HTML the dev tools are going

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.610
incorrect HTML the dev tools are going
 

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.950
incorrect HTML the dev tools are going
to tell you it's gonna come up as a

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960
to tell you it's gonna come up as a
 

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.800
to tell you it's gonna come up as a
error when you write incorrect Aria you

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:12.810
error when you write incorrect Aria you
 

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.060
error when you write incorrect Aria you
just sort of like you really have no

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.070
just sort of like you really have no
 

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.770
just sort of like you really have no
feedback until you try using it with a

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780
feedback until you try using it with a
 

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.970
feedback until you try using it with a
screen reader and discover that it

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980
screen reader and discover that it
 

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.010
