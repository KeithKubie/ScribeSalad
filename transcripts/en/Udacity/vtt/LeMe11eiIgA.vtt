To figure out how to get rid of the fraction over here, let's focus on that term

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:08.417
itself, 2 3rd x. I know that 2 3rd x is exactly the same as 2x divided by 3. So,

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.807
it would be super convenient if I could just multiply this term by 3, since then

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:17.075
it would no longer be written as a fraction, and I wouldn't have to go through

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:21.258
this whole mess over here. I can't, however, just multiply this term by 3. I

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:25.634
need to multiply this entire side of the equation by 3. If I'm going to put in

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:29.816
anything from the outside into an equation, I need to do that to the entire

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:33.862
side, and I need to do it to both sides. So, I'm going to multiply everything,

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.305
both sides of the equation by 3. And it leaves us with a very pretty equation

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:41.648
that only has integer, coefficients, and constants.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:45.487
&gt;From here, solving is pretty straightforward. You can take a second to look at

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.170
the steps that I did to come up with the same answer as we did using the first

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.750
method, 36 over 5. Both of these are completely fine ways of solving this

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:56.461
problem. It's just a matter of what you prefer doing. Which kind of math you

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.278
enjoy doing more.
