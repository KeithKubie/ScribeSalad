00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.100
Now, one thing that's important about
the horizon is that the horizon isn't

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.630
just something you make up, right?

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.650
The horizon actually depends upon
things like your discount factor.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.040
And if you have a very small
discount factor then so

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.110
far out in the future it doesn't
matter what's happening anyway.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.050
And so you can do better.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.850
But if you have a reasonable
discount factor then you're going to

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.000
have to look pretty far in
the future to get a good estimate

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.100
of taking a particular action
in a particular state.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.130
&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.800
&gt;&gt; Right.
So this is both good and bad, right?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.570
Monte Carlo is kind of neat because
it's sort of neat on its own.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.410
It's very useful,
it's one way of dealing with scale.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.560
It's completely compatible with
options and other things that we know.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.310
It has a bunch of dials in it, that we
can play with that sort of help us.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.940
And that we might be able to take cool
advantage of, but you still need lots

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.310
and lots and lots and lots of samples in
order to make it work, which is true for

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.740
any Monte Carlo method.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.690
&gt;&gt; So is there a sense in which
we traded, in big states basis,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.530
we traded being exponential in
the number of state features say?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250
For instead exponential in
the size of their horizon?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.286
&gt;&gt; Yeah and the trade off is, I mean
it's right here, I suppose this is our

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:08.598
trade off and you're right and
that makes sense, right?

00:01:08.598 --> 00:01:11.702
Before with the kind of algorithms,
that we used before, you visit all

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:14.768
the states, you back up information
about them and so on and so forth.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:17.118
So that clearly has to depend
upon the number of states.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.221
Here, we're not worrying about the
states, what we're doing is we're just

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.700
looking forward into the future
by doing simulation.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.040
And so every single time we have
to look forward into the future,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.530
we have to look forward into the future.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.880
And perhaps we have to look
forward very far into the future.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630
And somehow, because we're doing
this kind of Monte Carlo thing,

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.450
we're doing kind of, I don't know,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.530
like a almost a non-parametric
estimate of whatever the true

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.190
transition model is, that's going to
require lots and lots of states.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680
And lots and lots of samples,
and more and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.530
more samples the further out
into the future that we go.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.190
So we are going to be trading that off.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.090
We're always trading off kind of space
versus time in a particular way, and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.780
here the space is
represented by the states.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.070
As opposed to the time,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.890
which is represented by how far
out you're going to search.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.180
&gt;&gt; That's nice.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
