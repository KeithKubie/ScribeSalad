[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.080
RICHARD DAWKINS:
Thank you very much.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.550
Some of my titles may be good.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.466
I'm quite pleased with
"The Blind Watchmaker,"

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.420
as Ray Kurtzweil has said.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.260
"The Selfish Gene"
is not a bad title.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.880
But it's unfortunately
been rather

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.620
widely read by title only.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.070
Various critics have omitted
to read the rather substantial

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.150
footnote, which is
the book itself.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.840
This new book, "An
Appetite for Wonder,"

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.980
the subtitle is "The
Making of a Scientist,"

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.770
it is a memoir of the
first half of my life,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.950
up to the age of 35,
and it culminates

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.910
in the writing of
"The Selfish Gene."

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.470
So there's going to be a
volume two, in two year's time.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.960
It was all supposed to
have been one volume.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.430
But I kind of lost a
bit of stamina halfway

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.070
through and decided I needed a
bit of positive reinforcement.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.610
So I asked the publisher
if I could split it in half

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.010
and produce it in two volumes.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.440
And so it is actually a
rather natural breakpoint.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.520
"The Selfish Gene" was a fairly
natural breakpoint in my life.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.180
So I'm going to go through
with a set of readings, kind

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.320
of strung together
with a bit of talk.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.585
The book begins with
ancestors, and goes on

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:24.790
to my childhood,
and school days.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.849
And I got one or
two little anecdotes

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:29.890
from school days, which
might be vaguely amusing.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.070
I was sent to boarding schools
of a rather British kind

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.492
and rather young actually.

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:41.950
I was first sent
to boarding school

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.950
at the age of seven,
which is a bit too

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.080
young to be sent away to school.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.930
I used to have fantasies
that the matron would

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.450
turn into my mother.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.230
And I thought that since both
of them had dark, curly hair,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.730
it wouldn't take too much of
a miracle to achieve that.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.930
So I'm going to read a
little bit about school days.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.500
I was an exceptionally untidy
and disorganized little boy

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.200
in my early years.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.820
My first school reports
dwelt insistently

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.560
on the theme of ink.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.510
Headmaster's report-- He
has produced some good work

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.340
and well deserves his prize.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.510
A very inky little
boy at present,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.920
which is apt to spoil his work.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.310
Latin-- He has made
steady progress.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.300
But unfortunately
when using ink,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.530
his written work
becomes very untidy.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.130
Mathematics-- He
works very well.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.260
But I am not always
able to read his work.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.380
He must learn that ink is for
writing, not washing purposes.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.340
Ms. Benson, my elderly
French teacher,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.210
somehow managed to
omit the ink leitmotif.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.220
But even her report had
a sting in the tale.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.730
French-- Plenty of ability,
good pronunciation,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.950
and a wonderful facility
in escaping work.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.190
I then went on to another
school, a secondary school,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.280
which was rather more
spartan in some ways.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.750
And I went through a
religious phase, which I then

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.340
abandoned, and then
became rather rebellious.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.650
And with a couple of
friends, we refused

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.525
to kneel down in chapel.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.260
And so everybody else was
kneeling down with bowed heads

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.450
and we were sitting upright,
like islands of rebellion.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.090
It being an Anglican school,
they were very decent

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.830
and didn't take it out on us.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.720
They didn't indoctrinate
or punish us

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.070
in any way, which I think
is a nice advertisement

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.870
for the Anglican church.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.950
I hate to think what
might have happened

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.920
if we'd been to a school
run by a rival sect.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.930
My housemaster,
Mr. Ling, did make

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.950
sort of an effort to reform me.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.070
I'm going to read
a little bit here.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.980
I've only recently learned that
my housemaster, Peter Ling,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.670
actually a nice man, if
rather too conformist,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.350
telephoned [? Johan ?]
Thomas, my zoology master,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.510
to voice his concern about me.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.110
In a recent letter
to me, Mr. Thomas

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.640
reported that he warned
Mr. Ling that quote,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.510
"requiring someone like you
to attend chapel twice a day

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.380
on Sunday was doing
you positive harm."

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.980
The phone went down
without comment.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.850
Mr. Ling also
summoned my parents

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.170
for a heart-to-heart
talk over tea--

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.530
that's the way we do
things in England--

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.070
about my rebellious
behavior in chapel.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.270
I knew nothing of this
at the time and my mother

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.500
has only just told
me of the incident.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.060
Mr. Ling asked my parents
to try to persuade

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.370
me to change my ways.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.550
My father said, approximately,
by my mother's recollection,

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.000
it's not our business to
control him in that sort of way.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.160
That's kind of thing
is your problem.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.950
And I'm afraid I must
decline your request.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.920
My parents' attitude
to the whole affair

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.480
with that it wasn't important.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.550
Mr. Ling, as I said, was
in his way a decent man.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.170
A contemporary and friend
of mine in the same house

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.920
recently told me the
following nice story.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.590
He was illicitly up in a
dormitory during the day,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.020
kissing one of the house maids.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.350
The pair panicked when they had
a heavy tread on the stairs.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.130
And my friend hastily
bundled the young woman up

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.780
onto a window sill
and drew the curtains

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.560
to hide her standing form.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.430
Mr. Ling came into
the room and must

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.830
have noticed that only
one of the three windows

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.050
had the curtains drawn.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.570
Even worse, my friend
noticed, to his horror,

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.460
that the girl's feet
were clearly visible,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.280
protruding under the curtain.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.550
He firmly believed
that Mr. Ling must

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.090
have realized what was going on,
but pretended not to, perhaps

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.600
on boys will be boys grounds.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.960
What are you doing up here in
the dormitory at this hour?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.080
Just came up to
change my socks, sir.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.350
Oh, well hurry on down.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.980
Good call on Mr. Ling's part.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.810
That boy went on
to become probably

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.580
the most successful
alumnus of his generation,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.335
the mighty chief
executive officer

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:33.130
of one of the largest
international corporations

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.440
in the world and a generous
benefactor of the school,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.330
endowing, among other things,
the Peter Ling Fellowship.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.050
I don't mention the
name in the book.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.930
But I can divulge to you
that that boy was Sir Howard

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.680
Stringer, who became the head of
the Sony Corporation, the only

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.790
non-Japanese to do so.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.650
I then went on to
Oxford, which was

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.750
I think the turning
point in my life really.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.980
It was wonderful to be
educated to become a scholar

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.780
and to think,
rather than educated

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.790
to learn about what
was in textbooks.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.010
And so I think a tremendous
lot to the Oxford experience.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.510
And in particular to
various mentors at Oxford

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.840
and especially one,
Michael Cullen,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.660
who was the number
two to Niko Tinbergen,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.780
the great ethologist,
animal behaviorist, who

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.830
later won the Nobel Prize.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.520
Niko Tinbergen was my
official research supervisor

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.730
as a graduate student,
but Mike Cullen

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.120
was the one who really
looked after me.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.330
And I want to read
to you-- I hope

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.720
I didn't break
down when I do so.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.320
I occasionally choke
up a bit-- the eulogy

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.520
that I wrote for him
his at his funeral,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.500
in one of the Oxford
college chapels.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.470
He did not publish
many papers himself.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.290
Yet he worked prodigiously hard,
both in teaching and research.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.530
He was probably the
most sought after tutor

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.020
in the entire
zoology department.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.440
The rest of his time--
he was always in a hurry

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.250
and worked a hugely long
day-- was devoted to research,

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.580
but seldom his own research.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.700
Everybody who knew him has
the same story to tell.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.300
All the obituaries told it
in revealingly similar terms.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.610
You would have a problem
with your research.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.799
You knew exactly
where to go for help

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.549
and there he would be for you.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.340
I see the scene as yesterday,
the lunchtime conversation

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.390
in the kitchen, the wiry, boyish
figure in the red sweater,

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.800
slightly hunched like
a spring wound up,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.790
with intense
intellectual energy,

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.180
sometimes rocking back and
forth with concentration.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.800
The deeply intelligent
eyes, understanding

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.560
what you meant even
before the words came out.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.670
The back of the envelope to aid
explanation, the occasionally

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.380
skeptical, quizzical
tilt to the eyebrows,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.510
under the untidy hair.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.100
Then he would have to rush off.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.270
He always rushed
everywhere and disappeared.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.060
But next morning, the
answer to your problem

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.450
would arrive, in Mike's small,
distinctive handwriting,

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.680
two pages, often some
algebra, diagrams,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.610
a key reference
to the literature,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.740
sometimes an apt verse
of his own composition,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:29.330
a fragment of Latin or classical
Greek, always encouragement.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.601
We were grateful, but
not grateful enough.

00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:36.100
If we had thought
about it, we would

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.750
have realized he must
have been working

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.220
on that mathematical model
of my research all evening.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.410
And it isn't only for me
for whom he does this,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.550
everybody in the research
group gets the same treatment,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.470
and not just his own students.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.260
I was officially Niko's
student, not Mike's.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.720
Mike took me on,
without payment and

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.500
without official recognition
when my research became

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.530
more mathematical than
Niko could handle.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.640
When the time came to
me to write my thesis,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.420
it was my Mike Cullen who
read it, criticized it,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.930
helped me polish every line.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.960
And all this while he
was doing the same thing

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.660
for his own, official students.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.340
When, we all should
have wondered,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.590
does he get time for
ordinary family life?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.240
When does he get time
for his own research?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.400
No wonder he so seldom
published anything.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.980
No wonder he never wrote
his long awaited book

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.130
on animal communication.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.260
In truth, he should
have been joint author

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.350
of just about every one of
the hundreds of papers that

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.320
came out of that research group
during that golden period.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.150
In fact, his name appears
on virtually none of them,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.060
except in the
acknowledgement section.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.780
The worldly success
of scientists

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.580
is charged for
promotion or honors

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.830
by their published papers.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.330
Mike did not rate
highly on this index.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.950
But if he had consented to
add his name to his students'

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.180
publications as readily as
modern supervisors insist

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.190
on putting their names on papers
to which they contribute much

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.280
less, Mike would have been
a conventionally successful

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.600
scientist, lauded with
conventional honors.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.890
As it is, he was a brilliantly
successful scientist,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.680
in a far deeper and truer sense.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.160
And I think we know which kind
of scientist we really admire.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.320
Oxford sadly lost
him to Australia.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.990
Years later in Melbourne,
at a party for me

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.490
as visiting lecturer, I was
standing, probably rather

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.910
stiffly, with a
drink in my hand.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.050
Suddenly, a familiar
figure shot into the room,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.120
in a hurry as ever.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.530
The rest of us were in suits,
but not this familiar figure.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.970
The years vanished away.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.654
Everything was the same.

00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:44.570
Though he must been well
into his 60s by then,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.920
he seemed still
to be in his 30s,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:52.000
the glow of boyish enthusiasm,
even the red sweater.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.490
Next day, he drove
me to the coast

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.060
to see his beloved penguins,
stopping on the way

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:00.230
to look at giant Australian
earthworms, many feet long.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.600
We tired the Sun with talking.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200
Not, I think, about old
times and old friends,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.080
and certainly not
about ambition,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.740
grant getting, and
papers in "Nature."

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.060
But about new science
and new ideas.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.300
It was a perfect day,
the last day I saw him.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.760
We may know other scientists
as intelligent as Mike Cullen,

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.890
though not many.

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:29.400
We may know other scientists
who were as generous in support,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.350
though vanishing few.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.510
But I declare that we have no
nobody who had so much to give,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.100
combined with so much
generosity in giving it.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.060
From Oxford, I moved
on to Berkeley,

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.510
where I spent two
years as a very

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.780
junior assistant
professor, who loved it.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.530
But was then lured
back to Oxford,

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.370
where I became a
university lecturer

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.390
and eventually wrote
"The Selfish Gene,"

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.910
after quite a while
there at Oxford.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.240
Throughout the book, I
tried to put, in addition

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.770
to just stories about my
life and the people I knew,

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.220
I tried to put little
asides, perhaps little

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.810
scientific thoughts.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.350
And I want now to
read a couple of them.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.340
They really are asides.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.350
They could have come
anywhere, almost.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.520
The first is about--
actually the first two--

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.520
are about the luck that we
all have in being here at all.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.876
And I introduce it in
the very first part

00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:40.160
of the book, where I'm
talking about my ancestors,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.810
including one Clinton George
Augustus Dawkins, 1808 to '71.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.920
He was the British
consul in Venice

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.830
and he was there during
the war against Austria.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.900
I have a cannonball
in my possession,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.980
sitting on a plinth, bearing an
inscription on a brass plate.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.150
I don't know who's is
the authorial voice

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.130
and I don't know
how reliable it is.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.160
But for what it is worth,
here is my translation

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.070
from French, then the
language of diplomacy.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.420
One night, when he was
in bed, a cannonball

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.080
penetrated the bed covers
and passed between his legs,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.915
but happily did him no more
than superficial damage.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.620
This narrow escape of my
ancestor's vital parts

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.630
took place before he
was to put them to use.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.990
And it is tempting to
attribute my own existence

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.600
to a stroke of ballistic luck.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.750
A few inches closer to the fork
of Shakespeare's radish and--

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.980
But actually, my
existence, and yours,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.380
and the postman's, hangs from
a far narrower thread of luck

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.260
than that.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.200
We owe it to the precise timing
and placing of everything

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.490
that ever happened since
the universe began.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.350
The incident of a cannonball
is only a dramatic example

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.620
of a much more
general phenomenon.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.550
As I put it before,
if the second dinosaur

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.630
to the left of the tall Cycad
tree had not happened to sneeze

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.420
and thereby failed to catch the
tiny shrew-like ancestor of all

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.240
the mammals, we would
none of us be here.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.360
We all can regard ourselves
as exquisitely improbable.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.900
But here, in a triumph
of hindsight, we are.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.380
And that theme of being lucky
to be here I come back to

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.150
in the very last chapter, which
is called "Looking Back Along

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.090
the Path," in which I
tried to talk about all

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.980
the different things
I described in my life

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.180
and say what would
have happened if they

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.460
had been a bit
different, if things

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.501
had happened differently?

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.640
What if Alois
Schicklgruber had happened

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.320
to sneeze at a
particular moment, rather

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.230
than some other
particular moment

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:11.340
during any year before mid-1888,
when his son, Adolf Hitler,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.090
was conceived?

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.340
You may know that Hitler's
real surname was Schicklgruber.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:22.720
Heil Schicklgruber doesn't
have the same ring, does it?

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.640
Obviously, I have
not the faintest idea

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.920
of the exact sequence
of events involved.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.910
And there are surely
no historical records

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.280
of Herr Schicklgruber's
sternutations,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.830
but I'm confident that a
change as trivial as a sneeze,

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.450
in say 1858, would have been
more than enough to alter

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.140
the course of history.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.330
The evil omen sperm
that engendered

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.020
Adolf Hitler was one
of countless billions

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.820
produced during
his father's life.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.250
And the same goes for his
two grandfathers, four

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.010
great grandfathers,
and so on back.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.056
It is not only plausible,
but I think certain,

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.390
that a sneeze many years
before Hitler's conception

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.820
would have had knock-on
effects sufficient to derail

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.260
the trivial circumstance that
one particular sperm, that one

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
particular egg, thereby
changing the entire course

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.730
of the 20th century,
including my existence.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.450
Of course, I'm not denying that
something like the Second World

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.079
War might well have happened
even without Hitler.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.079
Nor am I saying that Hitler's
evil madness was inevitably

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.790
ordained by his genes.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.470
With a different
upbringing, Hitler

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.619
might have turned out good,
or at least uninfluential.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.640
But certainly, his
very existence,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.730
and the war as it
turned out, depended

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.410
upon the fortunate-- well,
unfortunate-- happenstance

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.525
of a particular sperm's luck.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.510
And I end that with a
poem from Aldous Huxley.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.240
A million million spermatozoa
All of them alive;

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.030
Out of their cataclysm but one
poor Noah Dare hope to survive.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.220
And of that billion minus one
Might have been Shakespeare,

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.330
another Newton, a new
Donne-- But the One was Me.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.280
Shame to have ousted
your betters thus,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.250
Taking ark while the
others remained outside!

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.230
Better for all of us,
froward Homunculus,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.545
if you'd quietly died!

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.020
Well, I was told
to stop at 1:30.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.290
So I think maybe I'll stop and
take questions at that point.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.800
Would that be a good idea?

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.300
RAY KURTZWEIL: So that's a
very interesting thought.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.630
I've had that thought of
the incredible improbability

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.100
of my own existence.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.960
So I wonder what you thought is
on the incredible improbability

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.650
of our universe having a
standard model with these 15

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.870
or so constants, which is
so precisely what they need

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.960
to be to allow for a universe
that encodes information, which

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.080
is the enabling
property for evolution

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.997
to be at all possible?

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:52.871
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:18:52.871 --> 00:18:54.370
It's a very interesting point.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.590
Not all physicists
accept that argument.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.750
Victor Stenger,
for example, says

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.100
that actually the alleged
improbability of the universe

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.700
is less than many people think.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.670
But assuming that it's right
and that we have these 15 knobs,

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.740
that each one represents
a fundamental constant

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.010
and if any one of those knobs
had been tuned ever so slightly

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.790
different, the
universe as we know

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.319
it would not have been possible.

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:22.610
Galaxies would not have formed.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.151
Perhaps, stars would
not have formed.

00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:26.200
Therefore, the elements
would not have formed.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.990
Therefore, chemistry
wasn't impossible.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.360
Therefore, life wouldn't have
been possible, and so on.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.985
So there's a temptation to see
the universe as a put-up job

00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:41.920
and to see a divine creator
as a divine knob twiddler, who

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.970
twiddled these knobs to exactly
the right value in order

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:52.200
to foreshadow, foreordain,
life, perhaps even human life.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.730
I find that a deeply
unsatisfying idea because

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.600
of course it leaves totally
unexplained the divine knob

00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.790
twiddler himself.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.440
You need exactly
the same problem.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.390
If you can magic
him into existence,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.950
you might as well just magically
the fine-tuning into existence.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:12.040
Other physicists have resorted
to a multiverse theory, where

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.070
they propose that this
universe, our visible universe,

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.290
is only one of a bubbling
foam of universes.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.270
We are in one bubble.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.270
And the other
bubbles in the foam

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.020
have different
physical constants.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.900
So there are billions of
universes in the multiverse,

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.590
all with different values of
the physical constants, all

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.450
with different
settings of the knobs.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.570
And with hindsight,
since we're here,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.300
we obviously had to be in
one of the bubbles, however

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.830
small a minority, which had
the right physical constants

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.710
to give rise to galaxies, and
stars, and chemistry, and life.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.770
That's the anthropic principle.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.100
It's obviously a
lot more satisfying

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.300
than the divine
knob twiddler idea.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.960
Other physicists say
that the 15 knobs,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.570
or how many ever there are,
are not free to vary anyway.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.620
There's only one
way for them to be.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.160
But the standard
model of physics

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.940
doesn't yet tell us
what that way is.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.160
And we need a better physics,
which will one day tell us

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.460
that the values of the
fundamental constants

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.320
could only be that way.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.920
As Einstein put it,
rather unfortunately,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.900
in unfortunate
language, Einstein

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.450
said what really interests
me is whether God

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.729
had any choice in
setting up the universe?

00:21:28.729 --> 00:21:31.395
What he meant, of course, was is
there only one kind of universe

00:21:31.395 --> 00:21:34.250
that is possible to
have or are there

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.350
lots of alternative ways in
which a universe might exist,

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.510
in which case the
multiverse theory works?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.010
OK.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.426
I probably said
enough about that.

00:21:43.426 --> 00:21:44.717
The next question?

00:21:44.717 --> 00:21:45.704
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.370
Something very
interesting I've noticed,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.690
I mean this is about
belief in a deity.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.640
What I've usually seen is
that some of the people

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.519
who are exposed to
natural sciences,

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:57.310
especially through high
school and college,

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.190
they kind of start to understand
that-- I mean at least go away

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.430
from faith in a deity.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.600
Interestingly, I've
seen several scientists,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.370
usually in abstract mathematics
and sometimes computer science,

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.710
who actually, as
the kind of grew up,

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.170
they start believing in
maybe the abstract idea that

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.430
is kind of similar to what
they've been experiencing.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.270
I was wondering what's
your thoughts on that

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.040
and what do you have
to say to those people?

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.390
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.080
Some research has been done
on fellows of the National

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.850
Academy of Sciences
in the United States,

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.050
the elite scientists
of the United States

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.940
and the equivalent
elite scientists

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.880
of the British Commonwealth,
the Royal Society.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.280
And these two
independent studies

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.250
have both come up
with the same result.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:52.030
That about 90% of these elite
scientists are nonbelievers.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.480
About 10% have some kind
of religious belief.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.570
And within that 10%, there is
a slightly greater tendency

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.450
for physical scientists
and mathematical scientists

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.180
to be believers than for
biological scientists,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.340
which agrees with
the observation

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.440
that you've just made.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.340
Quite often when you meet
a religious scientist,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:18.500
it's worth asking what
he really does believe.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.690
It often turns out to be a
kind of Einsteinian religion.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.230
I mean Einstein did not
believe in a personal god.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.270
Einstein used the
language of religion,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.330
used the language
of God, to refer

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.996
to that which we
don't yet understand.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:35.710
And he had a deep
and fitting reverence

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.820
for that which we
don't understand.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.930
And I think many
of us would agree

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.020
that we feel-- some
might call it spiritual

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.710
when we think about the enormous
amount that we don't yet know,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.460
the deep mysteries of
existence, the deep mysteries

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.970
of the universe.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.210
But that's hugely
different from believing

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.440
in a personal god, the god
of Abraham, the god of Moses,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.740
the god of Jesus,
the god of Muhammad.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.260
And I think it does
a disservice to use

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.030
the same language
for those two things.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.480
As to why biologists
should be slightly more

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.000
likely to be nonreligious
than physicists,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.510
I think that might
come from the fact

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.420
that Darwin's theory of
evolution by natural selection

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:27.320
is deeply anti-design in the
sense of deliberate design

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.040
by a creative intelligence.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.460
If you think about it, the
great achievement of Darwin

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.680
was to show that we don't
need a creative intelligence.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.610
What Darwin showed is
that entities complicated

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.130
enough to be creative designers,
things like a human brain--

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.120
the human brain is
perhaps the only one

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.690
we know-- entities
complex enough

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.620
to do that don't suddenly
get magicked into existence.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.270
They come about through a
very slow, gradual process,

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.170
exactly like the carving
out of the Grand Canyon,

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.700
as Ray Kurtzweil said.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:11.400
So biologists are predisposed
to be hostile to any attempt

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.100
to smuggle in an
intelligence by magic

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.510
because we know how
intelligence comes about.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.560
We know how it comes
about that brains

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.290
exist which are
capable of designing

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.180
planes, and cameras,
and computers.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.320
So that may be why there's
a slightly greater bias.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.040
But all scientists of these two
elite groups, the Royal Society

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.220
and the National Academy,
only about 10% are religious.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.480
And even they, one
wonders whether they're

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.880
religious in the
Einsteinian sense, rather

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.628
than the personal god sense.

00:25:42.628 --> 00:25:45.299
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:45.840
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.080
You've done all
kinds of great works.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.829
I'm sorry to follow
up a religion question

00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:50.800
with another religion
question, but--

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.049
RICHARD DAWKINS: They
usually are, I have to say.

00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:56.340
RAY KURTZWEIL: This might be
a gross oversimplification

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.964
or perhaps even a
misinterpretation of your work.

00:25:58.964 --> 00:26:01.130
But something that struck
me as one of the arguments

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.710
in "The God Delusion"
is sort of we

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.840
can as biological
entities, conscious ones,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.180
realize maybe the
pull towards religion

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.650
and how that affects us and
choose to not follow that.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.130
And I'm wondering how
you would compare that

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.160
with other things that might
be a part of our nature,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.660
sort of chemically
and physically as

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.452
biological beings, what
that means to how we react

00:26:22.452 --> 00:26:24.160
to other things, in
addition to religion,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.160
such as sexual desire, or
love, and other aspects that

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.322
might be considered "better?"

00:26:29.322 --> 00:26:30.280
RICHARD DAWKINS: Right.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.700
So I think I may have
got the question.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.980
Things like sexual
desire are built into us

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.550
by natural selection for reasons
we can clearly understand.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.150
I mean obviously
natural selection

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.025
is all about the surviving
of genes and genes

00:26:44.025 --> 00:26:45.570
get passed on by reproduction.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.760
And we need sex
for reproduction.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.340
And so we have rules
of thumb in our brain

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.195
which make us lust
after the opposite sex.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.630
Other things, like religion,
might come from something

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.800
a bit analogous to that.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.780
I mean I don't think religion
has a direct genetic survival

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.440
value in the way that
sexual lust does.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.500
But perhaps another
way to put it

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.150
would be that there are
psychological predispositions

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.560
which under the right
cultural circumstances

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.730
manifest themselves as religion.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.620
And I suppose you
could say in a way

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.470
that sexual lust, under the
right cultural conditions,

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:36.110
manifests itself as great
poetry like "Romeo and Juliet."

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.760
So it's not all that different.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.500
The kind of psychological
predisposition I'm thinking of

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.920
is well, because we're
very social animals,

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.830
we have a natural tendency
to calculate debts

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:57.580
to others, things that we owe
to others because reciprocation

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.640
is so important for
good Darwinian reasons.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.090
And so we are aware
of who owes us what.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.250
We are aware of whom
we owe things to.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.240
And when something
really good happens,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.420
we swim so much in a
sea of other people

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.619
that we naturally think
we need to thank somebody

00:28:14.619 --> 00:28:16.160
because so much of
what happens to us

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.380
is because of
social interactions.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.240
And so we feel a need to thank.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.390
And often there really
is somebody to thank.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.022
Often, it really
is another person

00:28:26.022 --> 00:28:28.480
who is responsible for the good
thing that's happened to us

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.670
and so we thank them.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.950
But when there's no other
person to be responsible

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:38.100
for-- to be grateful to, if
say the weather turns out

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.270
nice for our barbecue-
take a trivial example--

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.280
we still feel the
impulse to thank.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.510
But there's nobody to thank.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.830
I mean nobody actually called
the weather to be nice.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.060
So you thank God.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.570
So maybe that's
a small component

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.080
of the psychological
predisposition

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.450
that led to religion.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.490
Another one might
be the tendency

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.540
for children to obey and
believe their parents.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.500
In the wild state,
a child is extremely

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:13.720
vulnerable to being killed by
accident and by foolishness.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.630
So a child brain might
be naturally selected,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.160
comes into the
world preprogrammed

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.360
with the rule,
whatever else you do,

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.330
believe what your
parents tell you.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.180
If they tell you not to
go too close to the cliff,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.440
don't ask questions, just obey.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:36.620
If they tell you not to pick up
a snake, don't ask questions.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.780
Don't obey the sort of
scientific curiosity impulse.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.780
Just obey your parents.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.250
Don't touch that snake.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.010
Well, if the child
brain is preprogrammed

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.490
with that rule of thumb, obey
and believe your parents,

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.800
it has no means
of distinguishing

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.180
between good advice like
"don't touch the snake"

00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:01.150
and bad or at least
time-wasting advice like

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.680
"perform a sacrifice at
the time of the full moon"

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.550
or "pray five times a
day, facing the East."

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.630
How could the child know
which is good advice

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:11.340
and which is bad?

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.320
If it knew, it wouldn't
need the advice.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.540
It would just know.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.210
So the child brain
is preprogrammed,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:22.910
just as a computer is built, to
obey whatever instructions it's

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.530
given, in its own
machine language.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.770
And that's why computers are
vulnerable to computer viruses.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.770
A computer doesn't
have any filter

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:33.020
that says the instructions
I'm now being given

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.070
are evil instructions, designed
to wipe somebody's hard disk

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.730
and destroy their
doctoral thesis.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.110
Why do people do
that, by the way?

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.100
Can you imagine?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.590
The computer is simply built to
obey whatever instructions it's

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.110
given in the appropriate
machine language.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.550
And that's why it's vulnerable
to computer viruses.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.170
And so another way to put
what I've just suggested

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:02.120
is that religions are computer
viruses, the mind viruses.

00:31:04.862 --> 00:31:07.320
AUDIENCE: I guess just to be
blunt about it, to go forward,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.230
to follow that
analogy sort of, why

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.270
is following those
predispositions

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.650
towards religion sort of bad?

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.800
I get that impression from--
as opposed to following

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.679
say love, which might be another
biological process that we

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:21.470
follow [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.345
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:31:22.345 --> 00:31:24.622
No, I didn't mean
to say it's bad.

00:31:24.622 --> 00:31:25.330
It could be good.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.280
And I mean I'm not sure
how widely it's done,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.080
but it has been suggested
that computer viruses too

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.600
could be good.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.460
That you could-- if it
comes from anywhere,

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:41.350
it probably come from
Google actually-- the idea

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.159
that you could use the
principle of a program that

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:47.450
spreads itself, because it
spreads, because it spreads,

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.075
because it spreads,
because it contains

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:52.430
the instruction, spread
me around the internet.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.290
It could be benign.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.360
I mean you could spread a good
mind virus, a good computer

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.090
virus.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.590
So there's nothing that says
that the analogy to computer

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.750
viruses has to have to be bad.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.530
But it could be.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.360
And in some cases, I
think it probably is.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.900
At best, some of them
might be time wasting.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.530
I mean it is an awful
waste of time spending

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.985
hours on your knees praying
to some nonexistent spook.

00:32:16.985 --> 00:32:18.860
AUDIENCE: I, of course,
have another question

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.773
on atheism and religion.

00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:26.530
[LAUGHTER] So my question,
organized religion of course

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.100
has a long history of sexism.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.980
And you might expect atheism
to do better in this regard.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.640
And I think it's
true that it does.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:41.500
But organized atheism
also had several incidents

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.390
with male-dominated events,
both in terms of audience

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.580
and in terms of people speaking,
and also major incidents,

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.070
both at conferences and
in online discussions.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.010
And you yourself have been
criticized in this regard.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:01.130
And I'm wondering is there
some reason that atheism

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.160
falls victim to
the same traps as--

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.830
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well, I think
it's a very unfortunate thing

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.040
that many institutions
fall victim to.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.400
And it would be quite surprising
if atheist conferences

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.997
and atheist organizations
were completely immune to it.

00:33:14.997 --> 00:33:16.830
AUDIENCE: Is there some
way we could better?

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.420
RICHARD DAWKINS: Sorry?

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.710
AUDIENCE: Is there some
way we could do better?

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.900
Something that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.040
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.070
I mean I think we all
need to do better.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.500
I think it's pretty clear that
there's nothing particularly

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.160
bad about this in
the atheist world.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.120
But there is a need to
do better certainly.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.496
Yes, I agree.

00:33:33.496 --> 00:33:35.540
AUDIENCE: Is there some
way we could do better?

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.555
Like something we could
do differently maybe?

00:33:39.555 --> 00:33:42.020
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well, I mean
treat all human beings as

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.320
of equal worth and don't looked
down upon 50% of the population

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.635
because they happen to
have different genitals.

00:33:49.635 --> 00:33:54.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.710
AUDIENCE: So I don't have
a question about religion.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:02.141
[APPLAUSE] In your
book, you were

00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:04.140
reflecting on a bunch of
different memories, one

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.767
of them of somebody
who has passed.

00:34:05.767 --> 00:34:07.600
I was wondering if you'd
be willing to share

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.030
a memory about somebody
else who has passed,

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.300
Christopher Hitchens?

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.270
Is there any favorite
memory that you

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.786
might find useful
to share with us?

00:34:15.786 --> 00:34:17.160
RICHARD DAWKINS:
I think he was--

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.929
I mean I was a friend of his,
but only in his later life.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:25.870
I wasn't one of the early
coterie of friends like Martin

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.280
Amis, and Salman
Rushdie, and Ian McEwan.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.909
So I only met him I think after
2006, when we both published

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.570
books at around the same
time, on a similar theme.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:45.624
He was, I think, the
most spellbinding orator

00:34:45.624 --> 00:34:47.139
I ever heard.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:52.010
He was a magnificent speaker,
a beautiful, resonant voice,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.250
superbly resourceful, with
what must have been something

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.170
close to a photographic memory,
able to pull out examples

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:04.490
with great speed and to
best anybody in debate.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.310
I once wrote a
puff for him which

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.780
said something like if you are
a religious apologist invited

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.010
to have a debate with
Christopher Hitchens, decline.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.230
He was a warm, friendly man.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.010
He didn't suffer fools gladly,
but he was patient as well.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.760
I had enormous
admiration for him.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.500
I disagreed with him
on certain things.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.090
I disagreed with him over
the Iraq War, for example.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.240
He was impossible
to typecast on sort

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.000
of standard left,
right continuum.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.200
He was his own man in
that, as in so much else.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.890
His approach to atheism came
from a slightly different

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.790
direction than mine.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.650
Mine is more scientific.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.970
So for me, what
really matters is

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.050
the truth about the universe.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:02.360
And the god hypothesis,
it seems to me

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.690
to be an alternative
hypothesis about the nature

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:11.240
of the universe and its origins,
which is I think clearly false.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.500
And so for me, it's
a scientific battle.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.580
For Christopher, I think it
was more a political one.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.470
I think he saw religions
as political organizations.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:29.150
And he saw God as a
sort of divine dictator.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:36.148
And he saw the kingdom of God
as a kind of divine North Korea.

00:36:36.148 --> 00:36:39.070
Perhaps, enough of that.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.660
AUDIENCE: I was looking at
some of your personal details

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.660
earlier.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.480
And was surprised to see that
you're married to the best

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.914
"Doctor Who" companion ever.

00:36:48.914 --> 00:36:50.080
RICHARD DAWKINS: Here, here.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.880
AUDIENCE: And I'd
like to know are you

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.050
a big fan of "Doctor Who?"

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.710
RICHARD DAWKINS: Well, I became
a big fan of "Doctor Who"

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:59.167
only after I met her actually,
I'm ashamed to admit.

00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:00.250
I'd heard of "Doctor Who."

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.940
But I'd never actually
watched any of the episodes.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:10.280
And then after we married,
I did watch, not DVDs,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.190
it was-- what do you call them?

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.363
Tapes, yeah.

00:37:13.363 --> 00:37:17.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.890
And I did become a
fan of those tapes.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:20.910
I loved them.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.950
Not least actually,
because in her time,

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:27.750
which was the Tom Baker
era, who many people regard

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.290
as the definitive
Doctor as well,

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.540
the script was written
by Douglas Adams.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.980
And was consequently witty,
satirical, and appreciated

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.580
on different-- I mean it
was a children's program.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.740
And it's appreciated
much by children.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.740
But also, there
was a witty irony,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.915
which was appreciated
by adults as well.

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:54.360
And that's got Douglas
Adams written all over it.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.460
And you can appreciate Douglas's
episodes of "Doctor Who,"

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.730
which included the Tom
Baker and Lalla Ward

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:09.240
times as beautiful satire,
of the same kind of satire

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.430
as he was to use also in
the "Hitchhiker's Guide"

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.340
and in his Dirk Gently series.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.470
So making science
into comedy-- laughing

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.310
at, in a sort of genial,
benevolent, satirical way,

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:30.850
scientific ideas-- and
satirizing contemporary life

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.170
was something that he
did supremely well.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:37.639
And that got into "Doctor
Who" at that time.

00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:38.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.670
I personally
believe that we live

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.060
in a universe which is
governed by physical laws.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.160
That's it's not
necessary to have

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.210
spirits or anything like that.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:58.320
I understand that other
people, their behavior

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.320
may be explainable
using physical processes

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.640
and that I should apply
that to myself also.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.280
But I'm struggling at
the moment with where

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.220
does this kind of
sensation come from,

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.140
my consciousness, my
awareness of myself?

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:21.140
And I don't really have an
answer for that at the moment.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.202
So I wonder if you could help?

00:39:24.202 --> 00:39:29.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.620
RICHARD DAWKINS: I mean
ditto, ditto, ditto.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.920
I am as mystified as you.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.580
I feel exactly the same way.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:43.900
I am aware that my brain is the
product of natural selection,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.000
evolution by natural selection.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.460
And it is a machine.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.230
It's an on-board computer.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.700
It's helped my
ancestors to survive

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.320
on the African plains, in
the Pleistocene and before.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.660
And somehow an emergent
property of that large brain

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.350
is the feeling of subjective
consciousness, which

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:07.120
makes me know that
I'm me and not you.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.190
Makes me believe that
you have a personality

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.670
and you have a consciousness,
which is similar to mine,

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.320
that I can never actually
get inside your mind,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.430
nor can you get inside mine.

00:40:18.674 --> 00:40:20.090
That doesn't make
you a solipsist.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.866
It's the exact
opposite, of course.

00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:23.240
A solipsist is
someone who thinks

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.990
that he's the only
person that there is

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:30.230
and everybody else is, as
it were, part of his dream.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.420
There was a nice story
by Bertrand Russell.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.700
That he had a letter from a lady
who said, Dear Lord Russell,

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.940
I'm delighted to hear
that you are a solipsist.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.980
There are so few of
us around these days.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:51.350
I suppose that people
like you and me

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:56.470
have to think that something
about making a brain which

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:00.710
is good at navigating through
the world in a versatile way,

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.520
coping with all sorts of
different things that happen,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.720
not moving through
a stereotype world

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.420
like some computer programs,
which can only navigate

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.447
through a world of
colored bricks or a table

00:41:11.447 --> 00:41:12.530
or something of that sort.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.530
We have to navigate through
a very versatile world.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:20.050
Above all, we have to navigate
through a world in which

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.590
the dominant things that we see,
we encounter are other people.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.910
Like ourselves.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:30.280
We have to interact with sexual
partners, with business rivals,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.630
with business companions,
with co-workers,

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:37.090
with possible enemies,
with children.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:38.920
All the time, we're
surrounded by people

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.630
and we have to
interact with them.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.670
I suppose you could
say that something

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.310
about needing to interact
with other people

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:54.530
might facilitate the setting
up of a model in the head.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:58.350
We all have models in the head
of the world in which we move.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.910
I mean when we see
something, what we're doing

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.435
is constructing a model in
the head of that something.

00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:07.191
And you can show this
with visual illusions.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.440
When you construct a similar
model of the other people

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.610
you're having to deal with
and you have to put yourself

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:17.510
in their place, maybe something
about the model of other people

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.054
that you have to make
necessitates the generation

00:42:21.054 --> 00:42:22.220
of subjective consciousness.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.290
But that doesn't
really do it, does it?

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:31.120
That's sort of based on an
idea of Nicholas Humphrey.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.870
Daniel Dennett has
more advanced ideas

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:36.900
in his book,
"Consciousness Explained."

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:41.252
And I think I better not
go on too much with that.

00:42:41.252 --> 00:42:43.210
But you could look at
"Consciousness Explained"

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.600
and see if that does it for you.

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.866
There's other people who
are attempting to do it.

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.490
I sort of feel it's
one of those things

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:54.340
that maybe one day it'll
seem awfully obvious

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.860
and how could we be so
stupid as not to realize it.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.690
But at present, it does
seem to be a deep mystery.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.740
Sorry about that.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.610
AUDIENCE: So I read
the big footnotes

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:06.020
to "The Selfish Gene."

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.020
And one of my
takeaways from it is

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.030
that it's really not
about being selfish.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:18.420
I was absolutely uplifted by how
much cooperation helps people.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:23.470
And somehow like the
reasoning in this book kind of

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.840
flipped me over.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.630
So my plea would be, could
you write more articles

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.020
with maybe better,
catchier titles?

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:39.730
And my suggestion would be-- I
don't know who to attribute it,

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:44.390
but I love this one,
Snuggle for Survival.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:45.560
RICHARD DAWKINS: OK.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.060
Thank you.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.320
Yes.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.640
I mean you're absolutely right.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.320
That the central message
of "The Selfish Gene"

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.420
is not that we are selfish.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.450
Still less is it that
we should be selfish.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.160
It's actually mostly
a book about altruism,

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.210
snuggling if you wish
to put it that way.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.290
And it is true that title-- I
think most of my other titles

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.610
have been OK, actually,
"The Blind Watchmaker,"

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.560
"Unweaving the Rainbow,"
"Climbing Mount Improbable,"

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.430
and so on.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:17.640
I did show an early
pair of chapters

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.470
to a well-known London
publisher before I gave it

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.720
the title, "The Selfish Gene."

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.670
He said you can't call
it "The Selfish Gene."

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.270
It's a down word.
"Selfish" is a down word.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.650
Call it The Immortal Gene.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.440
And that would have
been good, I think,

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.600
because it does also convey
another aspect of it.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.490
The reason why
natural selection can

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:37.530
be said to work at
the level of the gene

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.760
is that genes are immortal,
or potentially immortal.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.990
And therefore, in the
long-term, survival of genes

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.500
is what really matters.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.410
And if they were not
potentially immortal,

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.910
it wouldn't matter which one
survived and which ones didn't.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.650
So "the immortal gene," it's
a phrase I use in the book.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:55.170
And that possibly
would have been better.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.670
I also suggested
in the book that it

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:00.064
could have been called
The Slightly Selfish Big

00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:02.230
Bit of Chromosome, With the
Even More Selfish Little

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.980
Bit of Chromosome.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.130
RAY KURTZWEIL: Let me ask
you to actually follow up

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.330
on this last question.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:14.250
You described religion
as a set of mind viruses.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.940
Another word for
mind virus is meme,

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:21.830
which is your I
think very apt word.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.510
And some of those memes
could be bad or good.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.610
And I think one of the
good memes from religion

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.260
is the golden rule, which
is a synonym for altruism,

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.250
which you just alluded to.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:36.480
And you had a very interesting
thesis in "The Selfish Gene"

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.290
about how altruism originates
or evolves in nature.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.970
So maybe you could
sum up by sharing

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.410
your view of how
altruism evolves?

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.990
RICHARD DAWKINS: Yes.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.140
The golden rule, of course,
is terribly important.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.930
I think it would be unfair
to attribute it to religion.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.410
It's true that many of the
great religions have adopted it.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.800
But I think it actually does
have older roots than that.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.591
And that's really what
you're asking about,

00:45:59.591 --> 00:46:02.240
which is the evolutionary
roots of the golden rule.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.880
Do as you would be done
by, so unto others as you

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.180
would have them do unto you.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.460
Altruism has two main
evolutionary roots.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.300
One is that.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.010
One is reciprocation.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:19.490
One is the survival value of
doing good turns because others

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.969
may do good turns to you.

00:46:21.969 --> 00:46:24.010
And the mathematical theory
of that, the best way

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.670
to approach it, is the
mathematical theory of games.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.600
And the theory has
been well worked out.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.350
And it does indeed work in
an evolutionary context.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.390
And a lot of "The
Selfish Gene" is actually

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:41.190
about the game theory of--
well, game theory generally,

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.650
including aggression
and reciprocation.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:48.950
The other main source
of altruism is kinship.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.600
It's easy to see nowadays--
it wasn't originally--

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.360
but nowadays, we can
see that any gene that

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.430
makes an individual animal
behave altruistically

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:02.190
towards genetic relatives
has, other things being equal,

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.820
a good chance of
propagating itself

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.965
because those genetic
relatives statistically

00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:09.590
are likely to contain
copies of the same gene.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.550
And so anyone can see that
that's true for offspring.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.720
What W.D. Hamilton
showed is that it's also

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.250
true of collateral
kin, like nephews

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:22.190
and nieces, and
cousins, and siblings.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:27.630
Well, humans probably
spent a large part

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:33.210
of their ancestral
life in small bands,

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:37.180
perhaps rather like baboons,
in which they were surrounded

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.660
by a group, a clan,
who would have been

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.385
mostly cousins,
mostly relatives.

00:47:43.385 --> 00:47:47.420
And therefore, there would have
been a genetic kinship pressure

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.530
to be altruistic towards
everybody in your band, which

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.750
pretty much meant
everybody you ever meet.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:57.860
And at the same time, since
you meet the same people

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.796
over and over
again in your band,

00:47:59.796 --> 00:48:02.420
you're going to meet them again
and again throughout your life,

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.180
that is perfect raw
material for reciprocation.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.740
It's perfect conditions
for the evolution

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.460
of reciprocation, reciprocal
altruism, the golden rule

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.450
in one way, putting it.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:19.340
So the fact that humans went
around in limited bands,

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:24.870
clans, fostered altruism
in these two different ways

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.630
and provided what
could be called a lust

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:32.110
to be nice, which was
analogous to the lust for sex.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.390
The lust for sex worked
because before the days

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:40.800
of contraception, sex tended
to be followed by babies.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.120
Nowadays, sex very often
is not followed by babies

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.090
because we're all
wise to contraception.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.320
And so we still enjoy sex, even
though we know perfectly well

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.340
cognitively that
we've separated it,

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.630
we've dissociated it from
its Darwinian function.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.969
But we still have the lust.

00:48:57.969 --> 00:48:59.260
And why on earth, shouldn't we?

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.600
Because the lust was
built into our brains

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.840
at a time when contraception
had not been invented.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.360
Natural selection doesn't
have cognitive wisdom.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.820
Natural selection simply builds
in clockwork rules of thumb.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.810
The lust for sex is just
such a clockwork rule.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:19.530
And the lust to be nice is also.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:21.480
Because it evolved
at a time when we did

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.330
live in small groups.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.120
Nowadays, we don't
live in small groups.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.560
We live in large
cities, where we are not

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.050
surrounded by cousins.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.509
And we're not
surrounded by people

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.550
we're going to meet again
and again in our lives.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.880
We're surrounded by
perfect strangers.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.820
But the lust to be nice is still
there, just as the lust for sex

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.010
is still there.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.290
The lust to be nice still works.

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:45.280
We still feel empathy
towards somebody in distress.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.730
We still feel we want to
do a good turn to people

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.600
who is neither related
to us, nor in a position

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.670
to give the good turn back.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.870
But it's there.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:55.910
And we feel it.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.440
It's an extremely
powerful emotion.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.050
There are a few
people, and we call

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.730
them psychopaths,
who don't have it.

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:03.930
But most of us do have it.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.180
Most of us do have empathy.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.160
Most of us do have pity
for people in misfortune.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.880
Most of us give to
charity and so on.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.190
So I think that
would be my attempt

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:17.440
at a Darwinian explanation
for the origin of altruism.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.010
And it becomes, of course,
much more sophisticated

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.900
due to cultural evolution,
which you can if you wish,

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.650
interpret in terms of
memes, not in what it does.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.720
Thank you very much.
