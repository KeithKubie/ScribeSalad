00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That is frustrating. Somehow the maximum likelihood estimator seems reckless.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have almost no data, and it comes up with these really extreme guesses

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of what the underlying probability is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I would submit this as unintuitive.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you and I flip a coin and it comes up heads,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we would not say obviously this coin always comes up heads.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We would say maybe a little bit more frequently but let's flip it more often.

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You're not yet convinced there might not be tails as there is in this case.
