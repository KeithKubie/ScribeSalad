[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.270
PRANSHU PATNI: Sometimes
it's the simplest things

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.460
that generate big
ideas that actually

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.840
lead to massive change.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.080
A few years ago, my husband
and co-founder, Nishant,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.300
was living and backpacking
around China for a few months.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.740
He faced a lot of trouble trying
to order food as a vegetarian.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.290
So knowing Mandarin
was critical for him.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.150
The problem that
Nishant faced actually

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.070
led us to imagine
the kind of problems

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.500
that language learners
around the globe face.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.350
So we thought, why not
create something innovative

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.300
which could be heavily
accessible, affordable,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.940
and effective for people to
be able to learn languages?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.900
Almost 80% of India is in
the productive age group.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.230
They can get jobs, but
they fail to do so because

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.630
of English becoming a barrier.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.341
So it's extremely
important for them,

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:03.340
and it's life changing
for them to know English.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.170
SIDDIQUE MALIK: My
name is Siddique Malik.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.660
I'm from Mumbai.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.340
When I retired from my job, I
decided to do something useful.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.130
That's why I joined
Hello English.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.130
I believe that there are
so many kids around us.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.340
They want to learn English.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
Joining Hello English
got me enough confidence

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.990
to go to my hometown and
teach the poor and needy.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.640
That's my aim.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.444
I am here in Kochi
because of that.

00:01:38.444 --> 00:01:40.590
I [INAUDIBLE] my English a lot.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.750
Before that I was
afraid of speaking

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.760
English in front of others.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.600
But now those worries
have gone away.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.310
Hello, children.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.730
How are you?

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.750
What is your name?

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.000
APP (FEMALE VOICE): I'm Pujar.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.920
SIDDIQUE MALIK: Very good.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.312
CHILD: My name is Siddhar.

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:01.394
CLASS: My name is Siddhar.

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:02.560
SIDDIQUE MALIK: That's good.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.240
Hello.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.575
Hello means?

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:05.200
CLASS: Namaste.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
SIDDIQUE MALIK: Namaste.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400
English is good for
higher education.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.480
It s a key for a better life.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.810
This is good.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.391
Very good.

00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:14.890
Very good.

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:20.780
PRANSHU PATNI: Starting
out, we never dreamt

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.380
that we would reach the kind of
scale that we are at right now.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.215
Over 30 million users are
currently using the app.

00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:30.050
We're bigger than any
university or school that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.040
has existed for ages in India.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.850
And Google Play gives
us insights and data

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.490
into the behavior of these
users so we can reach out

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.020
to an even larger set of users.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780
What inspires us as a
team and what motivates us

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.360
the most is when
we hear users talk

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.700
about how learning
English with the app

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.960
has impacted them in
such a positive way.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.920
That inspires us to keep going.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250
That inspires us to
make a bigger impact.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.980
SIDDIQUE MALIK: I believe
what we give to the world,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.070
that you will take
with you when you die.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.220
So I'll do that, that's what.
