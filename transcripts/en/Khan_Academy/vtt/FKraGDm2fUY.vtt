00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.101
- What I hope to do in this video

00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:05.340
is a proof of the famous and useful

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.181
and somewhat elegant and
sometimes infamous chain rule.

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.342
And, if you've been
following some of the videos

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:16.122
on "differentiability implies continuity",

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.282
and what happens to a continuous function

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.962
as our change in x, if x is
our independent variable,

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:24.722
as that approaches zero, how the change

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.482
in our function approaches zero,

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:31.182
then this proof is actually
surprisingly straightforward,

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:32.522
so let's just get to it, and this is just

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:35.702
one of many proofs of the chain rule.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.781
So the chain rule tells us that if

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.343
y is a function of u,

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.356
which is a function of x,

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.702
and we want to figure out
the derivative of this,

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:53.162
so we want to differentiate
this with respect to x,

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.523
so we're gonna differentiate
this with respect to x,

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:58.143
we could write this as the derivative

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:00.343
of y with respect to x,

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:02.262
which is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.003
of y with respect to u,

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.582
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.263
This is what the chain rule tells us.

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:15.718
But how do we actually
go about proving it?

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.203
Well we just have to remind ourselves

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:21.315
that the derivative of
y with respect to x...

00:01:21.423 --> 00:01:24.866
the derivative of y with respect to x,

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:29.866
is equal to the limit as
delta x approaches zero

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:35.026
of change in y over change in x.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.355
Now we can do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation here

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:41.058
to introduce a change
in u, so let's do that.

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:43.743
So this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:43.743 --> 00:01:48.056
the limit as delta x approaches zero,

00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:51.059
and I'm gonna rewrite
this part right over here.

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:53.387
I'm gonna essentially divide and multiply

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:55.183
by a change in u.

00:01:55.183 --> 00:01:58.442
So I could rewrite this as delta y

00:01:58.442 --> 00:02:00.638
over delta u

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:04.802
times delta u, whoops...

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:09.741
times delta u over delta x.

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:11.301
Change in y over change in u,

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:13.681
times change in u over change in x.

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.322
And you can see, these are
just going to be numbers here,

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:19.349
so our change in u, this
would cancel with that,

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.202
and you'd be left with
change in y over change x,

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:24.342
which is exactly what we had here.

00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:28.202
So nothing earth-shattering just yet.

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:31.105
But what's this going to be equal to?

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.114
What's this going to be equal to?

00:02:33.114 --> 00:02:34.442
Well the limit of the product

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:36.328
is the same thing as the
product of the limit,

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:39.021
so this is going to be the same thing as

00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:42.322
the limit as delta x

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.861
approaches zero of,
and I'll color-coat it,

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.141
of this stuff, of delta y

00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.434
over delta u, times--

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.742
maybe I'll put parentheses around it,

00:02:56.971 --> 00:02:59.728
times the limit...

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:03.247
the limit as delta x approaches zero,

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.796
delta x approaches zero,

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:08.492
of this business.

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:10.626
So let me put some parentheses around it.

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:14.154
Delta u over delta x.

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.855
So what does this simplify to?

00:03:16.855 --> 00:03:18.776
Well this right over here,
this is the definition,

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.696
and if we're assuming, in
order for this to even be true,

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:24.955
we have to assume that u and y

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.235
are differentiable at x.

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:29.955
So we assume, in order
for this to be true,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:31.497
we're assuming...

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:37.717
we're assuming y comma
u are differentiable...

00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:44.322
are differentiable at x.

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:46.001
And remember also, if
they're differentiable at x,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.062
that means they're continuous at x.

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.662
But if u is differentiable at x,

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:53.371
then this limit exists, and
this is the derivative of...

00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:56.442
this is u prime of x, or du/dx,

00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:58.542
so this right over here...

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:02.775
we can rewrite as du/dx,

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:04.903
I think you see where this is going.

00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:06.703
Now this right over here,

00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:08.743
just looking at it the way
it's written out right here,

00:04:08.743 --> 00:04:12.043
we can't quite yet call this dy/du,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:15.123
because this is the limit
as delta x approaches zero,

00:04:15.123 --> 00:04:17.883
not the limit as delta u approaches zero.

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.323
But we just have to remind ourselves

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:22.091
the results from, probably,
the previous video

00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.902
depending on how you're watching it,

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:26.263
which is, if we have a function u

00:04:26.263 --> 00:04:29.362
that is continuous at a point,

00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:31.703
that, as delta x approaches zero,

00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:33.816
delta u approaches zero.

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.544
So we can actually rewrite this...

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:40.144
we can rewrite this right over here,

00:04:40.144 --> 00:04:41.843
instead of saying delta x approaches zero,

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:43.384
that's just going to have the effect,

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:45.284
because u is differentiable at x,

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.124
which means it's continuous at x,

00:04:47.124 --> 00:04:49.943
that means that delta u
is going to approach zero.

00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:52.637
As our change in x gets smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:53.845
our change in u is going to get

00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:56.166
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:57.885
So we can rewrite this,

00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:00.425
as our change in u approaches zero,

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.024
and when we rewrite it like that,

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:04.225
well then this is just dy/du.

00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:08.365
This is just dy, the derivative
of y, with respect to u.

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.845
So just like that, if we assume

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:14.185
y and u are differentiable at x,

00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:16.165
or you could say that
y is a function of u,

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.485
which is a function of x,

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.381
we've just shown, in
fairly simple algebra here,

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:23.044
and using some assumptions about

00:05:23.044 --> 00:05:25.225
differentiability and continuity,

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:27.004
that it is indeed the case

00:05:27.004 --> 00:05:29.346
that the derivative of y with respect to x

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:32.205
is equal to the derivative
of y with respect to u

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:35.165
times the derivative
of u with respect to x.

00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:37.844
Hopefully you find that convincing.
