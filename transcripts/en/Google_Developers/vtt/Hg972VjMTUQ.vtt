PETER LUBBERS: Hi.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.589
I'm Peter, and this is Jocelyn.

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:04.630
And we're with the Google
Developer Training Team

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.410
here at Google I/O in
our developer lounge.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.450
And today we have some really
exciting announcements.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.420
You probably heard
at the keynote Sundar

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.490
announce the Android Nanodegree.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.422
But we also launched a
whole bunch of new courses.

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.130
Jocelyn, tell us a
little bit about that.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.255
JOCELYN BECKER: Yes, Peter.

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.750
So we launched some
more Android courses.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.260
We've launched a course
for complete beginners

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.720
to help you go from zero
programming to developing

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.850
an Android app.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.410
We've also launched a course
for advanced Android development

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.540
and for Gradle.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.120
And we actually have some
more courses coming out soon,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.390
like I hope really, really soon.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.450
We also launched
the first course

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.380
in our entrepreneur track.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.090
So that's super exciting.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.945
And why don't you tell us a
bit more about the Nanodegree?

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:51.820
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.850
So we're really
excited about a way

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.890
to tie all these
trainings together

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.770
into a more cohesive,
bigger story arc,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.290
learning everything about
all the different aspects

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.040
of Android development.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.520
And we do that
together with Udacity

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.240
in the form of this Nanodegree.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.680
So the Nanodegree is
something you'd take

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890
in addition to the courses.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.130
For $200 a month,
you receive coaching,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.610
you receive help from an
expert grading network,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.100
and then you also
get a certificate

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.530
at the end that will hopefully
make you more employable.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.000
To help with that
part, we also put

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.170
on a first-- what is called
the Android Career Summit.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.557
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:33.640
JOCELYN BECKER: Yeah, so
the Android Career Summit

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.560
is where we're going to
invite 50 Android Nanodegree

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.860
graduates.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.620
And that's actually
people who have either

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.170
graduated from the Nanodegree
or who are on track for it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.480
to come to Google for an
all-expenses paid trip

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.500
to sunny California
to work together

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.620
and to work with
Google engineers

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.140
and to really get a practice at
what it's like to be an Android

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.240
developer.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.099
We also have another exciting
initiative that perhaps you'll

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.140
tell us a bit more about.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.040
PETER LUBBERS: OK.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.200
Yeah, so the final
announcement we're making today

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.250
is that we teamed up with
the government of Egypt.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.530
We want, of course,
the language barriers

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470
not to be a problem
for training.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.470
And so we teamed up with
the government of Egypt

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.230
to completely do an end-to-end
translation of all our training

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.830
into Arabic.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.760
And we're also launching
2,000 scholarships

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.870
that we're giving away
to students in Egypt

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
to take an Android fundamentals
course in local language

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.580
coaching.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.220
We're super excited about that,
and hopefully all these people

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.080
will get careers in
Android development.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.010
So if you want to know more
about any of these initiatives,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.220
go to udacity.com/google
and udacity.com/android

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.730
for the Android Nanodegree.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.450
Thank you.
