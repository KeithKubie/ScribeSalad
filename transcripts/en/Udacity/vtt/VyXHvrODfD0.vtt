00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.640
Now we're going to set up our development environment. To

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.230
get ready, you're going to need to install some things

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.010
if you don't already have them installed. The first thing

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.406
you're going to need is Java. And you're going to need the

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:17.416
JDK 1.7, also known as Java 7. You probably already

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.712
have it on your computer, but if you don't, you're

00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:22.610
going to need to download that now. And then the next

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.427
thing you're going to need is Apache Maven. And then you're

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:27.715
also going to want to use Eclipse. You don't have

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.625
to use Eclipse when you're using Maven projects, but

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:33.800
we strongly recommend it. And during this course, all

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.910
the instructions are going to assume you are using Eclipse.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.440
Also recommend that you get Eclipse EE, because it

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.845
comes with built in support for Maven. If you

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.030
already have standard Eclipse installed, you can add the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.644
Maven m2e plugin to it. But really I think

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.393
you're going to have a much better experience if you

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:56.130
just use Eclipse EE. Some of the things in the

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.665
Maven plugin for Eclipse don't quite work right. Now

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:01.755
one thing you don't have to install is the App

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:04.553
Engine SDK. And this is because when you have

00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:09.334
Maven projects, you specify all the dependencies in a configuration

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:13.040
file called pom.xml. And it's in this pom.xml where you're

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.690
going to specify the version of App Engine SDK that you

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.050
want and then Maven will just download the App Engine

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.830
SDK for you. So if you need help installing any

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.520
of these components, we've written a document for you to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.950
help guide you through installing them. And you can find

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.020
a link to that document in the instructor notes for

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.280
this lesson. So go ahead and install each of these.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.348
And when you've done it, go ahead and check the

00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:37.810
box here, so that we know you're ready to continue.
