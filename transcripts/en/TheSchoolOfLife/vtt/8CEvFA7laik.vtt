00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.969
There's a belief that philosophy, when properly done, should sound dense,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.139
forbidding, a little confusing, as if it might have been awkwardly translated from the German.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.400
But at the dawn of the Modern age, lived a French philosopher

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.840
who trusted in a very different way of presenting his thoughts; a man who wrote a very slim book,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.520
barely sixty pages long, that can deservedly be counted as one of the true masterpieces of philosophy. The book is a compendium of

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.599
acerbic, melancholy observations about the human condition; each of them only a sentence or two long which nevertheless present an

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.309
exceptional number of timely, wise, and oddly consoling lessons for our morally confused and wildly distracted age.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.869
The Duke de La Rochefoucauld was born in Paris in 1613. And despite his many initial advantages: wealth,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.570
connections, good looks, and a very beautiful and ancient name, he had a thoroughly difficult and often miserable life.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.600
He fell in love with a couple of duchesses who didn't treat him well.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:10.709
He ended up in prison after some bungled but honourable political maneuvering. He was forced into exile from his beloved Paris on four occasions.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.470
He never advanced as far as he wanted at court.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.529
He got shot in the eye during a rebellion and almost went blind.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.089
He lost most of his money, and some enemies published what they falsely purported to be his memoirs

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.389
full of insults against people whom he liked and depended upon: who then turned against him and refused to believe in his innocence.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.709
After all this betrayal, imprisonment, impoverishment, injury,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.369
plagiarism, and libel,

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.499
La Rochefoucauld can readily be forgiven when he declared that he'd had enough of the act of life and would henceforth retreat to quieter,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.430
contemplative pursuits instead.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.819
So he hung up his sword and spent his time in the living rooms of two leading intellectual figures of his day: the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.129
Marquise de Sable and the Comtesse  de

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.640
Lafayette

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.149
who regularly invited writers and artists to sit with them in their Parisian salons in order to discuss the great themes of existence

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.340
often over lemonade and light snacks.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.630
The salons rewarded wit and spark. They weren't lecture halls or seminar rooms. There was no tolerance for lead nurse or pomposity here.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.030
So winning over listeners required particular skills that came to shape La Rochefoucauld's mind and work.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.499
It was in the salons that La Rochefoucauld developed the literary genre for which he has become known: that of the maxim or

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.690
aphorism, a pithy statement that deftly captures a dark insight into the human soul,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.109
reminding us of a wise and often uncomfortable truth.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.970
In good hands, an aphorism should deliver its punch in less than three seconds. One might be competing with the arrival of an asparagus tart.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.270
In the salons, La Rochefoucauld perfected and honed the 504 aphorisms, which made his name.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.290
He watched how his fellow guests reacted and tweaked his work accordingly. His aphorisms covered all manner of psychological topics;

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.079
though issues of envy, vanity, love, and ambition were recurring themes. A typical La Rochefoucauld

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.890
aphorism begins by addressing the reader with a we or one,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.320
inviting consent with gentle coercion.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.260
The aphorism then subverts an accepted piety about human nature in a cynical or skeptical direction.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.800
It's in the last third of the sentence that the sting is generally delivered, and it often makes us laugh as can happen when we're

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.510
forced to acknowledge the falsity of a previously sentimental or hypocritical position.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.820
Perhaps the most classic and perfect of all La Rochefoucauld's aphorism is, "We all have strength enough to bear the misfortunes of others."

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.820
It's closely followed by the equally effective,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.300
"There are some people who would never have fallen in love, if they hadn't heard there was such a thing." And the no less accomplished,

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.729
"He that refuses praise the first time it's offered does it because he would like to hear it a second."

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.119
Voltaire said that [italics] La Rochefoucauld's maxims was the book that had most powerfully shaped the character of the French people;

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.339
giving them their taste for psychological reflection, precision, and cynicism. Behind almost every one of the maxims lies a challenge to an ordinary,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.330
flattering view of ourselves.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.149
La Rochefoucauld relishes revelations of the debt that kindness owes to egoism and insists that we're never far from being vain, arrogant,

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.219
selfish, and petty and in fact never nearer than when we trust in our own goodness.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.739
Having suffered unduly in its name, La Rochefoucauld was particularly suspicious of romantic love.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.380
"The reasons lovers never tire of one another's company is because they never talk of anything

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.269
but themselves." "If one were to judge of love according the greatest part of the effects it produces,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.469
it might very justly pass for hatred rather than kindness."

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.660
"To say that one never flirts is in itself a form of flirtation."

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.910
La Rochefoucauld wrote as he did because he wanted his ideas to persuade people

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.209
whom he knew had little time and wouldn't necessarily be on his side.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.629
If most philosophers since have, with the odd exception, felt no need to write with his elegance, wit, and concision,

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.739
it's because they've trusted, wrongly, that so long as one's ideas are important, the style in which one delivers them is of no issue.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.250
La Rochefoucauld knew otherwise. Most of us are so distracted if someone wants to get a point across to us,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.549
they must use all the devices of art and writing to seize our attention, and burn them into our memories. The

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:18.629
history of Philosophy would have been so different if its practitioners had all imagined themselves to be writing for an impatient,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.709
non-professional audience with meandering minds in the midst of a chatty Parisian salon. But history offers us a new chance.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.690
The 140 characters of our own digital salons now offer us a second chance to try to put La Rochefoucauld genius into action.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.590
