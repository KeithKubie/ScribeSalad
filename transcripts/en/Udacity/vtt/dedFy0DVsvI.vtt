00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.330
So, the answer to this question should be, the

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.120
middle three children should be shaded in as affected. Now

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.250
think about this for a second if you had trouble;

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.960
maternal inheritance means it can only be inherited from the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.320
mother. Why is that? You only get mitochondria from the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.870
mother. So, in this case the affected mother and unaffected

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.794
father all of the children were affected. Both the males

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:25.342
and the females, because they all got their mitochondria from

00:00:25.342 --> 00:00:28.160
the mother. So in this case over here the male

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.320
is affected. Great. So now he's going to have his

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.530
own three children, but does he pass mitochondria down to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.750
children? No, he doesn't. Only the mother does that, so they

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.830
wouldn't be affected. Same thing over here. Male was affected

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.810
but he doesn't pass his mitochondria down. The mother was unaffected

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.220
in these cases so they'g going to be unaffected children

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.800
for this particular trait. On the other hand the females in

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.060
this row were effected and since they passed their mitochondria down

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.110
to the next generation all their children are affected as well
