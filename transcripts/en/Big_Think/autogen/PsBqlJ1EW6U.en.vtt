00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
hate my boss I loved I loved all of my
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.900
hate my boss I loved I loved all of my
bosses and they were never they were

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
bosses and they were never they were
 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.810
bosses and they were never they were
never as boring as I described them in

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820
never as boring as I described them in
 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.160
never as boring as I described them in
the song I'll save that for them
