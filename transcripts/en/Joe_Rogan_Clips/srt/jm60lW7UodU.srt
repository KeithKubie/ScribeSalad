1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,720
All through his life. But the tragedy
of how much effort you put out to,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:04,980
if we want to write about Trump,

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,280
if you want to go after like Tybee
did about the financial institution,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,170
the way Thompson did it was to kind
of waste your time later for time now.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,380
And he talks about that. He says, you
mean by that chemical speed? He says,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,800
doing dexedrine being an alcoholic,
sort of changing his life in his rhythms.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,371
He said,

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm wagering time later for time now I'm
using up energy are things that I might

9
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:28,350
have by burning the candles so brightly
at this instant cause I believe I need

10
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,320
to go after these moments and I later,
I'm not going to have it,

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,320
but I'm making that gamble.
I'm putting the card down right now.

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,940
And I think that's terrifying.

13
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,660
And I also think that he gave us
brilliant writing over one of the most

14
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,760
remarkable spans in American
history because of it.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,260
That's a weird tradition of journalism
to destroy your body while creating your

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:50,880
art. And, um, I think there's a, according
to my friends who are journalists,

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,170
there's a big problem with Adderall today
and there's a lot of people that are

18
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:57,570
using it to write and um,

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,410
it's fucking speed and you know,
you get addicted.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
I mean Adderall makes everything in front
of you closer. Have you done it? Yeah.

21
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,070
So my first book was called hyper.
I'm a personal history of Adhd,

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,070
so it was about being medicated as a
child. You were medicated as a child,

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,400
like having pills forced down my
throat, like all sold. We you six.

24
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:16,710
When I took Ritalin for
the first time I had,

25
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,230
I had a suicidal moment
and like six years old.

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,500
The first time you were six
you wanted to commit suicide.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,080
I held like a butter knife to my
wrist. I don't remember it. But yeah,

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,420
I kind of remember it, but
yeah. And it was on Ritalin,

29
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,510
which I've taken now as an adult and
I always feel startled when I'm on it.

30
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,850
If I ever take Ritalin
now why did he like, well,

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,810
I take it to write like this
world is incredibly painful.
So I take Adderall now.

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,300
Um, and I, I take it to how
often you take it everyday.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
I take like 30 milligrams a day really?
And I take it too,

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,540
I take it to go into a library and this
is what David Wallace wells was talking

35
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:48,691
about,

36
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,410
I think like two days ago on the show was
how do you read really shitty academic

37
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,590
articles where you need the information
from them. I'm not good at that.

38
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,590
I'm not good at even making like
a car reservation, you know,

39
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,760
like a car rental reservation.

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,970
And so this world's going to
be painful no matter what.

41
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,900
But there's a functionality that, um,
Adderall allows and it's always a wager.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,480
What Thompson writes about is
whenever something is given,

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,680
something else has lost. You never
get anything for free in this world.

44
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,590
Thompson understood that better than
anybody. So with him, with [inaudible],

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm not going to say Thompson
was hyperactive, I'm not
going to go into that.

46
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,790
But techs a dream, like Geiger was
like, Yo, you're breaking down.

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,350
Like you're 26.
You have a wife,

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,530
you have a very small child
you're writing right now.

49
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,250
You want to have your career go forward,
you're not doing well.

50
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,060
He and the guy who was like, I'm a doctor,
I had gone through med school, you know,

51
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:40,260
I'd bid it. I, I'd been overwhelmed. Like
you guy get ran every morning, you know,

52
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,790
he did, he did other things,
but he, he took Dex to train.
So I gave it to Thomson.

53
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:49,200
And for that small period of time it
helped. I mean for me it's like I,

54
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,830
I, I'm not a good researcher
and maybe I would be now,

55
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,950
but the only way I can write about
something like hunter s Thompson where I

56
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,290
didn't know him,
I had no experience with him,

57
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,550
is to read everything that he's ever
written or been written about him and then

58
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,760
go out and interview people.
And so effort is my only path forward.

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,330
And what Adderall helps for me is to
take the pain away of that effort,

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,590
but it doesn't take it away.

61
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,530
It shifts it around to other
aspects in other parts of life.

62
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:16,360
And I think Thompson when he wrote,

63
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,990
he who makes a piece of himself escapes
the pain or gets through the pain of

64
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,980
being a man. We don't listen to that.
Like, he was like, this effort is hard.

65
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,050
He's like,
I'm struggling with this effort.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,370
I'm trying to make these beautiful things.

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,620
I always think of James Salter
fiction writer Aspin um, um,

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,760
resident rope, beautiful novels. He
wrote his whole life till he was 90.

69
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,320
His last novel was at 87.

70
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,040
He wrote a memoir at 76 about being a
fighter pilot among other things in the

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,420
Korean War lyric. Literary he
did it his whole life. He didn't,

72
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,130
he didn't burn out for
a small period of time.

73
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,540
He's the Antonym to Thompson I think when
it comes to effort and literary work.

74
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,890
Right. Um, do, do you
just take it for work?

75
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,180
Yeah,

76
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,350
I mean you don't have like an issue that
you need to take it for all my I where

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,860
we will, um, I think that will,

78
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,950
whenever we have something
like chemical speed,

79
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,500
whenever we have something like alcohol,
um,

80
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,470
whenever we have something that's not
like marijuana where at least marijuana

81
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:16,480
cuts your mania.
You know,

82
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:21,481
like whenever we have something else like
alcohol or at our all we need ask the

83
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,420
question or is it,

84
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,120
is taking the pain away and
being productive through
those actually hastening

85
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,470
your own doom and I think
with alcohol is very clear.

86
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:37,360
It is without a roles more complex. I
think if you do an amount of time release,

87
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,430
you can make it work.
How many Americans do that?

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,810
Out of the percent that are prescribed,
you know, I don't know, 10%, 20%,

89
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,050
like it's dangerous.
How often do you take time off?

90
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,140
I'd say maybe one or
two weeks, uh, of, uh,

91
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,730
every three or four months. And when
you do that, do you feel weird? No,

92
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,850
I just watch movies. Like I just
don't do anything. It doesn't,

93
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,390
I don't have any productivity.
I don't, I don't produce.

94
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,550
So the only way you produces on speed,
the only way I produce,

95
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,810
the way I want to right now is on speed.
I didn't start taking it till I'm 2010.

96
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,010
[inaudible] it's crazy that we're talking
about this because there's so many

97
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,780
people like you. It's um, it's so calm.

98
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,290
I mean how much of the
work that we enjoy today,

99
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,440
especially literary work
is written by people.

100
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:26,620
Journalistic work is written by people
that are on speed. But that's not new.

101
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:30,040
I mean that's what Thompson and burrows
and southern like this has been.

102
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,490
I believe that our American society,
the situation I'm in,

103
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,880
I have created a situation where I
have too much work and it's my fault.

104
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,260
I should not be trying to be a professor
and also go report it competency and

105
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,200
also at George Mason in the
creative writing program, you know,

106
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:48,370
and also then be hosting like people
coming out and also then like be trying to

107
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,670
research something that might be my
next thing that's too much in the way

108
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,420
Thompson saw dexedrine was that he
could make reality match his effort.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,460
So there was no longer the limit.
It was the American dream idea.

110
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,230
If you just put out enough effort,
you'll get it.

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,210
And that's why I think he's
so brilliantly understood.

112
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,110
The toxicity of the American dream is
that the effort is what the story is.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,830
You just because you have a path with
the effort to be rich, to be successful,

114
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,980
that doesn't mean that a good thing.
That's what we'll actually dismantle you.

115
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,410
Yeah. It's putting it out.
And I think we forget that.
