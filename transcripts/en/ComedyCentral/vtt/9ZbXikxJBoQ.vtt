In case we all die,
there is something

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.908
that I must
confess to you, Ilana.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.343
Um...

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.944
♪

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:17.184
Last summer, um, I switched our
laptop chargers in the night--

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.187
during the night,
like a sneaky thief.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.421
And that's why
yours never works.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.023
And I see you try and
you try and you try

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.025
and it's
because it's mine.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.627
Oh.
It's never gonna
work, Ilana.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.895
I'm so sorry.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.129
It's not a
big deal at all.

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.931
Really?

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.132
My God.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.166
You are
forgiveness.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.168
You are.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.569
Wow-- Whew.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.637
Thank you
everybody.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.804
Namaste--
Gracias.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.206
Okay--
I'll continue the game.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.141
Um...

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.545
Never have I ever...
read a newspaper.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:45.646
Really?

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.714
Even homeless people
read newspapers.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:49.983
(Abbi)
Um, I'll
guess I'll go.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.920
Never have I ever...

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.621
never have
I ever, um,

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.657
dealt with how my parents'
divorce affected my overall,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.059
you know, being in
relationships.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.461
So.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:06.466
Hey.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.569
Yeah... I mean,
it's an intense subject.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:10.304
Can I get a bite
of that P-sal?

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:11.438
No, I'm still
working on it.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.307
There's a lot of--
(screaming)

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.608
Bevers, calm down.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.143
There's candles
somewhere.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.244
My goodness.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.512
(Ilana)
Relax-- Breathe.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.680
(Jaime)
Calm down, Bevers.
