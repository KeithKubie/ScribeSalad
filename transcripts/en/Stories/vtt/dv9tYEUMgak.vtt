LAURA LING: It's Saturday night
here in Mukuranga, Tanzania.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.940
And we are hanging
with the locals

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.870
here at the movie theater.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.940
I just bought my ticket.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.290
It was 500 shillings,
which is about $0.50.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.160
So let's go inside and
see what blockbuster

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
they're playing tonight.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.580
They're playing a
local Tanzanian movie.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.594
It's called "GENGE."

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:38.260
How's the movie?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.146
You like it?

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.270
SUBJECT 1: Yeah, very good.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.550
LAURA LING: Most people in this
town don't have electricity,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.400
so they come here
for entertainment.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.360
Luckily, this place
has a generator.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.960
What movies are popular here?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.960
SUBJECT 2: At this theater we
watch most Bollywood movies,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.970
American movies, like Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Rambo.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.300
But also we play
video games here,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.985
because they don't have
power and TV at their homes.

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:13.610
LAURA LING: Ah.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.651
So they come here-- people
will come here and pay

00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:16.900
to play video games.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.870
SUBJECT 2: Exactly.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.670
LAURA LING: Wow.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.836
So it's just like anywhere
else in the world, movies

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:22.440
and video games are popular.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.760
SUBJECT 2: That's right, yeah.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.130
LAURA LING: Please check
out this next video.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.320
It's getting dark out, and
this facility has no power.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.260
Racho is about to
see a client, who

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.240
could give birth at any moment.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.440
So Racho, basically,
has to do whatever

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.982
she can just to make it work.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.920
