00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.569
[Plane engine sounds]

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hello everyone welcome to the triumphant
return of--

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.160
&gt;&gt;Ian and Dan: The Friday Game Review!

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: I didn't say game.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.669
&gt;&gt;Ian: That was unrehearsed.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:14.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. You can tell.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: I am Ian Ni-Lewis and as always with
me he is...

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dan Galpin and today I am actually
wearing the cheese head.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.109
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's about time. Dan Galpin. I don't
know if I've really made the is clear because

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.589
we make fun of Dan a lot on this
show.[Dan Laughs] Dan walks among mortals

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:40.180
as a coding slash developer relations god,
someone who can only be expressed

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.770
in, with a headgear--

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: I just thought it was the fact that
I am generally cheesy where ever I go.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually what it is is, Dan is so good
at what he does, that he basically just lifts

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.690
a middle finger to the world and
it's silly fashion requirements.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right, exactly. [Chuckles]

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, check that out. Our producer,
Ray Taylor, now has two cameras to work with.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.149
Camera One! Camera Two!

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oooo, nice, that's exciting.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Unfortunately, camera two is apparently
not lit at all.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, it's not.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: We'll work on that.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: We'll have to get light actually bouncing
off of us toward camera two, although realistically,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.250
that's not my best
angle.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: It’s not.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: You have a good angle?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, but, uh, I have ones that are worse
than others.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay. Joining us as well is the mystery
beer.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. I've been taunted by the mystery
beer for several hours now so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, now I'm going to try this--

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: It actually came in this wrapper, although
I turned it inside out so you wouldn't be

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.770
able to tell what it is.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh I see.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay, ready?

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: So this is it.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Bottoms up!

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.740
[long pause]

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740
&gt;&gt;Dan:Hmm.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's pretty hoppy.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: That’s pretty significantly bitter.
I like it.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.469
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ah, indeed. That is, uh, so this is
another from our friends at McKellar.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.119
|
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, fantastic. Wow! I think--

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.219
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes, the Mackellar

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.250
&gt;&gt;Dan and Ian: One thousand IBU.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.199
&gt;&gt;Ian: And just to put that into context,
I think most IPA's top out at around a couple

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.199
of hundred.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:16.669
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. Actually, you know, it’s quite
good. I think that--

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:20.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's powerful. I think you reach a
point of bitterness where you just can't get

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.100
any bitterer.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, basically we spent the last six
months or so building up a tolerance to all

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.919
things bitter here, and uh--

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.919
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's true.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and it's, uh.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait, I've been working with you for
a year.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.709
[Dan laughs]

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's true. But that's me building
up a tolerance for all things bitter.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: Gotcha.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right. So, let's get right on to
the games. We've got some really interesting

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.530
things today. We've got a few games
that came off of the moderator that we're

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.530
going to look at.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thanks for your voting.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, thank you very much for voting.
Sorry to everyone whose games were not chosen.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.690
There were some comments today
on the Friday Review Google plus page talking

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.510
about why certain things were or were not
voted in. So I just wanted to clear

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.800
that up. The reason why something will get
chosen is, "a", because you vote it up, and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.070
"b", because we want to talk about
it. Typically, Ray Taylor and I will sit down

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.670
and look at the top ten apps and the top ten
games, and Ray-To will pick some

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.620
number of apps from that of which he'll cover
maybe three. [Dan chuckles] And then Dan and

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.870
I will sit down and look at the
games, look at the top ten, and choose usually

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.230
the top six. We generally try to choose just
the top voted games,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.100
but we don't always, and usually it's because
one of the top voted games is one we just

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.440
don't have much to say about. I'm
Particularly looking at you, X-Bugs dude,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.820
we talked about your thing twice man, so quit
it with the complaining because

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.870
we're not going to talk about it again. It's
a good game; we did actually nominate it,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.870
for uh, yeah.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: We did.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: A lot of times a nomination will take
four to five weeks to go through, and the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.970
reason is, merchandizing has a whole
pile of apps that could be featured, and then

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.350
they choose the ones that they think are going
to be best for that particular

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.350
week.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: As with X-Bugs itself, I vaguely remember
some comment that squashing bugs was not as

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.550
fun as they thought it would
be, you know? That just might be their opinion,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.920
I thought that squashing bugs was quite a
lot of fun.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: I thought it was endless fun.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: I wouldn't go that far.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: For the whole family.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.300
[Dan laughs]

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was something that small children
would appreciate and it's a lot nicer than

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.310
having them squash real bugs, so you
know, in general.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a bug squashing simulator, they're
going to go out and squash bugs all weekend

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.570
long as soon as they get away
from the computer.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.653
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're mutant bugs. Now we've talked
about the game.

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:03.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a good point.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oooooo.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right, so we're also going to talk
about some games that weren't actually nominated

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.420
because Ian and I had
something miraculous happen in the last week.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes!

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: we actually got a few days off, following--

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes, and boy do I regret it, the first
moment I open up my email inbox,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: So we actually had some time to play
games that were not on the moderator list.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.950
And so we want to talk about some of
the games we've been playing, some of them

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.750
last week and some of them throughout the
last couple of months and put them

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.310
through the same kind of critical filter as
we put everything else on the Friday Game

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.380
Review through. And, uh, and also we
want to talk a little bit about some of the

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.020
things that have gone on in the last few weeks,
one of course is, today we are

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.610
shipping Nexus 7 devices, which is awesome.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: No way! Today?

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. Today.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really? And this is a surprise to me
because none of us knew actually. A lot of

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.240
people are like, "Why is Google so
secretive? Why won't they say when they're

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.580
shipping things?" Because we don't know.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, pretty much.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: I mean, I'm sure somebody knows. We
don't.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: We posted it, the only reason I know
is that we posted it on a Google Plus page,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.940
and--

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: There you go!

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I'm like all right! I guess we're
shipping devices, how cool.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Seriously, if you and I ever get fired,
we'll probably find out about from the public--like

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.170
through a blog or
something.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: I expect.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because that's how we find out everything.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.170
[Laughter]

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm like, okay I guess I should pack
up my desk.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right so.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:31.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right, so Nexus 7. Let's bring
that bad boy up. This is an awesome game machine,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.910
and I'll tell you why.
First, it's got the Tegra 3 inside,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: so very similar to our previous standby
which is the ASUS Transformer Prime, actually

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.440
we're still going to use the
ASUS Transformer Prime on the show, and the

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.380
reason is it has one of the best HDMI output
implementations that we've ever

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.380
seen.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whereas the Nexus 7 stock does not
come with an HDMI output at all. But, I'm

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.290
playing games on this,
and I'll tell you why. Because it is just

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.290
as fast--

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mmm Hmm.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: and it's easier to hold. The truth
is, having a, in fact if Ray-To would go to

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:16.300
camera two for a second, when you have
the ability to just hold it in your hands

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.100
like this, compared to, right, the--

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: The Docking especially--

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, you might want to take the dock
off.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: The dock is so cool.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, all right, whatever.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay, all right.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.389
&gt;&gt;Ian: For some definition of cool, anyway,
the way you hold it in your hands like this,

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:35.360
it's just really easy. I can play
accelerometer games, I can play duel stick

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.960
games, and I never get tired of holding it,
and I never feel like I have to

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.230
stretch my thumbs to reach elements of the
interface, but at the same time, I never feel

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.669
like I'm squinting because it's so
much bigger than a phone.

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:53.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's an awesome game playing
device, and it's where I've been doing all

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.490
of the gaming that I don't do on Galaxy
Nexus these days, and, uh,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you know there are, I'm just excited
for more game developers to get their hands

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.430
on it. I think it's fantastic,
like we finally have a development platform

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.480
that anyone can go and buy, one of the latest
version of android, that

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.090
hopefully will be available at some point
to everyone around the world, but today it's

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.900
available to a lot of people so
that's really cool.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, and at a very good price point
too.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.470
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, and Jay is awesome, and that,
we're not actually talking about , we're talking

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.090
about this, but we're really
not trying to pimp this as a sales pitch.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.090
Actually just really excited.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's true, we're just really excited
about it.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.889
&gt;&gt;Dan: I just want to make it really clear
that this is not our "This is the official

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:37.630
Nexus 7 commercial segment of the
Friday Game Review." This is because we frickin'

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.650
love playing games on this device.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: And that's what it comes down to. And
you know, part--

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Here's the thing, Jay, Jelly Bean..

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Jelly Bean, yeah.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh my God.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Project Butter is awesome, and actually

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, so--

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.290
&gt;&gt;Dan: Being able to actually synch the Vsynch
in your games is awesome. Everyone should

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.840
start doing it. It's really really cool and
we may even cover that someday, I don't know.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840
Maybe in another forum.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah yeah, We've got some really pretty
good talks about that. Um, in general, the

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.410
improvements that were made in
Jelly Bean, will make your user experience

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.839
totally smooth. You will feel like you bought
a new device, okay. I put it on my

00:09:10.839 --> 00:09:15.740
Galaxy Nexus, and I felt like I had just gotten
a new phone. I think it's finally gotten to

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.291
be, you know, what I would
consider, world class. Because I think we

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:25.970
can admit that Gingerbread and even ICS were
janke compared to what we really

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.900
wanted from the hardware, what the hardware
was capable of.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.900
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: We fixed all of that.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually we've gone beyond what the
hardware is capable of right now. [Unintelligible

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:40.029
word] In all seriousness, what's
cool about Jay for gamers is that our touch

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:46.580
response has gone from two to three frames
worth of delay to one frame fixed

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.140
delay which is amazing and--

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:54.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: We've actually seen significant performance
improvement in some games just for running

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.260
on Jelly Bean and the
interesting thing is--

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.620
&gt;&gt;together: We have NO idea why!

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a complete mystery to us. We're
gonna figure it out one day.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is the ultimate Temple Run machine,
I can tell you this.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right, Temple Run Brave got
ten or fifteen percent, or something like

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200
that?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was insane.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: It was bizarre.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it--

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is that a Unity game?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's a Unity game.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Did we see it that on any other Unity
titles?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't know. I don't really pay attention.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: You were more playing Temple Run Brave,
nice.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.911
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's the best part about it, is that
your gestures just get recognized just that

00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:27.060
much better, it's just, its'
awesome. I'm really excited, I can't wait

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.220
to hear what you guys thing of it when you
get your hands on it and, uh, and let's

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.220
go on to some games!

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, let's do that. So, yeah, this
is a very special episode of the Friday Game

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.360
Review, and I'm pretty sure when I
posted that, at least some people that grew

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.730
up in the 70's and 80's thought that it was
going to be about us kicking our

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.730
drug habits.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hmph.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: And it's not. Those habits are very
valuable to us.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: But, let's go ahead and take a look
at some of the games. Why don't we start with

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.880
one of the games that you've been
playing.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:02.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right, not to be completely cliché
here, but I've been playing a lot of Dead

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.740
Trigger and this is Dead Trigger and
I'm actually getting wiped right now, running

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:13.710
here on the Transformer Prime. And this is
not my real game, I will point out

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.200
that I'm like to day seventy right now in
real life, and I think I'm on day five or

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.220
something like that. What's great about
Dead Trigger is the way to do a high quality

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.290
three title for mobile. They've been very
clever in the way they actually

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:34.460
reuse a relatively small number of environments
to do a whole variety of different missions,

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.960
and they've managed to fit the
game into about a hundred megabytes, which

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.280
is great. Now, however--

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I love how they have an ad for
Shattergun.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: They do.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: That rocks.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: But here's the one problem with that
ad, I mean seriously?

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.700
[Laughter]

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.960
So one thing, if you're going to do something
cool enough, like have an ad for your other

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.589
game. Dude! Show the people the
stuff.

00:11:57.589 --> 00:11:59.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: Show it some love, man.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Show it some love.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Come on you guys.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's one thing. Another thing is
back button support. I'm hitting the back

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.620
button right now and you notice nothin'
is happening.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: No back button.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.600
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's just, you know.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ouch.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's like they never watch this
show. You know, which is amazing, but--

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: We get it. You're awesome, you're from
Europe, you can do things differently, but

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.010
not the fricken' back button.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: You do not mess with that pal.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.230
[Dan laughs]

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: So that's one thing, another thing
about the game is, it actually does have a

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.101
limited back button support on the main
page when you actually get back to it, it's

00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:37.200
like, eek, mission failed.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.260
[nonsense sounds]

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's the dreaded quit application dialog.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.399
&gt;&gt;Ian: And what it really comes down to is
this is a great game, you know, you should

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:50.220
all try it out, you know play it,
you're going to have a lot of fun with it,

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.010
but it will not be a featured app in Google
Play.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Until they fix some of these things,
yeah.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, because the Google Play Q&amp;A team
is just going to look at this and laugh. Of

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.209
course, we're going to nominate,
we're going to work with these guys, because

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:05.500
we think they're awesome, we think that it
should be featured in Google Play.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: Um hmm.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: But they're going to have to fix this
stuff before it gets featured.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.589
&gt;&gt;Dan: Totally. And the game really is awesome.
The other thing that people, and I will say

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:16.930
a lot of people have been
commenting on Google Play that "Hey, this

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.220
is a ninety-nine cent game and it expects
me to buy stuff."

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, it's "pay-me-um".

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: And actually, the reality of the game
is, you can grunt your way through this game

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.410
without buying anything, as far as
I can tell. Maybe at some point.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Plus, you know what?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Get over yourselves.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.899
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is a fifteen dollar game. This
would have sold for fifteen bucks on Xbox

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:40.940
Live and you know it.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, this is--

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ninety-nine cents is pretty good deal.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a really good deal. And to be
honest, I am not on day seventy something

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.781
of the game, and I still only paid the
ninety-nine cents, and part of the reason

00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:53.680
I did that was I wanted to see could I actually
get through the entire game with

00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:01.160
ninety-nine cents? We still don't really know
if that's true, but as the weeks go by, I'll

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.240
try to update you guys.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.029
&gt;&gt;Ian: I've been wondering Dan, for you, just
in terms of the way you perceive things--

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:09.029
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:10.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: How many hours are in a day?

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.180
&gt;&gt;Dan: Uh, twenty-six. So uh.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.529
&gt;&gt;Ian: That answers my question.

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:18.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually, there's only four hours for
sleep, is what it really comes down to, so--

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wow.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:26.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, you know, I know that since you've
had a child, four hours of sleep is actually

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.230
a luxury, so in any case,
I'll continue reporting back, and also I hope

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.899
to come back to this came when they fix some
of these things because it is

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:41.090
awesome! So that is Dead Trigger. Now, other
games that we are playing, now this game is

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.360
not on the main screen here because
it was already installed, um, so.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, mine, yes. I'm going to take this
out of the thing here.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:59.221
&gt;&gt;Ian: Um, okay, Radiant Defense is, every
year or two, and there comes a game I have

00:14:59.221 --> 00:15:01.640
to finish. I almost never finish a
game.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: mmm hmm

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.070
&gt;&gt;Ian: And in this particular case, it was
Radiant Defense. I think the last game--

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Have you actually finished it now?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: I have finally finished it. I have
three starred every level.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.940
&gt;&gt; Dan: Nice!

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: I love that tower defense games. I
think tower defense games are great. This

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.490
one in particular really really caught
my eye. So, it was free to download.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:25.590
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: Before you go in to
it, I think you disconnected the HDMI cable.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.590
&gt;&gt;Together: Oh!

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: How's that?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.590
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: That's better.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wonderful.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: You must be very cautious that these
mini HDMI cables, MicroAge HDMI cables.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:39.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah yeah. What's really, really interesting
about this game is that unlike the, so, as

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:45.320
go ahead and get past the
sort of cheesy, humorous sections here. They

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320
actually are pretty funny , um,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: The humor is good, yeah.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, it's right up at like the Captain
Underpants level.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly, just where we like it.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:58.390
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just where we like it. Okay. So like
many tower defense games, enemies will come

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.730
on a path, what makes this one
interesting is that you will set the path

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.580
by building blocks. Now a lot of games will
let you set the path, you know alter

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:14.550
the path by building towers. But in this case,
you can't build towers on the path. You have

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.870
to build towers on these
existing black squares, but you also get a

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.990
certain number of these black squares that
the blocks to set yourself. So if I set up

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.480
these
modules, I can actually lengthen or alter

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.459
the path this turns out to be one of the major--

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Innovations.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: Innovations, well, it turns out to
be one of the major strategies that you have

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
to think about.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, okay.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's a lot of levels where you're
absolutely hopeless unless you've built the

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.260
correct path. But if you have built
a path that makes sense, you know for instance,

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.769
you've got aliens coming at you from two different
areas, you need to build

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:59.010
a path so that one of them takes so long that
you get it second rather than getting both

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.300
of them at the same time.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right, exactly.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.170
&gt;&gt; Ian: And the other innovation, the other
thing that I think is really interesting,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:14.669
is that towers miss. The towers
actually have aim, and they rotate around

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:19.759
at a fixed speed. So, sometimes, you're seeing
it right now, every now and then

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:23.069
one of those bullets will just miss one of
the enemies, so you have to be a really careful

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.110
about your tower placement,
because you don't want to make it so that

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.210
they have to rotate around really quick. You
don't want to make it so the shots

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:33.790
are hard, for instance, if you place a tower
where the aliens are coming past it, then

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.770
it's going to be harder for it to
make the shots because they're coming faster,

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.230
whereas, if you place a tower when enemies
are coming towards it, it's a lot

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.580
easier to make the shot.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: I love the graphics style of this game.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.009
&gt;&gt;Ian: The style is great.

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:50.850
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hexage just does it with all our games,
but Radiant Defense is the pinnacle of what

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.639
they've done with this style.
I think is brilliant and you know you immediately

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:57.710
look at one of their games, and you immediately
say,"Oh that's Hexage

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.059
game." That's just it. So I hope that's how
it's pronounced.

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:02.279
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hecks-AH-gay?

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:05.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hecks-AH-gay. That's right it could
be. [laughter]

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.340
&gt;&gt;Unknown male speaker: You know they're a
Japanese Company right?

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, there you go.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.799
&gt;&gt;Dan: They build in the U.K. I believe so,
we're going for Hexage.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:22.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: So the graphics are great, they've
got this really cute cartoon-y style but it's

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.210
not too cute.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.309
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:31.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: All of the enemies and the weapons
are really well rendered. They all have their

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:38.530
own behaviors that keep you engaged,
but on top of that they, they just have a

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.690
really deep strategy, and of really interesting
monetization model. So this is

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:50.059
one of those games where you buy upgrade packs
and I have to admit I bought all the upgrade

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:55.359
packs so when I say I three
starred it, I did three star it I had to buy

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:58.379
all the upgrade packs. Let me show you what
they've got.

00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:01.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can even get the, yeah yeah.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:08.989
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, basically it was say that I want
this, the best weapon in the game by far is

00:19:08.989 --> 00:19:12.419
the ballistic missile, the Seraphim
Missile launcher. Reason it's such a great

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:15.419
weapon is because the,uh, they're seeking.

00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.119
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, okay.

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: So if they miss, they'll come around
again.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:25.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Isn't Seraphim like the name of the
Pharisees or something? I don't know.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.909
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're thinking of Sadducees, Seraphim
were they were just like Cherubim.

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:30.999
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's it. Right.

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:32.759
&gt;&gt;Ian: They were Kabbalistic angels.

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:37.919
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right, that's why they were
called Kabbalistic. I was just curious if

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:41.250
there was some mythological reference
there that I was missing here.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think we've both missed it.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.159
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay.

00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:50.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, if I want to unlock this, they're
going to sell me the explosive pack, and I

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.720
don't know, it's like a dollar
ninety-nine or so. Or you can get the science

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720
pack.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Ooooo.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.159
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which gives you power blades, which
are awesome because you know how there is

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:04.690
always like one enemy that gets away
from you and he's got like one hit point left,

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.919
but he still kills you? Well, you put a power
blade in front of your base,

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:10.609
and he runs into it and "boom."

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:11.769
&gt;&gt;Dan: Awesome, awesome.

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:17.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, incredible stuff. Just really
fun stuff. The other thing that I love about

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.749
it, um, I think you do have to buy
it, if I remember, I think it's one of these.

00:20:21.749 --> 00:20:29.289
Oh, maybe not, maybe not. I think it's actually
in there to begin with. They

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:35.070
have a specific type of tower that doesn't
do any damage, but if an enemy dies near it,

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.149
it doubles your money.

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:37.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: NICE! I like that.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, you get into these really interesting
strategies, where you're not just trying to

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:46.990
kill all the aliens, you’re
trying to kill them in the right place so

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.470
you can get the most money and the way they
score is, so like many games that I

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:59.159
enjoy an interest bonus between rounds, which
gives you an incentive to spend the least

00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:04.000
money possible, now they cap that at
five hundred dollars, so if you get more than

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.320
five hundred, you're not going to get any
more interest, which is, eh. You

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320
know.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Makes sense.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah. But then what they do for your
score is they take all the enemies that you

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.980
killed and all the money you have
left and they have a multiplication factor.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:23.110
So if you want to get a HUGE high score on
this game, which I haven't. I think

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.499
the top ten high scores are all about twenty
million, I think, three starring every level,

00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:29.940
I might have broken two million.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:35.909
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wow, so, so the moral of this story
is that this game monetized well enough that

00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:39.119
Ian went and bought everything in
the game, so it's probably one that--

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:41.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: With my own money, not my Google credit
card.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.049
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, this is probably one,

00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:44.049
&gt;&gt;Ian: Good deal.

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:47.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is probably one that is probably
worth looking at if you're studying what's

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.570
a decent story. Of course, Ian may
not reflect everyone's taste but this game

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.570
is truly awesome.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.919
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not at all. I am very different. It's
a lot of fun, and not only did it give me

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:02.070
a reason to buy, did you notice how
good their merchandising is?

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.119
&gt;&gt;Ian: They're not just saying, it's not a
stupid little list of things that you can

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:08.639
buy that's dull, and boring, it's--

00:22:08.639 --> 00:22:15.241
&gt;&gt;Dan: They sell it to you, they're mock marketing
it within the game to me as the player of

00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:16.241
the game, which is awesome--

00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:17.241
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:22:17.241 --> 00:22:20.529
&gt;&gt;Dan: You know, this is NOT the place to
cut corners, in a game, when you're actually

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:21.529
like getting to the monetary phase.

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:27.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right. It's not like, you know, four
thousand radiant bucks or something like that.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:28.890
You know that--

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is what you're getting.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:35.029
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is what you get, but they've put
some nice graphics, they've given them creative

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:38.860
names that make me think, "Oh
yeah, I want that pack.." And even just saying

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.860
it's a pack.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.860
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's pretty cool.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.539
&gt;&gt;Dan: For people who feel nickeled and dimed
by these games, this is a great strategy.

00:22:45.539 --> 00:22:49.190
I think, actually, even if you are
selling this things individually, I think

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.470
the idea of selling them in packs is really
appealing.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Especially, what I really want Shadow
Gun to do actually is have an upgrade that

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.059
turns, that doubles the amount of
coins you get for everything in the game and

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:09.460
turns everything that you had to buy with
gold, which is the slow currency that

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.879
you basically don't get during the game into
something you could buy with coins. Basically,

00:23:12.879 --> 00:23:13.879
unlocking the entire game

00:23:13.879 --> 00:23:14.879
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:17.679
&gt;&gt;Dan: into something you can just grind through
for like seven or eight dollars. Basically--

00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:25.309
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, right. I think this is actually
a nine or ten dollar game, which absolutely

00:23:25.309 --> 00:23:29.500
is in line with the enjoyment that
I got out of it. I had a lot of fun. Could

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:36.389
have spent nothing, and still had a lot of
fun, but getting each pack really

00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:37.389
increased my enjoyment.

00:23:37.389 --> 00:23:38.389
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly, exactly.

00:23:38.389 --> 00:23:43.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: Here's a question for you, by the way
about pricing. Would you rather get something

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.039
that is fifty percent off or
something were you get fifty percent more

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:49.729
free?

00:23:49.729 --> 00:23:57.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: You know, usually, that's an interesting
question. I want both.

00:23:57.139 --> 00:23:58.139
[Laughter]

00:23:58.139 --> 00:24:00.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: And because you're Dan Galpin, you'll
probably get it, but let's pretend you're

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:01.950
me.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:07.441
&gt;&gt;Dan:No, no. I think honestly fifty percent
more for free makes a lot of sense when it

00:24:07.441 --> 00:24:12.639
comes to monetization in the game.
There are only a certain number of people

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:18.169
who are going to monetize, and if you can
make those users feel like they’re getting

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:22.109
value for their money and make them spend
a little bit more, my suspicion is that you're

00:24:22.109 --> 00:24:23.109
going to monetize better.

00:24:23.109 --> 00:24:25.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: So here's the thing, I was just reading
this in The Economist this morning, because

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.090
that's what I read when I brush
my teeth in the morning.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:34.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: They had an article that said, they
did some studies on this, people would rather

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.289
get fifty percent more free than
get fifty percent of,

00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:38.289
&gt;&gt;Dan: There you are.

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:39.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: even though, let's do the math,

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.279
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're spending more money.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:46.809
&gt;&gt;Ian: fifty percent more free is thirty-three
percent off the price.

00:24:46.809 --> 00:24:48.700
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mmm hmm.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, just an interesting thing. But
definitely, people like to feel like they

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.499
are getting a better deal.

00:24:54.499 --> 00:25:01.639
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I think that's the key thing. We're
working with Wind Up Knight, beginning of

00:25:01.639 --> 00:25:06.700
the game, he pops up this dialog
and says, "BOOM! You can unlock the entire

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.779
game for the one time only price of blah."
And right after, I think you're after

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:15.379
the second level or something like that, and
it was his most popular purchase in the game

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:19.330
with people. One, he demonstrated
value; two, they already understood what they

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.950
were getting in terms of game play, and it
was so awesome, once you could

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.729
unlock the entire game, to not have to worry
about that, then you could just spend your

00:25:26.729 --> 00:25:30.710
money on all the really cool
upgrades in the game, and it was very cool,

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:31.710
so I--

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:38.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know what is absolutely the biggest
draw monetization-wise? You know, everybody

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:42.349
should do this, this is what
we've discovered over and over again, the

00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:44.080
biggest draw is something that is time limited.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: MMM Hmm.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: Where I can spend my money, I spend
my money on things that I truly enjoy, but

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:55.399
there are times when I have spent
more money than I was going to, for instance,

00:25:55.399 --> 00:26:01.510
I bought platinum packs of cards on Big Win
Hockey. Really enjoyed that. Still

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.399
need to call those guys and ask them why my
team doesn't work anymore. Maybe because I

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:06.879
spent too much money on it, I don't
know.

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:10.419
&gt;&gt;Dan: The game simply was not intended for
a gamer of your caliber.

00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:11.659
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's probably it.

00:26:11.659 --> 00:26:12.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: And your wallet size.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nah, oh yeah yeah.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's it. Anyway, If you see me on
Big Win Hockey, I will kick your ass. Why?

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.690
I have money.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mmm hmm.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: Not that much money, but probably,
ya know.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.289
&gt;&gt;Dan: More money than most people want to
spend on virtual cards.

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:32.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's put this in real terms. I'm stupid
with my money.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.460
[Laughter]

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.899
&gt;&gt;Ian: Anyway, the point is that the platinum
cards were on sale, they were fifty percent

00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:46.330
off for a week. And I have no idea
whether that's, whether they even stopped

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.340
that after a week, but it got me.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:53.460
&gt;&gt; Dan: I, and actually time limited offers
are great. Not only that, people do one of

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.390
two things, one is to have an item
that is only available during that period,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:01.889
period, during that time, in general, and
the second thing is to have an offer

00:27:01.889 --> 00:27:05.999
or a sale that is only available for that
time period. Those are both great. Also, activities,

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:09.330
tournaments, anything you can
do to make the game more alive will get people,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.560
I guess. You know what it actually was, I'm
wearing this cheese head, and so

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.659
you had to make fun of yourself this time
because I've basically got it all,

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:19.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Basically, once you have the cheese
head, you're everything that I ever wanted

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.649
you to be. I have no further criticism.

00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:22.649
[Laughter]

00:27:22.649 --> 00:27:25.719
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right. I've got the beard, I've
got the cheese head, we're all good.

00:27:25.719 --> 00:27:26.719
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yup.

00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:27.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: So let's go on to our next game.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.379
&gt;&gt;Ian: Thank God you didn't wear the cheese
head without a beard, that would have been

00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:32.379
disgusting.

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:35.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know. I know. All right, so
we actually do have a--

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, you've been, well, you've been
playing one other game.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: I have.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: But we should probably get to the real.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's get to the real games.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: Should we do Tiny Hawk?

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's do Tiny Hawk.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:48.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because I'll tell you this, I thought,
this is either a game about a little bitty

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.919
bird, or it's going to be about
skating and that's awesome. Thank God it’s

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:56.440
about skateboarding! Rock ON!

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:05.299
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. This is a game that's about skateboarding
and, honestly, it's fun. It does have some

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:09.309
weird glitches,
occasionally like you just saw there. But

00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:14.049
basically your job is to play Tiny Hawk here.
It's 8-bit retro style, it's really

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:18.070
retro style. It's not, you get--

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: The frame rate alone is much higher
than you get--

00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:25.139
&gt;&gt;Dan:Yeah, in most retro games. Basically
you can do two things. You can jump, and you

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:30.499
can go down. And that's, the
goal is to get to the end and try to collect

00:28:30.499 --> 00:28:33.580
all the cans of whatever those are. Um and--

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.859
&gt;&gt;Ian: What are those?

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:39.399
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're cans of random soft drink,
I think, of some sort.

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:41.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay. Sort of energy beverage maybe?

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:46.799
&gt;&gt;Dan: It looks like it. I don't know, but,
and sometimes it's actually really hard to

00:28:46.799 --> 00:28:51.370
jump. You have to kind of figure
out, and you can't really change your direction.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:56.509
So it is sort of like this combination, endless
runner slash with this

00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:57.509
skateboarding paradigm.

00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:59.099
&gt;&gt;Ian: But you can bounce off the walls, that's
how you got there.

00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:01.019
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly. You bounce off walls.

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:02.019
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice, nice.

00:29:02.019 --> 00:29:03.019
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: The HDMI is--

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:06.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, the HDMI, yeah. It's a little,
I'm going to put this back into its stand

00:29:06.139 --> 00:29:08.424
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is that going to help, is that really
going to help?

00:29:08.424 --> 00:29:11.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: Because I'm less likely, I won't pick
it up and I'm less likely to jostle it.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:16.539
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we just switch to camera two for
just a second? 'Cause I just want to mention

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:20.139
that this looks totally dorky.
Go ahead. Play the game.

00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:21.139
&gt;&gt; Dan: Thanks.

00:29:21.139 --> 00:29:23.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: Play it. Play it. Play it so.

00:29:23.179 --> 00:29:24.179
&gt;&gt;Dan: So.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: How dorky is that?

00:29:25.179 --> 00:29:26.399
&gt;&gt;Dan: My dork Fu is strong.

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:28.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay, all right.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:36.169
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right, so does anyone, does anyone
understand that the dork Fu is strong reference?

00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:37.590
I don't know. All right.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.749
&gt;&gt;Ian: Whoa, you have a picture in picture
for camera two?

00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:40.749
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:29:40.749 --> 00:29:44.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: When did you make that? While you were
screwing around over here?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.289
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: Pretty much, yeah.

00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:50.989
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ray-To, you are so much better at this
stuff than I am. I don't know why.

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.419
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: It helps with job security.

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:55.239
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, exactly. Well you do have a win
in seven.

00:29:55.239 --> 00:29:56.239
[Laughter]

00:29:56.239 --> 00:29:58.679
&gt;&gt;Dan: OH, is that what it's being called
these days?

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:00.489
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh you missed that whole discussion.

00:30:00.489 --> 00:30:01.489
&gt;&gt;Dan: I did.

00:30:01.489 --> 00:30:02.739
&gt;&gt;Ian: It was great.

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:03.739
[Laughter]

00:30:03.739 --> 00:30:08.721
&gt;&gt;Ian: We’ll stop with the inside jokes
now. Okay. So, Tiny Hawk verdict, what did

00:30:08.721 --> 00:30:09.721
they do wrong?

00:30:09.721 --> 00:30:15.109
&gt;&gt;Dan: I actually have not found anything
significant that they do wrong. The game does

00:30:15.109 --> 00:30:18.080
the correct thing with the back key,
the game does the correct thing with audio.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080
Um, yeah.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.769
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right on you guys.

00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:26.799
&gt;&gt;Dan: So as far as the game itself can be
a little frustrating. Um, it is a native game,

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:31.499
I don't see why it has to be
anything other than my suspicion is..

00:30:31.499 --> 00:30:33.979
&gt;&gt;Ian: Native game you mean?

00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:36.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: NDK game. It's an NDK game.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.299
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a Marmalade game right?

00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:41.779
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a Marmalade game, exactly. But,
I mean, for the most part, they're doing the

00:30:41.779 --> 00:30:45.259
right thing. I would say, you know,
this is, the only thing, if there was anything,

00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:48.499
like it even allowed you to continue the thing
by hitting the continue

00:30:48.499 --> 00:30:52.539
button. Like, they've really understood the
flow, and the way it should be. If there's

00:30:52.539 --> 00:30:56.749
anything if I had to nitpick,
this looks like a dialog, and I might expect

00:30:56.749 --> 00:31:01.049
hitting the back key actually gets rid of
it, rather than backs out, but it’s--

00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:05.659
&gt;&gt;Ian: But if they say our pocket GDC, you
know what they're probably thinking is we

00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:11.220
have options, and then in our pocket
IO, we changed that and said, you know what,

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.249
that other option wasn't very good, so.

00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:14.289
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:14.289 --> 00:31:15.289
&gt;&gt;Ian: But anyway.

00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:18.099
&gt;&gt;Dan: But, in general, I actually think the
fact that you can just immediately continue

00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:19.099
like that is awesome.

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:22.289
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah. I'm really impressed, so we're
gonna go ahead and nominate this.

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:23.289
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:23.289 --> 00:31:25.159
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'll tell you what I think is going
to happen, I think what's going to happen

00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:30.259
is, people are going to like this, and,
ya know, I don't know, we got a few people

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:37.019
on the editorial board that might frown on
it, in general, the 8-bit stuff

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:40.719
if it's a good game, we like it, but a lot
of times it won't be featured immediately.

00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:41.719
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:47.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: And the main reason is that we're still
worried that the average Google Play subscriber

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.610
is not going to understand
the 8-bit motif, they're not going to see

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.879
it as an homage. They're going to see it as
something that either looks ugly to

00:31:56.879 --> 00:32:03.019
them or reflects badly on the platform. But
I'll tell ya, Tarvaris who does our merchandising

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:05.139
is a huge retro gamer, and--

00:32:05.139 --> 00:32:06.479
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, he'll love it, and--

00:32:06.479 --> 00:32:07.899
&gt;&gt;Ian: He put together the Indie games.

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:09.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, he did.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: The Indie games collection last week,
and we're really hoping to do a retro games

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.260
collection soon.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.589
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. I very much want to do that,
and this would be a perfect one for that.

00:32:16.589 --> 00:32:19.732
I think the only issue with the game is
it can get a little frustrating at times,

00:32:19.732 --> 00:32:20.879
because of the jumping.

00:32:20.879 --> 00:32:23.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: But that is all about retro games.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is.

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.239
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you're not tearing your hair out
on a retro game then it's not truly a retro

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:27.239
game.

00:32:27.239 --> 00:32:28.239
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's actually how I lost all of my
hair.

00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:29.239
&gt;&gt;Ian: hmm.

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:30.239
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, umm.

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:31.239
&gt;&gt;Ian: Except for this piece in the back?

00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:33.299
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yea, except for this piece in the back.
Um so, uh.

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:34.499
&gt;&gt;Ian: I just touched Dan's hair,

00:32:34.499 --> 00:32:35.499
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:36.499
&gt;&gt;Ian: it felt so weird.

00:32:36.499 --> 00:32:42.159
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dirty. All right so, next game we're
looking at, um, let's go to Awesome. Is that

00:32:42.159 --> 00:32:43.159
okay?

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:44.159
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sure.

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.159
&gt;&gt; Dan: All right.

00:32:45.159 --> 00:32:46.159
&gt;&gt;Ian: AWEsum!!!

00:32:46.159 --> 00:32:50.070
&gt;&gt; Dan: AWEsum! is a game that is hopefully
going to show up in portrait, yes it did.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: NO WAY!! Thank you, Doctor HDMI.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.299
[Dan laughs]

00:32:54.299 --> 00:33:00.519
&gt;&gt;Dan: So and to ASUS for putting this really
awesome HDMI set of settings in.

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:01.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:02.519
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, AWEsum.

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.929
[Ian sneezes]
Again I'm going to play like this, which looks

00:33:04.929 --> 00:33:09.919
even dorkier than, you can go back to camera
two to see just how dorky this

00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:17.860
actually looks. But again, this is my goal
of trying to keep the HDMI cord in. MicroAge

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:23.889
HDMI is not meant for the person who
wants to hold their device, jiggle it around,

00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:26.749
and play games. It is meant for it sitting
on a table.

00:33:26.749 --> 00:33:31.029
&gt;&gt;Ian: So if anybody wants to release a tablet
with a BNC connection, we're all over that.

00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:32.029
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. Absolutely.

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:33.080
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: Show up and take my money.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.139
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly!

00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:35.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200
[Laughter]

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.889
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, AWEsum is actually--

00:33:37.889 --> 00:33:40.419
&gt;&gt;Ian: By the way, do we have a [unintelligible]
cam today?

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:42.470
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: Sadly we do not.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.149
&gt;&gt;Dan: Argh, that's so sad.

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:45.489
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really, that's too bad.

00:33:45.489 --> 00:33:46.489
&gt;&gt;Ray-To: [unintelligible] a BNC cable

00:33:46.489 --> 00:33:50.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: So AWEsum! is a game that's uh, I think
it's a game that's great for kids. If I had

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.909
a kid, I would totally encourage
them to play this game. The goal is to actually

00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:59.099
sum up numbers. In this case the sum is eleven,
you can see it on the top

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:04.330
left hand corner of the screen, and the goal
is to drop these things to get it to eleven,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.500
ninety-nine, none of those will
match up, however, eight and three will, I

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:13.010
can drop that on, and boom, now that goes
away. So it teaches kids basic

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:19.990
arithmetic tables, as well as teaches them,
um, gamer elite skills I guess.

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Is it always eleven?

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Uh, no. The sum will change. And I
mean, like, at some point you just have to

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.810
say I'm going to drop them, cause
there's just nothing I can do, none of these

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.330
are going to add up, you know, uh, and you
only have a limited number of those

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.970
retries. So there is certain about of luck
involved here. What's even cooler is if you

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.580
can get an AWEsum!, where both add
up to eleven.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.919
&gt;&gt;Ian: I really wish you could play the sound
effects. Can I simulate the sound effects?

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:45.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes. You can.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:46.780
&gt;&gt;together: AWESUM!!!!!!

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: Twelve, now it's switched to twelve,
and now you'll see whether I can actually

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.400
add anything to twelve, which
I can't.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: Except the thing is, we don't sound
enough like just laid back California surfer

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.010
dudes.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: No. You can also rotate these.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Awesome. Bogus, dude.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: You can also rotate these like that,
so, Oh shit.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Choke it, dude.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:11.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: I totally screwed, I could have made
an AWEsum! there, but instead I'm just gonna

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.350
drop it, because unfortunately.
All right.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: BOGUS!

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:23.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thanks. So we're now actually testing
really to see if I can add, which is questionable.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.540
It's actually being nice,
it's giving me things that are allowing me

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: AWEsum!

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.340
&gt;&gt;Dan: That are allowing me to get rid of
the really tall stack there. All right, that'll

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.480
work. I still haven't managed to
get a quote unquote AWEsum! yet, but as you

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.910
can see, the game is cool and yeah, I think
actually it's going help teach kids

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:44.430
arithmetic, which I really like. There's not
a lot of games out there that would have what

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:49.080
I would consider a mildly
educational component to them. So, uh, yeah

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.940
I like it. The game doesn't do anything particularly
wrong. It actually looks

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.290
quite good on a tablet. The only thing we
ran into this game, and I never actually managed

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.340
to figure out why, was it wasn't
showing up on a Galaxy Nexus.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right. We were really curious about
that because we looked at the game's listing

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:08.500
and the only thing that they were
filtering on was ETC1, which everything should

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500
have.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.180
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly. So I'm not sure what
was going on with that.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.780
&gt;&gt;Ian: But it doesn't actually show up on
a Galaxy Nexus. I will say this, that filtering

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.040
on ETC1 is, um.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a, I think there are like I think
maybe two devices that we've ever shipped

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.520
that don't support ETC1, but--

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: Probably not necessary, but you never
know.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.911
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly. But if that's really the reason
why it's not showing up, we need to figure

00:36:31.911 --> 00:36:36.750
that out. So. that's AWEsum! it
is a really cool game. I definitely want to

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.750
nominate it.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:43.051
&gt;&gt;Ian: The other thing I love about this is
that "awe" in their title is totally in the

00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:46.940
D.A.R.E. to keep your kids off
drugs font from the 80's.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, exactly.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: And not, can you show that for just
a second there Ray-To?

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. D.A.R.E. It totally is.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: I told you it was a very special episode.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it needs to have a little period
next to each one of them to it can be some

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:02.550
sort of acronym.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: That would be so cool.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:08.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: That would be so much cooler, yeah.
So um, one thing, one review comment for you

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:15.560
guys. But overall, the game is great
and good job guys! Don't have a lot to say

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.860
about that. The final one that we are officially
looking at is Krafteers.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:29.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, so this is an interesting game.
I didn't know what to expect when I loaded

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.750
it up, I wasn't super happy with
the way it looked on phones honestly, um,

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:43.290
but mostly, it wasn't bad, it's just that
on my Galaxy Nexus, all these buttons

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.690
were just a little small.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:49.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: They definitely, I definitely feel
like there is, they're even a little small

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.270
on the tablet to be honest. I would
inflate--

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:54.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah. I would say, if you could inflate
by even twenty percent I think you'd be there.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, that was definitely my feeling
while I was playing it. Um the game is cool

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:04.530
actually. It's a game in which you
build things and then you fight things with

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:11.490
the things that you built. And if you like
taking lots of objects and

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.570
looking all over to find them, and figuring
out how to do things. It's actually really

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.570
fun.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:22.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's actually like an easier to discover
version of Minecraft, in a way. I mean, the

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.640
crafting and defense mechanic I mean.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: yeah.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, you'll do things like you'll
pick up a log and make a club out of it, and

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.921
you'll club a tree to death, I'm
not actually sure how that works, but, you'll

00:38:32.921 --> 00:38:33.921
club down a tree.

00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:34.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, you'll club down a tree.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: And then you'll club its trunk into
planks.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.150
&gt;&gt;Dan: You club its trunk into planks, and
you'll club its planks into sticks.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.150
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you might need sticks and planks
to build something. Sometimes you also get

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.120
a little bit of straw, which also may
be useful.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: You'll use that to build a fire which
is magical, because I thought you needed wood

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.790
for a fire, but apparently
straw is good.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: Straw is good enough, yeah.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:01.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: Then you can also club, oh no, I'm
sorry, you can't club stones, you need to

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.620
get a stick.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Flint.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: And flint to get a pickaxe.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: And the flint you just find..

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh and a vine from the vine tree.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: And a vine from the vine tree, exactly.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: And, uh, yeah. I mean you can see it's
something kind of interesting.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: We've just proven that we've both played
through the tutorial. Awesome!

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:15.420
[Hands smacking]

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, uh, almost lost my cheese there.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: So.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:25.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, uh, oh yeah, so the one thing I
would say, we can't really show you to demonstrate

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.690
this, this game does have
music on the live stream though.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: Which made me sad,

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.110
&gt;&gt;Ian:Babababbabida

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:39.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: No one watches our show, so um yeah.
Fix that. I actually think it's an interesting

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.540
game to feature. I'm really
curious what the team would think about it.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:53.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think it's decent. It's not a novel
game, and there are games like this, I will

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.970
say it's a little novel in the
sense that I went through the entire tutorial

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.620
and it didn't ask me to buy anything. So.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: OH!

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:05.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: For this particular genre, not being
nickeled and dimed was actually kind of nice.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now it did bring up an ad, and I will
say that the one bug was when I clicked on

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:13.720
the ad, it took me into Google Play
to buy something. I clicked back and I never

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.840
got the game back. So.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:24.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, and this is a real problem, it's
very common to mess up the transitions when

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:29.790
your app loses focus, when your
app pauses or stops. You really need to make

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:36.350
sure that you stay where you are and do everything
you can to make it quick to get back in.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:42.050
I noticed this too, I locked up my phone and
then went back in and it has to reload again,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:48.600
and it's a real pain. Now on
Honeycomb Above, you can use the API, what's

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.740
the API again? To not lose your context?

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:56.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: I am not sure how Tiny Village keeps
showing up here also. It's sometimes when

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.820
I randomly click on the screen even
when I don't see an ad, it just randomly goes

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:06.590
there. I haven't figured that one out. I clicked
the full version.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.310
So this doesn't actually pop up full screen
but what I ended up having, when I was in

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:14.650
game, was, there was in game ad of
this and I hit the back key to get out and

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.790
then I was stuck forever.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:16.790
&gt;Ian: OH really?

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. It doesn't happen when you buy
through.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, you need to watch out for that.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:21.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:25.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, the in app purchase is always
going to pop up as a dialog on the tablet,

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520
yeah.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is what actually--

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: I kinda wish it would do that on the
phone too.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:34.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's kind of a mixed bag, honestly,
in terms of how good it is. The advantage

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.560
of it popping up full screen is
that the system is guaranteed to have enough

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.910
memory to actually launch the play store.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yes but the advantage of it--

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.390
&gt;&gt;together: Not popping up full screen is
that it's not going to try to reclaim your

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:48.390
app.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:54.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: And ninety percent of the time, I mean,
there are a few games that we found where

00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:00.920
the play store and your app really
can't co-exist. But in general, the issue

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.500
is, if the play store needs more memory, what's
it going to kill first? Is it

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.080
going to kill like ten random things that
are taking up a couple megs each?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually, the play store doesn't kill
anything, it is what is the android platform

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.780
going to try to kill off to free
up more memory.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right. I'm sorry, I meant the play
store client.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:23.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. When the android platform is
trying to make room for that play store client,

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.720
what's it going to kill? Well,
it's gonna say, huh, this is one really big

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.430
application that's taking up hundreds of megabytes
of RAM and it's--

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's in the background now---

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's in the background now so I'm going
to kill it off.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.600
&gt;&gt;Ian: Stay tuned on that because we're going
to maybe make some progress there. But for

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.550
right now, the lesson to be gleaned
from this if you've got anything that hides

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:51.060
your app, whether it's an ad, or an in app
purchase, some sort of capillary,

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:58.530
or, offer wall, any of those things, if they're
in a different process and they need more

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.800
memory, it could result in your
process stopping. You need to be really careful

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.900
about testing that sort of thing, and making
sure that your process can

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.701
resume in a way that's not going to annoy
the user.

00:43:09.701 --> 00:43:12.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely. The final thing I actually
wanted to go over was Call of Atlantis which

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840
was another game--

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, before we hit Call of Atlantis,
I just wanted to mention, we did have a backup

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.610
beer, and since I think
we're uh,oh no, I'm done and you're not, which

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.610
is good.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's a thousand IBU's, it's a sipping
beer.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:26.110
&gt;&gt;Ian: And it's 9.6 percent alcohol, but I
wanted to share this with you because I know

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.820
that right after this meeting,
you've got a meeting, with the uh--

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: With the Biz Dev people for Call of
Atlantis.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:34.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which is, by the way, completely coincidental.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.581
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, we don't usually, So Call of Atlantis
was really fun. So it was interesting because

00:43:41.581 --> 00:43:46.390
Call of Atlantis
came to us and it actually was a game that

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.950
was letter boxed. And then I said to the guys,
I'm like look you know this

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:56.350
game looks like it was designed to not run
on anything other than a PC and can you guys

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.310
do something about it? And most
developers when I say this are like no it

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.820
was not designed and we're not going to touch
it and you know what ever.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Our designers like it that way.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:09.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah our designers, but they actually
came and said let's think about it. What they've

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:13.280
done, as you can see here
There's actually stuff, the game originally

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.510
ended between the columns on the left and
right hand side of the screen. They

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.270
simply extended, they added additional graphics
and they extended it with this little border.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:27.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's, so all that Tuscany marble-y
stuff on the left and the right, was not there,

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.350
it was just black before, right?

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:33.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly, it was just black and it was
funny, because I first looked at it, I said,

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:38.090
well, you know, it’s not
necessarily exactly what I wanted them to

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.740
do, but as I, I actually played both versions
of the game side by side, and I

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.051
realized as I played this more and more, that
having it fill the full screen and it does

00:44:45.051 --> 00:44:49.490
actually fill the full screen
during various parts, like the load screen,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:54.401
it actually does go full screen there, it
just felt that much better. It was a

00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:59.960
real surprise to me. I mean, we've always
said we wanted people to try to use the full

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:04.730
screen, but in this game, even making
a relatively minor change like adding a background

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:07.531
graphic they could extend and not changing
any other part of the game

00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:12.220
play made an enormous difference in the experience
to someone who was using it. It really made

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.650
it feel like I was playing
something that was meant for my device.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:19.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, and this brings up an interesting
point, is we've talked a lot about different

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.381
screen aspect ratios, and

00:45:21.381 --> 00:45:22.740
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oooo, this is good.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:31.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: Isn't it? this is the barrel aged Bourbon
11, so it's a beer that's been aged in bourbon

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.900
barrels.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: So another thing I'll tell you, when
we first got this game, all of--

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.310
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hang on Hang on--

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.310
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh sorry.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:42.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: You interrupted me with beer, but you
can always interrupt me with beer, but you

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.680
can't interrupt me with other things,
anyway, the point is, we know it can be frustrating

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:51.860
to deal with different aspect ratios, but
there's always some way to do

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.690
it that isn't going to just completely suck,
you know?

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sometimes you can stretch your game,
some games stretch really well, some games

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.670
don't, but you can add a little bit
to either side, sometimes it's just as simple

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:09.060
as hey, you had your scoring area or head,
over the top of the game, and now

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.610
there's some area above that that's just blank,
why don't you just move your head up.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly, so so

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:19.460
&gt;&gt;Ian: The one thing you don't want to do
is, and this is what I was getting to, is

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:26.480
try to game the system by defining
compatible screens and making really specific

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.491
aspect ratios for each set of screens, do
you know what happened to all the

00:46:30.491 --> 00:46:33.490
people who declared on compatible screens
today?

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.481
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're not showing up on this device.

00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:39.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right. None of them show up
on the Nexus 7, do you know why?

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Because we didn't think about it?

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exact--NO, we thought about it! I've
been lured!

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:44.770
[Dan Laughs]

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:49.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: The problem is the Nexus 7 is a geometry
that has never been seen before in android.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.650
It's a seven inch device.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well it's--

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's twelve eighty by eight hundred.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: Most importantly it's a DPI that has
never been seen before.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's what I meant. It's quote unquote
T.V. DPI.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.150
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. Well, we haven't really named
it, it's two hundred and thirteen DPI's.

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:04.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oooo, you said the number.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know, I know. So, um.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Don't use compatible screens is the
moral of that story.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, if you can possibly, possibly.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:14.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: Go back to, I know you're rearing to
talk about Call of Atlantis so.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:19.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, one thing we noticed when we were
first playing the game is that the fonts were

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:25.020
very very low resolution, and
it's interesting because when a font is really

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:31.430
really low resolution, your eye tries to focus
that font, it tries to see,

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:37.720
because it looks blurry, and it just makes
you strain to read all the text as if you're

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:43.870
expecting it to somehow, it tricks
your eyes into trying to get it into focus

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:44.870
when it can't.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:50.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: The truth is..that's actually just
Dan, he needs bifocals and we haven't told

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840
him yet.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:58.580
&gt;&gt;Dan:[in a shaky old voice] Thank you Ian.
[Normal voice] Now, back to the game. So we

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.190
asked them, we said, look can you do anything
about the font, and they did, and

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:07.100
honestly the game is much much more playable,
and even though the background is still the

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.600
equal low resolution, you don't
even really notice. The back for the most

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.870
part, the background is a much lower resolution
than the font in the foreground.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:19.360
But the whole game feels a whole lot more
crisp, and it didn't take that much more space.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.370
And it made a huge difference in
the game play.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:28.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: And to put it more technically, what
you want to do is watch your high frequency

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:34.540
art, so fonts are always expected to
be high frequency, you can get away with lower

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:41.730
frequency on other pieces of art, like on
your backgrounds for instance, you

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:49.200
can't always get away with it, but in general
you can. But basically you need to look at

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.571
your game on different displays,
and ask yourself, especially on the 720P or

00:48:55.571 --> 00:49:02.330
even when it releases, the new 1080P tablets.
Look at them and ask yourself,

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:10.240
does your game actually still look good? And
if it doesn't, you might want to start considering,

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:16.040
switching up some art, doing a set
of larger bit maps for instance.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: And that's mostly what they did, but
there are some they didn't bother to do, and

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.630
for the most part, you don't notice
them. I think the key thing is be strategic,

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:28.970
you don't actually necessarily need to change
every piece of art, in order to

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:34.450
get something feeling like a real tablet app.
All of a sudden, this app, which really felt

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:38.340
very low resolution, very
outdated, all of a sudden feels like a modern

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:39.340
application. So.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: It really does. Looks very crisp from
back here. It looks great, and I see what

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:47.810
you mean. The backgrounds are not
necessarily the same resolution, but I think

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:51.690
it's a perfect trade off, what they've done
is they've taken the elements that

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:58.610
are relatively small but high frequency and
put a lot of effort into making those sharp,

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:03.970
and they've taken the elements that
are low frequency, but really really large,

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.780
and they've kept those at a lower effective
resolution, which means they use

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.720
less memory without actually disturbing the
user experience.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly and that’s, I think that,
Again, one of the reasons I wanted to highlight

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.540
this was I really like the trade
offs that they've made. I think they've made

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.840
some very smart decisions. I will say the
only thing left that I really really

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.440
don't like about this game is their icon.
If we can go, if you can see that icon on

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.500
the screen..it just makes me sad
because android icons are not supposed to

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.080
be rounded corner things.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually...let's talk about all of
these icons, because every single one of them

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.570
makes me sad.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: They're all bad.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: And let's just talk about how each
of them could be better. Dead Trigger...does

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.430
not need a rounded rectangle around
it.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:44.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:49.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: No reason. Why not just put, you know,
an outline around the letters?

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: It would be so cool if they just had
some glowing outline in a back of red, ahhh.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.240
Awesome.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: The next one.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: Krafteers

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:03.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: Same basic deal, why not just a pickaxe
and flint? Why does it have to have a background?

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:04.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:09.910
&gt;&gt;Ian: The next one is, well okay, those guys
are little and so's the next one but still..

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:10.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: Tiny Hawk you don't even need to have--

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: why not just have an Alpha background?

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:17.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. Exactly, and AWEsum! definitely
an Alpha background would be awesome. You

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.560
only need the three numbers.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:25.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: 'Cause remember, we know that there
are a lot of guidelines out there, and we

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:31.340
know that a lot of times,
you go with a particular lead skew or a particular,

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.480
or maybe it's the device that your boss owns
or whatever,

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:41.480
and they want everything to look like that
particular OS, but remember that android users

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.470
bought android for a reason,
they usually love their android device and

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:46.760
they want it to look like android.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:52.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: And if you look at those icons on the
bottom, which are mostly android system icons,

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.070
you can see that they all have
unique shapes. And part of the way people

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.220
recognize them is their shapes. You recognize
that the browser is that circle, so

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.480
it actually gives the user something else
to clue into.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:09.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right. Now some of these, sometimes
it's really, like for instance YouTube, YouTube's

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.170
logo has always looked like
that.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, so it looks like that in the browser.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:19.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, so even though, if someone were
to come to us with this icon and say does

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:23.940
this look like an android icon,
honestly, we'd say, no, but if it's part of

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:29.360
your branding, if it's part of the way your
brand looks, all right. But

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:36.791
especially when it's obviously not, and Call
of Atlantis is a great example of this. Call

00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:41.910
of Atlantis has a brand that's
defined by this circular thing.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it's got this dragon in the corner.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:49.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: A circular thing with a dragon in the
corner. Well, the dragon in the corner's just

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:50.410
a badge, right?

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, that's their--

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:52.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: We've got badges, everyone's got badges.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's their Playrix brand.

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: And then the game is actually the circle,
well, it would actually be really cool to

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:03.960
just have it be a circle you
know? And we have full Alpha in these support

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.940
in these icons and it can look really really
great.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: It doesn't actually need to have this
thing on the background. So, you know, that's

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:15.490
a general call to developers,
think of, your brand is very very important,

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:19.780
think about how you can make your application
stand out on android by taking

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.070
advantage of the fact that you can use funky
shapes.

00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:27.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep. Absolutely, and you'll, and the
really really nice thing about this is, instead

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:33.250
of just having a featureless
set of uniform rounded rectangles, your user

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:39.520
will be looking at things where not only the
picture, but also the outline of your icon

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.270
will
become a visual cue to them to know where

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:50.270
your application is and what that icon stands
for. So, in general, if you can, and

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:53.260
we realize that sometimes design departments
are tough to convince.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mmm hmm.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: But if you can convince them that they
don't want the rounded rectangle, you can

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.970
often get a better, more memorable
icon on android.

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:06.130
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely. So we're almost done for
today.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: We are so out of time, we only gave
Ray-To forty-five minutes and we have just

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.720
taken fifty-six, you know why?
Because we're awesome.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:21.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: Rrrrright. Uh, so in any case, definitely
keep nominating stuff to the forum. We really

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.020
really appreciate all the
time you guys put in there.

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Absolutely.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: We really appreciate all the time you
guys put into actually writing games. We've

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.540
been so happy, honestly, with a lot
of the games that have come out onto Google

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540
Play Creation League.

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.400
&gt;&gt;Ian:It's great, yeah. You know, this year
we have seen so much great stuff on Google

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.190
Play, we've still got a few
developers that we really want to bring over,

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:47.590
but in general, the quality is such that,
three years ago we were like, "what

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.230
are we going to feature this week?"
[Dan laughs]

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:53.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: and now it's like, "Oh my God, how
are we, what are we going to reject because

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.550
they're all so good?"

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:59.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. It's great to see everyone taking
to the platform, and to me, I think having

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.370
a Nexus 7 as a reference device
for people to play off is great. What's awesome

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:07.120
is, this a a hundred ninety-nine dollar device
in the U.S. It's a low end

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.120
device!

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's a hundred and ninety-nine dollars,
and it's slightly more capable than an Xbox

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.420
one.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's kind of amazing.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:21.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Almost. I mean Modulo's, some custom
software, it's in the league of the ASUS Transformer

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.420
Prime, which has been our
top performing go to device for a long time,

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.760
and it's only two hundred bucks.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: Which just blows my mind, now, I would
say that I'm gonna buy one for my wife, but

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.770
if I bought one for my wife,
she'd be pissed because I just spent two hundred

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:44.070
bucks. I need to find a way to get it for
free.[Dan laughs] and then

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:48.990
she'll, so I think what I'm going to do get
one for myself for free and then buy one,

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:52.040
and give her the one that was free,
and say it was free.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right, exactly. So.

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.960
&gt;&gt; Ian: My wife's like that. Anyway, but yeah
so--

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: You know, she doesn't watch this program,
fortunately.

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:11.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nah, sometimes she does actually, but,
the other thing that the Tegra 3 platform

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:16.340
I don't want to massively pimp the
Tegra 3 platform, it has its good side and

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:22.540
it has its bad side. You know, it's a platform.
But, you may have noticed that

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:31.410
some companies are betting heavily on it in
the gaming space. Well, here's a chance to

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.710
get a Dev Kit really cheap.

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:37.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't know why we're pimping this
so heavily, because like nobody's going to

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.570
pay us for doing that.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:42.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know, we're gonna get a call from
the guys in Dev and they're going to be like,

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:43.950
"Thank you, we love you all."

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:48.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's just one of those things where
we're, like, you know, phones come out and

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:53.230
sometimes we're like super happy like
oh yeah, this is super great, but, let me

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.680
speak frankly for a moment.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: Is this different than the rest of
the show? [laughs]

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: In the history of android, a lot of
times something will come out and we're like,

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:07.850
you know, that's awesome, but I can
go to the store and get something, a competing

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:14.310
product, that's just as good for either a
lower price, or maybe the same

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:21.060
price but maybe objectively, it's slightly
better in some ways, and this changes all

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:27.890
of that. This is the first product that
we've shipped, where it's competitive on price,

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:34.590
and performance and pretty much everything
else and we've had a lot of fun

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:40.910
playing with it. We've had development devices
in for about two months now, been carrying

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:46.310
them with us, we've been sharing
them with developers in our lab, and every

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:49.630
time I pick one up I'm like, wow, I'm really
happy that we're shipping this

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:50.630
device.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:54.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah. It's a warm and fuzzy feeling
to be proud of something your shipping like

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.750
this, and I'll be from a developer's
perspective, the other thing that's great

00:57:56.750 --> 00:58:02.030
about it is that its video performance tools,
work out of the box on this device.

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:03.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: NO WAY!!

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:04.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, which is awesome.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:05.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: NO WAY! That's so awesome.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.480
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: So basically, I was on the Xbox 360
launch team, and I think that since then,

00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.640
I think this is the first device that
I've been just as excited about.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Awesome.

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:20.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well maybe not quite as excited but
you went out into the desert for the Xbox

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:21.100
360.

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:24.360
&gt;&gt;Dan: I did, I was there freezing in the
desert with everyone else. It was awesome.

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.360
[hands smack]

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:30.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was a good thing that they distributed
sweatshirts to us. So in any case, that's

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:34.000
it for today's Friday Game
Review. Again, continue putting cool stuff

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.180
on the Moderator, we're going to continue
to mix it up a little, I would actually

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:43.140
love to show you guys those performance analysis
tools, and maybe we'll run a game through

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.140
the wringer.

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:49.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let us know. You can give us feedback
on our Google Plus page and you can give us

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:52.050
feedback on YouTube, but we
probably won't read it because let's face

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.750
it, YouTube commenters? come on!
[Laughter]

00:58:55.750 --> 00:59:00.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: but in general we want to know what
you think and we also want to know what you

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:03.880
want to see. Would you like to see
more technical info? Because that's kind of

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.560
our job, we're engineers. Would you like to
see more game reviews? We can do

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:15.370
that too. We are massive gamers. What's most
interesting to you? Anyway, let's sign off

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:21.160
for now. Next week, we'll be back
with another beer and another set of games.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.450
Love you all, see you later.
