Speaker 1:          00:00          Uncle Jake wanted to tell a story about a fighter pilot that he knew when he was a kid and this fighter pilot taught uncle Jake some very important lessons. So here is a story from Uncle Jake

Speaker 1:          00:17          when I was a kid, I had a kid in my fourth grade class named Jonathan that sat behind me in class. He wasn't really my friend, but he was friends with some of my friends. And this boy Jonathan used to talk all the time, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. And it really annoyed me. Not only did he talk, but he had a voice that kind of came out through his nose and it made it even more annoying. He would say, Hey, when are you guys doing? What are you up to? What are you doing? What's happening? How? How are you guys doing nonstop all the time. And the more I was around him, the more I got annoyed. Sometimes I even got angry one day. It really started to get to me. So I told him to just be quiet.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06          And he was quiet for a little while, but not for very long. And then it was talk, talk, talk, talk, talk again, talk, talk, talk.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15          I couldn't stand it. It was so aggravating. Finally, one day I got super annoyed. We were sitting on the ground during reading time and how it's just trying to read and he kept talking. I'd had enough and I finally looked at him and I said, would you just shut your mouth only instead of saying it quietly because I was so mad. It came out way too loud, so loud that everyone in the classroom heard me say it, including the teacher and my teacher did not like that at all and I got in trouble. The teacher, Mrs Tally was her name. She came over and sent me to the principal's office. I was the one that got sent to the principal's office even though it was Jonathan had been talking. Now what was I going to do? As you can imagine, the principal called my house and told my parents I had been in trouble.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Now pay attention here because I have to tell you another part of the story. It's a story within a story, but it will lead back to Jonathan and how that whole situation turned out. You see, there was a man that used to come over to our house. Sometimes he was older than my dad, but not by much. My Dad called him captain. The captain had been in the navy, but he didn't drive ships. He was a pilot in the navy. He flew planes and during the Vietnam War, his plane was shot down and he parachuted to the ground, but when he landed, he was surrounded by the enemy and they captured him and put him into a prisoner of war camp and it was an awful place.

Speaker 2:          03:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:03          there was horrible food and they didn't get much of it and the water made them sick and they lived in baron rooms called prison cells and it was hot and it was miserable and the prisoners were treated horribly by the guards in the prison. They were beaten and they were starved and they were given no freedom to do anything. The only good thing that the prisoners had is that they were not alone. There were other prisoners. They're mostly other pilots that had been shot down and most of the time they lived with each other in these tiny prison cells.

Speaker 2:          03:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:47          I only knew about all this because my dad had told me what had happened to the captain. Well, after I got in trouble at school for getting annoyed at Jonathan who talked all the time and I yelled at him, my dad invited the captain over to my house.

Speaker 2:          04:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:06          And my dad said that the captain wanted to tell me something. Then when we sat down after dinner, the captain looked at me and started to talk and when the captain talked, everybody listened.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:23          The captain spoke slowly and clearly and you could tell that he meant every word he said, and this is what he told me that night. He said, Jake,

Speaker 2:          04:37          okay,

Speaker 1:          04:37          I know you got into some trouble at school.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:40          I know you've got annoyed with another kid and yelled at him during class. Now I want to tell you something. When I was a fighter pilot, I was shot down and got captured by the enemy. I was put into a prison camp and it was a horrible place. And in that prison we had cellmates.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Those were the other prisoners that we lived with and the rooms were small and we were hungry and we were sick and we were tired and we were miserable.

Speaker 2:          05:13          And in that

Speaker 1:          05:15          terrible situation, it would be very, very easy for me to get annoyed with my cellmates. In fact, we all could have gotten annoyed with each other.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:26          Maybe my cellmate snored or maybe he coughed all day and all night. Or maybe he cracked his knuckles all the time or picked his nose or scratched his feet in a gross way. That made me really annoyed.

Speaker 2:          05:42          But Jake,

Speaker 1:          05:45          I was in that prison camp with those other guys for six years.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Six years.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:56          That is a long, long, long time.

Speaker 2:          06:00          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:00          To be in prison. And that is a long, long, long time to be annoyed. And in that prison we didn't have many other choices for friends. It was just us and our cell mates. That's it.

Speaker 2:          06:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:19          So we came up with a rule and the rule was that if someone annoyed us, it wasn't their fault. It was our fault. It was our fault. If we let their snoring bother us, if my roommate snort, it was my fault. If I let that bother me, it was my fault. If I got aggravated at the way my cellmate scratched his feet, it was my fault. If I couldn't stand the way that my cell mate coughed or talked to or cracked his knuckles, it was my fault. That was the rule. We couldn't allow ourselves to get annoyed. Being annoyed would've made that prison much, much worse than it already was, and we couldn't have that and we didn't have that

Speaker 2:          07:23          ever.

Speaker 1:          07:25          So Jake, if you let someone annoys you, you're allowing something that shouldn't control you to control you. You're letting it get inside your head. And I know you're young, but that's no excuse. You can't do that. You have to learn to ignore the little things that annoy you. I promise you,

Speaker 2:          07:50          yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:50          that there are enough things in life that can go wrong. Big things, important things that you'll have to worry about. So don't let these little things bother you. Just accept them and shake them off. Think about something else and don't focus on little things that annoy you, but that don't really matter. Does that make sense to you, Jake?

Speaker 2:          08:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:20          And I said to the captain, yes sir. And I meant it. I couldn't believe what the captain had been through and I couldn't believe that he had this amazing attitude. I could see in him how strong you have to be to stay calm and not let things annoy you. It made me feel like I was a giant Wimp for letting little things bother me. And that was the first lesson that I learned from the captain. And he taught me much, much more over the years. And I'll tell you more about those lessons later. But this first lesson, it was an important one. And after that, when I went back to school and I heard Jonathan Talk, talk, talk, talking in his annoying voice high, just let it go. It wasn't a big deal anymore and I was strong enough to deal with it. And that's the lesson I learned. I learned it from Jonathan, but more I learned it from the captain. And to this day, even as a grown man, all these years later when some little thing is bothering me or annoying me, I think of how much worse things could be. And I just ignore that little thing. And even if I can't ignore it, I just keep my thoughts to myself. I keep it inside and I put a smile on my face and I worry about bigger things in the world.

Speaker 1:          09:57          And you know what? When you act like things don't bother you, eventually they don't. So be strong and don't let little things annoy you.
