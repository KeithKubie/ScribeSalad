00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:17.050
Ladybugs, sometimes known as Ladybirds and
less commonly Lady Beetles, are a rarity in

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.480
the insect world in that they’re one of
the few creepy crawly insects we as a species

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.000
don’t actively dislike, due to their habit
of eating the things that destroy our crops.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.960
But just how did this little insect get such
a strange name?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.640
To start, while many members of the Coccinellidae
family are colloquially known as “ladybugs”

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.859
in a number of places in the states, technically
speaking they aren’t considered to be true

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:41.859
bugs.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.719
It’s more fitting to instead refer to them
as beetles.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.059
While it’s certainly true that ladybugs
possess several key qualities that bugs share,

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.870
to be classified as a true bug, a given insect
must also possess “sucking, beak-like mouth

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.739
parts and go from egg to nymph, to adult,
with no larva stage”.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.920
The ladybug neither has the correct mouth
parts nor skips the larval stage, so can’t

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.750
fall under this category.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.799
Instead it is, as mentioned previously, a
member of the beetle family, a group of insects

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.619
characterised by hard “shell-like” exteriors
that often hides a set of delicate wings.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.340
However, the interesting part here isn’t
the “bug” part of “ladybug” name or

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.740
the “bird” part of the other common name-
“ladybird”, with these being somewhat

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.350
obvious in their origins.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.229
The less obvious part is why these tiny voracious
beetles have the word “lady” in their

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.229
name.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.640
At first glance, there doesn’t appear any
particular reason why this should be the case;

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.469
the beetles don’t seem to possess any qualities
associated with the fairer sex.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.380
It turns out, the ladybug isn’t named for
any particular female trait it possesses.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.380
Rather, it is named for a specific lady- the
Virgin Mary.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.380
Why?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.280
This isn’t precisely known.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.359
One of the leading theories is that the name
came about as a result of the ladybug’s

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.759
bright red shell, which is not too dissimilar
from the red cloak Mary is often pictured

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.479
wearing in biblical paintings.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.430
There’s also an old European legend that
states that farmers many hundreds of years

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.110
ago prayed to the Virgin Mary asking for help
to save them from the pests devouring their

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.290
crops and in return she sent a swarm of tiny
beetles bearing her trademark coat to eat

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.290
them.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.739
In truth, ladybugs are known to dine almost
exclusively on insects we humans consider

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.010
pests, like aphids, something old timey farmers
without pesticides or other easy-means of

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.459
keeping their crops protected from destructive
creatures were no doubt incredibly thankful

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.459
for.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.740
Since back in those days it was common to
thank God for almost any good fortune, it’s

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.269
not hard to see how this legend popped up,
and perhaps this gratefulness really did contribute

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.269
to the name.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.270
Whatever the case, as it turns out, people
believing the ladybug was a gift from God

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.660
(or Mary) is supported by the fact that almost
every European country ended up coming up

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.129
with a name for the beetle that linked back
to God or Mary.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.129
For example, in Germany, the word for ladybug
is “Marienkäfer” which translates to

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.220
“Mary’s Beetle”; in France, one common
name is “la bete a bon Dieu” which roughly

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.829
means “God’s animal” while in Russia
a popular name “Bozhya korovka” which

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.319
translates to “God’s little cow”, no
doubt referring to the beetles’ spots which

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.769
are not unlike the kind you’d find on certain
cows.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.810
In fact, one of the alternate early names
for the beetle, before “ladybug” or “ladybird”

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.939
in English was “ladycow”.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.299
The earliest mention of the word “ladybird”,
referring to the beetle, is noted by the Oxford

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.780
English Dictionary to have occurred in 1674
in a dictionary of sorts covering southern

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.030
English words.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.110
It was noted in that work that, at that time,
a common slang term for the “little spotted

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.860
beetle commonly called the Lady cow, or Lady-bird”
was “bishop”, further demonstrating the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:12.310
strong association people had with these beetles
and their religion.
