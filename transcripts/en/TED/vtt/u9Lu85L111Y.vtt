00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:16.484
The youthful perspective on the future,

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:19.662
the present perspective on the future

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:24.233
and the future, mature
perspective on the future --

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.778
I'd like to try and bring
all those three tenses together

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.931
in one identity tonight.

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:34.762
And you could say
that the poet, in many ways,

00:00:34.786 --> 00:00:38.578
looks at what I call
"the conversational nature of reality."

00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:40.858
And you ask yourself:

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:43.113
What is the conversational
nature of reality?

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:46.455
The conversational nature
of reality is the fact

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.649
that whatever you desire of the world --

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.077
whatever you desire of your partner
in a marriage or a love relationship,

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.108
whatever you desire of your children,

00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:59.945
whatever you desire of the people
who work for you or with you,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.317
or your world --

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.823
will not happen exactly
as you would like it to happen.

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:08.019
But equally,

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.335
whatever the world desires of us --

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.334
whatever our partner,
our child, our colleague,

00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:15.547
our industry,

00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.258
our future demands of us,

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:19.976
will also not happen.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.953
And what actually happens

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:26.357
is this frontier
between what you think is you

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.217
and what you think is not you.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.378
And this frontier of actual meeting

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:34.496
between what we call a self
and what we call the world

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.238
is the only place, actually,
where things are real.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.250
But it's quite astonishing,

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:43.455
how little time we spend
at this conversational frontier,

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:49.138
and not abstracted away from it
in one strategy or another.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:54.377
I was coming through immigration,

00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:57.901
which is quite a dramatic
border at the moment,

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:00.382
into the US last year,

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:03.371
and, you know, you get off
an international flight

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:04.547
across the Atlantic,

00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:06.266
and you're not in the best place;

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.843
you're not at your most
spiritually mature.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.132
You're quite impatient
with the rest of humanity, in fact.

00:02:12.156 --> 00:02:16.531
So when you get up to immigration
with your shirt collar out

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:18.044
and a day's growth of beard,

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:21.407
and you have very little patience,

00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:24.159
and the immigration officer
looked at my passport

00:02:24.183 --> 00:02:26.291
and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:31.457
I said, "I work with the conversational
nature of reality."

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:35.392
(Laughter)

00:02:36.964 --> 00:02:39.233
And he leaned forward over his podium

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:42.187
and he said, "I needed you last night."

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:44.599
(Laughter)

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:46.927
(Applause)

00:02:48.363 --> 00:02:49.513
And I said, "I'm sorry,

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:52.620
my powers as a poet
and philosopher only go so far.

00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:53.857
I'm not sure I can --"

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:55.418
But before we knew it,

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:58.872
we were into a conversation
about his marriage.

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:00.569
Here he was in his uniform,

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:02.061
and the interesting thing was,

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:04.298
he was looking up and down
the row of officers

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:07.351
to make sure his supervisor didn't see

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:09.865
that we was having a real conversation.

00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:14.073
But all of us live
at this conversational frontier

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:16.185
with the future.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.963
I'd like to put you in the shoes
of my Irish niece,

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:21.738
Marlene McCormack,

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:25.206
standing on a cliff edge
on the western coast of Spain,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.237
overlooking the broad Atlantic.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:31.018
Twenty-three years old,
she's just walked 500 miles

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:34.624
from Saint Jean Pied de Port
on the French side of the Pyrenees,

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.425
all the way across Northern Spain,

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.460
on this very famous,
old and contemporary pilgrimage

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:44.019
called the Camino de Santiago
de Compostela --

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:46.959
the Path to Santiago of Compostela.

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:51.431
And when you get to Santiago, actually,

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.230
it can be something of an anticlimax,

00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:55.576
because there are 100,000
people living there

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.791
who are not necessarily applauding you
as you're coming into town.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:03:59.816
(Laughter)

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.167
And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you
a memento of your journey.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.306
But you do have the possibility
of going on for three more days

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.725
to this place where Marlene stood,
called, in Spanish, Finisterre,

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:18.726
in English, Finisterre,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.167
from the Latin,
meaning "the ends of the earth,"

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:25.238
the place where ground turns to ocean;

00:04:25.262 --> 00:04:29.647
the place where your present
turns into the future.

00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:32.256
And Marlene had walked this way --

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.974
she just graduated as a 23-year-old
from the University of Sligo

00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:38.375
with a degree in Irish drama.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.791
And she said to me, "I don't think
the major corporations of the world

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:43.220
will be knocking on my door."

00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:46.316
I said, "Listen, I've worked
in corporations all over the world

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.493
for decades;

00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:51.244
a degree in drama is what would most
prepare you for the adult --

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:52.285
(Laughter)

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.464
corporate world."

00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:55.028
(Applause)

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.111
But she said, "I'm not
interested in that, anyway.

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:01.758
I don't want to teach drama,
I want to become a dramatist.

00:05:01.782 --> 00:05:03.414
I want to write plays.

00:05:04.132 --> 00:05:08.623
So I walked the Camino
in order to give myself some courage,

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:10.826
in order to walk into my future."

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.496
And I said, "What was the most powerful
moment you had on the whole Camino,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.064
the very most powerful moment?"

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:17.996
She said, "I had many powerful moments,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.040
but you know, the most powerful
moment was post-Camino,

00:05:22.064 --> 00:05:26.316
was the three days you go on from Santiago
and come to this cliff edge.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.956
And you go through three rituals.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.601
The first ritual is to eat
a tapas plate of scallops" --

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.190
or if you're vegetarian,

00:05:34.214 --> 00:05:36.667
to contemplate the scallop shell.

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.142
(Laughter)

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:42.454
Because the scallop shell has been
the icon and badge of your walk,

00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:45.255
and every arrow
that you have seen along that way

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.344
has been pointing underneath
a scallop shell.

00:05:49.368 --> 00:05:51.453
So really, this first ritual is saying:

00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:53.385
How did you get to this place?

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.245
How did you follow the path to get here?

00:05:56.963 --> 00:06:02.085
How do you hold the conversation of life
when you feel unbesieged,

00:06:02.109 --> 00:06:03.267
when you're unbullied,

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:04.699
when you're left to yourself?

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:09.636
How do you hold the conversation of life
that brings you to this place?

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:14.629
And the second ritual is that you burn
something that you've brought.

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:17.610
I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:20.074
She said, "I burned a letter
and two postcards."

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.812
I said, "Astonishing.

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:23.880
Twenty-three years old and you have paper.

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:25.080
I can't believe it."

00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:26.414
(Laughter)

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:28.089
I'm sure there's a Camino app

00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:32.521
where you can just delete
a traumatic text, you know?

00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.077
(Laughter)

00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:36.117
It will engage the flashlight,

00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.773
imbue it with color

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.941
and disappear in a firework of flames.

00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:45.340
But you either bring a letter
or you write one there,

00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:46.537
and you burn it.

00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:50.905
And of course we know intuitively
what is on those letters and postcards.

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:56.621
It's a form of affection and love
that is now no longer extant, yeah?

00:06:58.434 --> 00:06:59.993
And then the third ritual:

00:07:01.194 --> 00:07:05.631
between all these fires
are large piles of clothes.

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.858
And you leave an item of clothing

00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:11.270
that has helped you to get to this place.

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:15.143
And I said to Marlene,
"What did you leave at the cliff edge?"

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:16.592
She said, "I left my boots --

00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:18.767
the very things
that I walked in, actually.

00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:21.266
They were beautiful boots,
I loved those boots,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.276
but they were finished
after seven weeks of walking.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.825
So I walked away in my trainers,

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.136
but I left my boots there."

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.041
She said, "It was really incredible.

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:33.449
The most powerful moment was,
the sun was going down,

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:36.179
but the full moon was coming up behind me.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.606
And the full moon was illuminated
by the dying sun in such a powerful way

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.308
that even after the sun
had dropped below the horizon,

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.571
the moon could still see that sun.

00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:51.164
And I had a moon shadow,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:57.208
and I was looking at my moon shadow
walking across the Atlantic,

00:07:57.232 --> 00:07:59.019
across this ocean.

00:07:59.614 --> 00:08:00.765
And I thought,

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:03.385
'Oh! That's my new self
going into the future.'

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:09.394
But suddenly I realized
the sun was falling further.

00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:13.539
The moon was losing its reflection,

00:08:13.563 --> 00:08:15.827
and my shadow was disappearing.

00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:18.963
The most powerful moment
I had on the whole Camino

00:08:18.987 --> 00:08:24.975
was when I realized I myself
had to walk across that unknown sea

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:26.406
into my future."

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:29.653
Well, I was so taken by this story,

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:31.002
I wrote this piece for her.

00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:32.531
We were driving at the time;

00:08:32.555 --> 00:08:34.228
we got home, I sat on the couch,

00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:36.029
I wrote until two in the morning --

00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:37.447
everyone had gone to bed --

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.318
and I gave it to Marlene
at breakfast time.

00:08:40.342 --> 00:08:43.513
It's called, "Finisterre,"
for Marlene McCormack.

00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:47.728
"The road in the end

00:08:47.752 --> 00:08:52.484
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:56.199
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:08:56.223 --> 00:08:58.617
into the western sea

00:08:58.641 --> 00:09:01.606
the road in the end
taking the path the sun had taken

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.488
into the western sea

00:09:03.512 --> 00:09:04.679
and the moon

00:09:04.703 --> 00:09:06.989
the moon rising behind you

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:11.371
as you stood where ground turned to ocean:

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:13.303
no way to your future now

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:14.519
no way to your future now

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:17.306
except the way your shadow could take,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.643
walking before you across water,
going where shadows go,

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:25.493
no way to make sense of a world
that wouldn't let you pass

00:09:25.517 --> 00:09:29.232
except to call an end
to the way you had come,

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:35.561
to take out each letter you had brought

00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:38.050
and light their illumined corners;

00:09:38.074 --> 00:09:43.158
and to read them as they drifted
on the late western light;

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.387
to empty your bags

00:09:44.411 --> 00:09:45.964
to empty your bags;

00:09:45.988 --> 00:09:48.717
to sort this and to leave that

00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:51.082
to sort this and to leave that;

00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:56.345
to promise what you needed
to promise all along

00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:59.205
to promise what you needed
to promise all along,

00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:03.913
and to abandon the shoes
that brought you here

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.786
right at the water's edge,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.371
not because you had given up

00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:09.016
not because you had given up

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.881
but because now,

00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:13.088
you would find a different way to tread,

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.855
and because, through it all,

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:17.280
part of you would still walk on,

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:18.788
no matter how,

00:10:18.812 --> 00:10:20.364
over the waves."

00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:23.946
"Finisterre."

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.324
For Marlene McCormack --

00:10:25.348 --> 00:10:31.689
(Applause)

00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:37.837
who has already had
her third play performed

00:10:37.861 --> 00:10:40.976
in off-off-off-off-Broadway --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.165
in Dublin.

00:10:42.189 --> 00:10:43.202
(Laughter)

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.600
But she's on her way.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.365
This is the last piece.

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:53.511
This is about the supposed arrival
at the sum of all of our endeavors.

00:10:53.922 --> 00:10:55.334
In Santiago itself --

00:10:55.358 --> 00:10:56.596
it could be Santiago,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.925
it could be Mecca,

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:59.117
it could be Varanasi,

00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:00.703
it could be Kyoto,

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.994
it could be that threshold
you've set for yourself,

00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:12.348
the disturbing approach
to the consummation of all your goals.

00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:17.681
And one of the difficulties
about walking into your life,

00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:19.138
about coming into this body,

00:11:19.162 --> 00:11:21.533
into this world fully,

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.998
is you start to realize

00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:30.329
that you have manufactured
three abiding illusions

00:11:30.353 --> 00:11:34.375
that the rest of humanity has shared
with you since the beginning of time.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:39.207
And the first illusion
is that you can somehow construct a life

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:41.414
in which you are not vulnerable.

00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:47.471
You can somehow be immune
to all of the difficulties

00:11:47.495 --> 00:11:51.679
and ill health and losses

00:11:51.703 --> 00:11:56.051
that humanity has been subject to
since the beginning of time.

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:57.791
If we look out at the natural world,

00:11:57.815 --> 00:11:59.319
there's no part of that world

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:03.295
that doesn't go through cycles
of, first, incipience,

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:04.521
or hiddenness,

00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:06.974
but then growth, fullness,

00:12:07.713 --> 00:12:11.235
but then a beautiful,
to begin with, disappearance,

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:14.282
and then a very austere,
full disappearance.

00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:16.413
We look at that, we say,
"That's beautiful,

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:20.710
but can I just have the first half
of the equation, please?

00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:22.729
And when the disappearance is happening,

00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:25.805
I'll close my eyes and wait
for the new cycle to come around."

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:29.821
Which means most human beings
are at war with reality

00:12:29.845 --> 00:12:31.653
50 percent of the time.

00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:37.601
The mature identity

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:40.859
is able to live in the full cycle.

00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:42.536
The second illusion is,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.087
I can construct a life
in which I will not have my heart broken.

00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:49.750
Romance is the first place
we start to do it.

00:12:49.774 --> 00:12:53.198
When you're at the beginning
of a new romance or a new marriage,

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:57.361
you say, "I have found the person
who will not break my heart."

00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:59.150
I'm sorry;

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:04.572
you have chosen them out unconsciously
for that exact core competency.

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:05.906
(Laughter)

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.267
They will break your heart.

00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:08.447
Why?

00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.081
Because you care about them.

00:13:10.105 --> 00:13:12.271
You look at parenting, yeah?

00:13:12.295 --> 00:13:15.423
Parenting: "I will be
the perfect mother and father."

00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:18.362
Your children will break your heart.

00:13:18.386 --> 00:13:22.140
And they don't even have to do
anything spectacular or dramatic.

00:13:23.077 --> 00:13:26.986
But usually, they do do something
spectacular or dramatic --

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.031
(Laughter)

00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:29.333
to break your heart.

00:13:30.095 --> 00:13:33.471
And then they live with you
as spies and saboteurs for years,

00:13:33.495 --> 00:13:36.333
watching your every psychological move,

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:39.055
and spotting your every weakness.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:40.245
And one day,

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:42.397
when they're about 14 years old,

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.891
with your back turned to them,

00:13:43.915 --> 00:13:45.159
in the kitchen,

00:13:45.183 --> 00:13:47.346
while you're making something for them --

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.378
(Laughter)

00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:50.909
the psychological stiletto goes in.

00:13:50.933 --> 00:13:53.968
(Laughter)

00:13:53.992 --> 00:13:57.273
(Applause)

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:02.752
And you say, "How did you know
exactly where to place it?"

00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.791
(Laughter)

00:14:03.815 --> 00:14:04.974
And they say,

00:14:04.998 --> 00:14:06.523
"I've been watching you for --

00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:07.558
(Laughter)

00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:08.928
a good few years."

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:17.072
And then we hope that our armored,
professional personalities

00:14:17.096 --> 00:14:20.232
will prevent us from having our
heart broken in work.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:23.270
But if you're sincere about your work,

00:14:23.977 --> 00:14:25.587
it should break your heart.

00:14:26.173 --> 00:14:27.961
You should get to thresholds

00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:31.504
where you do not know how to proceed.

00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:35.388
You do not know how to get
from here to there.

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:37.963
What does that do?

00:14:37.987 --> 00:14:41.239
It puts you into a proper
relationship with reality.

00:14:41.263 --> 00:14:42.413
Why?

00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:44.264
Because you have to ask for help.

00:14:50.959 --> 00:14:52.347
Heartbreak.

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:54.483
We don't have a choice about heartbreak,

00:14:54.507 --> 00:14:58.482
we only have a choice
of having our hearts broken

00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:03.936
over people and things and projects
that we deeply care about.

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.472
And the last illusion is,

00:15:07.496 --> 00:15:11.933
I can somehow plan enough
and arrange things

00:15:11.957 --> 00:15:15.572
that I will be able to see
the path to the end

00:15:15.596 --> 00:15:17.270
right from where I'm standing,

00:15:17.294 --> 00:15:18.928
right to the horizon.

00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:22.024
But when you think about it,

00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:25.447
the only environment
in which that would be true

00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:27.914
would be a flat desert,

00:15:28.848 --> 00:15:31.459
empty of any other life.

00:15:33.061 --> 00:15:34.658
But even in a flat desert,

00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:37.960
the curvature of the earth
would take the path away from you.

00:15:38.764 --> 00:15:40.318
So, no;

00:15:40.342 --> 00:15:41.957
you see the path,

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:43.863
and then you don't

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:45.822
and then you see it again.

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.966
So this is "Santiago,"

00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:50.777
the supposed arrival,

00:15:51.405 --> 00:15:55.160
which is a kind of return
to the beginning all at the same time.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.134
We have this experience of the journey,

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:00.864
which is in all of our great
spiritual traditions,

00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:02.041
of pilgrimage.

00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:06.335
But just by actually standing
in the ground of your life fully,

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:10.449
not trying to abstract yourself
into a strategic future

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:14.130
that's actually just an escape
from present heartbreak;

00:16:14.154 --> 00:16:16.963
the ability to stand
in the ground of your life

00:16:16.987 --> 00:16:20.376
and to look at the horizon
that is pulling you --

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.718
in that moment,

00:16:21.742 --> 00:16:23.220
you are the whole journey.

00:16:23.244 --> 00:16:25.599
You are the whole conversation.

00:16:27.743 --> 00:16:28.893
"Santiago."

00:16:28.917 --> 00:16:31.899
"The road seen, then not seen

00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:35.258
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.754
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take

00:16:40.778 --> 00:16:43.528
the road seen, then not seen

00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:48.628
the hillside hiding then revealing
the way you should take,

00:16:48.652 --> 00:16:52.302
the road dropping away from you

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:57.076
as if leaving you to walk on thin air,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.275
then catching you,

00:16:58.299 --> 00:16:59.539
catching you,

00:16:59.563 --> 00:17:02.388
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:03.575
catching you,

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:05.935
holding you up,
when you thought you would fall,

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:07.505
and the way forward

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:11.136
the way forward always in the end

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.697
the way that you came,

00:17:12.721 --> 00:17:14.598
the way forward always in the end

00:17:14.622 --> 00:17:15.778
the way that you came,

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:19.136
the way that you followed,
the way that carried you into your future,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.880
that brought you to this place,

00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:23.367
that brought you to this place,

00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:28.649
no matter that it sometimes
had to take your promise from you,

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:33.988
no matter that it always
had to break your heart along the way:

00:17:34.697 --> 00:17:35.878
the sense

00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:40.501
the sense of having walked
from deep inside yourself

00:17:40.525 --> 00:17:42.687
out into the revelation,

00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:45.224
to have risked yourself

00:17:45.248 --> 00:17:51.218
for something that seemed to stand
both inside you and far beyond you,

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:53.739
and that called you back in the end

00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:56.403
to the only road you could follow,

00:17:56.427 --> 00:18:00.780
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:18:00.804 --> 00:18:03.696
walking as you did, in your rags of love

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.641
and speaking in the voice that by night
became a prayer for safe arrival,

00:18:10.665 --> 00:18:12.392
so that one day

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.533
one day you realized

00:18:14.557 --> 00:18:18.040
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:20.016
one day you realized

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.397
that what you wanted
had actually already happened

00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:23.572
and long ago

00:18:23.596 --> 00:18:27.573
and in the dwelling place
in which you lived before you began,

00:18:27.597 --> 00:18:28.753
and that

00:18:28.777 --> 00:18:31.393
and that every step along the way,

00:18:31.417 --> 00:18:33.064
every step along the way,

00:18:33.088 --> 00:18:36.915
you had carried the heart
and the mind and the promise

00:18:36.939 --> 00:18:39.826
that first set you off
and then drew you on,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.013
and that

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:45.910
and that you were more marvelous

00:18:45.934 --> 00:18:48.198
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:48.222 --> 00:18:52.199
you were more marvelous
in your simple wish to find a way

00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:56.460
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach

00:18:56.484 --> 00:19:00.221
you were more marvelous
in that simple wish to find a way

00:19:00.245 --> 00:19:03.151
than the gilded roofs
of any destination you could reach:

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.352
as if, all along,

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:07.469
you had thought the end point
might be a city with golden domes,

00:19:07.493 --> 00:19:08.948
and cheering crowds,

00:19:08.972 --> 00:19:10.919
and turning the corner

00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:15.290
at what you thought
was the end of the road,

00:19:15.314 --> 00:19:18.427
you found just a simple reflection,

00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:22.972
and a clear revelation
beneath the face looking back

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:27.324
and beneath it another invitation,

00:19:27.348 --> 00:19:29.747
all in one glimpse

00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:31.418
all in one glimpse:

00:19:31.442 --> 00:19:32.672
like a person

00:19:33.729 --> 00:19:37.146
like a person or a place
you had sought forever

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.657
like a person or a place
you had sought forever,

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:45.008
like a bold field of freedom
that beckoned you beyond;

00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:46.389
like another life

00:19:46.413 --> 00:19:48.198
like another life,

00:19:48.222 --> 00:19:49.489
and the road

00:19:49.513 --> 00:19:52.805
the road still stretching on."

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.543
(Applause)

00:19:55.567 --> 00:19:56.721
Thank you.

00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:59.822
(Applause)

00:20:01.379 --> 00:20:02.530
Thank you.

00:20:02.554 --> 00:20:05.554
(Applause)
