I only very recently got introduced to

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149
I only very recently got introduced to
 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.220
I only very recently got introduced to
mr. Hitchcock so pelham and I was I felt

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230
mr. Hitchcock so pelham and I was I felt
 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.990
mr. Hitchcock so pelham and I was I felt
a special affinity to his creations and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
a special affinity to his creations and
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.089
a special affinity to his creations and
the more I learned about him realize

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099
the more I learned about him realize
 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.220
the more I learned about him realize
that he has a background in engineering

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230
that he has a background in engineering
 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.960
that he has a background in engineering
was a formally trained engineer a

enormous number of possibilities it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520
enormous number of possibilities it
 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.550
enormous number of possibilities it
gives you it's what I call a platform

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560
gives you it's what I call a platform
 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.580

mindset it is not about solving one

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590
mindset it is not about solving one
 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.610
mindset it is not about solving one
thing but it is about creating a network

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620
thing but it is about creating a network
 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.590
thing but it is about creating a network
of opportunities what we call a solution

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600
of opportunities what we call a solution
 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.569

space because you're just not after one

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579
space because you're just not after one
 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.100
space because you're just not after one
thing but one thing could lead to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110
thing but one thing could lead to
 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.209
thing but one thing could lead to
another and there's so many spillover

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
another and there's so many spillover
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.020

possibilities that could be achieved

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030
possibilities that could be achieved
 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.030
possibilities that could be achieved
through engineering one of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040
through engineering one of the
 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.700
through engineering one of the
approaches that engineers really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710
approaches that engineers really
 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.130

capitalize on is what i call the modular

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140

systems thinking the ability to break

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
systems thinking the ability to break
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.520
systems thinking the ability to break
down a system into its composite modules

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530
down a system into its composite modules
 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.950
down a system into its composite modules
and understand those modules at the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960
and understand those modules at the
 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.289
and understand those modules at the
level of how they are linked to one

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299
level of how they are linked to one
 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.219

space and so forth and rebuilding it

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
space and so forth and rebuilding it
 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.760

back together because that exercise

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770
back together because that exercise
 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.080
back together because that exercise
enables you to isolate and understand

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090
enables you to isolate and understand
 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.760
enables you to isolate and understand
what the strong links are and what the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770
what the strong links are and what the
 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.760
what the strong links are and what the
weak links are within that system Alfred

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770

Hitchcock was I think a pioneer in

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599
Hitchcock was I think a pioneer in
 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.069
Hitchcock was I think a pioneer in
understanding and applying this sort of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
understanding and applying this sort of
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.269
understanding and applying this sort of
thinking the deconstruction that

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:33.279
thinking the deconstruction that
 

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.379
thinking the deconstruction that
reconstruction part of it in his

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389
reconstruction part of it in his
 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.539
reconstruction part of it in his
creations and I think the best example

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549
creations and I think the best example
 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.029
creations and I think the best example
for that is the movie called the rear

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039
for that is the movie called the rear
 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.399
for that is the movie called the rear
window with the Jimmy Stewart he really

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
window with the Jimmy Stewart he really
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.229
window with the Jimmy Stewart he really
exploited the the potential of montage

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:51.239
exploited the the potential of montage
 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.469
exploited the the potential of montage
technique where you break down things

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479
technique where you break down things
 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.330
technique where you break down things
into pieces and then piece them together

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340
into pieces and then piece them together
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.349
into pieces and then piece them together
in different ways so that you have the

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359
in different ways so that you have the
 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.449
in different ways so that you have the
ultimate goal in this case motion

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459
ultimate goal in this case motion
 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.749
ultimate goal in this case motion
picture continuity the narrative

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
picture continuity the narrative
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.029
picture continuity the narrative
progression so I think this montage and

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039
progression so I think this montage and
 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.640
progression so I think this montage and
the modular systems thinking go very

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
the modular systems thinking go very
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.539
the modular systems thinking go very
well and demonstrate how mr. Hitchcock

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549
well and demonstrate how mr. Hitchcock
 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.100
well and demonstrate how mr. Hitchcock
was able to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110
was able to
 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.450
was able to
capitalize on these foundational

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460
capitalize on these foundational
 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.340
capitalize on these foundational
principles of engineering design to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350
principles of engineering design to
 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.680
principles of engineering design to
achieve something potential others

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
achieve something potential others
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.930
achieve something potential others
