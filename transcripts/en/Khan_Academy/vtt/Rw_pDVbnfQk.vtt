00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.280
In the last video, I talked
about some of the weaker

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.990
intermolecular forces or
structures of elements.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.260
The weakest, of course, was the
London dispersion force.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.500
In this video, I'll start with
the strongest structure, and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.530
that's the covalent network.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.950
So if you have a covalent
network crystal-- and let me

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.860
actually define the
word crystal.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.910
Crystal is just when you have
a solid, where the molecules

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.260
that make up the solid are
in a regular, relatively

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.130
consistent pattern, and this is
versus an amorphous solid,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.790
where everything is kind of just
a hodge-podge and there's

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.170
different concentrations of
different things, of different

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.390
ions, and different molecules,
and different

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.270
parts of the solid.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.640
So crystal is just a very
regular structure.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.970
Ice is a crystal, because once
you get the temperature low

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.810
enough in water, the hydrogen
bonds form a crystal, a

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.700
regular structure.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.160
And we've talked about
that a bunch.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.870
But the strongest of all crystal
structures is the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.490
covalent network.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.830
And the biggest, or the prime,
example of that is carbon when

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890
it forms a diamond.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.820
So in the covalent network,
carbon has four valence

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.650
electrons, so it always
wants four more.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310
So when carbon shares with
itself, it's very happy.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.030
So what it can do is it can form
four bonds to four more

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.870
carbons, and then each of those
carbons can form four

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.310
more bonds to four
more carbons.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.900
And this, one, 1, 2, 3, and
it just keeps going on.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.770
This is the structure
of a diamond.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.200
And the reason why this is such
a strong structure is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.180
because you can almost view
the entire-- in fact, you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.300
should view the entire diamond
as one molecule, because they

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.600
all have covalent bonds.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.750
These are actual sharing of
electrons, and these are

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.850
actually the strongest of
all molecular bonds.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.630
So you can imagine if the entire
solid is made out of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.560
this network of carbons,
you're going to have an

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.639
extremely strong, extremely high
boiling point substance,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.710
and that's why a diamond is so
strong, and that's why it's so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.260
hard to boil a diamond.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.640
Now, the next two, and it
depends on your special cases

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.320
of the next most solid version
of a solid, and it depends

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.420
which case you're talking
about, one are the ionic

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.830
crystals, and I'll do them both
here, because one isn't

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.110
necessarily-- ionic crystal--
and the next is the metal.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.110
Well, it's not the next.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.010
They're kind of the
metallic crystal.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.060
And these bonds, I mean, let's
say the most common ionic

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.530
molecule or-- that's not
exactly the right word,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.560
because to some degree, let's
say if I had some sodium and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.930
some chloride-- and just
remember, what happens with

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.740
sodium chloride is sodium here
really has one extra electron

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.600
that it's dying to lose.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.350
Chlorine has seven electrons
and it's dying

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.400
to get a new one.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.570
So sodium essentially donates
its electron to chlorine, and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.370
then the chlorine becomes
negative, the sodium becomes

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.620
positive, and they want to be
near each other, right?

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.420
So you have a positive sodium
ion and a negative chlorine

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.930
ion, and the structure of this
is going to look something

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.990
like this, where they're
all-- so let me do

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.800
the sodium in green.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.370
So you have a bunch of sodium
ions that are positive, and

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.890
then you have a bunch of
chlorine ions that are maybe--

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.230
this isn't the exact way that
they actually are, but I think

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.890
you get the idea, that one atom
is positive and one atom

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.980
is negative, so they really,
really want to be close to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.280
each other.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.620
And so this is a pretty strong
bond, and it has very-- not a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.740
very high boiling point.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.630
It can have a pretty high
boiling point, and this type

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.290
of structure is actually
quite brittle.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.470
So if you take some dry table
salt, not dissolved in water,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.120
if you have a big block of it
and you slam it with a hammer,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.950
you'll see that you'll get,
like, a big slice of it.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.070
It'll just fall off, right?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.700
Because you're essentially just
cutting it along one of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.600
these lines really fast. That's
the interesting thing.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.700
Whenever you do something on
a macroscale, like cut

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.490
something, you really
fundamentally are breaking

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.650
atomic bonds.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.240
So the strength of the atomic
bonds really do tell you about

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.870
how hard or strong
something is.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.470
Now, the metallic crystal we've
talked a lot about.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.950
Metals, they like to get rid of
their electrons, or not get

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.620
rid of them, they like
to share them.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.170
So what happens is, let's say in
the case of iron, you have

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.960
a bunch of iron atoms.
This is all iron.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.120
And their electrons are allowed
to roam free in the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.640
neighborhood.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.605
These are all the electrons.

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:53.750
They're allowed to roam free.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.750
And because of this, it forms
this sea of electrons that are

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.710
negative, and that makes it
a very good conductor of

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.820
electricity.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.120
And, of course, since the iron
atoms have allowed their

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.210
electrons to roam, they all
become slightly positive.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.940
And so they're kind of embedded
in this mesh or this

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.660
sea of electrons.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.060
And so the metallic crystals,
depending on what cases you

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.960
look at, sometimes they're
harder than the ionic

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.060
crystals, sometimes not.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.256
Obviously, we could list a lot
of very hard metals, but we

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:23.670
could list a lot of
very soft metals.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.870
Gold, for example.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.160
If you take a screwdriver and a
hammer, you know, pure gold,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.280
24-carat gold, if you take a
screwdriver and hit it onto

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.030
the gold, it'll dent
it, right?

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.280
So this one isn't as brittle
as the ionic crystal.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.600
It'll often mold to what
you want to do with it.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.350
It's a little bit softer.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.410
Even if you talk about very hard
metals, they tend to not

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.700
be as brittle, because the sea
of electrons kind of gives you

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.570
a little give when you're
moving around the metal.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.030
But that's not to say
that it's not hard.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.750
In fact, sometimes that give
that a metal has, or that

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.880
ability to bend or flex, is
what actually gives it its

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.900
strength because it's allowed to
kind of deflect the force.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.990
So the strength, and I've
touched on this, it also goes

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.820
into the boiling point.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.200
So because these bonds are
pretty strong, it has a higher

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.930
boiling point.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.690
If you just took salt crystal
and tried to boil it, you'd

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.900
have to add a lot of heat
into the system.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.500
So this has a higher boiling
point than say-- I mean,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.540
definitely things that have just
van der Waals forces like

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.610
the noble gases, but it'll also
have a higher boiling

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.590
point than, say, hydrogen
fluoride.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.870
Hydrogen fluoride, if you
remember from the last video,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.970
just had dipole-dipole forces.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.310
But what's interesting about
this is they have a very high

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.600
boiling point unless they're
dissolved in water.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.410
So these are very hard, high
boiling point, but the ionic

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.870
crystals can actually be
dissolved in water.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.400
And when they are dissolved
in water, they form

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.120
ionic dipole bonds.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.022
What does that mean?

00:06:57.022 --> 00:07:04.850
Ionic dipole or ionic
polar bonds.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.810
And this is a situation where
the sodium-- and this is

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.310
actually why it dissolves
in water.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.260
Because the water molecule,
we've gone over this tons of

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.830
times, it has a negative end,
because oxygen is hoarding the

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.970
electrons, and then the hydrogen
ends are positive

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.290
because the electron's pretty
stripped of it.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.820
So when you put these sodium and
chloride ions in the room,

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.020
or in the water solution, the
positive sodiums want to get

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.510
attracted to the negative side
of this dipole, and then the

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:47.450
negative chlorides, Cl minus,
want to go near the hydrogens.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.240
So they kind of get
dissolved in this.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.170
They don't necessarily want to
be-- they still want to be

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.440
attracted to each other, but
they're still also attracted

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.630
to different sides of the water,
so it allows them to

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.780
get dissolved and go with
the flow of the water.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.460
So in this case, when you
actually dissolve an ionic

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.300
crystal into water, as an ionic
crystal, not a good

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.370
conductor of electricity, not a
lot of charge that is really

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.130
movable in this state.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.140
But here, all of a sudden, we
have these charged particles

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.430
that can move.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.670
And because they can move, all
of a sudden, when you put

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.570
salt, sodium chloride, in
water, that does become

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.470
conductive.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.270
So anyway, I wanted you to be
at least exposed to all of

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.580
these different forms
of matter.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.480
And now, you should at least get
a sense when you look at

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.460
something and you should at
least be able to give a pretty

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.780
good guess at how likely it is
to have a high boiling point,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.400
a low boiling point, or
is it strong or not.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.289
And the general way to look at
it is just how strong are the

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.809
intermolecular bonds.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.800
Obviously, if the entire
structure is all one molecule,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.800
it's going to be super-duper
strong.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.530
And on the other hand, if you're
just talking about

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.020
neon, a bunch of neon molecules,
and all they have

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.100
are the London dispersion
forces, this thing's going to

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.600
have ultra-weak bonds.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.250
So a gas is almost its
most natural state.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.040
If you get super, super cold,
you might be able to get it to

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.520
a fluid, and then everything
in between.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.000
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.
