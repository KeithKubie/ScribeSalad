00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.060
We've learned that a
moderate level of inflation

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.350
is normally associated
with a good economy.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.150
But what we saw-- in particular,
we saw in the early '70s,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.010
in 1973, when the
oil embargo hit--

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.920
is that we started to experience
something called stagflation,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.500
or something that was
labeled stagflation.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.290
It's this weird,
bizarre circumstance

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.430
where you have inflation
at the same time

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.120
as the stagnation
in the economy.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.630
So that's where they get
this kind of combination

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.084
of words, of stagflation.

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:30.750
Let's think about how
that would happen.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.250
In particular, let's
think about how

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.189
that would happen due
to a supply shock.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.230
There's other ways that
you could get stagflation

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.020
if you have strange
regulations, over-regulation,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.250
if the government
does weird things.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.869
But the classic example
is a supply shock.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.410
When we say supply shock, it's
something like an oil embargo,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.730
where all of a sudden
the supply of oil,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.480
the supply of something,
just goes down dramatically.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.660
And it could be because
of some type of emergency,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.830
or it could be literally
because of an embargo.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.450
And just think
about how that would

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.260
affect the rest of this chain.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.440
So if the supply of something
dramatically goes down--

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.250
We know that supply has
an inverse relationship

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.920
with price.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.420
So if supply goes down,
then, bam, right there,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.319
you see price would
immediately go up.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.110
And when we think about
something like oil,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100
you might say, hey, oil is
only the part of my pocketbook

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.070
where I drive around.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.080
But it's not, because
even when you buy a fruit,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.121
you're really paying for
the transportation cost.

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.060
So the price of oil affects
fruit, affects food,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.697
affects any good in services.

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:34.280
It's one of these things that's
pervasive through the economy.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.330
So the prices of a bunch of
things could generally go up.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.830
Well, if the price of a bunch
of things generally go up,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.205
what's going to
happen to demand?

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.740
Once again, inverse
relationship right over here.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.700
Demand is going to plummet.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.400
If demand plummets, utilization
plummets, investment plummets,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.910
and profit is going to plummet.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.620
And profit's going
to plummet now

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.550
because, one, utilization
is going down,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.090
and price has gone up.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330
But it's not the price that
they can sell things at.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.120
Now price is fundamentally
a big cost for-- especially

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.450
if you think of it from a
US-centric point of view,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.820
if oil is an import, as in the
case of the early '70s, then

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.860
price going up is
going to have, I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.855
guess they have an
inverse relationship.

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:24.730
So the price goes up.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.438
It's really going to
be on the cost side.

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.350
So once again,
hitting profits hard.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.260
And if all of these
things go down,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.000
that's just going to kill
employment, kill wages,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.770
and then further make
demand even worse.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.890
So stagflation is
that situation where

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.660
you have some type of
shock to the system, where

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.380
in the classic scenario
it hits supply so hard

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.247
it causes a massive inflation
in one part of the economy,

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.830
and as is the case
of oil, a part that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.440
affects other parts
of the economy.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.590
And then all of that kind
of throws a monkey wrench

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.790
in everything else.
