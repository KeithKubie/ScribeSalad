00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.850
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: Hello.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.900
I'm Avnish Miduthuri, and I'm a
Product Manager for Google Pay.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.690
JENNY GOVE: And I'm Jenny, and
I'm a User Experience Research

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.720
Leader Manager for Google Pay.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.510
Today we're going to be
talking about building

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.870
powerful checkout
experiences with Google Pay.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.350
Even though more and more
people are transacting online

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.950
and the number of online
payments is growing each year,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.580
merchants still have trouble
maximizing their conversion

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.080
rates online.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.520
Online checkout is
notoriously problematic,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.840
and we know this because
data shows that more than 70%

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.160
of carts are abandoned
across e-commerce sites.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.260
Of course, we want
customers to be

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.810
able to change their
minds easily when they're

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.710
making a purchase.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.130
However, we don't
want cart abandonment

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.690
due to poor ease of use.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.670
Unfortunately, a lot of it
can be attributed to that.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.360
A significant amount is
due to usability issues

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.380
with form fields.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.310
So for example, studies
have found that 90% of sites

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.640
don't format the
credit card expiration

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
field in exactly the same way
as it is on the physical card

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.740
itself.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.310
And this can lead to all
sorts of errors for users.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.720
They get confused.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.990
There's some dropoff
there when that happens.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.410
Another issue that has been
found is that 86% of sites

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.130
don't clearly mark which
form fields are optional

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.380
and which are required.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.680
And this can lead to users
getting stuck, perhaps

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.220
sometimes even trying to
complete fields that are not

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.270
even applicable to them.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.240
And that can be another
common point of drop off.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
While there are many guidelines
for improving form usability--

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.990
and these are really
important to implement

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.150
wherever you do have a form--

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.690
a better way is to choose
a checkout solution that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.650
minimizes the form field entries
that are required of users.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.320
So what I've shown you so far
is data from audits of sites.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.690
And these are poor
experiences, and we know

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.480
that from usability studies.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.630
These are really facts
about apps and sites

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.580
today and their compliance
with best practices.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.230
But what about
users' perceptions?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.890
Well, 28% of users
report that they

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.310
experience checkout
fails that are

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.190
too long or too complicated.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.860
And that's a reason for why
they abandon their purchase.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.420
You can see that
here on the chart.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.770
There's only a couple
of things that people

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.530
think are worse
than that, and that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.180
is some of the shipping
costs being too high,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.210
and also being required to
create an account before you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.755
check out.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.580
However, the issue of too
long and complicated checkout

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.690
processes is worse for
them than the experiences

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.570
they feel about having
trust with the credit

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.500
card on the site, and also
with regards to how they

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.210
feel about return policies.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.650
It's sometimes the return
policies aren't satisfactory.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.060
So not only does the data show
that checkout processes are

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.350
problematic for users, but users
are really well aware of it

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.100
as well.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.400
Now through our work
with Google Pay,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000
we intend to mitigate these
problems both for users

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.890
and for developers.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.230
Before we get into some
of the new tools we've

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.140
created to help
solve these problems,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.320
we'll give you a quick
recap of Google Pay

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.612
and look at some of
the latest highlights.

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.070
AVNISH MIDUTHURI:
Thank you, Jenny.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.970
Our mission with Google Pay is
to enable the billions of users

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.210
that are signed in to Google to
pay with their Google account

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.310
wherever they are,
whether that's

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.800
online, in apps, in stores, and
of course, when they transact

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.170
with Google apps and services.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.420
Google Pay uses the
payment information

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.690
that users have already saved
to their Google account,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.540
when they set up the
Google Pay app, safeguards

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.030
to Chrome autofill,
or make purchases

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.330
on the Play Store, YouTube,
or several other Google

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.370
properties.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.230
And hundreds of
millions of users

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.520
globally are already enabled
to pay with Google Pay.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.740
As a developer,
Google Pay provides

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.020
you access to all
of these credentials

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.330
when users shop on your
sites and in your apps.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.500
And so by implementing
Google Pay,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.040
you can maximize conversion by
reducing friction at checkout

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.480
and enable your customers to pay
with just a couple of clicks.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.230
And here are just a few
of the largest merchants

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.410
that have done just
that around the world.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.230
From Chipotle, eBay,
Multikino, Ryanair, Yandex

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.480
taxi, many, many more.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.810
Thousands of apps and
hundreds of thousands of sites

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.080
globally now except Google Pay.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.280
And our merchants have
seen great results,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.490
from the Gilt app that
saw a 10% lift in product

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.890
view-to-conversion
from Google Pay users

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.190
over non-Google Pay
users, or Vueling

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.580
that saw a 17% lift in
conversion after they

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.750
implemented Google Pay
on their mobile site.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.480
And Starbucks has seen
such great adoption

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.490
of Google Pay in
their mobile app

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.310
that they're extending that
acceptance to auto reloads

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.830
to further enhance their
customer experience.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.390
And as Google Pay is
expanded globally,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.400
we've worked to
customize the app

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.150
and provide locally relevant
features and experiences.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.100
A great example of
this is in India.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.230
Google Pay launched
in India with support

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.410
for UPI, a Unified
Payment Interface

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.000
that allows for instant
bank-to-bank transfers.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.360
Users in India can use Google
Pay to send money to friends,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.600
pay their utility bills,
recharge their mobile plans,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.740
and of course, pay on their
favorite sites and apps.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.100
And we've seen tremendous
adoption from users in India,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.210
with over 45 million monthly
active users and $81 billion

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.320
in annualized
transaction volume,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.210
and over 2,000 online merchants
that accept Google Pay in India

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.980
alone, varying across use cases
from food delivery, retail,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.730
travel, movie and event tickets,
even trading investments,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.390
and well-known merchants like
[INAUDIBLE],, Book My Show,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.650
and many, many more.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.160
And with simple
hassle-free payments,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.020
Google Pay is helping
accelerate the move

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.140
in India for both users and
merchants from cash to digital.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.920
For example, Uber saw that
50% of their Google Pay users

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.070
in India had previously
transacted with cash.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.990
And on Redbus, a popular
online bus ticketing platform,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.330
15% of their transactions
now come from Google Pay.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.530
And starting just a few
weeks ago, users in India

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.620
can now book train tickets
from Indian Railways

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.890
at no additional cost.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.060
Users can search for, buy, and
even cancel their train tickets

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.797
all from right within the app.

00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:52.380
So that brings you
up to speed on what

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.567
we've been working on recently.

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:56.150
And now we're going
to talk about what

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.820
we're doing to make
Google Pay even better

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.590
for users and developers.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.200
JENNY GOVE: So let's start
with the user experience

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.140
and simplifying
payment experiences.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.930
We're adding new
customer-facing features

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.350
to improve your checkout
in several different ways.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.580
We know that providing more
detail and transparency

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.010
for customers leads to
increased conversion

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.840
rates for businesses.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.320
And with dynamic updates,
the Google Pay sheet

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.250
can display shipping options
and dynamic plans pricing

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.220
with a breakdown
that you provide.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.669
This allows customers to
confirm all relevant purchase

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:45.000
details quickly, leading to
a faster checkout for them.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.380
You'll see this rolling out soon
in leading web implementations

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.660
by Shopify merchants,
Square, and Stripe.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.780
And a little later
in this talk, Avnish

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.190
will walk you through how
you can add dynamic updates

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.890
with Google Play to your site.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.930
In addition to
speeding up checkout,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:08.470
we're working on a feature
that quite literally provides

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.140
monetary value to
your customers.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.140
We're doing this by
displaying saved offers

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.650
or enabling users to
enter a promotion code

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:23.380
and seamlessly applying them
when users pay by Google Pay.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.300
We're looking to
test this feature

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.050
across desktop and across
mobile in the coming months.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.080
And if you'd like to learn
more, please reach out

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.790
via the support link here
from our developer site.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:42.220
Now let's take a look at
ways to raise conversions.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.790
So we know that simpler
checkout experiences

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.970
make it more likely
that users will convert,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.120
and this can be achieved
using Google Pay.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.130
And to make checkout
even simpler,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.340
we're offering new
payment button options.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.370
These are customized for
your sites and your users,

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.140
and they're aimed at driving
higher sales for you.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.140
For instance, rather
than using static assets,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.670
web developers can use
the create button API.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.940
This enables a dynamic
purchase button

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.390
that uses the right styling
and the right colors

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.630
and is localized to your
user's device or their browser

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.280
settings, as you can see here.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.940
And in addition to that,
we've been experimenting

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.600
with personalized buttons that
display important information

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.750
to users before they
enter the checkout flow.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.280
So for instance, we can
show users exactly what

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.690
card they'll be paying with.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.000
So you can see that on
the left-hand screen

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.498
in a moment coming up.

00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:50.610
So you can see it here, they
can see exactly what form

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.380
of payment they're paying with.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.510
Or as on the right-hand
side, we might

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:59.250
be able to push messages to
them, like they need to sign in

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.490
or to sign up to Google Pay.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.690
And all this information can be
displayed right on the button.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.800
And as the button is hosted
and rendered by Google Pay,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.280
all of this will happen
without you, the developer,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.915
having to make any changes.

00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:23.310
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: So now let's
talk about new places and ways

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.640
that merchants can
accept Google Pay.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.530
In India, we're looking
to connect merchants

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.720
and developers to
build experiences

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.810
that bridge across
offline and online,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.360
as well as across online
platforms like desktop

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.800
and mobile.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.260
The Google Play
omnichannel API allows

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.780
users to authenticate
payments in the Google Pay

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.377
app that are triggered by
entering codes elsewhere.

00:11:46.377 --> 00:11:48.960
Let's walk through an example
of how this works on the Book My

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.170
Show site, which is a popular
movie ticketing site in India.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.380
A user starts on the desktop
site, selects Google Pay,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.400
and enters their phone number.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.060
This then triggers
a notification

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.410
to the user's Google
Pay app on their device.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.190
Only users can click
into that notification,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.740
approve the payment,
and see the confirmation

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.263
right in the Google Play
app, as well as the surface

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:12.430
that they're transacting on.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.760
In addition to
more places to pay,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.490
we're also enabling
additional payment methods

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.310
to allow more users to pay
with Google Pay on your sites

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.140
and apps.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.610
So for example, users are now
able to use Google Pay to pay

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.390
with their PayPal account easily
without any additional logins

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.410
or passwords if they're
signed into Google.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.390
For merchants, this
interoperability

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.670
allows access to the
millions of users

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.950
that have already stored
their PayPal credentials

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.370
in their Google account.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.430
And this feature is live across
merchants in the US and Germany

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.190
and will be rolling out to
more countries later this year.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.020
As you can see an example
here on the FlixBus app,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.473
which is a popular app to buy
bus tickets across Europe.

00:12:56.473 --> 00:12:58.390
And users can just select
their PayPal account

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.390
if they have it in
their Google Pay

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.370
and pay without any
additional friction.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.600
And as we add payment
methods, we're

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.370
making it really
easy for developers

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.040
to accept these methods
via standardized interface.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.370
So for example, you can already
accept cards and now PayPal.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.310
And coming soon,
UPI payments will

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.190
be available via the
same unified API.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.610
So what that means is
with a single integration,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.260
Indian merchants will
be able to accept

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.170
Google Pay for their users
wherever they operate,

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.660
and global merchants
can accept UPI payments

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.070
for their Indian users.

00:13:36.413 --> 00:13:38.580
So we've talked about some
of the new features we've

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.350
enabled with Google
Pay, as well as some

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.470
of those that we're
working on enabling soon,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.280
as well as some of
the steps we've taken

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.113
to simplify the integration.

00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:48.530
Now I'm going to talk about
one of the features that Jenny

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.300
mentioned earlier--
dynamic updates--

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.520
and show you how you
can add dynamic updates

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.550
to your checkout
flow with Google Pay.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.420
So to start with, you'll
need Google Pay on your site.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.250
And if you don't
already have Google Pay,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.750
you can check out
our developer docs

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.080
to learn how you can do that.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.090
But just to recap, here
are some of the steps

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.420
you take to enable Google Pay.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.960
Load pay.js, which is our
Google Pay JavaScript library.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.250
Call isReadytoPay.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.800
That's an API that you
can use to determine how

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.960
and when to show Google Pay.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.120
Then if you use a
purchase button,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.920
we recommend using
the create button API

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.070
that Jenny talked about to
display the right Google Pay

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.160
purchase button that's
customized to your preferences,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.580
as well as to the
user's settings.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.070
Finally, when you're ready to
accept payment from the user,

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.240
call loadPaymentData to
present the Google Pay sheet.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.600
Now that you added Google
Pay to your site, let's talk

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.050
about how you can
enable dynamic updates.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.800
You can do so in
three easy steps.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.710
First, provide price
and shipping info

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.650
in your payment data request.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.460
Second, specify a callback
function and the callback

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.080
intents you'd like to listen
to that affect your checkout.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.630
Finally, update your
payment data request

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.900
based on what the user selects
on the Google Pay sheet.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.400
So in today's
example, I'll show you

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.710
how the callback
function is triggered

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.350
when a user selects a shipping
option on the Google Pay sheet.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.910
Let's walk through each of
those steps in a little bit

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.390
more detail.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.140
You can provide price in
the transaction info object

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.060
that already exists today.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.300
What you can also do now
is to present display items

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.290
to the user that gives
the user more information

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.790
and allow them to confirm their
purchase right on the Google

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.730
Pay sheet.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.400
So for example, you can provide
subtotal, shipping, taxes,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.400
and discounts.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.780
And if you require shipping
and enable multiple shipping

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.043
options, you can set these with
the shipping option parameters.

00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:46.460
Again, with shipping
options, we'd

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.280
recommend using labels to
display the price to users,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.560
as well as a
descriptive information

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.370
to let users know, for example,
when items will be delivered

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.210
for each shipping
option so they can

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.760
make an appropriate selection.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.370
Next, provide a
callback function

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.833
when you construct
the Google Pay client.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.750
Determine the updates
you'd want to listen to,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.540
and also specify those
in the callback intents.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.080
So again, we're showing
shipping option here.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.210
Then, when that's done, you
can call loadPaymentData

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.760
to present the Google Pay
sheet and allow the user

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.650
to select their payment
and shipping information.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.830
Finally, when the
user makes selections,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.920
you'll receive a callback on the
callback function you specify.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.920
And you should handle these and
update the payment data request

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.780
appropriately.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.490
So you can see
here, for example,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.840
the callback function is updated
based on the user selected

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.650
shipping options.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.930
The total price now
reflects the price

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.120
with the user-selected
shipping option,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.330
as well as new display items
that can be shown to the user

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.197
if those have changed.

00:16:50.197 --> 00:16:50.780
And that's it.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.340
I'm going to show a quick demo
of how that looks on my Pixel.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.770
Can we switch to demo, please?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.339
So I'm heading to New York this
weekend for a developer event

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.180
next week, and I'd like to
buy some Google swag here,

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.740
so I'm going to go to the
Google Play Store site here.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.599
And let's like this sweatshirt.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.910
I'm going to click to
buy with Google Pay.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.150
So you can see my payment
information displayed, as well

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.109
as shipping addresses.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.849
It's already got our Google
New York office selected

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.220
as the shipping address.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.980
And for shipping options,
the $10 standard shipping,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.860
that only gets there
in five business days,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.480
which will be too late.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.980
I could pick $20 for shipping.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.870
That sounds pricey.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.390
Let me see if I can
actually have this shipped

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.910
to me right here
in Mountain View

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.160
and pick it up before I leave.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.530
When I selected the
Mountain View address,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.670
you notice that there's a free
shipping and California option

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.960
that didn't apply earlier.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.980
The price updated
to $22.15, and I

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.470
can click in and see the
details for the transaction,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.930
so I can confirm that
shipping is, indeed, free.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.537
And now I'm ready to pay.

00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:02.620
So I'll just click to pay.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.080
Payment information and shipping
is sent to the merchant,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.230
and the order is confirmed.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.240
And that's it.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.180
Dynamic updates are available
for web developers in our test

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.530
environment starting today.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.170
So we encourage you to
check out our documentation

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.410
or stop by our code labs at
IO right here to test it out.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.560
JENNY GOVE: Thanks, Avnish.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.040
So next, we're going to talk
about how you can easily

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.450
accept Google Pay on
your site or in your app.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.780
If you build your
own site or app,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.470
we've made it really simple
for you to add Google Pay.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.710
Google Pay users a
JSON request format

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.380
to make it very simple
for you to accept Google

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:52.200
Pay consistently with the
same request across Android,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.740
the web, as well as other
Google services like Actions

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.740
on Google.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.950
Google Pay works with
your existing processor

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.000
and can be integrated with
just a few lines of code.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.420
We've expanded our list of
supported payment processors

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.410
to over 60 processors globally.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.890
You can reach out to any
of our processor partners,

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.530
and they're prepared to
walk you through anything

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.960
you need for easy
integration with Google Pay.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.850
Next, if you're a merchant that
uses hosted checkout platforms,

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.140
we've also worked to make Google
Pay broadly available and easy

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.840
to add for all merchants,
including those that

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.980
don't build their own sites.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.900
For example, if you're a
BigCommerce merchant processing

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.890
with PayPay or with Stripe,
you can now easily enable

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.950
Google Pay for your customers.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.740
Google Pay is available
on several commerce

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.600
and hosted checkout
platforms globally,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.510
including Shopify, Square,
PayU, and TPAY, and many more.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.950
And if you're a
commerce platform that

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.680
offers hosted solutions, do
contact us via our developer

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.560
site, and then you can
find out how you can easily

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.720
onboard all your
merchants and provide

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.330
your merchants with a
better checkout experience.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.660
Now that we've talked about the
new features and improvements

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.880
we're making to
Google Pay, we're

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.460
going to walk you through
some of the guidelines

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.430
to ensure that you can make
the most of what Google Pay has

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.040
to offer.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.090
These will help you create
checkout experiences that

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.400
increase the likelihood
that your customers are

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.000
successful and satisfied
from start to finish.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.940
Google Pay enables customers to
share their payment information

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.440
in a single click.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.130
So Google Pay can help
you onboard new users

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.510
without them having to manually
enter all that information.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.540
For example, here and
in the DoorDash app,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.680
Google Pay is
enabled as a default

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:12.500
to help new DoorDash users get
through to check out quickly.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.170
And new Starbucks users
who have Google Pay

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.660
can quickly top up
their rewards cards

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.660
without having to go through
a payment method setup flow.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.920
Now, requiring account
creation before users

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.250
have gone through the checkout
flow slows down the purchase

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.170
and can lead to abandoned carts.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.870
I think we saw in that graph
at the beginning on users'

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.410
perceptions that users
don't like that at all.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.640
No one wants it.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.180
So use Google Pay for a faster
guest checkout experience.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.270
And then you can
recommend to your users

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.340
to create an account
after they've

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.410
come and fulfilled
the tasks that they

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.960
came to your site or app for.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.030
In the Macy's
checkout process here,

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.190
you can see guest
check out on the left

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.360
here, and then the option to
create an account after they've

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.500
gone through checkout
on the right-hand side.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.530
Now, it's important
to include and present

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.320
all the relevant transaction
details for the user

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.920
before they take that
final action to purchase.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.280
And studies have shown that
a significant number of users

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.920
abandon the purchase
because they can't

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.720
see that total cost up front.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.530
I'm sure that we've all done
that at one point or another.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.800
With Google Pay, you
can use dynamic updates,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.850
as we talked about earlier,
to show an updated price based

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.980
on the shipping selections.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.980
And that's directly
within the payment sheet.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.550
And so your users then can check
out quickly and confidently.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.540
And it is important to the user
that their specific payment

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.060
methods, such as a
specific credit card that

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.690
is being used with Google Pay,
is clearly visible to them,

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.970
so that they can be sure
about that form of payment

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.360
they're using.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.920
So we recommend also
displaying Google Pay

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.280
alongside that payment method
used by the customer right

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.750
throughout the
checkout process--

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.600
including on the
confirmation screens,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.990
as you can see here,
and also on receipts.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.030
This gives users
the full context

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.780
when they see the confirmation
screen, or perhaps

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.020
a receipt in email, and
that consistency continues

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.240
to build their user trust.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.820
Now, if you sell tickets or
passes, you can use Google Pay

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.940
and our passes API
together to provide

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.880
a delightful post-purchase
experience for your users.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.100
So here you see Ryanair.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.870
They've enabled Google Pay as
a payment method in their app,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.690
and then once users have
purchased their ticket,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.350
they can save it to their app.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.100
They can save their boarding
pass to have it ready there

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.030
and then for when they're
going to board their flight.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.100
And with Google
Pay, you can also

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.250
enable quick
single-item purchases

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.560
right from the product
pages themselves,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.140
as Etam have done here.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.750
This enables even
quicker purchasing

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.260
so your customers don't have to
add their items to their cart

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.180
before going through
the checkout process.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.610
They can just purchase directly.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.270
So implementing
these practices can

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.200
help you make better
experiences for your users,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.900
enabling them to
check out quickly

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.380
and easily every single time.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.000
So that wraps up the content
of our presentation today.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.390
If you want to know
more, then please just

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.070
visit these links here.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.940
The first provides
guidelines on implementation,

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:47.320
and the second is access
to our brand assets.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.110
So we've shared a lot of
details with you today,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.080
and we're excited to see
how you take them to create

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.840
your own delightful
purchase experiences,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.210
whether that's adding
dynamic updates

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.338
or enabling purchases directly
from your product pages.

00:25:02.338 --> 00:25:04.380
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: And
today I'm happy to announce

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.590
Google Pay Developers Live,
our marquee developer event,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.390
dedicated to Google Pay.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.760
And this will be happening
later this year in London

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.820
and will be
livestreamed globally.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.950
So please save the date and
sign up at the link shown here

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.180
to get updates on the event.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.180
JENNY GOVE: And if you're
interested in learning

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.110
more about saving tickets or
other passes to Google Pay

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.290
after purchase, be sure
to check out [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.900
and Jose's session,
"Engaging customers

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.570
beyond payments: Tickets,
transit, and boarding passes."

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:39.583
And that's on Thursday at
2:30, right here on stage 7.

00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:41.500
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: And
while you're here at IO,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.890
you can meet our team anytime
at the payment sandbox.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.380
And if you'd like to continue
the conversation today,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.283
come join us at our
developer meetup.

00:25:49.283 --> 00:25:50.950
That's happening in
the community lounge

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.262
starting at 4:20, and it's
on the porch of stage 1.

00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.720
JENNY GOVE: And so
that just leaves

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.240
me to say thank you all
so much for joining us,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.900
and we hope to see you soon.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.067
AVNISH MIDUTHURI: Thank you.

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:04.660
