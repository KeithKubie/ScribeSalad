00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.690
Sci-fi is one of Hollywood�s most popular
genres thanks to a multitude of memorable

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.740
creations like the lightsaber and the starship
Enterprise.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.800
Between time-traveling Deloreans, dream machines,
and the Force, viewers obviously need to suspend

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.860
disbelief to become truly immersed in one
of these fantasy worlds.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.690
However, some sci-fi flicks try to base their
concepts in real science, only for scientists

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.769
to disprove them.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.710
Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Sci-Fi Movie Premises
Debunked by Actual Science.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.710
Lucy

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.769
Luc Besson�s slick action film features
Scarlett Johansson as an unwilling drug mule

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.620
who gains access to 100% of her brain�s
capacity after being exposed to the substance.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.360
The movie bases its entire plot on the idea
that humans exhibit only 10% of their mind�s

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360
power when they are awake.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
Unfortunately for Besson, this is a myth that
has been disproven time and time again, with

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.710
neurologists and even the Mythbusters saying
it�s wrong.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
In actuality, people use �virtually� every
part of their brain all the time.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.140
The sequences of Lucy beating up bad guys
may have been fun to watch, but such a flawed

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.890
concept makes it hard to take it all seriously.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.890
Planet of the Apes

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.530
Fox�s iconic franchise, Planet of the Apes
has been revitalized thanks to the recent

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.200
films starring Andy Serkis.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.680
Those projects tried to ground the mythos
in more factual science than before, but even

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.960
they succumbed to an inaccuracy from the originals.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.730
Due to a slight variation in the FOXP2 gene,
apes do not have the ability to communicate

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.090
in speech, and they cannot freely move organs
in the vocal tract, including the cords needed

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.090
to form words.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.560
So while Caesar and company can talk to the
humans they�re fighting against, we would

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.580
have to find a different way to negotiate
a peace treaty with an army of chimps if need

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.820
be.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.970
Jurassic Park

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.090
Steven Spielberg�s blockbuster wowed an
entire generation of moviegoers by bringing

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.440
dinosaurs back to life, but you can�t use
the film to make your own t-rex or raptor

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
pet.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.380
The process of extracting blood from fossilized
mosquitoes is only slightly plausible considering

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.010
a number of factors, and the actual cloning
depicted is impossible.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.710
The most frequently used cloning method, nuclear
transfer, involves the transfer of the nucleus

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.530
of one cell into a second cell of the same
species after that second nucleus has been

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.880
destroyed.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.970
Unless life finds a way, there are no dinosaur
cells available to complete the task.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.189
We�ll just have to make do with the movies
� which is probably better.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.920
I Am Legend

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.130
All Robert Neville wants to do is design a
cure to save humanity from a deadly plague

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.249
that wiped them out years ago, testing various
versions and tracking his progress.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.829
However, there�s one crucial element that
he overlooked.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.280
Since his blood (the basis for his cures)
has no trace of the deadly virus, it would

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.290
be useless in any kind of medication.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.599
Vaccines work because they contain those traces
of whatever sickness they�re made for, infecting

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.769
a patient with a weakened form of the illness
so the body can recognize it and develop the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.879
necessary antibodies.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.380
As Neville was never infected, his blood did
not possess any antibodies for the virus he

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.969
was hoping to wipe out.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:02:59.969
Armageddon

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.870
Michael Bay is not known for being grounded
and realistic, but even he should have known

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.510
better for this disaster film.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.879
A team of astronauts looks to save to world
from a giant asteroid by dropping an atomic

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.250
bomb inside of it.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.250
Based on the information provided in the movie
(such as the asteroid�s size, trajectory

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.950
speed, and location), their mission would
have had to start in the outskirts of the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.999
Kuiper Belt outside of Neptune in order to
have any shot of being successful.

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.459
Science has shown that the h-bomb would have
to be a million times more powerful than �Big

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.599
Ivan,� which is the largest such weapon
ever detonated on Earth.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.209
At least the Bayhem is fun to watch unfold,
but it�s still a glaring mishap.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.280
Conclusion

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.719
Those are our picks for sci-fi film premises
debunked by real science.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.730
Are there any we missed?
