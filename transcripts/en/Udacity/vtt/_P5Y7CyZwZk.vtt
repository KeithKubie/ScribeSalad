00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem, we were tasked with figuring out how much work 65 kg Andy

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
has to do to climb this flight of stairs that's 6 m tall.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's think about what's going on here in terms of energy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Andy starts and ends with no kinetic energy, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so none of his net work is going to contribute towards kinetic energy,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but because Andy ends at a higher height than he started,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that means he has more gravitational potential energy up here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
than he did down here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This just means that the net work done by Andy is equal to the change in his potential energy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This, of course, is just equal to the final potential energy minus the original potential energy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If we choose potential energy to be 0 at the bottom of the stairs,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we can say that the original potential energy--when he's at the bottom of the stairs--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is equal to 0.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This leave just the final potential energy term,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which we know is equal to mg times the final height.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Plugging in all my values here, I find that Andy has to do 3900 J of work

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to climb this 6 m flight of stairs. Great job.
