00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
(dance music)

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.947
- This is The Super Late Morning
Show, we're the Lucas bros.

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.261
I'm Kenny, this is Keith.

00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.475
Yo, it's time for the weather, man.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.577
- So let's just go to Mookie
and see what it's like.

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:15.602
(soaring intense music)

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:17.852
(bubbling)

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:20.192
- Oh!

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:21.025
Hey.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.052
It's mad sunny out today.

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.336
(soaring intense music)

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:31.578
- Today, we're honoring real dads, man.

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:33.625
- Yeah, man, real dads that
make real choices, man.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.886
We'll be honoring deadbeat fathers.

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:35.719
- [Kenny] Yes.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.136
(gentle acoustic guitar)

00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:42.707
Yeah, so, I think a lot of people get mad

00:00:42.707 --> 00:00:44.734
at deadbeat fathers
for leaving their kids.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:45.567
I think it's great.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:46.533
- Yeah, man.
- You know what I mean?

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.739
- It's awesome, I think.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.012
So, we brought one here.

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.130
- All right, we got a real
father just like our dad.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.320
We got Brian coming out here.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.160
Can we get Brian?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.561
- Let's get Brian, give
him a round of applause.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:56.086
(applauding)

00:00:56.086 --> 00:00:57.976
- Brian, Brian, what's up, man?

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.372
How's it going, man, how's it going?

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.243
- Everything's going good for me.

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.076
(laughing)
- How's your kids,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:03.501
how's your kids?

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:04.766
- I do not know.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.774
- You live with that.

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.376
- I am, yeah.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:08.397
- You made some tough choices.

00:01:08.397 --> 00:01:09.405
- I made some tough choices, man.

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:10.268
- Yeah, man.

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:12.706
- I put people in the taxi pregnant.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.461
- Did you even get into the taxi?

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:17.538
- I don't like taxis.

00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:19.422
- Do you even, like, know
where your son was born?

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:21.172
Do you have any idea?

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:23.080
- At the hospital.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.996
- [Kenny] Oh, okay.

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:25.438
(laughing)

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:27.018
- Definitely a hospital, right?

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:29.021
- Or a taxi, I don't know.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:29.854
- So you weren't there,

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:30.759
what were you doing in place of that?

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:31.800
- I was on the block, man.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.633
I have to make money.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:34.093
I mean, I ain't got time
to be sitting around

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.669
cutting umbilical cords and all of that.

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:37.592
- That's fucking, that's beautiful.

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:38.485
- See, now you can't be a dad

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:40.627
if you're such a good drug
dealer, I get it, man.

00:01:40.627 --> 00:01:42.986
- I mean, you know,
priorities, you gotta--

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:46.027
- Yeah, it's drug deal, and then, child.

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:47.752
(laughing)

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:49.410
- I mean, baby, I damn did my life.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.572
You'd do the same thing.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:52.349
- We got a prize for your
for coming on our show.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.015
- Well, that's what's up!
- We're very grateful.

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:54.956
We actually got some tickets

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:57.316
for you and your sons to Disneyland.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.769
- Bring out Johnny!

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:00.231
- What?

00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.548
(applauding and heartfelt music)

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:04.715
- I got to go.

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:07.501
- We're just kidding,
man, Johnny's not here.

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.563
(laughing)

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.230
- Man, y'all got me.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:14.019
Man.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.565
- Nah, actually, man, you
got the greatest prize, man.

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:17.280
You got freedom, man.
- Freedom.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.750
- That's what I mean.
- It's a beautiful thing.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.583
- Thank you, Brian.

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:20.881
- Don't tell nobody I was here.

00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.868
(laughing)

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:24.939
(soaring intense music)

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.115
- On Monday, we're
gonna have some sunshine

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:29.525
in the afternoon, leading in some clouds.

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.885
We give it a 10 out of
10 for smoking weed.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.565
Tuesday, Wednesday, there's gonna be

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.260
some isolated T-storms
up in the northwest.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.767
We're gonna give it a 10
out of 10 for smoking weed.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:42.088
Thursday, little more rain, 10 out of 10.

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.974
Friday, it's gonna be back
to the sunshine, guys.

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:47.497
But my parents are gonna be in town,

00:02:47.497 --> 00:02:50.054
so I'm giving it a 9 out
of 10 for smoking weed.

00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:51.586
But for all you out there,

00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:53.411
still gonna be a 10 out of 10 day.

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:55.028
(dance music)

00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:57.611
(hip hop beat)

00:03:10.327 --> 00:03:12.827
(baby crying)
