10 Editing Mistakes In Popular Superhero Movies
That Went Unnoticed

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.419
Mistakes happen in any line of work.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.340
We live with them, we move on.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.469
The world of movies is no different.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.870
The editing process is susceptible to errors
just like any other.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.500
Unfortunately for the people behind these
errors, the evidence is permanently etched

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.860
into movie history once the movie in question
is released.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.480
That's not to say it's an unforgivably bad
thing, or something we should complain about

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.330
relentlessly... it's just... well, it's just
a thing!

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.580
If anything, it gives us something to look
out for and talk about!

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.350
So that's what we're going to do here!

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.870

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.289
Here are ten editing mistakes in popular superhero
movies that went unnoticed.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.289
The Avengers
Let's start with a funny one.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.289
In 2012's The Avengers, the final battle sees
the titular team of superheroes taking on

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.289
the Chitauri army led by Loki in New York
City - and it's a scene involving the God

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.289
of Mischief that we're talking about here.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.289
When Tom Hiddleston's character catches an
arrow fired at him by Hawkeye, his other hand

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.289
is supposed to be resting on the handle of
the Chitauri flyer he's riding on.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.289
However, the movie's special effects team
failed to actually add the handle, so Loki's

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.289
hand is actually resting on nothing.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.289
Superman Returns
2006's Superman Returns really wasn't very

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.289
good.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.530
It wasn't awful, but hardly anything truly
exciting happened!

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.649
That being said, the one truly exciting scene
was the one we're including here because of

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.300
an editing mistake it contained.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.020
It's the scene in which Superman stops the
aeroplane from crashing into the baseball

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.020
field.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.790
After he's safely put the plane on the field,
there's a wide shot in which Superman, the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.380
plane and baseball players can all be seen
- all of which cast shadows onto the pitch

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.790
except Superman himself.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.700
Captain America: Civil War
At the end of 2016's Captain America: Civil

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.840
War, Helmut Zemo, Tony Stark, Steve Rogers,
Bucky Barnes and T'Challa end up at a HYDRA

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.150
base in Siberia.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.340
Most of the action takes place inside the
base itself, but there is a scene outside

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.939
- and it's when Zemo and T'Challa interact.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.670
Siberia's freezing, right?

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.659
So it's pretty strange that nobody's breath
is visible.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.189
Clearly the scene wasn't filmed in a freezing
location, but you would think that the breath

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.930
would have been edited in for the purpose
of authenticity.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.469
The Amazing Spider-Man
2012's The Amazing Spider-Man was actually

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.799
teaming with editing mistakes, but none were
more noticeable - or, frankly, more hilarious

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.799
- than this one.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.530
In the scene on the subway when Peter Parker
has just acquired his powers and is unable

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.810
to control them, he inadvertently gets into
a fight with a number of his fellow passengers.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.910
One of them - a black man - uses Parker's
own skateboard as a weapon but, out of nowhere,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.320
he changes into a white guy wearing totally
different clothes!

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:42.100
That's some pretty poor scene-chopping right
there!

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.200
Doctor Strange
In 2016's Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.480
titular character is involved in a terrible
car crash that wrecks his body, including

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.470
his all-important fingers, which ruins his
career as a surgeon, prompting him to go on

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.790
a journey that leads to him becoming a sorcerer.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.630
When he's training with Karl Mordo, after
he gets knocked down, you can briefly see

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.100
Strange's fingers.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.140
In the shot in question, his fingers are in
perfect condition and appear unharmed.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.600
However, at this point, he is still badly
maimed and you see this again afterwards.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.750
Deadpool
2016's Deadpool was so much fun that, frankly,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.070
it could have made some huge editing errors
and we'd have been happy to let it get away

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.070
with them.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.400
This one was only small, however, but it's
notable enough to point out.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.419
In the scene in which Colossus is sent flying
by a punch from Angel Dust, everyone in the

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.770
background - apart from Deadpool, that is
- appears to be frozen in time, with one of

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.359
them even frozen whilst in the middle of a
stepping motion.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.300
X-Men: Apocalypse
Here's one for the video game geeks out there.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300
X-Men: Apocalypse wasn't great.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.510
The 2016 installment in the X-Men movie franchise
received some of the worst reviews since the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.479
series began back in 2000 - and careless errors
like this one won't have helped its cause

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.479
one bit!

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.820
When Evan Peters' Quicksilver is playing Ms.
Pac-Man at home, the titular character he's

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.820
controlling dies.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.630
However, the sound effect is that of the original
Pac-Man dying, and not Ms. Pac-Man at all.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.890
Guardians of the Galaxy
Guardians of the Galaxy was so good that it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.870
seems like a huge shame to pick fault with
any of the 2014 space epic!

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.810
This happened, however, so we're going to
talk about it!

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.540
On the Nova Corps planet of Xandar, when Gamora
is trying to get her hands on the Orb Infinity

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.450
Stone, she jumps down from a walkway to the
level below.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.259
She clearly lands with both feet close to
each other, but when the camera quickly cuts

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:41.840
further away, she's practically doing 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.060
the splits.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.040
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Oh Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, how

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.650
you disappointed us!

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.530
The 2016 offering just didn't live up to expectations
- and there were also a number of editing

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.650
errors in the movie.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.140
A couple of those occurred in the scene in
which Wonder Woman is looking at the email

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.790
sent to her by Bruce Wayne.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.140
First of all, the total size of the email's
content is shown to be 24 megabytes, but when

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.720
you see the sizes of the four individual files
it contains, it should be closer to 800 megabytes.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.060
Moreover, when Diana slides her finger to
the left on the touchpad, the cursor actually

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.140
moves to the right.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.010
Suicide Squad
In 2016's Suicide Squad, one of the titular

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.920
team's surprise big-guns was Diablo, who was
played by Jay Hernandez.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.700
Diablo had a huge fiery form that he used
to take on Incubus in the movie's final battle,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.370
but just prior to that happening, there was
an editing error.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.630
Diablo had just been knocked away by the villain,
and the scythe tattoo on his forehead appeared

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.800
to switch from facing his right to his left,
which means that the image was mirrored for

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.530
some reason.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.840
