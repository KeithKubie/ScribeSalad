00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.576
- [Instructor] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.576 --> 00:00:04.792
is make a visual argument as
to why the derivative with

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:08.959
respect to x of cosine of x is
equal to negative sine of x.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:13.867
And we're gonna base this argument,

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.366
based on a previous proof we made

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:21.308
that the derivative with
respect to x of sine of x

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:23.308
is equal to cosine of x.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.439
So we're gonna assume this over here.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.807
I encourage you to watch that video.

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:31.431
That's actually a fairly
involved proof that proves this,

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.059
but if we assume this, I'm
gonna make a visual argument

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.892
that this right over
here is the derivative

00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:40.360
with respect to x of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.743
So right over here we
seen sine of x in red

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.263
and we see cosine of x in blue.

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:48.000
And we're assuming that this blue graph

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.987
is showing the derivative,
the slope of the tangent line

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.374
for any x value of the red graph.

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:55.688
And we've got an intuition
for that in previous videos.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.234
Now what I'm gonna do next,

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:59.937
is I'm gonna shift both of these graphs

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.187
to the left by pi over two.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.506
Shift it to the left by pi over two

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.202
and I'm also gonna shift
the blue graph to the left

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.452
by pi over two.

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:16.828
And so what am I going to get?

00:01:16.828 --> 00:01:19.089
Well the blue graph is
gonna look like this one

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:22.300
right over here and if it
was cosine of x up here,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.002
we can now say that this is equal to

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.835
y is equal to cosine
of x plus pi over two.

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.225
This is the blue graph,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.978
cosine of x, shifted to
the left by pi over two.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:39.145
And this is y is equal to
sine of x plus pi over two.

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:46.636
Now the visual argument is, all I did,

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.814
is I shifted both of these graphs

00:01:48.814 --> 00:01:50.913
to the left by pi over two.

00:01:50.913 --> 00:01:52.968
So it should still be the
case that the derivative

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:56.115
of the red graph is the blue graph.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.688
So we should still be able to say

00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:01.015
that the derivative with
respect to x of the red graph,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.348
sin of x plus pi over two

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:09.879
that that is equal to the blue graph.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.046
That that is equal to cosine
of x plus pi over two.

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.815
Now what is sin of x plus pi over two?

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:23.916
Well that's the same thing as cosine of x.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:26.288
You can see this red graph is
the same thing as cosine of x.

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:27.685
We know that from our trig identities

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:30.210
and you can also see in
intuitively or graphically

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.938
just by looking at these graphs.

00:02:31.938 --> 00:02:35.219
Now what is cosine of x plus pi over two?

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.950
Well once again, from our trig identities,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.315
we know that that is the exact same thing

00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:41.148
as negative sine of x.

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:44.955
So there you have it, the visual argument.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:46.722
Just start with this knowledge,

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:50.156
shift both of these graphs
to the left by pi over two,

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:51.649
it should still be true,

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.488
that the derivative with respect to x

00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:56.155
of sine of x plus pi over two

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.736
is equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:07.070
And this is the same thing
as saying what we have

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.431
right over here.

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:10.124
So now we should feel pretty good.

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:11.700
We proved this in a previous video

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.522
and we have a very strong
visual argument for this

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.924
for cosine of x in this video.
