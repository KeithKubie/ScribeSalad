00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome to the final week of Fashion as Design.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
Expression.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.519
Every time we put something on, we're obviously
communicating something, even if we're communicating

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.659
that we don't wanna participate in fashion.

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.969
We're saying something, it's a decision we
make to put on clothes.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.950
And so that's why we're concluding the course
with this particular subject because it's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.890
sort of a culmination of everything that we've
been looking at.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.140
But we've chosen a handful of items that we
feel conveyed just a little bit more of a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.530
meaning perhaps.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.649
One of my favorite items of the course is
the doorknocker earring.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.149
The doorknocker earring takes on a lot of
different forms, but the most salient aspect

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.430
of it is that it's big.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.539
It's meant to look like a door knocker when
you go to visit a friend.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.749
It could be a hoop, it could be a square,
it can just be something very large that dangles.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.499
It's something I first discovered when I started
getting into hip hop as a kid, and Salt-N-Pepa

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.770
famously wore his big, huge earrings.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.859
Do you remember it?

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.550
Actually I was in the UK at that point in
time, so Salt-N-Pepa, I didn't know so well.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.109
Sort of came to them later.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.690
But thinking about the ways in which that
style has now traversed, I came to them from

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.690
"Sex and the City."

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.760
Ah, okay.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.290
And so that was an appropriation of some sort.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.290
Yes.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.430
So that's really what we're going to be focusing
on when we look at the door knockers this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.430
week.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.280
They are very much so at the forefront of
a conversation about appropriation.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.380
So they're an earring that has had deeply
rooted cultural significance to women of color,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.320
Latino women and black women.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.440
And in 2001, the American television show
"Sex and the City," the star of that show,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.790
Carrie Bradshaw, was outfitted in a pair of
door knocker hoops that said, "Carrie," right

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.790
across them.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.150
And it was sort of viewed as an insensitive
form of appropriation because this is an earring

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.140
that meant very specific things to certain
people.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
Right.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
And so when we think about expression, it's
not only about expressing ourselves, but who

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.830
else we might be expressing when we put on
certain items of clothing or accessories.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.830
Right.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.850
So we move from appropriation to subversion
in terms of expressions.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.850
This is a favorite of yours.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.640
Really a lot of my favorites in this week.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.590
So this slip dress is one of my all time favorite
items of fashion.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.280
I am a big Courtney Love fan.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.120
And as many of us know, she often wore slip
dresses while performing.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840
It sort of looks a bit like an undergarment.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.170
And so for that reason, at its core, it's
a very sort of sensual garment.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.610
But the women who have worn it and have made
it kind of codified its meaning as something

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.810
that's a little more tough, are women that
have worn it with leather jackets and boots,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.290
and they really kind of subverted this idea
of a sexualized feminine body.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.490
They took the received or expected expression
of the slip dress which is feminized, soft,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.400
sensual, and they completely flip that expression
on their heads as a recourse to power around

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610
their bodies in public and in private.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.860
Very well put.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.920
You taught me everything I know.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.240
So we'll then, look at message, and so one
of my favorites of this entire course is the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.209
lapel pin, something that I think is tiny
but mighty.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.531
And so you may be wearing one right now or
you may have one on your coat that you wear

00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.880
it out of doors.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.240
You might think of the cross ribbon, often
most associated with the early 1990s and the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.350
AIDS awareness campaigns.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.930
And so it becomes this very powerful signifier,
really powerful sartorial symbol of messaging

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.060
and therefore expressing one's, perhaps identity,
allegiance, remembrance, or other types of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.060
emotions.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.261
So we'll end this week thinking about identity.

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.880
And one of the garments that we'll look at
is kente, something that has had a real significance

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.690
on the west coast of Africa, specifically
in Ghana and Togo for many centuries, but

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.690
really came to prominence in many ways in
a kind of global Pan African consciousness

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.830
after independence in Ghana in 1957.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:03.010
And so we will look at the ways in which expression
at a national level can be made through specific

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.830
types of clothing and dress.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.000
And kente stands as a lens through which to
have that conversation.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.050
Michelle: So to conclude this week, and indeed
the course, we're going to be going to the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.500
studio of Asher Levine who's here in New York,
and we'll look at him and his creation of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.500
a biker jacket.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.740
We looked at the biker jacket in the Coutures
week, and here we'll look at a prototype that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.740
he's made.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.160
He is someone who designs, not only in fashion,
but designs costume for very well known performers

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160
as well.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.530
And so often what he's thinking about is how
these can be read on stage as signifiers of

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.160
very large expressions.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.050
And the biker jacket that he's created is
beautiful.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.270
It's white and it looks almost like a kind
of a molten scaled texture through which glows

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.410
certain colors.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.370
He's thinking about it for practical reasons
when one's on the back of the motorbike.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.330
You can signal which way you're going by using
the light function that's inherent to the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.330
biker jacket.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.060
But it's also much more about expressing a
certain type sartorial style.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.430
So we hope you've enjoyed this final week
in the course, and that you've learned a little

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.990
bit about how expression and fashion go together,
and indeed confirmed many of the ways in which

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.800
you yourself express through clothing.
