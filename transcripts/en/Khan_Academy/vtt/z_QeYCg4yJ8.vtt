00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.200
Both of the major parties -- and we're talking about the United States here --

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.333
hold a national convention during the summer before the actual general election.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:15.733
So the Republicans will hold their Republican national convention,

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.333
and the Democrats will hold their Democratic national convention.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.267
And it's there that they will choose their official candidates

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:25.800
that will run against each other in the general election.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.267
And a national convention for one of the parties

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:32.800
will look something like this.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
This is the Democratic national convention in 2008.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
You have all the delegates over here,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.600
and everyone's all excited and they start to cheer lead for their party.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.533
and for their candidate the republican national convetion

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.333
looks very similar

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.333
And although there's a lot of energy here there actually isn't a lot of suspense

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.533
Going into the convention we usually know already who

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.733
the candidates for each of the parties are going to be

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.933
And that's because each of the states have their own selection process

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.533
for picking a candidate

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:07.667
As we get the results from we know how many delegates

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.667
they're going to send to the convention

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:13.267
and who(m) they're going to vote for

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:17.267
But there's two ways they can select those candidates

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.200
or those delegates at the national convention

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:31.667
They could either run a caucus

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:37.267
or they could run a primary

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:40.267
And I'll start with primary because that's a little more intuitive

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.400
It's kind of like just a election that is based on party

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.000
for whom do you want to be your nominee

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.667
at coming out of the convention

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:51.933
So for any given state they will have both a

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.800
Democratic primary and a Republican primary

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.333
And on the democratic primary let's say candidate A gets

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:03.600
40% of the votes on that election

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800
Candidate B gets 30% of the votes

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.200
and let's say candidate C gets another 30%

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.600
What will happen is is that state's delegates on the democratic side

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.000
So let's say that that state just for convenience

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.200
Let's say they have ten delegates

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.133
On the democratic side, that means that these delegates

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.533
will go on to the national convention and represent

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.133
the different candidates proportionally

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.733
So out of these ten delegates 40% or four will represent candidate A

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.133
Three will represent candidate B

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:39.733
and three will represent candidate C when they go to the national convention

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.533
On the republican side it's a little bit more nuance

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:43.867
you could have similar results

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:45.533
A gets 40%

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:51.533
B gets 30% and C gets - now let me do different letters

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.133
so these aren't the same candidates

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.533
Let me do candidates D, E and F

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.733
So you could have candidate D, candidate E, candidate F

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:02.533
and let's say - let me do the percentages slightly different

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.333
for fun

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.933
So let's he has 45% over here

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:07.533
let's say he has 25% over here

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:12.533
and then let's say you have candidate F with 30% over here

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:15.533
On the republican side it depends from state to state

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.133
Some states will do it similar to the democrats

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.933
where the delegates represent the candidates proportion to

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:23.867
the votes they have

00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:25.533
While some other states have it 'winner take all'

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:30.933
And so for example in a winner take all state, candidate D

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:33.333
will get all 10 delegates

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.067
And the reason why states do that is it's a stronger incentive for candidates

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.867
to show up to that state if they feel like their in the running

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:43.667
Because if they throw enough money and marketing in that state, that's a big deal to take all of the

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.267
votes.

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.467
On the other hand, if you're a smaller candidate and you don't think you

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.667
can take it all, it may be a disincentive for you to even show up to that state

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.667
and you might want to focus on the states where you can actually get

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.400
some delegates

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.000
So that's all the primary is.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's really a- you can kind of view it as an election

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.600
That sell separately on the democratic side, separately on the republican side

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.200
an those are used by the state's parties to decide which delegates go to the national party

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.933
and whom those delegates are going to vote for

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:15.000
A caucus, the point is the same thing

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.600
To figure out who are your delegates that are going to go

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.933
to the national convention and whom are they going to vote for

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:24.200
but the process is a little bit different

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.400
In a caucus, you essentially have- people get together

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.800
in these events, these caucuses in different in these events,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.000
these caucuses in different precincts,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.800
and the most famous of these are the Iowa caucuses

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.600
So in small precincts you'll have groups of fifty to a hundred

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.800
people get together, and the different parties will have different

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.733
ways of going about it

00:04:44.733 --> 00:04:49.133
but they have processes in place where people try to market for different candidates

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:55.867
they campaign for different candidates

00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:59.133
and sometimes they'll have a cut-off that if one of the candidates

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:03.133
at one of the precincts don't get at least 15% of the votes

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:06.933
then those people who supported that candidate will have to give their

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:10.133
support to another candidate they make sure that all of the delegates

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:13.667
represent at least a certain threshold of voters but there's different

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:15.467
processes in place

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:19.467
But the bottom line is that at each of these pre-syncs they'll select delegates

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:25.067
and then those delegates will then go on to the county conventions

00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:29.600
and then those delegates at the county conventions now these are

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.400
representing more people

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.600
will then pick delegates to the district conventions and then at the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.400
district conventions they will pick candidates to the state conventions

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.600
and at the state conventions they will pick the final candidates

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.800
that will go on to the national convention

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.800
No the two most famous caucuses or primaries are the Iowa caucus

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.600
which takes place in Iowa

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600
You have the New Hampshire primary which of course takes place in New Hampshire

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.133
And they are important not because they pick so many delegates that those delegates

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:05.133
will tip the balance necessarily

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:08.067
These are small states they don't have that many delegates compared to

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.533
California or Texas or Florida

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:12.533
but what's important about both of them is that they happen

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:15.133
very very very early on in the primary season

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:18.533
and because they happen early on in the primary season

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.933
the candidates that come off with the lead here it is easier for them to raise money

00:06:22.933 --> 00:06:27.133
they say 'Oh I want to give my money to a winner, you know I don't want to give

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:31.533
it to a candidate who is just going to blow it and lose the money and lose the election

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:33.333
regardless'

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.133
So it gives you that. It also gives a big signal for who's a front runner because

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:42.467
there tends to be dynamics for whoever wins or comes in in second place in the Iowa or

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:47.267
New Hampshire primary that those are the people that everyone should pay attention to

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:50.267
they get more fundraising it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.667
More people all of a sudden take a serious look at them

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:56.267
Now the Iowa caucus just to be clear

00:06:56.267 --> 00:07:00.867
the primaries all happen in one day and you get the one, the polling results

00:07:00.867 --> 00:07:03.800
when people exit the polls and you also get the final result pretty quickly

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.267
This caucus process actually takes place over many many months

00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:10.400
five months in the case of the Iowa caucus

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.600
And the result, the thing that the press focuses on is not this final result,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.800
of who are the actual delegates that go to the national convention

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.333
The thing that the press focuses on are the precinct convention where people get together

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:32.333
Because coming out of those precinct conventions the state parties get the information

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:36.533
on how many candidates each delegates won going into now the county convention

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:42.133
And this, this is the indicator that the press and the media and everyone else likes to use

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:47.333
to see who's a front runner in that specific party's primary

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:51.533
And the reason why the Iowa caucus in particular gets so much importance is

00:07:51.533 --> 00:07:52.933
because it is the first caucus

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:56.133
These results come out before anything else

00:07:56.133 --> 00:08:00.133
The New Hampshire primary this is the first time that you have direct voting for candidates

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:03.333
so you're getting I guess getting a more direct number or your not having it

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:06.733
distorted or maybe cleaned up depending on how you view it

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:10.733
by all of the different processes that might take place within the precinct convention
