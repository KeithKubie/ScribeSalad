00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
Going with my habit of
overly simplified economy,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.840
let's then imagine an economy
that has only two actors in it.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.260
So it has Mr. Farmer
right over here.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.220
Do my best to draw
the farmer, maybe he

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.410
has a mustache of some kind.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.570
So it has Mr. Farmer
right over here.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.480
He's got a hat on.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.180
So that is the farmer
in this economy.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.990
And then let's say we
also have a builder.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.084
So this economy, they're
producing two things.

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:27.750
They're producing
food, and this builder

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.580
can help maintain stuff.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.340
So maybe he has
a lot more, maybe

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.630
this is the builder
right over here.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.140
So this is Mr. Builder.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.440
And let's say, for the sake of
what we're going to do here,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.860
let's say that for this economy,
it's kind of a constant.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.470
If either of these fellows
gets an extra dollar to spend,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.969
he's going to spend 60% of it.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.260
And so, what I'm going to do
is introduce a formal word

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.440
that really is just
another way of saying that.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:07.070
In this economy, the marginal
propensity to consume

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.720
is-- and I'll put that
in parentheses, it's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.240
often referred to as
MPC-- that is equal to you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.530
could either say 60%
or is equal to 0.6.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
And all this is saying is that
if someone in this economy

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.380
somehow finds another
dollar in their pocket,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.540
they're going to
spend 0.6 of that.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.124
Or they're going to
spend 60% of that.

00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:30.581
So if you give the builder--
if a builder all of the sudden

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:33.470
gets an extra dollar, he's going
to spend another $0.60 on other

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.970
things.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.840
And the person to really
spend it with is the farmer.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.550
If the farmer gets
another dollar,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.640
he's going to spend 60% of that,
or $0.60, with the builder.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580
Now given this
assumption, let's think

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.850
about what would
happen in this economy

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.440
if all of a sudden
one of them decided

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.260
to increase their
spending a little bit.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.520
So we'll assume that they
were all living happily.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.740
The economy was kind
of at a steady state.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.320
And let's say the
farmer discovers

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.787
a sock in a drawer that he
didn't realize was there.

00:01:57.787 --> 00:02:00.120
And it's got a little bit of
their agreed upon currency.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.570
Maybe the agreed upon currency
in this island is a dollar.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.810
They've maybe got a stash when
their shipwrecked on this,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.720
or whatever.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.880
So the agreed upon currency
is actually the dollar.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.889
And the farmer
discovers that he's

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.775
got-- he discovers a big
pile of dollars in his sock.

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:17.650
And he says, well, I'm
going to spend $1,000.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.850
I need to do some
repairs to my buildings.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.330
So we have this kind of increase
in spending that's going on.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.800
So the farmer says, hey,
I'm going to spend $1,000,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.600
and I'm going to give
it to the builder.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.150
Now the builder
says, well, you know,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.070
gee, I've just gotten $1,000.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.610
I have a marginal propensity
to consume of 60%, or 0.6.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.670
I'm going to spend 60% of that.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.960
So he's going to spend,
and the only person

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.770
he can spend it
with is the farmer.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.800
He's going to spend 60% times
$1,000, which is equal to $600.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.570
Well, now the
farmer says, well, I

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.880
got above and beyond the
$1,000 that I just spent.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.920
Somehow the economy
seems to be picking up.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.490
The builder just
spent $600 more on me

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.950
then he would have
otherwise done.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.910
He bought that much more food.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.580
I have $600 more.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.270
I have a marginal propensity
to consume of 0.6 or 60%.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.900
So I will spend 60% of
that $600 that I just got.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.020
And so it will be
60% of this thing.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.060
So it will be 60-- I'll
write it as a decimal-- it'll

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.040
be 0.6 times this thing,
which is 0.6 times 1,000.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.570
Or you could say it is
60% of the $600, which

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.870
is going to be equal to $360.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.760
Well, now the
builder says, well, I

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.115
got that initial $1,000.

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:44.990
I spent $600 of that.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.420
But now I've got
another $360, and I

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.610
have a marginal propensity
to consume of 0.6.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.120
So I'm going to
spend 60% of that.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.720
So above and beyond
this spending,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.010
he also spends 60% of
this right over here.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.200
And 60% of this is 0.6
times this whole thing.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.780
So he's going to spend
0.6 times this thing--

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.630
and I'll write it in green--
times 0.6 times $1,000.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.410
Now this number
right over here, I

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.577
don't know what this
is, is it 60% of $360.

00:04:20.577 --> 00:04:22.160
I don't know, I could
get a calculator

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160
to figure out what
that is exactly.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.720
So let's say that I have
0.6-- we could actually

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.860
say 0.6 to the third power.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.380
Or let's just write
that-- 0.6 to the third.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.830
And then I'm going to
multiply that times 1,000,

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.850
gives us $216.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.070
So this guy-- so this right
over here gives us $216.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.350
This guy says, hey
got another $216,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.120
I'm going to spend 60% of that.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.210
And I think you see
where this is going.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.260
And 60% of that is going to be
0.6 times this whole quantity.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.240
So it's going to be--
I'll write it here--

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.960
it's going to be 0.6
times this thing,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.240
which was already 0.6
times 0.6 times 0.6.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.580
So you're going to have 0.6
times 0.6 to the third power.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.330
That's going to be 0.6 to the
fourth power times 1,000, which

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.930
is whatever 60% of 216 is.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.690
And I'll just calculated it.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.420
So times 0.6 gives us $130,
is going to get $129.60.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.000
Now this guy, the builder,
say, I got another $129.60.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.740
I'm going to spend 60% of that.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.940
And it goes on and on and on.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.390
So given this, let's think
about how much from that

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.190
incremental increase of spending
of $1,000, how much total

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.510
new production and spending
happened in this economy?

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.850
So the way to think about
that, so the total-- and we

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:49.970
could view it either way.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.735
Remember, you could
view kind of the GDP.

00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:53.770
You could view that as
the aggregate output.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.710
You could view that as
the aggregate income,

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.680
aggregate expenditure.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.020
These are all views
because really the economy

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.090
is a very circular thing.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.460
One person's expenditure turns
into another person's income.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.840
But we could say
total output here,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.590
measured in our agreed upon
currency, which is let's say

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.520
dollars.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.320
This is now going to be,
it was this original $1,000

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.800
that the farmer spent
for the builder.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.310
So it's going to be
that original $1,000

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.580
plus this first, right
over here this 0.6 times

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.990
1,000 that the builder
spent, that $600.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.140
So that's 0.6 times
1,000 plus-- then

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.930
we had this time
the farmer said,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.260
I'm going to spend 60% of that.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.540
So that was 0.6
squared times 1,000.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.834
Plus 0.6 squared times 1,000.

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:42.250
And then this guy said, oh,
I'm going to spend 60% of that

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.520
now that I got that 0.6
squared times 1,000.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.760
So he's going to take
60% of that and spend it.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.650
And that gave us that 0.6 to
the third power times 1,000.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.840
Plus 0.6 to the third
power times 1,000.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.540
And then the last one we
did, it would keep going on

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.040
and on forever,
theoretically, is

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.180
you're going to have plus 0.6
to the fourth power times 1,000.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.510
And this would keep
going on and on forever.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.550
We could then would be plus 0.6
to the fifth power times 1,000,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.020
plus 0.6 to the sixth power.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.880
Keep going on and on forever.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.887
And one of the fascinating
things about mathematics,

00:07:19.887 --> 00:07:21.720
and maybe the next
video, I'll reprove this.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.410
I've proven this in
multiple playlists,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.760
is that you can actually
sum up because this value

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.110
right over here is less
than 1, this actually

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.970
ends up being a finite sum.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.720
You can actually take
this infinite sum

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.530
and get a finite number.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.900
So just to simplify this,
the total output that's

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.600
kind of sparked by
that original $1,000,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.110
we can factor out the 1,000--
I'll do this in a new color--

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.390
so we can factor out the 1,000.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.820
And we are left with--
well if we factor of 1,000

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.950
there you get 1 plus
0.6 plus 0.6 squared

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:01.470
plus 0.6 to the third power
plus 0.6 to the fourth power.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.470
And it goes on and on and on.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.070
And in the next video, maybe
I'll prove it, just for fun.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.990
But this right over here,
it's an infinite sum

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.680
of a geometric series.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.710
And this will actually
simplify to-- I'll

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.040
do it in the same green
color-- as 1 over 1 minus 0.6.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.060
So whatever this number is right
over here, it'll be 1 minus 1

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.080
over that.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:32.409
And so in this case, this
would be equal to 1 over 0.4.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.539
And 0.4 is 2/5.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:40.400
So this is equal to 1 over
2/5, which is equal to 5/2.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:50.050
So your total output is going
to be equal to 1,000 times 5/2.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.220
Or this is the same thing as
equal to 1,000 times 2 and 1/2,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.410
which is equal to 2,500.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.150
So there's two interesting
ideas that are going here.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.550
One is, when people get
a little bit more income,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.090
they're going to
spend some of it.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.160
And that's where the marginal
propensity to consume is.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
We're assuming it's linear,
that no matter how much you give

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.540
them, they're just going
to spend 60% of that.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.740
And then given that, that 60%,
it keeps getting multiplied

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.150
and going through the economy.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.650
You essentially have
this multiplier effect,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.720
that that 1,000 got spent,
some fraction of that gets

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720
spent, then some fraction
of that gets spent.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.690
And so what we ended up
doing is that first $1,000

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.260
got multiplied by 2.5.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.380
And this 2.5 was
completely a function

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.540
of what the marginal
propensity to consume was.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.480
So we have this
relationship here

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.100
is that whatever the marginal
propensity to consume is,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.630
that drives the multiplier.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.980
And all the multiplier
is saying is

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.780
if you spend an extra dollar
in this economy, given people's

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.260
marginal propensity to
consume, how much will that

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.794
increase total output?
