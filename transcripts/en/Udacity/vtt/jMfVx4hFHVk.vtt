00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.907
The reason that we're not increasing clock speed

00:00:01.907 --> 00:00:05.744
is not that the transistors have stopped getting smaller and faster.

00:00:05.744 --> 00:00:10.881
Even though transistors are continuing to get smaller and faster and consume less energy per transistor,

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.392
the problem is running a billion transistors generates an awful lot of heat,

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:16.689
and we can't keep all these processors cool.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.458
Power has emerged as a primary driving factor,

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:23.892
possibly the most important factor in modern processor design at all scales,

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:28.499
from a mobile phone that you keep in your pocket all the way to the very largest supercomputers.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.394
The consequence is we can't keep building processors in the way we always have

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:34.906
by making a single processor faster and faster.

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:38.975
When we do that, we end up with processors that we simply can't keep cool.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:43.948
Instead, processor designers have turned to building smaller, more efficient processors in terms of power,

00:00:43.948 --> 00:00:48.725
and they then spend their extra resources to build a larger number of efficient processors

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.518
rather than faster less-efficient processors.
