CHARLES VOGL: So let me
talk a little bit about why

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.080
I talk about community.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.580
When I was in my 20s, I
remember on a particular Sunday

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.170
I joined my cousin, Erin, to her
large, hip, urban church in Los

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.080
Angeles.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.130
And I joined her that day
because I was, at that time,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.040
looking for a
spiritual community.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.550
And I wondered if I
would belong there.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.210
And I remembered
when we got there,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.960
the service began with
the downbeat from the band

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.620
at the front of the room.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.670
And as soon as that happened,
everyone in that auditorium--

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.100
well over 1,000
people-- stood up,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.870
raised their hands
over their heads,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.980
and started swaying
with the music.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.520
I also remember about
halfway through that service,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.310
I was tired of pretending that
that was comfortable for me.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.560
And there was nothing wrong
with what they were doing.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.540
I was just looking for something
far more contemplative.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.030
And so about halfway
through, I quietly sat down.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.350
I remember when I sat
down alone, the looks

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.970
and the frowns that were
directed at me-- while I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.130
sat there by myself.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.590
And I felt pretty clearly
that I didn't belong there.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.990
I'm here talking about
community today--

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.800
and I've obviously
written a book about it.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.966
But what I want you to know
before we go any further

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.360
is the deep truth
about why I'm here

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.740
is I felt like an outsider
for a very long time.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.720
And when I mean outsider,
I mean like cry alone

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.040
at night kind of
outsider and wonder

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770
if I'd ever have
the kind of friends

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.820
that I actually wanted
kind of outsider.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.130
And quite frankly, I
wondered whether I'd ever

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.850
find the place where
I felt confident

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.610
that I belonged there.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.570
And I spent years looking for
where I thought I would belong.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.030
In fact, in my 20s,
I went and served

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.610
in the US Peace Corps
in northern Zambia

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.600
on the Zaire border.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.710
And I remember when I
left for the Peace Corps,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.450
I was so excited to
meet the people that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.690
were as brave and as
adventurous as I wanted to be.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.120
When I got to the village,
I was really lonely.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880
And maybe that
shouldn't be a surprise

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.310
because I was far away.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.950
I was in a place with a totally
different culture, a totally

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.680
different food,
and quite frankly,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.690
people who just had no
familiarity with someone

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.080
like me.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.750
When I say I was
lonely, I mean like cry

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.680
alone at night kind of lonely.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.030
And as much of the
villagers welcomed me

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.075
for a good amount of time there,
I thought I didn't belong.

00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.450
But they certainly
did welcome me

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.544
and it was a life
changing experience.

00:02:40.544 --> 00:02:41.960
But when I was in
the Peace Corps,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.543
one of things I did
expect was to have

00:02:43.543 --> 00:02:45.640
a certain amount of
community and connection

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.690
with other volunteers.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.795
And that was certainly
true at some level.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:50.170
But I also remember
that we would

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.790
sit at campfires on occasions
and often, there were

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790
big stacks of beer beside us.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.290
And behind me, there seemed
to be a never ending game

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.540
of beer cricket going on.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.250
And I remember one night, a
volunteer I'll called Jake,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.780
turned to me and
he said, Charles,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.870
I don't trust people
who don't get drunk.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.800
And because I didn't drink,
well, he didn't trust me.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.520
And because of
conversations like that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.510
in evenings like
that, at some level,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.400
I was pretty confident
that I didn't really

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.946
belong among those volunteers.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.090
In my 30s, I moved
to New York City.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.930
And by this point, I'd
spent years looking

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.055
for exactly where I belong.

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:34.440
And it was a New York City
that a very famous pastor who

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.750
works in the Upper East Side
shared with me the wisdom by CS

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.341
Lewis called "The Inner Ring".

00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:43.090
And that's when I
discovered I was looking

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.360
for totally the wrong thing.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.820
And what Lewis wrote about
was that we all want to find,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.080
what he called an inner
ring to belong to.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.380
And these inner rings
are exclusive groups

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.270
of people who are
cooler than the groups

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.590
that we are already a part of.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.510
And there's nothing wrong
with these inner rings.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.930
The problem comes with
our desire or our longing

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.210
to be inside them.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.050
In fact, this longing
causes really good people

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.957
to do really bad
things and is the cause

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:17.956
of a lot of unhappiness.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.100
We also discover when we try
to enter these inner rings

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.770
that whenever we get
inside of a ring,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.430
we always discover there's
another inner ring.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.262
And this pattern continues
forever, unless we break it.

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:39.720
This pattern of always wanting
to be in the next inner ring

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.094
and there is never
an end of them

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:43.110
he called the trap
of the inner ring

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.060
and he did give us
a way to break it.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.612
And his solution was find
something you like to do,

00:04:51.612 --> 00:04:54.530
do it often, invite
anybody who wants to do it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.590
with you to come do it.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.210
And he says that if we do that,
the people who show up and do

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.530
that thing with us will
create a very specific kind

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.750
of relationship with us that
allows us to break the trap.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.410
And that relationship
is called friendship.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.030
And I was exposed to this.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.190
It was deeply inspiring
because I thought, well,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.760
even if I couldn't find exactly
where I was supposed to belong,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.170
maybe I can create it.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.210
The next year I went to
graduate school at Yale

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.050
to study religion,
philosophy, ethics,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.880
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.200
And when I got to
Yale, one of the things

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.790
that surprised me was it turns
out the history of the school

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.120
is so large and grand that many
students-- certainly not just

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.500
me-- often are convinced that
we'll never be good enough

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.660
to actually belong there.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.310
Many of us walk around concerned
that at any given moment

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.560
someone's going to approach
us, tap us on the shoulder

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.490
and explain, there's
been a terrible mistake,

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.580
expose us for the fraud
we already knew we were,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.100
and then tell us that
we need to leave.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.460
And it turns out that many
of us are walking around

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.360
with this confidence
that we were going to be

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.500
asked to leave any moment.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.100
Well keeping Lewis's wisdom
in mind, my now wife Socheata

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.900
and I started a dinner series
in our home every Friday night.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.090
We would make a large
dinner and anybody

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.490
who wanted to join us
for dinner could do so.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.650
And I promise you
that first semester I

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.361
was convinced many times
this was a terrible idea.

00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:28.360
There are times when
people said they would come

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.670
and they would cancel.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.420
There were times when
I'd make a huge meal

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.944
and three people on the
entire campus would show up.

00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:35.360
And there were all
the times where

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.890
I had turn down all the
invitations on every Friday

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.580
night and everything on campus.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.930
Then of course, all the
stuff going on in New York.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.800
But that first year
something surprising happened

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.540
and the dinners
became very popular

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.780
and they became very,
very successful.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.080
In fact, they became so
successful after two years

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.920
that my wife and I hosted
over 500 people in our home

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.050
and we couldn't keep
up with the exhaustion.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.390
So we had to create a whole
team to run the dinners that

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.390
would plans the menu, that
would cook the meals, and quite

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.990
frankly, keep up with this
demand and we got to a place

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.106
where Arjan would go ahead and
organize the dinner leaders who

00:07:11.106 --> 00:07:12.480
then organize the
volunteers that

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.646
would then make the dinners.

00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:17.410
And then Sam would go on
and manage the sponsors

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.970
and then the wait lists we
were creating every week.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.900
And I'll tell you, over those
dinners, cooking those meals,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.150
cleaning my kitchen, I formed
some of the most important

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.350
friendships in my entire life.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.030
In fact, those friends
have hiked with me

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.500
across the mountains of Peru,
they've eaten across Vietnam

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.580
with me, and a number
of them stood with me

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.529
at my wedding on
a Pacific island

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:43.820
and in the middle of the ocean.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.580
We weren't was making
dinners together,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.784
we were creating
powerful friendships.

00:07:53.784 --> 00:07:55.200
These friendships
were so powerful

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.750
that now they let
me call them when

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.340
I'm having my worst days so I
no longer have to cry alone.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.230
And sometimes, those
friends now call me and they

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.400
cry in my living room.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.230
My sixth year at
Yale, my friend Melo

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.930
asked me to lunch
at the Yale commons.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.090
And the two of us
sat in a long table

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.450
the north side of
the dining hall

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.900
underneath that vaulted
ceiling and Melo

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.480
told me something over that
lunch that was a real surprise.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.140
He told me that his
first year at Yale

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.250
had been his hardest
year of his life.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.500
In fact, he had moved from the
Philippines and the workload,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.280
the culture, and the New
England weather were hard enough

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.460
to be challenging.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.179
But when he got
here, they discovered

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.990
that his medical doctor wife,
Jazz, couldn't work legally

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.760
in Connecticut.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.390
And so she had to live far away
so they could make ends meet.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.800
And then while he was on
campus for that first semester,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.890
his mother's fight
with cancer worsened.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.000
And Melo couldn't afford a last
minute trip to the Philippines.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.180
And so when his mother
died, he couldn't visit her,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.590
he couldn't say goodbye, and
he couldn't say, I love you,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.470
one last time.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.870
And so what he actually
did was like me--

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.830
he cried alone at night.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.280
He told me that when he got back
to the Philippines that summer,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.610
his attitude was he
was sure he would never

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.542
return to New Haven.

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:24.000
It didn't matter that he had
a full scholarship to the best

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.030
school in his
field in the world.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.080
He told me he knew
it was just too much.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.630
And then he told me, I
remembered your invitations.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.800
I remembered dinners
at your house.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.980
I started creating
community to serve me,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.080
but now I've realized I'm
doing it to help others.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.940
It changed our lives and I
know how deeply important

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.660
it is that we all belong.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.720
So that's actually why
I teach about community

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.930
and that's actually
why I'm here today.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.380
Because it's very rare that
a friend comes to me and says

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.430
my whole life has changed
because you invited me.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.430
And so it's fun and
sometimes difficult

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.994
to tell that to a crowd.

00:10:04.994 --> 00:10:06.410
Before I move
forward, I just want

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.010
make sure we're on the
same page and what I mean

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.340
about recognizing community.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.030
So let's just get that
definition covered.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.300
We could talk about groups.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.190
Nothing wrong with groups.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.500
We're all part of
lots of groups.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.791
I consider a group of people
who have gathered together

00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:19.670
and that could be
for a good reason.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.120
A tribe might be
a group then that

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.250
shares a value or an interest.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.370
We're all part of that.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.520
When I talk about community,
what I'm talking about

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.610
are people who share a mutual
concern for one another.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.885
And it is that mutual concern
that makes us a community.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.260
So when we talk about leadership
in community or building

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.009
a community, we're
talking about how do we

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:42.205
build that mutual concern.

00:10:42.205 --> 00:10:44.205
There are lot of things
we could talk about when

00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:45.288
we talk about communities.

00:10:45.288 --> 00:10:47.950
We can talk identity and values
and insider understanding.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.157
Those are all perfectly
good things to talk about.

00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:52.740
I'm not going to put it on the
front half of this presentation

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.239
today.

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.360
We can talk about it later
if you have other questions.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.060
Let's talk of the
problem of community.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.990
Why do we even have to
talk about it at all.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.781
Why isn't it just
everywhere all the time--

00:11:01.781 --> 00:11:02.740
we're all good at it.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.690
I think one of the
reasons is that we're

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.500
one of the most
loneliest generations

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.150
in American history from what I
can tell the research shows us.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.080
Just a few statistics to
help you understand that.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.700
Personal networks seem to
have decreased about one third

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.367
in the last two generations.

00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:21.200
And we're now at a place
in American history

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.650
where more Americans say
they don't have someone

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.449
to talk to about important
subjects than people who do.

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:30.740
And to give you a sense of
what that change looks like,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.823
the number of people who
don't have that confidant

00:11:32.823 --> 00:11:36.310
has tripled in just
the last generation.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.840
So we're in a time
where there may

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.134
be more longing to be
connected than ever before.

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.550
So how do we build
and strengthen.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.230
Well, one of the
things that's going on

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.310
is I find that when I talk
about building community,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.030
often, for people who are
leaders in building community,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.889
they're scared to
death of structure.

00:11:52.889 --> 00:11:54.930
So I have a picture here
of a big bridge that has

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.720
a lot of structure holding up.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.850
And the attitude seems
to be that [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.791
if we add structure,
we're just being evil.

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:03.540
And I understand where
that's coming from.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.770
We've all seen organizations
and communities

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.900
that have so much
structure it's suffocating.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.540
But I just want to
share that's just

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.290
totally wrongheaded thinking.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.170
In fact, part of
my work is looking

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.340
at 3,000 years of
spiritual tradition

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.880
where people have used
principles and structures

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.310
to come together for
literally millennia, often

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.730
through existential
threatening times.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.160
And they've done this so
successfully that we can go out

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.560
right now and we can meet the
descendants of those traditions

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.000
that are still together.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.470
So there are principles,
ideas, and structures

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.630
that we can borrow
from these millennia

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:42.810
and use them wherever we want
to build community ourselves.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.370
This is a certain point
that often gets overlooked.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.030
The communities that I talk
about are only serving.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.530
If there is a community there
that is trying to use people

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.238
or is just forcing me
to be a part of it,

00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.140
that is not what
I'm speaking to.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.590
I'm assuming that if someone
is joining the communities

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.970
that you're building that
they're growing in some way

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.720
and you want to help them grow.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.990
And if not, then this
probably doesn't apply.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.607
All right.

00:13:04.607 --> 00:13:06.940
I'm going to introduce there's
three ideas from the book

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.400
briefly and we can talk about as
much of this later as you want.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.210
The first idea is that
strong communities

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.650
have a clear boundary or they
at least have a boundary.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.910
Whenever I bring
this up, I usually

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.385
hear some pushback on that.

00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:22.586
That boundaries are bad.

00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:24.210
And I understand
where that comes from.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.040
And it's not a bad
thing that people

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.380
are worried about boundaries.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.080
But if we want to create strong
connections in our community,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.430
we have to, at some level,
know where the boundary is.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.980
And well, the boundary is
good because it keeps people

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.335
together who share values.

00:13:38.335 --> 00:13:40.960
So it may not be important what
they look like, what they wear,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.410
where they live, but at some
level, we're sharing values.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.197
And the reason
that's important is

00:13:46.197 --> 00:13:47.780
you want to bring
in community and you

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.480
want to tell me that everyone
belongs in the community.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.240
The first question
I have is, is there

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.729
anybody in the
world that doesn't

00:13:56.729 --> 00:13:58.520
share the values that
are important for you

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.220
for your community.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.920
And the answer is
yes, then there's

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.230
somebody who shouldn't be in
your community, at least now.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.480
And therein will give you a
hint of where the boundary is.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.530
If you don't have
a boundary at all

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.010
or you refuse to acknowledge
that you have a boundary,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.600
you run into what I call the
everything-nothing conundrum.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.610
If everybody in
the entire world,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.210
as far as you're concerned,
belongs in your community,

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.100
then there's no
difference between people

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.890
in your community and people
who are not in your community.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.220
And that makes it look a lot
like there is no community.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.550
And it's hard to build
strength within the community

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.242
if no one can tell who's in
your community and where it is.

00:14:41.242 --> 00:14:42.950
To give you a sense
of how pervasive this

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.283
is, one of people I interviewed
for my book is my friend

00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:46.230
Gabriel Grant.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.430
About 10 years ago, Gabriel
Grant with some partners

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.230
founded the Byron Fellowship.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.060
The Byron Fellowship brings
in global social entrepreneurs

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.220
around the world, brings them in
for an intensive training here

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.440
in the United States,
and then connects them

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.130
for the rest of their careers
as they create social change

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.990
on all the continents.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.940
And when I asked Gabriel
in the interview, who

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.090
belongs in the
Byron fellowship, I

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.000
remember there was a
long pause and then he

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.580
laughed really hard.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.560
And he said, well,
what I want to say

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.850
is everyone belongs in
the Byron Fellowship.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.340
But he laughed hard because
the Byron Fellowship only

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.770
accepts nominees from
faculty from the top 100

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.180
universities in the world.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.017
And once those
nominees are made,

00:15:27.017 --> 00:15:28.600
then the staff of
the Byron Fellowship

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.290
go through those
nominees and select

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.820
a small minority of those.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.800
So they've actually got
a global system set up

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.990
to keep most people out to come
down to the very few Fellows

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.880
that they'll accept,
fly in, and train.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.980
But his instinct is the say,
when interviewed, everyone

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.580
belongs in our community.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.680
Which is to say, it's
a common instinct,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.120
but it's not necessarily
a great policy

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.970
for creating an
intimate community.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.180
And that has to be acknowledged
at some level-- that

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.100
not everybody all the time
in our community, thus,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.574
a boundary.

00:16:02.574 --> 00:16:03.990
Maybe you are
afraid of boundaries

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.580
because you think all boundaries
do is they keep people out.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.830
And they tell them to go away.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.288
And we've all seen
communities that

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:11.470
have a boundary that
seems kind of silly

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.370
and maybe kind of mean.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.200
I want to flip that around--
that if you're on the inside

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.190
and you're thinking
about building community

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.856
and since you're in
this room and you're

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.060
listening to me now and
hoping you're in that club--

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.030
we can think of
boundaries as primarily

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.160
as keeping somewhere safe.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.330
And we have to sometimes
keep some people out

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.690
so the inside is safe.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.640
But our priority is
keeping the inside safe,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.056
not concerning
ourselves who we're

00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:36.680
keeping out any given minute.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.210
So the question
I have for you is

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.800
you're building
community in a church

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.870
or otherwise is-- how do
we want inside to be safe

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.740
and who do you want
to be safe there.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.000
And how is it different
from everywhere else, where

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.809
they may not feel so
safe, talking about things

00:16:51.809 --> 00:16:54.350
we want them to talk about or
sharing the things that they're

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.850
going to share about when
they're on the inside.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.740
And then making that explicit.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.370
A great example that
came to mind is funerals.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.060
I was briefly a
chaplain in a hospital

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.369
and I was so honored when
families would allow me

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:11.450
into rooms where,
on some occasions,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.060
they were literally
having the worst

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.940
hours of their lives--
with a death in the family

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.630
or sitting with
someone who is sick.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.900
And that was a sacred space.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.275
They don't let everybody in
because whenever someone came

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:25.270
in, they wanted to make sure
that that person honored

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.130
what was going on in that room.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.200
And honored that they needed to
have that support in that time

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.350
and not take selfies as soon
as they came in the room.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.200
So we can create our
communities in a way

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.060
that when someone walks
in, they understand

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.280
that they're being honored.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.430
That we're keeping them safe
with whatever they share there.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.110
We're going to find those
connections building.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.610
All right.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.443
And the way that we
make sure that we're not

00:17:46.443 --> 00:17:48.300
the jerks that are
just keeping people out

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.190
is we make sure there's
achievable entry.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.560
Here's a same bridge I
showed a photograph of.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.660
And if you want to
enter that bridge,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.599
there is an entry
you can walk through.

00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:58.640
And there's a difference
between making something

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.160
the self-selecting-- when
someone sees the values inside

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.990
and they want to join that--
and selecting someone, say

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.060
by nomination or application.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.990
All right, the second idea
I'm going to introduce here

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.790
is what I call the
Inner Rings Principle.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.840
In mature communities,
what we find is

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.700
there is a series of inner
rings that a new member

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.630
can enter as they grow.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.940
So the outer ring would be
visitor in the next ring

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.580
might be a member and then
they progress in there.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.340
And instead of the
inner ring simply

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.390
being more boundaries
for someone

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.120
to cross so they can
then brag about being

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.060
in an exclusive
group, the inner rings

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.300
reflect an expansion of
their sphere of concern.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.607
And I'll talk more
about that in a minute.

00:18:46.607 --> 00:18:48.190
But when someone
joins our community--

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.700
and that can be a
church-- the question

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.940
is, what's available for me.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.400
And most of us want
to grow in some way

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.890
and the rings offer a path or an
acknowledgement of that growth.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.294
And we want to grow in two ways.

00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:02.960
It may be that there
is technical things

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.440
that we want to get good at.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.930
But more important
in our community

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.629
is there's a way we
want to grow internally.

00:19:09.629 --> 00:19:11.170
And the rings will
reflect that as we

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.100
go from a visitor to a member to
a novice to an elder than maybe

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.320
even principal elder or master.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.880
So the example looks
like this if we chart it.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.360
Someone travels inside
and that's their path.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.954
The example I'm going to bring
here because it's easy to use

00:19:26.954 --> 00:19:28.120
is that of the "Karate Kid".

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.110
Hopefully, some of you
have seen this film

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.090
or at least heard of it.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.510
If we think of, say, the karate
community or martial arts

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.280
community-- when Daniel shows up
he is concerned about one thing

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.954
and that's himself.

00:19:41.954 --> 00:19:43.370
He wants to protect
himself and he

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.837
wants to get good at fighting.

00:19:44.837 --> 00:19:46.420
And that would be
an outside ring and.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.010
His realm of concern is
pretty small-- it's him.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.230
And he finds an elder, maybe
even a principal master,

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.650
in Mr Miyagi, who then
teaches him about karate.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.390
And we see over the
course of the film

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.660
that he learns
technical skills--

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.380
punching, kicking--
but of course, we also

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.200
see that he learns internal
growth, discipline,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.270
and honoring elders.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.810
Elsewhere in the film,
we see another dojo

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.070
by another ostensible master,
who is also teaching them

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.250
mostly just technical skills.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.610
And he claims to be
a master, but when

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.250
we talk about the inner
rings, about growing

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.790
their realm of concern, we
know by the end of the film

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.450
that he's only
concerned about himself

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.070
and his own group of fighters.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.860
And we know that because
in the third act,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.600
he encourages his own fighters
to hurt other fighters

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.710
whereas Mr. Miyagi is about not
only all fighters in karate,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.230
but he demonstrates
in the first act

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.710
that he even cares about kids
getting beat up on the street.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.376
Which is to say, he's
concerned not only

00:20:45.376 --> 00:20:47.200
about everybody in
his tribe, but he's

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.480
concerned about how the
tribe serves and interacts

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.440
with a dynamic world.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.650
So in the best, most
mature communities,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.400
as we go in those
inner rings, we

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.899
don't enter those inner
rings just to brag about it--

00:20:58.899 --> 00:21:00.440
we enter those inner
rings because we

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.590
get to concern ourselves
with more people

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.960
until the point we're
concerned about the whole world

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.710
as an elder master.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.120
That's the Inner Ring Principle.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.229
The last idea I'm
going to introduce here

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.020
is what I call the
Crisis of Belongingness.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.144
This is not one of the main
principles of the book,

00:21:15.144 --> 00:21:16.620
but it is discussed.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.190
And the Crisis of Belonging
is exactly the phenomenon

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.880
I referenced earlier in
my story with Melo and me,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.930
where we were convinced
we didn't belong,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.710
even though from the
outside, it looked

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.580
like we did to everybody else.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.870
And hopefully you
have some empathy

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.940
with what this feels
like-- to be somewhere

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.160
where you're invited
but not quite convinced

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.370
that you belong there.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:42.800
It often feels like-- it looks
like this when we're there.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.180
I bring this up because it's
far more common than I ever

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.280
thought it would be.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.920
And I share it here
because I've discovered

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.580
that one of the things that
addresses this is so simple,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.800
it's actually almost
difficult to believe.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.140
And that's simply
making invitations.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.480
When we make an
invitation to someone

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.590
who's in a crisis of belonging
or even when we're experiencing

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.200
ourselves, as I did
in graduate school,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.050
the invitation does two things.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.430
The first one is every time we
make an invitation to someone,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.300
they get evidence
that they belong.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.150
And whether they accept
that invitation or not,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.200
they now have a data
point that someone else

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.870
thinks they belong.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.210
And when we're having
that crisis of belonging,

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.160
every time we make
an invitation,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.230
we share with others that
we have the authority

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.760
to help others
belong to the point

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.810
where it doesn't actually
matter if anybody joins us

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.100
almost ever.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.162
The invitations themselves
have all the power.

00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:48.620
What I didn't tell
you about Melo--

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.950
and here's a picture of him on
a far more happier day-- is he

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.760
only came to my home
for dinner three times

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.300
that entire first year.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.720
It wasn't the dinners they gave
him the strength to come back.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.610
It was the invitations
that he was welcomed

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.080
at those dinners that let
him know that he wasn't alone

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.740
and that he belonged.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.452
And that changed
his entire life.

00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:12.160
And as we're working
in our communities--

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.520
and includes churches--
the invitations

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.030
we can extend at almost no cost.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.530
All right.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.950
Before, I move forward
to go into discussion,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.490
there's three thoughts I
want to leave you with.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.700
The first one is
I really believe

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.280
community needs to be fun.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.800
If they're not fun, I don't
want people showing up

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.425
and I certainly don't
want to help to build it.

00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:33.800
We talked earlier
about churches.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.540
If church isn't fun,
then I can imagine

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.230
it's really hard to
get people involved.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.438
So everything that I've
talked about with community--

00:23:40.438 --> 00:23:42.270
the assumption is we
want to make this fun.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.910
The second idea I
want to share is

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.540
I really believe people are
desperate for connection.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.860
We talked about a few
statistics that I've

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.340
discovered while I was
doing research for the book,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.930
but as I talk to people
now around the country,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.770
I'm shocked about how
much we're in the rooms

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.860
where we're unaware how much
the other people in that room

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.974
are desperate to be
connected with us.

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.390
And I bring this
up so that you're

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.710
in this room now learning
about this, presumably,

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.010
there's a reason for that--
that you feel embolden

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.820
that, in fact, people are
waiting for you to invite them

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.060
in.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.520
And lastly, since we're
going invite people in,

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.090
to please be brave
with your invitations.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.240
I put a picture of
me in the Peace Corps

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.710
here for this last photograph.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.230
And the reason
for that is you're

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.950
really clear how much I looked
like the people in my village.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.680
And as I've grown
older and thought

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.830
about how they welcomed
me and invited me in

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.200
and fed me and looked
out for me-- how

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.090
brave they were to invite
me into their lives

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.160
and literally allowing me
to hold their children.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.930
And those invitations
and that welcome

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.330
literally changed my life.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.170
So I encourage us
all to consider

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.330
how being brave with invitations
can change the world.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.890
So those are the
ideas I want to share.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:52.880
Today is the day of
the book release.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.140
I'm excited to share
this with the world.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:54.940
So Nick.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.470
NICK: I know that you've been
asked for various technology

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.840
companies, finance companies,
to go and kind of be

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.440
a consultant of developing
a sense of community

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.930
in the workplace.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.220
So where would do
you even start there?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.690
What is ground one?

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:09.760
Is it more research?

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.070
Is it more you need to do
this or you need to do that.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.080
CHARLES VOGL: Well the
first question I have

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.480
is, why do you want to
bring people together.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.994
And I'm a big
believer that if you

00:25:21.994 --> 00:25:23.410
want to build a
genuine community,

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.774
there needs to be some
service being provided.

00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:27.440
People are committing
their time, right?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.880
There voting with their feet,
they're voting with their time.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.046
And I want to know if you
want to build it together,

00:25:32.046 --> 00:25:33.190
why do you want to do that.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.290
And if it's to get
something out of them,

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.820
then that's a
pretty cruddy reason

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.029
to go build community, right?

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:40.319
There are other ways to get
people to do things for you

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:42.119
than pretend you want
to build community.

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:44.160
So the first question is
why do you want to do it

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.420
and then why would they
want to participate.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:49.020
And then when
that's established,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.990
we know that people do
want to participate.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.900
Then the next question
I have is, well,

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.640
how do people know when
they belong, right?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.190
You may think you
know or you may

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.250
think that they should
know, but how do they know.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.100
And it's really
remarkable how much

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.781
the answer is, I have no idea.

00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:07.280
Right?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.520
They should know.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.520
And I've actually spoken to
a number of religious leaders

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.520
about this who are trying
to grow their churches

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.170
or at least grow the
connections in their church

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.420
and it's shocking
how difficult it

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.600
is for someone who's visiting
to find out how they can belong,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.007
how they can get invited.

00:26:24.007 --> 00:26:26.090
And one of things that I
think is really important

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.531
is what I call a gatekeeper.

00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:29.030
If there's a community
that you want

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.380
to be part of as a visitor
to an event-- for example,

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.350
you figure out, well,
there are values here

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.400
I want to participate in, right?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.140
A commitment, a service that
I want to participate in.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.930
Who are the people that
can find that visitor

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.170
and invite them
across that boundary.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.890
Do you just leave it up to
visitors to figure it out.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.620
Do they walk around
kind of ignored

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.010
until they figure out they
can't find the gate in

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.640
and then they leave.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.170
And if you don't have people
who know that members need

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.440
to act as the gatekeeper to
help the right valued people

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.780
across the boundary, then
you're probably losing people.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.550
And I want to know
how that's happening.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.670
And the answer to that is
always going to change, right?

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.300
Because communities
are as diverse.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.790
Everybody gets together.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.210
But fundamentally,
a visitor is going

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.732
to need a way to get access in.

00:27:19.732 --> 00:27:21.190
AUDIENCE: If you,
take for example,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.090
a church that's largely just
visitors on that outer ring

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:29.300
and you, naturally, want to
bring them into community,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.600
either smaller sub-communities
within the church or just

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.730
the inner ring of
the church-- I guess,

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.580
mainly, my question is
about smaller communities

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580
within the church.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.260
How do you get someone who's
on the outside-- just sort

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.600
of on a visitor
level-- to acknowledge

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.130
the importance of joining one
of these smaller sub-communities

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.300
and becoming in the inner
ring of one of those?

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.140
CHARLES VOGL: Right.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.150
So the answer is, of course, I
don't know about your church.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.380
Which is to say, if I say
things that don't apply to you,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.910
you're probably right,
because I've never

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.909
visited anybody there and
seen your programming.

00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:05.650
And I want you to
know that I don't

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.080
have that much hubris to
know how you should run that.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.850
The questions that
just to my mind

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.860
is, do those visitors know
what's available to them.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.742
Do they know the values
or the priorities

00:28:16.742 --> 00:28:19.200
of those small groups that you
think they may want to join.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.000
And maybe, quite frankly,
none of those visitors

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.180
want anything what you're
offering, if that's the case--

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.210
and I'm not assuming it is.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.335
But if it is the case,
maybe the best case scenario

00:28:26.335 --> 00:28:27.910
is they don't show up, right?

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.930
But I don't know that.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.830
If we're assuming
that that's wrong,

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.370
that they do want
what you're offering--

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.600
and by virtue of
that, belong there--

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.360
the question is, do you know how
they're learning what's there.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.860
And then the other
question I have--

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.340
and I know what the answer to
it is-- how are they getting

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.760
invited.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.290
Because maybe they
do belong there,

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.340
but they're not getting
that invitation, right?

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.230
And it could be a
matter that we think,

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:55.350
well gee, they
know it's there, we

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.933
say it's there, that
should be enough.

00:28:56.933 --> 00:28:59.570
Fair enough, but if you're not
getting the results you want,

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.750
the question is, can you
invite them more powerfully.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.690
Let them know that they're
invited-- not, it's available

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:07.830
and people can show up.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.413
And partly that's going to come
from someone that I referenced

00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:13.200
earlier-- a gatekeeper-- who
understands for people to cross

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.579
the boundary that
they want to cross,

00:29:15.579 --> 00:29:17.620
that we want them to cross
so that they will grow

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.370
to be enriched in the
ways they want to be grown

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.040
and enriched-- someone's
got to take that role.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.925
Otherwise, people bounce off
and for almost obvious reasons.

00:29:25.925 --> 00:29:27.300
AUDIENCE: And
we're going to take

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.880
the example of a music band.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.120
I heard you say community
is about having fun.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.410
And yes, of course, for example,
playing music can be fun.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.140
But at the same
time, my question

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.490
was, how do you
get people that are

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.340
out there on their
free will to commit

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:48.320
to do things that are maybe
less fun but need to happen?

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.429
Or like in your example
with the dinner,

00:29:50.429 --> 00:29:52.220
how do you make the
transition for somebody

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.790
that comes and hangs
out and it's fun

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.220
to actually do
something about it

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.322
and get involved and prepare
the next meal or whatever?

00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:01.030
CHARLES VOGL: OK.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.450
So when you say
get involved, you

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.700
don't simply mean, get
involved, have fun,

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.970
but at the end of the day,
there are mechanical needs

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.640
that have to happen.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.980
And you need people to do that
so that the entire community

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.510
can participate in this event.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.490
Again, the question that jumps
to my mind-- and we may not

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:20.630
have time to answer
it in detail now--

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.457
is, well, why are they coming.

00:30:22.457 --> 00:30:25.040
And I'm certain there's a good
reason, because they're coming.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.120
And you said when they're
coming of their own free will--

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.950
hopefully, everything
we're talking about,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.640
people who are coming in
of their own free will.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.848
And if they're not, then
that's an entirely different

00:30:32.848 --> 00:30:34.685
conversation.

00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:36.140
So they're coming,
they're voting,

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.640
there's something that they're
getting there they're excited

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.360
about .

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.010
And I'm going to guess that
they are growing in a way

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.350
that they want to grow.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.100
Now, that could be
musically, but my guess

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.990
is that's probably just part and
a minority of the way they're

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.580
growing when they
show up with you

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.310
in your community
for those hours.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.760
My guess is what's
going on there

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.510
is the other way
that they're growing

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.220
is they're building friendships
and maybe even they're becoming

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.150
better friends-- that
some percentage of people

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.790
are showing up actually
do want to contribute.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.240
And if they value coming
together and building

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.170
that friendship and building
that friendship around music,

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.790
my guess is some
percentage of them

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.590
want to contribute to the
group in a way of creating

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.602
that container.

00:31:17.602 --> 00:31:20.060
Because a container can't happen
unless someone creates it,

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.260
right?

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.160
So the question that I have
is, can you make an invitation

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.930
or have you been making
invitations for those members

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.670
to create that container.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:34.120
When it makes clear,
what needs to be done,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.430
and why you're doing it.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.096
And I don't mean we're
doing it, like we

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.610
need to have enough chairs,
but why we're doing it

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.300
because this space is where
musicians come together

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.540
and build those friendships
over months and years,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.920
as opposed to finding
random events.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.850
In my experience, I'm
shocked-- in the best way--

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.397
how much people want
to contribute when

00:31:55.397 --> 00:31:57.230
they're invited to do
so in a community that

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.860
holds their values.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.420
And usually, my mistake
is I'm not asking enough.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.850
AUDIENCE: Some people are
willing to participate.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.220
And some people are there
just to get gigs and get paid.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.850
CHARLES VOGL: OK, I'm
glad you brought that up.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.800
So, obviously,
it's OK for people

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.280
to show up at some place with
different priority, right?

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.529
Because we're never going
to find an entire room where

00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:20.220
everybody has the
exact same priorities.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.182
And that's where it goes
to back to the values.

00:32:22.182 --> 00:32:23.890
So if you're getting
together because you

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:25.640
want to build friendships
and enjoy music,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.200
that's a very different
value than I'm here

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.360
to get my next job.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.480
And maybe those two could
remain compatible, right?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.210
But we can acknowledge
that they are different.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.690
And if what you want is
people to get together

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.760
to build friendship
and play music,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.635
at some point, if people
who aren't valuing

00:32:42.635 --> 00:32:45.010
that and their valuing their
next gig and everything that

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.093
doesn't give that to them
is a waste of their time

00:32:47.093 --> 00:32:49.950
and distraction--
there may come a time

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.830
where you need to draw
a more firm boundary.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.509
Because if you're
not getting support

00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:56.300
you need to create a
container looking for,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.650
it's just not sustainable.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.970
And if it's not
sustainable, then forget it.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.220
AUDIENCE: If we take the same
example-- you have musicians

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.240
out there for the wrong
values that you want

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.150
to build your community
around, then what do you

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:10.990
do with those guys?

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.106
Do you get rid of them?

00:33:12.106 --> 00:33:13.730
CHARLES VOGL: If it's
important for you

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.420
to have a group that has
the values that you want

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.570
and not have people with
values you're not looking.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.480
Now, if they change their
values, fair enough, right?

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.050
Because you're not
telling them they

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.520
can't come because
of who they are.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.187
It's just that you
don't want people

00:33:24.187 --> 00:33:25.770
marketing themselves--
you want people

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.700
building friendship and
playing music, right?

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.274
So if that's important for
you, then I think, yes.

00:33:33.274 --> 00:33:34.690
You put it as
getting rid of them.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.106
I would say I think
it's important

00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:39.290
that you identify the people
you want to invest in.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.130
And now how you draw that
line is going to be up to you

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.630
and I don't have the
solution for that, right?

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.260
And it could be that you just
have other events where you're

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.290
only inviting people that have
the values you're looking for.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.397
Or you create rules
that says, look,

00:33:53.397 --> 00:33:54.980
while we're here
doing this, we're not

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.180
doing this other thing, right?

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.930
And if you want to do that,
that's fine, just not here now.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.960
Because this is the space.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.590
Because what you want to
create-- not everybody

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.552
belongs in that
group all the time

00:34:08.552 --> 00:34:10.510
AUDIENCE: I want to
challenge you a little bit,

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.817
jumping back to mentioning
the importance of fun.

00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:17.900
But then going back to the
story you started with,

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.315
in terms of going to the
church, people listening music

00:34:22.315 --> 00:34:23.690
were having fun
but you mentioned

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.270
you were looking for
something more contemplative.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:31.340
So I'm curious-- if by fun you
mean, is it really about fun?

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.270
Is it really about something
larger in terms of something

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.473
that we enjoy?

00:34:36.473 --> 00:34:37.889
Something that we
find meaningful?

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.222
Something that gives us purpose.

00:34:39.222 --> 00:34:43.020
Something that brings
excitement or adventure.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.574
How narrowly scoped do you want
to really focus on that fun?

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:46.949
CHARLES VOGL:
Well, I don't think

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:48.270
the fun is end all be all.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.530
The reason I bring it up
is that I've discovered

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.690
that in the literature
about community,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.147
often, it's not about fun.

00:34:55.147 --> 00:34:56.730
And the assumption
is people are there

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:57.900
because they have to be there.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.983
Because they live in the
same neighborhood or they

00:34:59.983 --> 00:35:03.080
work in the same company
and it's just no fun.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.349
And I don't I wouldn't want
to build that community.

00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:07.390
I certainly wouldn't want
to grow it unless there

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.130
was some element of fun.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.975
And in the book,
I discuss rituals.

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.850
And I think one of the
most important rituals

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.130
that a community needs to have
is what I call play rituals.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.940
The most common is feasting.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.540
And probably, every community
that isn't geared to you, there

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.380
is some time where you'd
get together and celebrate

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.230
with food.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.380
The fancy term is feast.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.650
That probably never occurred
to you as extraordinary,

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.594
but it's important.

00:35:32.594 --> 00:35:35.010
But can you imagine being in,
say, a corporate environment

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.890
or a neighborhood
environment where nobody ever

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.870
schedule time to have those kind
of meals or those times, right?

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:43.690
Because, we'll never
get any business done,

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.770
we're here for whatever.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.030
Well, that's no fun.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.070
I think something
that's meaningful

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.470
is terribly important.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.729
I don't know if in every
community, everywhere,

00:35:52.729 --> 00:35:54.270
we can create deep
levels of meaning.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.840
I would love that to happen.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.404
All the committees that I
invest my time in-- they

00:35:58.404 --> 00:35:59.570
are deeply meaningful to me.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:04.250
And what I mean by that is
they connect me with the past.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.550
And what I'm doing now is
connecting to the future.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.955
And I want most of what
I do to be standing

00:36:09.955 --> 00:36:11.580
in the tradition of
something, at least

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.080
standing on the shoulders of
the people who got me here

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.960
so I could do it now.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.780
And I want what
I'm doing to serve

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.780
people are going to come
next-- in the next hour

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.260
or the next generation.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.680
And as soon as that's
true, that's meaningful.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.030
I don't know if that's the
standard for every community.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.770
AUDIENCE: The other
thing I was hearing

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:32.296
that I want to check out with
you is, for these communities,

00:36:32.296 --> 00:36:34.170
there's this kind of
voluntary participation.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.970
It's not work, it's not
family, or commitments.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.296
Acknowledging that there's
an opportunity cost.

00:36:40.296 --> 00:36:42.670
Acknowledging that people who
are deciding to participate

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.590
rather than whatever
other way they

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.920
might spend their leisure time.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.410
And so how to make it
compelling in that way.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.670
CHARLES VOGL: If we, as
leaders-- meaning bringing

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:54.500
people together-- want to
build strong communities,

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.610
we have to know at some level
how people want to grow.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.350
And I count having
more friends to call

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.260
when I'm having a bad
night-- like totally counts.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.980
Because I'm growing
in a friendship

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.530
and growing and building
[INAUDIBLE] friends.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.488
But none the less, we
need to know how to grow.

00:37:10.488 --> 00:37:13.490
Because if they're not
growing and we're not

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.280
providing that-- even
if not personally, then

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.360
in the experience-- then I don't
know why people would show up.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.439
And I bring that up
because I'll talk to people

00:37:22.439 --> 00:37:24.230
and they don't know
how people are growing.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:26.490
And often, there
can be a mistake

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.190
of how they want to grow.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:31.140
So one of the people
interviewed for my book

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.730
is Marcus Graham, who's
the head of community

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:37.310
for the 100 million
unique user month

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.580
community on Twitch online.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.050
And 100 million people is
bigger than many countries

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.500
in the world.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.380
And they struggle
with understanding

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.380
how that diverse
amount of people

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.520
want to use their
platform and come together

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.500
and connect and use it.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.708
And they're not all the same.

00:37:53.708 --> 00:37:55.940
And as they grow, they get
more and more different.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.670
And so they've
learned that they need

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.530
to bring people into their
office in San Francisco.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.240
Even though they're one of
the largest online platform

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.284
for connection in the
history of the world,

00:38:05.284 --> 00:38:07.450
they've learned they need
to bring people physically

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.650
into their office and listen
to them for days in a row

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.871
to understand, what
is it you want.

00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:14.370
Now, they don't use
my language, how

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.328
do you want to grow, how
do you want to enrich.

00:38:16.328 --> 00:38:18.010
But goodness knows
the people who

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.656
will bring it don't
want the status quo

00:38:19.656 --> 00:38:21.280
and Twitch doesn't
want the status quo.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.510
But to get there from here,
they've got to understand that.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.020
And that's true for all of us.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.630
And we might get
lucky in the beginning

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.670
and marginal success will show
us, oh, something is right.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.340
But as the church gets
bigger or the music community

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.020
gets bigger, that's going to
make it harder and harder.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.360
And there may be a
divergence there.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.250
And that's OK to acknowledge
that not all communities need

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.750
to grow in their natural
trajectory all the time, right?

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.250
If it grows into something you
don't want to build anymore--

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.749
because maybe it's more about
getting people gigs than it is

00:38:50.749 --> 00:38:53.860
about growing the
music or appreciating

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.850
the tradition-- than it's OK,
as far as I'm concerned, to say,

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.225
that's not what I want to grow.

00:38:58.225 --> 00:39:00.850
That's one that you want to grow
and you're welcome to do that.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.660
But I would invest
my time elsewhere.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.530
AUDIENCE: I was curious
to know how important you

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.595
feel physically being
in the same place is.

00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:10.220
And you sort of
addressed this earlier,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.500
but do you think
that communities

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.580
that don't physically meet-- for
example, ones that are online--

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.670
are they capable of the same
level of being a community?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.510
Are the hampered
in particular ways?

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.110
And then a related
question would be,

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.740
if they do meet
physically in person,

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.890
how frequently do these kind of
physical meetings need to be?

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.951
Like, could it just
be at Christmas

00:39:31.951 --> 00:39:33.950
when everyone's visiting
their family-- they all

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.840
get together-- or et cetera.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.740
CHARLES VOGL: Right.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.220
Thanks for asking.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.720
So online communities
is something I

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.079
do address in the book briefly.

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.620
And to understand
that, I interviewed

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.770
people who are managing
millions of people

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:47.740
online in communities.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.280
And absolutely,
online communities

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.200
are communities and
provide an enormous amount

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.240
of support and connections
that are rich all of the world.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.320
No question about that.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.840
Also, what I
discovered in speaking

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.298
of people who
professionally manage

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:03.260
these is at the end
of the day, right now,

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.830
nothing matches bringing
people together in a room.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:11.190
And I'm sure there's a lot
of ideas of why that is.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.460
There's nothing wrong with
never going into that room.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.540
But when you build
that community online,

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.400
giving people a place to
come together and see one

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.314
another makes an
enormous difference.

00:40:22.314 --> 00:40:24.230
And one of the principles
that I do talk about

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.150
is the principle--
what I call the temple.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:28.540
And all the temple
is in the work

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:31.530
that I talk about is a place
where a community can come

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.630
together or people
of shared values

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.080
can come together
and enact rituals.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.080
And that ritual can simply
be feasting together.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.050
Or honoring somebody
in their community

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.520
that's honestly
important to them.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.650
When we come together
in what I call a temple,

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.600
one of things that
goes on is we can see

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.870
who else is in the community.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.820
And even if that is
a teeny percentage

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.060
of the people in
that community, we

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.380
get a sense of how
big the community is

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.920
and what it looks like and
the fact that we belong there.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.880
And leadership-- creating
a space where people

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.900
can come to-- and the
fancy word I use for that

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.240
his pilgrimage, where they have
the opportunity to pilgrimage

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.910
there-- can build belonging.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.680
And there's nothing wrong
with not coming to that place.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.180
And people who
come to that place

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.340
are not better than
the other people.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.090
But in leadership,
if we create that,

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.060
that creates a stronger
sense of belonging.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.170
And even for the
people who don't come,

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.330
knowing they can come, knowing
that there is an invitation,

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.410
knowing that they belong
there if they choose to go--

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.200
creates a stronger
sense of belonging.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.200
And so obviously, the
advantages of being online

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.040
is the internet doesn't sleep.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.720
Rent is pretty cheap.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.250
No one has to find the keys.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.904
Parking is usually pretty good.

00:41:42.904 --> 00:41:44.820
And so a lot of things
that happen online that

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.060
can't happen in an arena.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.050
However, not to
dismiss the investment

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.750
of bringing people together.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.380
And as far as
frequency goes, there's

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.080
no way for me to know that.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.280
I think a group of best friends
from high school-- maybe

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.360
they're cool with once a.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.890
Year people who are supporting
each other as their families

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.890
wrestle with a diagnosis
of cancer-- may

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.750
twice a week is just the
right amount of time, right?

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.000
I don't know the answer.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.179
You get to figure that out.

00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:13.970
But in both cases, what
we're acknowledging

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.480
is sitting in the same
room together makes

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.830
a profound difference.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.850
NICK: So you mentioned
feasting before.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:22.170
And as I said before,
I know personally,

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.830
you have perfected the
art of dinner parties.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:29.040
So I wanted to
know, say if we have

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.810
a network of friends-- this
will be the perfect way for me

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.800
to get there.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.670
What would you advise for that?

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:38.470
And how do we even
go about what would

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.090
be the best version of a feast?

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.580
So say, our team
here at Google--

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.260
great team of people we have.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.790
Gourmet food downstairs
and how do we frame it of,

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.600
I want to celebrate our
teamwork, what you've all done.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.430
And what is the best
way in a modern day

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:55.035
to create space for that?

00:42:55.035 --> 00:42:56.410
CHARLES VOGL: So
let me be really

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.150
clear that I'm certain
that I don't know how

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.500
your community should feast.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.190
And I'm certain that
I don't know what

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.370
the best gathering is for you.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.965
What I can speak to
is the principles

00:43:07.965 --> 00:43:10.090
that you, as you make those
efforts to bring people

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.040
together, may want
to keep in mind

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.040
and know how much you
want to turn up the volume

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.170
or turn down the volume
on those principles

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.350
so that you enrich what
you're already investing in.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.157
And as far as bringing
friends together

00:43:21.157 --> 00:43:22.740
for a meal-- whether
I've perfected it

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.680
or not-- one of things I
discovered in our culture now,

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.990
or at least in my tribe,
is the number of times

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.950
that someone is invited
to sit down in a room

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.750
without electronic
distraction, without an agenda,

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.340
to spend three to four
hours talking with someone

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:45.350
in that room with no outcome
required of them-- sometimes

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:48.070
approximate 0 times a year.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.570
Maybe you're doing
better than that.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.920
But I'm shocked by
how seldom that is.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.890
And I discovered how
unspeakably powerful

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.790
it is when someone in
the community says,

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.290
I'm going to create that space.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.660
And all we're going to do
is get to know one another

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:06.810
and talk about what we
think is important to us.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.190
And there are all kinds
of subjects that come up--

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.230
vulneralbilities-- that can
come out after 2 and 1/2

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.870
hours or three hours
talking that doesn't come up

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.666
after 30 minutes or 25 minutes.

00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.540
And for those of us who
are willing to create

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.590
that container and if you will
create the rules of that space

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.430
so that someone can
feel comfortable

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.190
that they belong there
and they're welcome there

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:33.760
and they'll be listened there
is a powerful investment

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.080
in the community.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.770
And I hope you do it as
much as you possibly can.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:41.085
NICK: Join me in thanking
Charles for being here.
