00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.445
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you all
for joining us this afternoon

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.420
for another Talks
at Google event.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.110
We have today,
Doctor Don Johanson.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.470
He's the discoverer of Lucy.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.290
Ever since finding that
skeleton, that hominid,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.730
his team has discovered over 350
skeletons of that same species.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.420
So it's really an amazing story.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.220
For over 40 years
he's led this program

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.277
and currently is working on the
Institute for Human Origins,

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.110
if I'm not mistaken.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.880
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: Of.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.171
MALE SPEAKER: Of Human Origins.

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:31.670
Institute of Human Origins.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.930
And so he'll talk to
us about that as well.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.810
He is also speaking on behalf
of his book, "Lucy's Legacy."

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.510
So with that, please join me
in welcoming Doctor Johanson

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.110
to Google.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.832
Thank you.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:45.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:46.850
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
Thanks very much.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.120
It was so convenient to
have somebody pick me up

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.540
at my house in San Francisco
and drive me down here.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.860
I actually finished my talk
in the backseat of the car.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.810
But I'm happy to
have an opportunity

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.700
to speak at Google,
an organization

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.390
that absolutely
everybody knows about.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490
And if they don't,
they can Google it.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.230
So I have had a wonderful
privilege of fulfilling

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.960
a childhood dream.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.180
And I'm a professor at Arizona
State University, although I'm

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.350
living here and teaching
only online, which

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.520
I'll mention in a bit.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.630
But I try to tease out
those students who really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.840
have a passion for something.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.320
And I think, probably, that's
the most difficult thing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649
in education in this
country right now,

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.190
is that so many students don't
have a passion or a commitment

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.730
to something at a young age.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.272
And they flounder
or they say things.

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:41.105
They'll come into my
office and they'll say,

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.290
well jeez, there's nothing
left to do in the world.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.190
And I was fortunate in
having a childhood dream.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.030
I read a book when
I was 13 years old

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.740
called "Man's Place in
Nature" by Thomas Henry

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.650
Huxley, who was one of Charles
Darwin's closest buddies.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.570
He was often called, as you
may remember, Darwin's bulldog,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.830
because he was really the
proselytizer, in many ways,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.840
for Darwin's paradigmatic shift.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.560
And to use that
word carefully, that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440
was a really paradigm shift.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.148
Can we turn the lights
down a little bit?

00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:11.990
That would be great.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.790
And he gave public lectures
throughout Great Britain

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.730
on evolution and Darwin's
"Origin of Species."

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.410
And he thought it was terribly
important to understand

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.310
our place in nature
and called his book

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.050
"Man's Place in Nature."

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.940
And one of the conclusions
that both he and Darwin came to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.520
was that the idea of
natural selection,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.910
a descent with
modification, and so on,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.960
is not restricted just
to non-human creatures,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.230
that it was also applicable
to the human species.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.910
And they concluded that, based
on the similarities of apes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.680
and humans, particularly
African apes

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.410
like chimps and especially
chimps and gorillas,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.460
that we shared a
common ancestor.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.710
That's one of the tenants
of evolutionary thought,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.540
that there is descent
from a common ancestor.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.120
And they predicted
at a time when

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.650
anthropologists,
biologists, geologists

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.920
were extraordinarily
euro-centric in terms

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.060
of understanding human
origins and pinpointing

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.540
Europe as the finishing
school for humanity.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.370
And it wasn't
until the mid 1920s

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.850
that fossils that
were discernibly

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.620
on the human family
tree of great antiquity

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.290
began to be discovered.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.120
And reading that book
as a young teenager,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.670
I was absolutely
riveted by the idea

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.360
that we shared a common
ancestor with the extant apes,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.820
and that there was, at least
at that time, the beginnings

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.340
of discoveries like Neanderthals
from Germany and France,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.160
and also a cro-magnon,
as we call them,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.600
Homo sapiens from
southern France.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.860
And I wanted, as
a young student,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.800
to be part of that search.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.910
And I fortunately was accepted
to an undergraduate school,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.540
University of Illinois, where
I studied anthropology and then

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.120
went on to the University of
Chicago where I did my Ph.D.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.410
with a professor
who I sought out

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.720
who had an expedition
in Ethiopia, in Africa.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.720
And I sort of talked
my way onto that dig

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.390
and spent my first year in
Africa in the summer of 1970.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.120
So that's 45 years ago.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.990
And when I first
entered the field

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.590
of what's called
paleo-anthropology-- the study

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.900
of human origins, not the
study of old anthropologists.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.370
But when I first entered the
field of paleoanthropology,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.920
we had about six
different species

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.690
on the human family tree.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.980
Today we have upwards of
23, 24 different species.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.600
So that the tree
of human evolution

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.050
has become exceedingly complex.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.640
Today I've chosen to give some
of the biological background

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.180
to being human.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.420
One of the questions that
we all ask ourselves,

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.270
whether you're philosophers,
anthropologists,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.860
whether you're in
the tech business

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.380
or whatever, what is
it that makes us human?

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.270
And this is, of course,
the quintessential question

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.400
of anthropology, which is
the study of humankind.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.640
And it's always been studied
from a cultural point of view.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.820
People will say, well, you
know what makes us human

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.430
is we sing, we paint, we dance.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.810
Every society has some
creation myth of some sort.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.940
And so on.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.251
These are, I think, really the
results of three core areas

00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.500
that we're beginning to study.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.590
Oh, and by the
way, if anybody is

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.110
thinking of tweeting anything,
I'll give you these addresses.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.240
And central to understanding
what makes us human

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.780
is really this sort of
interactive evolutionary

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.160
dynamic between cultural
evolution on the one hand

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.770
and biological evolution
on the other hand.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.820
I say that it's very
important to reinsert

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.480
the idea of
biological evolution,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.080
because anthropologists
not far from here,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.230
in a little school over
in Stanford, at Stanford,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.324
had a schism in its
anthropology department

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:20.240
a number of years ago.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.440
Because many of the
cultural-- social-cultural

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.640
anthropologists-- thought that
once culture comes in the door,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.380
biology jumps out the window.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.460
And that we are no longer
part of the natural world.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.650
We are, as one anthropologist
Alfred Kroger wrote,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.150
super organic beyond culture.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.900
And I think we have
to really understand

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.900
the biological roots of who we
are and how that, in many ways,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.920
set us up to be the
most dominant, the most

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.590
intelligent, the most
creative, and at the same time,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.400
unfortunately, the most
destructive species we know

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.850
of in our solar system,
and perhaps anywhere

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.470
in the universe, which is
a rather provocative issue.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.010
But certainly on this
planet, we are in control.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.610
And how did that happen?

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.400
And I'm going to just touch
on this at the beginning

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.530
because the Institute
of Human Origins,

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.480
which is located at
Arizona State University,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.240
grew out of an idea I had in
1981 when I moved to Berkeley

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.280
and founded this
research institute.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.380
I wanted a place
that was dedicated

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.940
to the pursuit of finding
the cultural remains

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.210
and the fossil remains
of our ancestors

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.682
and try to fit them-- can these
lights come down any more?

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.598
MALE SPEAKER: Unfortunately
not for the video.

00:07:35.598 --> 00:07:36.924
I'm sorry about that.

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:39.330
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: Oh, OK.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.110
I wanted a place
where we sort of had

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.110
a group of paleoanthropologists,
geologists, archaeologists,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.660
people who were dating
rocks and so on,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.800
came together under the rubric
of a single research institute

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.450
to pursue the past.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.590
And in 1997, that organization
was acquired by Arizona State

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.460
University, providing us with
greatly expanded opportunities,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.500
and also the opportunity
to leave descendants,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.730
which is, after all, the
goal of all evolution.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.890
We were now leaving students.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.550
And before we were not.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.900
And moving there,
we recently began

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.690
to move out into
other areas and try

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.110
to understand the
evolutionary foundations

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.960
of human uniqueness.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.705
Because if you read
people like Steven Pinker

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:31.680
in "The Language
Instinct," and others

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.799
who are evolutionary biologists,
much of what we're looking at

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.350
must have some explanation
that can be rooted deeply

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.240
in the whole idea of
natural selection.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.620
And that we are
who we are because

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.230
of that intangible force that
we call natural selection.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.740
So the rubric that
we're working on, we

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.140
have about 14 different teams
working in different places,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.880
everybody from psychologists to
field archaeologists and so on,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.260
is to understand the
evolutionary interplay

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.260
of these three major insights, I
think, into what make us human.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.670
We lead lives of extraordinary
cognitive complexity.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.600
No other animal comes close
to the cognitive complexity

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.610
that we have.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.850
And we have an extraordinarily
expensive organ,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.080
which is called the brain,
which demands a lot of energy.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.740
A different way of eating and
different foodstuffs and so on.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.910
And the abilities to gain those.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.400
And we communicate
through symbolic language.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.180
No other animals do that.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.480
No chimpanzees as
close as we can

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.130
get to ourselves, who
do sign and so on, talk

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.890
about tomorrow or
yesterday, or what's

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.890
going on in the next room.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.850
So we are remarkably
unique in that regard.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:55.170
Second, we have a capacity for
culture that is unsurpassed.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.940
And particularly our
culture is cumulative.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.190
And people here
at Google, people

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.350
in this part of the world, in
Silicon Valley, so to speak,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.250
understand what that means.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.490
Biological evolution
is glacially slow.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.520
Over a very long period,
very minor changes occur.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.870
But in terms of our
culture, whether it's

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.630
technology or what, our
advances are cumulative.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:26.680
So once culture begins
to be our sort of savior,

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.560
in the sense that everything we
do is filtered through culture,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.090
you have a growth
like that, which

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.320
is extraordinary and
unique and different

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.250
from any other creature
that we know of.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.400
And thirdly, although it may not
seem like this when you open up

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.190
your morning news, humans
are the most cooperative

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.530
of any vertebrae on the planet.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.900
No other creatures,
no other species

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.980
come anywhere close
to cooperating.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.020
If we were a chimpanzee troop,
for example, male dominated,

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.200
of course, and a male chimp
from another troop came in,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.900
we would kill him and eat him.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.730
We cooperate more
extensively with each other

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.690
than anyone else, any other
species on the planet.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.910
And at the moment, this
is a work in progress.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.080
And maybe if I'm
invited back once we

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.330
have spent a few
years looking at this,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.540
we may reveal some
very interesting deeper

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.760
understanding of what it
is that makes us human.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.180
And interestingly,
this is a proposal

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.560
that is supported by the
Templeton Foundation, which

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.310
is a very religious
foundation as you may know.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.890
Templeton supported
research in various fields,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.670
but you had to tie it and try
to make science and religion

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.620
kind of fit comfortably
in the same textbook.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.780
And there are no such
restraints based on us.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.960
Well, as I said, there
were very few species

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.870
of fossils when I
first started working

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.070
in 1970, species of humans.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.890
But today we have a fossil
record that takes us back

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.010
to about 6 million years.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.670
We came from something, like you
see on the left here, much more

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.480
ape-like, with a projecting
face, a brain about the size

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.720
of a couple of cups
of coffee that we

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.840
have in the morning, about
380, 400 cubic centimeters.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.330
Walking upright.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.260
And these creatures
we collectively

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.770
call Australopithecus,
or ape man, as

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.170
they are sometimes called.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.910
And they take us back to
about 6 million years ago.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.270
And the one feature we
see that continues back

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.930
that far is upright bipedalism,
what I'm doing right now.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.470
And freeing our hands
from locomotion.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.030
And beginning to use them for
other ways of manipulating

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.640
the world around us.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.260
It's interesting looking
at this because as we

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.630
grasp a branch on the
human family tree,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.470
the roots all lead
back to Africa.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.030
It's where we had a common
ancestor with the African apes.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.040
It's where we first stood up
about 6 million years ago.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.410
It's where we first began, in
the middle, to expand brains.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.790
Lucy's brain was
about, as I said,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.550
about 400 cubic centimeters.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.530
Our brains are about
1,400 cubic centimeters.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.480
It's where our ancestors
began to fashion stone tools

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.990
in a very regular
way at about 2.8,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.500
maybe 3, maybe 3.4
million years ago.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.970
It's a big debate
right now about that.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.770
Where our bodies
were transformed

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.410
from ape-like bodies that
had very short lower limbs

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.380
to having very long lower
limbs, which is our lever

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.880
arm for getting around.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.530
Right on up to the emergence of
Homo sapiens at 200,000 years.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.650
So all these features that
we think of biologically,

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.680
and culturally in terms of the
birth of culture with stone

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.870
tools, and probably
culture before

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.610
that with things that don't
preserve in the fossil record,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.680
all premiered in Africa.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.700
So I'd like to look at no
specific place in Africa

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.290
as the cradle of
humankind, rather Africa

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.340
as a crucible where all of this
experimentation was going on.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.480
I told you that I read Huxley.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.820
I didn't read Darwin
till a little bit later.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.750
He only had one, not very
interesting, black and white

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.300
diagram in his book.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.480
Huxley had pictures of apes
and neanderthals and stuff.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.020
And Darwin shied away,
as you know, from talking

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.120
about human origins.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.630
He was particularly
worried about upsetting

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.110
Emma, his wife, who was a
very devout religious person.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.980
But you have to read
"The Origin of Species"

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.510
to the last page, the second
to the last paragraph,

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.630
before he says, "light will
be thrown on the origin

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.840
of man and his history."

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.798
And that's all he said.

00:14:29.798 --> 00:14:31.990
That was enough.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.740
But it's true that
he tried to stay away

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.430
from this because he didn't
want to upset Victorian England.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.460
He didn't want to be the
center of great controversy.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.010
And yet later on, after chewing
on this idea for so long,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.580
in 1871 he wrote a book
called "The Descent of Man."

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.900
And wrote up a
number of scenarios

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.430
of how we became human.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.091
He and Huxley would go to the
zoo and they'd see chimpanzees.

00:14:58.091 --> 00:14:59.590
And they'd see how
similar they are.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.270
I'm sure everyone in this
room has seen a Jane Goodall

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.060
documentary or gone
to a zoo and looked

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.980
into the eyes of a
creature that is remarkably

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.540
reminiscent of maybe
somebody you know.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.660
And there's no doubt
that they are not only

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.270
very similar in
their appearance,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.160
but details of their
anatomy as Darwin and Huxley

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.350
examined their teeth and jaws,
are very similar to ours.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.330
And from the work of people
like Goodall and many others,

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.920
there are certain behaviors that
are reminiscent of who we are.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.730
They certainly experience
a wide range of emotions

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.020
that we would have traditionally
thought of as only being human.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.600
And with the Human Genome
Project and the Chimp Genome

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.960
Project, chimps aren't running
that project, but the Chimp

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.790
Genome Project, we're
about 99% identical

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.010
in terms of our
DNA, which is one

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.230
of those homologous features
that really shows us that there

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.630
was a common ancestry there.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.620
And it was not too far
distant in the past.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.750
So there's no longer any
question among most people

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.490
that these two creatures shared
some sort of a common ancestor

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:10.300
somewhere about 8 million years
ago on the continent of Africa.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.000
One of the features
in Africa that

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.040
has been so beneficial
to us is one

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.780
of the great
geological structures

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.120
on the planet, which is
the Great Rift Valley.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.870
It runs all the way from
Mozambique in the south,

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:31.690
divides here, and continues
up through Tanzania and Kenya,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.740
and up into the Horn
of Africa, which

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:39.750
is this area just up in here,
the little triangular area

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.740
known as the Afar Triangle.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.700
And that was an area that
was really terra incognita

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.810
until the late 1960s.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.305
I made my first visit there
with a French geologist who

00:16:50.305 --> 00:16:52.320
had been exploring that area.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.681
He had found bones
of big animals.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:55.930
He didn't know what they were.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.940
They were elephants, and
pigs, and rhinos, and monkeys,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.200
and antelopes, and so on.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.740
And during the
course of his work,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.550
I met him in Paris at a
cocktail party and he said,

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.640
you should come with me.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.599
And I did.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.880
And this is the place where
I have worked since 1972.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.420
You see the Rift Valley.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.369
You see Addis Ababa,
the capital of Ethiopia.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.369
The Rift Valley, this
is Lake Turkana, which

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.720
used to be lake Rudolf,
continues up here

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.440
into that very large triangular
area, which is, much of it,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.810
below sea level.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.250
It is where the Horn of Africa,
due to continental drift,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.790
is beginning to move away.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.760
And it is rifting the surface
of the face of Africa.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.330
And very ancient
geological layers

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.430
are being resurrected,
because they're

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.350
being now eroded and exposed.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.700
And this is a classic picture.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.600
This is the first view I
had of the site of Hadar,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.350
as it's called.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.562
It's a local name, an Afar name,
the Afar people who live there.

00:17:58.562 --> 00:18:00.270
And as far as you can
see in the distance

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.610
you see these
beautiful badlands.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.460
And there are a
number of features

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.290
in there in the distance
which are very light colored.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.760
And those happen to
be volcanic ashes.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.870
And those volcanic ashes lend
themselves to argon dating.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.150
So we can tell,
in a precise way,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.600
how old these
geological strata are

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.980
by doing potassium argon
or argon argon analysis.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.670
And they are very
horizontal, as you can see.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.500
They have not been disturbed
very much by tectonics.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.240
And in addition to that, you
can't see it quite as well

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.400
here, but they're
fairly fine grained,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.460
which meant that
the deposition was

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.390
a very slow, quiet deposition.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.000
It wasn't a raging river that
breaks up bones and distributes

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.540
them.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.600
It records and preserves and
fossilized things in place.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.700
And here is an aerial view.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.830
I did a little
work for-- I think

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.730
this was a "NOVA" program--
a couple of years ago.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.555
And took some photos.

00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.930
We were very
fortunate, there was

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.487
a river running
right through here,

00:19:01.487 --> 00:19:03.070
so we had a permanent
source of water.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.403
We're out there for three
months a year, two and a half,

00:19:05.403 --> 00:19:06.520
three months a year.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.990
And I don't know how many
of you have spotted my camp,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.810
but that's where we camped for
two and a half to three months,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.090
in the middle of nowhere,
which means we have

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.120
to bring everything with us.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.350
There's no Walgreens down
the street, or Safeway.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.250
So it is a very remote place.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.290
It is dangerous in
many, many ways.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.920
Lots of snakes.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.930
But also there are
two rival tribes

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.900
that live on either
side of that river.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.740
And we've worked north
of the river, which

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.360
is towards the top of
the screen, since 1972.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.180
We wanted to work
south of the river

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.380
but we're unable to because
of the nature of the people

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.090
there who like to shoot you.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.750
So we've continued to
work there over the years.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.140
And here's a closer view of
camp, what it looks like.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.590
Various tents set up
for personal tents.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.150
This is a work tent over here.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.430
There's a kitchen tent.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:05.890
There's an eating tent.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.080
And a team of
scholars and students

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.120
will go out there for two
and a half to three months

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.260
to regularly search
for, excavate,

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.530
and hopefully discover
remains of our ancestors.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.290
It is, as I said, a
fairly hostile region.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:25.130
The Afar people, the first
year I worked there our camp

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.782
was burglarized in the middle
of the night by these people.

00:20:28.782 --> 00:20:29.990
They didn't know who we were.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.200
Fortunately we didn't get shot.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.250
But over the years we've
made great friends with them,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.970
and they are
regular participants

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.750
in the explorations
in these expeditions.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.480
So we worked there between
the early '70s and 1980,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.150
when Mengistu took over Ethiopia
and Haile Selassie was deposed.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.520
And this is a typical group
of paleoanthropologists,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.810
and geologists, archaeologists,
fossil pollen specialists, pig

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.380
specialists, elephant
specialists, kitchen crew,

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.090
and so forth and so on.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.540
And I may be here talking about
these in these spotlights,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.380
but if it wasn't for
this integrative effort,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.080
this multi-disciplinary
approach,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.380
I wouldn't be able to
tell you the details

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.830
that I'm going to tell you.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.420
Work continues now at night.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.360
The romanticism of the
kerosene lamps is long gone.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.710
We have solar panels.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.760
So we have electricity.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.330
And we can charge
up our computers.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.080
And we can communicate
with the rest of the world.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.220
And sometimes people work
in the evening, as you saw.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.560
And there's really no way
to find these fossils except

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.100
to go out, and walk, and
look, and walk, and look.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.120
And to hope that your eyes will
fall on something exciting.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.910
These fossils, this
is an elephant foot

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.430
that is eroding out of--
actually on top of it

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.870
was a beach sand.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.560
Below it is deeper water
deposition, interestingly.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.480
So it meant that the
lake was probably

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.400
receding at this point.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.290
And you see a small
group of people

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.890
in the background for scale.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.280
And you might spend three
or four or five days

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.570
in there with a team
of five or six people.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.950
But this elephant, 3.4 million
years old, was found in place

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.410
and still, incredibly,
hard to believe,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.340
it's still articulated.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.290
So regularly research or survey
teams like this will go out.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.930
And with a trained eye, try
to find these fossils that

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.150
have eroded out from
their ancient beds

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.280
where they've sort
of lain in suspended

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.300
animation for millions of years,
and give us better insight

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.760
into our early human ancestors.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.860
Sometimes it's a
discovery a single tooth,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.970
like this, that led to
an entire face of one

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.100
of these early
Australopithecus creatures.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.620
You see in the background
a team of people

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.800
who are beginning to set
up a screening operation

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.460
and have cleaned this slope
totally of the loose sediment

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:12.350
on top and recovered
most of a single face.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:18.930
In 1974 I completed my Ph.D.
at the University of Chicago.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:24.220
And went out to Ethiopia for
my first major, full scale

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.490
expedition.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.070
And had some National
Science Foundation

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.850
money that got us out there.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.770
And that fall, in
November, at this locality

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.720
where you see the
people standing,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.650
I made a discovery of a partial
skeleton, which has now become

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.600
more or less iconic, a skeleton
that was nicknamed Lucy,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.495
after "Lucy in the
Sky with Diamonds,"

00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:48.620
the Beatles song that was
playing in camp the night

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.190
of her discovery.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.170
And one of our
expedition members,

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.180
Pamela, said, well, if
you think it's a female,

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.880
why don't you call her Lucy?

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.810
And she picked up
that moniker and has

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.450
been known as Lucy ever since.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.380
Well, what did I find?

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.470
The first piece I
found was not a molar,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.330
it was this little
fragmentary piece

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.840
of bone, which is the
elbow on the right side.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.070
It is the ulna, the bone that
allows you to flex and extend.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.190
As you can see, it's
like a little wrench.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.320
It's not the one that
turns your forearm,

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.910
but the one that
flexes and extends.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.000
And I kneel down
and looked at it

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.370
and knew virtually
immediately, from its anatomy,

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.060
there are features
in almost every bone

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.710
we pick up that
easily differentiate

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.732
between human and non-human.

00:24:39.732 --> 00:24:41.690
The only thing it could
have been was a baboon.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.100
It was the right size
for a fossil baboon,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.420
but it didn't have the
right kind of anatomy

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.550
on the backside of it.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.730
It had our kind of anatomy.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:55.020
And then on the left, you see
a much younger and thinner me

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.240
with my graduate student
who is doing all the work,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.180
but that's what
they do, wrapping up

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.335
each and every fragment
here in toilet paper.

00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:06.190
We have these huge
boxes of toilet paper

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.710
that follow us to the field.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.730
And marking each spot where
the large bones were discovered

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:16.300
before we started systematically
scraping and cleaning

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.210
and screening and so on.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:23.140
So it was that single bone
that led to an excavation

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.400
where we had a small team out
there, a team of geologists,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.070
anatomists,
paleontologists, and so on,

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.240
screening every
part of this hill.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.480
And this is a photograph
of the first time

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.970
ever that these bones
were more or less

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.940
re-articulated after
3.2 million years.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.750
We knew at the time that it was
older than three million years.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.790
We didn't know how old exactly.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.250
This is the French
colleague, Maurice Taieb

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.110
who was so generous in inviting
an international team to come

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.070
and work.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.750
And we basically had a
French and American team

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.300
working there.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.600
And this is the image
which has become so iconic,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.110
a partial skeleton.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.600
Unfortunately, the skull eroded
out first and rolled down

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.350
the hill and broke up.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.450
So all we have are
fragments of the brain case.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:14.310
But importantly, enough of the
back and the sides to give us

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.880
this cranial capacity estimate.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.680
And a number of things
were important about her.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.260
We had her pelvis, which is a
very fragmentary and fragile

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.460
part of the body, which tells
us a lot about locomotion.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.570
And we had the knee,
and we had the ankle.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.760
And it was clear from
the detailed anatomy,

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.850
working with an
orthopedic surgeon,

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.370
that in every one of these
anatomical regions so

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.430
important for
reconstructing locomotion,

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.090
this was a creature that was
fully upright and bipedal

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.720
on the ground as we are.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.500
Clearly her legs
were very short.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.150
If you compare the length of
the upper arm bone, the humerus,

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.630
with the thigh bone on the
lower right there, the femur,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.200
they're almost of equal length.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.230
As you see if you just
look at your own body,

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.060
your thigh bone or femur
is much longer than this,

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.010
because as I said, our
lower limb is our lever

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.070
arm for getting around.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.830
She was clearly very different
in terms of details of teeth

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.140
and jaws and skull and so on.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.670
And a distinctive new
species of Australopithecus.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.930
And I named her after the Afar
people in the Afar region.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.010
She is known in Ethiopia
by her own name.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.080
She's known as Dinknesh,
which in Amharic means

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.540
you are wonderful.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.040
But regularly driving around
Ethiopia in the countryside,

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.580
you'll come across something
like this, Lucy College.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.630
There are Lucy cafes.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.690
There are Lucy magazines.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.145
The national soccer team of
Ethiopia, woman's soccer team,

00:27:46.145 --> 00:27:47.290
is named Lucy.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.210
There's a Lucy Cup in soccer.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.760
So she's known
more often as Lucy

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.280
than as Dinknesh, which is
commemorated in this stamp that

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.700
was minted in 1985.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.770
So this is more or less what
the complete reconstructed body

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:04.890
would look like.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.600
And as you heard, we now have
many, many different specimens.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.120
We have at Hadar itself,
90% of the sample that

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.300
represents Afarensis and
that's about 400 specimens.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.870
And I know there are undescribed
in Ethiopia in the museum where

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:25.160
Lucy is stored, all
these fossils are back

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.650
in the capital in
the National Museum,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.670
that there are another
300 or so specimens.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.900
It is a species that lived
between about 3 million years

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.850
and 3.4 million years.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:41.270
So it's one of the longest
lived species we know

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.850
of in the human fossil record.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.520
We've been around for, as we
are now, maybe 100,000 years.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.380
So her species was
an enduring species.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.810
It's found throughout
eastern Africa, what

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:56.510
is today Kenya, Tanzania,
Ethiopia, out in Chad,

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.020
for example, in
North Central Africa.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:08.360
And in 1976, Doctor Mary Leakey
who was in charge of work

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.070
with her husband Louis Leakey
at Olduvai Gorge, which

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.030
some of you may have visited
or certainly know about it,

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:18.460
came to visit me in the field
with her son Richard Leakey.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.110
And bedazzled by the fossils
that we were finding.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.020
We hadn't found
Lucy yet, but she

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.582
was encouraged to go back
to a site in Tanzania

00:29:28.582 --> 00:29:30.790
where she and her husband
had worked in the late '30s

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.650
and didn't find any
hominids, didn't

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.430
find any human ancestors.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.480
But it was about the same
age as the Lucy site.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.870
And they found a trail of
human footprints impressed

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.990
in a volcanic ash that's
3.6 million years old.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.800
And there was a volcano that
was erupting in that area.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.510
It was a special
kind of volcanic ash.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.475
It was a carbonitite.

00:29:50.475 --> 00:29:52.840
It had a lot of
carbonates in it.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.100
So it was at the beginning
of a rainy season.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.640
And when it covered
the surface--

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.910
there was a light rain, because
you can see raindrops in there.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.720
And a couple of
human ancestors that

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.130
were of the same species,
because we now have the teeth

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.630
and jaws of this
species at this site

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.550
called Laetoli, walked
across that surface

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.340
and left imprints of their feet.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.570
And it's like all of us in
this room going to the beach

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:21.030
and walking in moist
sand, let's say at sunset,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.150
then looking back.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:23.700
That's what our
footprint looks like.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.340
But this footprint is
3.6 million years old.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.750
It's got a strong heel strike.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.490
It's got a strong toe off.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.000
It's got a transverse and
longitudinal arch to the foot.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.150
And this was all predicted on
the fossils that we had found.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.414
And it really documents in a way
we never thought was possible.

00:30:42.414 --> 00:30:43.080
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.850
-And what about Lucy herself?

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.150
What did she look like?

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.100
We know from the teeth,
the jaw, and now the skull

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.590
fragments we found,
that Lucy had

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.527
an ape-like face, with the
brain just a little larger

00:30:57.527 --> 00:30:58.110
than a chimps.

00:31:00.765 --> 00:31:03.603
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: A piece
I did for a three part series

00:31:03.603 --> 00:31:05.022
for "NOVA."

00:31:05.022 --> 00:31:06.920
It's an animatronic.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.560
-She may have had dark
skin and patchy hair

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.369
to protect her from the sun.

00:31:12.369 --> 00:31:14.410
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: We
know chimpanzees do this.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.957
And I thought if chimps
can do it, why can't Lucy.

00:31:17.957 --> 00:31:19.540
Termites are great
if they're roasted.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.300
I don't like them raw.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.620
If you ever go, get roasted.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.210
They're wonderful.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.930
-Walking upright freed her hands
to develop a more precise grip

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.463
than other apes,
more like our own.

00:31:31.463 --> 00:31:32.838
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
And the hand

00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:37.503
bones that we have [INAUDIBLE]
certainly capable of finding

00:31:37.503 --> 00:31:38.485
different [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.210
-And even with her
small brain, perhaps she

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:51.725
was beginning to have a more
human-like awareness of herself

00:31:51.725 --> 00:31:52.600
and her surroundings.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.940
Lucy and her kind must been
extraordinary creatures.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.480
We know that they persisted as
a species virtually unchanged

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.990
for over a million years.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.510
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.280
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: So this
was a long lived species,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.090
which is very important, and
geographically widespread,

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.640
meaning it lived in a series
of different habitats.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.370
And more recently we have begun
to find more complete skulls.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.310
For instance, this is a
beautifully complete 3.1

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.500
million year old, 3.2
million year old skull,

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.660
meaning the face, the
brain case, and the lower

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.350
jaw, of what a female of
Lucy's species would look like.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:43.250
And it's allowed
paleoartists to reconstruct,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.820
I think more accurately,
the shape of the face,

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.720
much more ape-like
as you would imagine.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.880
And we've also begun to find
complete skulls of males,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.520
which are considerably
larger than females.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.700
So there was a lot
of sexual dimorphism

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.490
between males and females.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.380
Lucy is, as people say,
probably the best known fossil

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.180
of the 20th century.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:14.370
And has certainly
become the benchmark

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.270
by which other
discoveries are judged.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.120
If something new is
found, like recently you

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.510
saw in the "National
Geographic" magazine,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.640
they immediately say older than
Lucy, or younger than Lucy,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.900
or more complete than Lucy,
or maybe an ancestor to Lucy,

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.210
or maybe one of
Lucy's descendants.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.940
And she has become
part of our vernacular.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.480
If you watch
"Jeopardy," occasionally

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.070
she appears on there.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.110
She appears in
crossword puzzles when

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.820
the little clue
is human ancestor

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.390
begins with L, four letters.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.720
My favorite one
appeared in, I think

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.060
it was, "Science"
magazine, where

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.050
Lucy goes to a cocktail party.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.970
He says, oh, not the Lucy?

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.340
So she's become
very widely known

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.000
as kind of the ambassador.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.963
And also, most
recently, I don't know

00:34:02.963 --> 00:34:05.600
how many of you saw,
believe it or not,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.010
Scarlett Johansson--
spells her name

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:11.909
with two S's as my parents did--
did this movie called "Lucy."

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:13.723
Anybody see this movie?

00:34:13.723 --> 00:34:14.389
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.730
-You know what, the other
day I was in this museum.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.030
And you know what I found out?

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.980
-What?

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.679
-The first ever
woman was named Lucy.

00:34:24.517 --> 00:34:26.350
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
It's a very funky plot.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.058
-Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

00:34:28.058 --> 00:34:29.140
-Yeah.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.475
No.

00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:31.370
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.830
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
So this movie

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.620
had been out for
quite some time.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:38.370
And I was at a dinner
party in Santa Monica.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.370
And someone said have you
seen the movie "Lucy?"

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.310
And I said, no.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.179
And they said, you know,
it's about your Lucy.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.510
And I couldn't believe
it, but there it was.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.480
So as you heard,
Lucy is not alone.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.760
Funny, a number of years
ago I was on an airplane

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.340
and talking to one
of those people

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.639
you can't stop talking to.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.320
He's going to talk to you
whether you like it or not.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.780
And he said, well, did you
ever find anything else?

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.670
So it was good question.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.840
So we now have an
extraordinary insight

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.320
into the anatomy of virtually
every anatomical region.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.710
And trying now to look
at micro-evolutionary

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.170
changes over time.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:18.560
It seems to have been a very
stable species that underwent

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.720
very little change,
perhaps a slight increase

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:27.130
in body size over time,
but a very stable species.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:30.920
And is the reference collection,
the go-to collection,

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.230
for all paleoanthropologists
who make discoveries now.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.360
The first place they
go is to the drawers

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.010
where Lucy and the other fossil
from Hadar and the Afarensis

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:43.190
fossils are stored
in Addis Ababa.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.420
We know an enormous
amount about this genus.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.460
We belong in the genus Homo,
which is Latin for man,

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.490
as you know.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:55.020
Yet we know much, much
more about the ape-men,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.430
or Australopithecus, and
the diversity of species,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:02.400
the specializations in
anatomy and behavior and diet,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.870
than we know about the
origins of our own genus.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:11.730
And most recently we have begun
to concentrate in areas where

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.525
we're finding sediments that are
between two million and three

00:36:14.525 --> 00:36:15.280
million.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.360
Lucy's species, is
I said, Afarensis,

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.440
disappeared at three
million years, which

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.760
was a very eventful
moment in human evolution,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.650
and an eventful moment in
terms of climatic change.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.970
Because at the three million
year timeline, time level,

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.840
there was this major
shift from a wetter,

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:39.010
more forested environment, to
a dryer, more open environment.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.770
And we saw lots of
diversifications

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:43.520
in animals that we
think of traditionally

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.560
as savanna animals,
like baboons speciated

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.080
into a number of species.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.560
Like the great diversity
of antelopes and gazelles

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.840
that make a living out
in these open areas.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.110
And it is generally thought that
these earlier Australopithecus,

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.360
like Lucy, lived in more
bushy or more woodland,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.520
not deeply thick
forested rainforest.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.920
But certainly an
environment was different.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.060
And at that time, one of the
great generators of change,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.100
biological change with
natural selection working,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.870
is climatic change.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:19.720
So what happened was there
was a major change, that's

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.240
when Lucy's species disappears.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.340
We see a whole proliferation of
different kinds of vertebrates

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.880
living in open areas.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.970
And we see a major bifurcation
in the human family

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.050
tree between our
own genus, Homo,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.550
which has emphasized
brain expansion,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.760
and an increased diversity
of Australopithecus species

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:45.060
that are now beginning
to occupy a whole new set

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.470
of ecological niches,
as I will show you.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.830
So the switch has turned
more to the origin

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:55.230
of man, the origin of Homo,
which a "New Yorker" cartoon so

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.140
neatly pointed out.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.090
Oh yeah, well, what if I
were the first man on earth?

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.770
And there have been
some recent discoveries.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.280
I'm happy to say that part
of that, part of those,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.010
were made by my team.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.480
This is a upper jaw.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.900
This is the roof of your
mouth, right here, your palate.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.190
And you can see from
the top that a chimp

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:22.070
and Australopithecus have
very long, from front to back,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.950
narrow, parallel
side of tooth rows.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:28.880
That's a feature we inherited
from our ape ancestry.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.010
But our own species,
everybody sitting

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.380
in this room, Homo sapiens, we
have a much more parabolic arch

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.640
to our arch.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.600
It is very deep.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.490
If you put your tongue
in the top your mouth,

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.950
it's very domed.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.620
Australopithecus and chimps
have a very shallow palate

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.450
from the bottom of the teeth
to the roof of the mouth.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:53.200
And you can see how ours
is wider from side to side,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.070
shorter from front to back.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.650
And this is a 2.4
million-year-old upper jaw

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.270
that was found at
the side of Hadar

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.950
in much earlier deposits,
more recent deposits.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.110
And was, for a long time, the
oldest anatomical evidence

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.920
that we have of our own
genus, not very much.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.990
Yet it was associated,
interestingly,

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.860
with stone tools.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.820
Tools, this doesn't probably
look like very much to you,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.690
some of us have stones in our
driveways that look like that.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.040
But there are features of that,
such as this flat platform

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.270
up here where it
was really struck,

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:32.270
this sort of bulb of percussion
here as the shockwaves

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.440
go through the rock.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.650
And they're found in an area
where it's very fine grained.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.780
So someone had to have purposely
brought in that raw material

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.330
and made the tools there.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.080
And that's the
oldest association

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.610
between our own species and
our unique mode of adaptation,

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.770
which is culture.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.740
Now most recently, a group from
the Institute of Human Origins

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.200
went off to a site up
here in the corner,

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.050
called Ledi-Geraru, which is not
far from the Hadar star there,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.580
where Lucy was found.

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.810
And began looking at deposits
that I explored in 1972

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.120
that were not very fossil rich.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.780
But I collected enough pigs
and elephant fossils from there

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:19.050
to know that this was
around somewhere between two

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.610
and a half to three
million years.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.100
Pig fossils and elephant fossils
are very time diagnostic.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.920
For instance, if we
all go out this weekend

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.370
and collect a
dinosaur tooth, you

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.550
know that rock is older than
65 million years, right?

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.120
Well, elephants and pigs
evolve very quickly over time.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.320
And you can use them
as time diagnostics.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.720
So a colleague of mine,
Kay Reed, at the Institute,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.070
went out, got a
permit to work there.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:46.470
And her team announced, you
may remember this spring,

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.180
the discovery of
what is the oldest

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.760
evidence for our own genus.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.440
Again, it's fragmentary,
unfortunately.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.030
We have a fragmented
mandible on the right

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.690
there, from the
top of that hill.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.020
It was discovered by one
of our Ethiopian students.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.560
Very interesting
developments in Ethiopia.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.680
When we first went
there, there was no lab.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.050
There were no people
interested in the subject.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.870
Today, there's a
major commitment

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:12.490
by the Ethiopian
ministry of culture

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.760
that has built a fabulous lab.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.660
There are now about 10
well-trained students

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.810
by our team and a
couple of other teams

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.290
who are Ethiopian
nationals, who are beginning

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.270
to undertake their
own explorations,

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.430
put their own teams together,
and make their own discoveries.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.070
And appropriately,
this lower jaw

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.810
was discovered by one of
our Ethiopian students.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.950
And there are features
of this, such as

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.270
the long, narrow
molars, for example,

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.890
and many other features
in that jaw, that

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.670
suggest that this
is the earliest

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.710
Homo at 2.8 million years.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.570
Now it is most
interesting for me

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.250
because when I announced
Lucy in 1978, right

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.940
on the heels of that, I
published a major overview

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.700
in "Science."

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.055
And suggested the possibility
that Lucy's species, Afarensis,

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:09.240
is a generalized species,
meaning it was not very

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.390
specialized in any direction.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.360
It could be the common
ancestor for our own lineage,

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.610
as well as other lineages
of Australopithecus.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.260
And this helps
bolster that view.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.640
Ethiopia has played an
incredibly important role,

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.030
mainly because of geology.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.410
But now because there are
so many teams going there.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:32.350
When I found Lucy in
1974, actually the year

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.090
before I found a
fossil knee, no one

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:39.120
had found a human fossil in that
region of the Afar Triangle,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.600
that's 600 miles on the side.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.220
And that led to sort
of a hominid rush,

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.700
like the discovery of
gold in California.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.140
And other teams, who
became competing teams,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.210
went out there and
started searching.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:55.830
And the record in
Ethiopia ranges

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.500
from about 5.8 million
years ago, right

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.200
on up to the emergence of
Homo sapiens at 200,000 years.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.467
So it is an extraordinarily
important and complete role.

00:43:07.467 --> 00:43:09.550
Well, you may have all
heard that the new governor

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.674
of Kentucky, who's been
elected as a creationist, so

00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.590
obviously these guys are
going to the Creation

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.500
Museum in Kentucky.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.710
But this is the photograph
or the depiction we all

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:24.870
see so often every month
or so, "New Yorker"

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.520
has some form of this.

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.230
And it's an
inexorable march from,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.710
as I say, ape to angel, because
we all think of ourselves

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.240
as being such angels.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.140
But even Darwin knew that there
is no direct line from ape

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.860
to human, that the
evolution of all creatures,

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.960
whether they be plants,
insects, invertebrates, humans,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.820
or whatever, is
basically a tree.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:57.850
And he drew a tree in
his origin in 1859.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.210
And that is, indeed, the case.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.430
This is kind of my version
of the family tree.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.810
Everybody in my field
has their own version,

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.460
so there's a veritable
forest out there.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.490
But what I want
to point out here

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.300
is here is Lucy's
species, dying out

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.940
at about three million
years, and living for about

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.940
a million years of time.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.490
We know her ancestor
at about 4.2 million,

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:26.760
there's no question about that.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.450
And we know something
about her descendants

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.870
based on anatomy, this lineage
and these two lineages.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.740
And this is the first time we've
been able to actually trace

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.920
lineages in the fossil record.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.210
This was a group
of Australopithecus

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.510
that were devout vegetarians.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:50.120
They had massive faces,
huge molars, big crests,

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.790
massive chewing muscles, like
the temporalis and masseter

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.550
muscles.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:56.360
And they specialized.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.720
And as the climate got drier
and drier in East Africa,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.600
and as the antelopes and
gazelles and savanna baboons

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.300
and other forms of animals,
came into competition,

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.220
they ultimately went extinct.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.210
They did not leave descendents.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.810
So that part of the
hypothesis that I've

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.160
published in '81, which has
been fairly well established

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.200
with intermediate
forms between Afarensis

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.640
and their very derived forms.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.990
And it's only just
recently, now,

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.960
that we've been able
to begin to fill

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.020
in this branch leading to Homo.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.730
So it's a hypothesis.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.360
It continues to be
strengthened by discoveries.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.030
And what it does is it really
puts Lucy's species, Afarensis,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.970
at a pivotal point on
the human family tree.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.730
Where we had a fairly
impoverished family tree here,

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.860
to a very species-rich tree.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.670
Many of those
species went extinct.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.970
Neanderthals disappearing
about 40,000 years ago,

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.620
about 5,000 years after
we entered Europe.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.720
And some other species
that went extinct.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.840
So Lucy's particular
place on the family tree

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.580
is very important in
terms of understanding

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.030
the dynamics of
evolutionary change,

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.280
and ultimately the emergence
of all of us in this room,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.720
Homo sapiens, about
200,000 years ago or so.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.330
So this was one of those
moments-- oops, sorry--

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.791
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:25.791 --> 00:46:30.280
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: I had a
little nervous finger there.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.740
In that movie, 'Lucy."

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.390
She actually goes
back and meets her.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.240
Very funky.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:47:01.373
But we all know where this came
from, This image right here.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:13.990
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: So, that is
more or less the story of Lucy

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:16.950
and her discovery,
her importance.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.180
Important role she's played
in my life, of course,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.720
as an anthropologist.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.780
And this is my email if anybody
wants to be in touch with me.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.550
I have a website called
becominghuman.org.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.840
Because I think in many
ways we're not there yet.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.570
We're just becoming human.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:43.640
And I just released, 14th of
October, a MOOC on edx.org,

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.740
that is entitled
"Human Origins."

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:51.590
It's eight weeks of
lectures about-- I

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:54.550
guess there are about six
or seven lectures a week.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:57.070
They are about 15 minutes long.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:58.280
Illustrated.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:04.110
I had been asked by Coursera
to do a course online.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.740
And I really wanted to do
a course that was free.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.720
I wanted people to have total
access to this, particularly

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.220
because of the third world
countries in which I work,

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.510
where they will never
have an opportunity, many

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:18.420
of these people, to take a
course in human evolution

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.590
or human origins.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.140
And my Ethiopian
colleagues have already

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.390
written me, some of the
people working in the National

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.970
Museum, who have really
no formal education

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:27.880
in human evolution.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.720
They are all glued to their
screen, because in this course,

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.140
they learn what
otherwise they would not

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.510
have available because this
course is absolutely free.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.890
You have to enroll
at a certain time.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.800
And if you want
credit, it's like $400.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.819
There are 10,000 students
now taking this course.

00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:48.360
It was the first
time it was offered.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.590
It will be offered
again next March.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.090
But these are
additional resources

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.780
if you would like to
follow up with anything.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.140
And of course, I'm
available on email.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.734
Thanks very much, indeed.

00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:05.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:09.510
MALE SPEAKER: Any
questions for our talk?

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.010
Yes?

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.300
MALE SPEAKER: So
you described Lucy

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.950
between around four to
three million years ago.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.180
Were there any other human
species or humanoid species

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.950
at that time?

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.449
In your diagram
there weren't any.

00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:28.990
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
The question is,

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.140
were there other
species of humans

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.740
living at the same time as
Australopithecus, Afarensis,

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.300
or Lucy's species.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.780
This is a question that we
are debating at the moment.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.050
An Ethiopian colleague
of mine found

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.800
at about 3.4
million years, which

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.720
means a couple hundred
thousand years older than Lucy,

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.645
north of where I work, a very
interesting foot skeleton

00:49:53.645 --> 00:49:57.990
and partial limb skeleton
that has a divergent toe.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:02.160
And that-- Lucy's
toe, or Afarensis,

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.550
we have a complete articulated
foot that we found one year.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.700
And those feet
are like our feet.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.070
You saw the
footprints and so on.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.180
So he thinks that's
a new species.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.860
He hasn't named it a
new species right now,

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.110
but I know in private
conversation with him

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.220
that he is on the verge
of putting together

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.780
an argument that it
is another species.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.915
That would probably
be a species that

00:50:24.915 --> 00:50:29.050
is a descendant of Ardipithecus,
which I haven't talked about,

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.530
which is at 4.4 million.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:35.820
And while-- and it has a
very large divergent toe.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.950
So there may be
two lineages there.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:43.030
There is a discovery
by the Leakey family

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.260
on the west side of Lake
Turkana, which they have

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.570
given a new species name to.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.620
And most people don't think
it's probably a new species.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.450
But that may be another lineage.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:58.700
I think it would be very
unusual if Afarensis

00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.030
were the only species.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:06.720
Even up as recently as 50,000
years ago on planet Earth,

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.430
we had Homo neanderthalensis.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:09.530
We had Homo sapiens.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:14.280
We had Homo erectus, very
late Homo erectus in Java.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:19.740
We had Homo floresiensis, these
peculiar little hobbit-like

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.970
creatures that are found
out in the end of the Malay

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.180
Archipelago.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.300
And perhaps these
denisovans that have been

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.950
recognized in genetic analyses.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.700
So at just about
every point you had

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.570
three or four or five species.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.970
But then there was a major
winnowing of those species.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:43.570
And that is directly correlated,
really, with our emergence.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.430
Wherever Homo sapiens went,
whatever species was there

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:51.470
as a human species, very
rapidly disappeared.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.490
And there is an interesting
article by one of my colleagues

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.110
at the Institute of Human
Origin, Curtis Marion,

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.890
in the September issue, the
cover issue of the "Scientific

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.890
American" in
September, called "How

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.280
Humans Conquered the Planet."

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:10.140
And in there he makes a
case that the refinement

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.590
of the features that
we really consider

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:17.700
as modern human, symbolic
language, cumulative culture,

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:21.800
and significant cooperation,
division of labor, and so on,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.220
really emerged in Africa, in
that very diverse, mosaic set

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.450
of environments.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:32.380
Neanderthals had evolved into
a separate species in Europe

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.390
directly in response
to two things.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.500
One was genetic
isolation, so there

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.410
was recombination, and
mutation, and natural selection.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:46.160
But also a physical,
physiological, and anatomical

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.300
adaptations to a
periglacial environment.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.890
They were living with glaciers
in the distance, three, four

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:54.390
miles thick.

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.970
And their anatomy shows that.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:00.760
But he thinks that the things
that really make us who we are

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.490
today came out of Africa,
which alters dramatically,

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:07.380
and I've said this for
years, the early view we see

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.110
in "Time-Life" books on
early man of this upright,

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:17.240
white skin, French looking guy
in Europe, as the first humans.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.260
Whereas, I think it was probably
a much darker skinned people

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.510
who came out of Europe and
displaced Neanderthals.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.930
Brought about the extinction
of flores, floresiensis,

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.320
erectus, and so on.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.410
So I'd be very surprised
if there were not

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:37.558
other lineages or other
species at the same time.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.530
MALE SPEAKER: If I am
remembering correctly,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:53.860
you said that Afarensis lived
to about three million years ago

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.970
and the earliest Homo
species was 2.8 million.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:03.390
What is it that distinguishes
Homo from Australopithecus

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:06.780
that you can say, now
we've got a new genus?

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.410
DR. DONALD JOHANSON: Well,
I showed you the mandible.

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.470
And there are a number
of features in there,

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.760
the shape, the
elongation of the teeth,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.030
the reduction of
buttressing of the anterior

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:20.610
portion of the mandible,
the particular place where

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.840
the, what's called, the
ascending ramus arises,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.450
and the shape of the arch
in a parabolic fashion.

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:29.200
We don't know exactly
why those came about.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.840
We think it had
something to do with more

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.930
flexion of the cranial basal
areas of the skull that

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.590
brought this face in
and shortened the arch.

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:42.110
And in relation to that,
it began to broaden.

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.320
But there are lots of
people working on that

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.660
trying to figure that out.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.990
It isn't just the stone tools
that are found with them,

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:51.680
because that doesn't
define a species.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.820
And the upper jaw I
showed you, I think,

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:58.840
was very convincingly different
from an Australopithecus.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.590
So what we would like
to see, of course,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:06.430
are cranial remains to see if
there's much difference in not

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.160
only cranial
capacity, but cranial

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.030
shape between Australopithecus.

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:15.680
Now the palate, if we look
at it in lateral view,

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.110
is not prognathic or projecting.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.700
It's very flat like ours.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.030
Our faces are very flat.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.200
So there are those
subtle features

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.510
that all line up and
accumulate to convince us

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.020
that that Homo is very
different from Australopithecus.

00:55:33.239 --> 00:55:34.530
Does that answer your question?

00:55:37.892 --> 00:55:38.850
MALE SPEAKER: One more.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.820
MALE SPEAKER: So you
mentioned that most

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:49.590
of the fossils of Lucy's
species are kept in the National

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:51.991
Museum in Ethiopia.

00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:53.740
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
All of the specimens.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.800
All of the specimens that
have been found in Ethiopia

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.950
of human ancestors now
reside in the National Museum

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.680
in Addis Ababa, yes.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.590
MALE SPEAKER: So, given what's
happening, like in Syria

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:08.550
and so on, are you worried that
someday somebody may steal them

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.300
or-- or what are we
doing to protect them?

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.091
DR. DONALD JOHANSON:
Well, I'm more worried

00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:14.030
that there's going to
be a massive earthquake.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:16.030
As you get earthquakes,
you know the Rift Valley

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:19.450
is very unstable like
California and the Western coast

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.530
and the Ring of Fire.

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:27.090
They are stored in
very substantial safes.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.970
There are guards at the
museum all the time.

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:34.760
There is a trained group
of Ethiopian scholars now,

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.890
who are totally
dedicated to this.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:40.760
Some of them are in still
Ethiopia teaching or working

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.490
full time at the ministry.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.990
But of course, we never know.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:50.260
I think there is no
anti-evolution movement

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.090
in Ethiopia like there
has been in Kenya because

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:58.380
of these radical Baptists
who have been going over

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.820
there and converting
everybody to Christianity

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.110
and saying that this evidence
needs to be destroyed,

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:06.820
sort of like the
ISIS point of view.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.717
It would be very difficult
for anyone to steal these.

00:57:09.717 --> 00:57:11.300
It would be very
difficult for anybody

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.840
to come in and destroy them.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.280
But we never know what happens.

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.610
In 1940-- when was Pearl Harbor?

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.280
Was that '41?

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.090
All the Homo erectus, all
the Peking Man fossils,

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:33.120
were shipped from Peking to
the China Sea, South China Sea,

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.300
to save them from the invasion.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.820
And they vanished.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.050
They've never been found.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:42.120
They never made it
aboard the USS Harrison.

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.490
So things like that happen.

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.090
Yet on the other hand, you
have the first Neanderthal

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:54.860
found in 1856 in the
Neander Valley, Neanderthal,

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.220
near Dusseldorf.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:00.570
And that survived and
still is in Dusseldorf,

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:02.680
because it was kept in a safe.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.030
And was the first
fossil Neanderthal,

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:08.030
the first fossil human
ever found in Europe.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:11.990
But in addition to that, it
was the first fossil specimen

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:14.070
that gave us DNA.

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:17.720
They drilled into the arm
bone of this 1856 Neanderthal,

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:20.950
that nobody even knew
about genes back then.

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:22.530
Fortunately preserved.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:24.840
Fortunately organic
material in it.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.930
And fortunately getting
a DNA sequence out of it.

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.260
So it works both ways.

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.660
But I firmly believe
that these fossils belong

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.110
in the country of discovery,
and that it's incumbent on us

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:44.110
as scholars, coming in
at their invitation,

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.620
having this privileged
opportunity to come in,

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:50.140
to help them establish
these organizations

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.180
like a major laboratory,
like the National Museum,

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.640
to house these specimens.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.860
And let's hope they do
continue to survive.

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.490
Maybe someday someone
will develop a method

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:03.490
to actually date the fossil
and not the volcanic ash,

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:04.030
for example.

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:07.574
That would be a
significant contribution.

00:59:07.574 --> 00:59:09.490
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
very much for speaking

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:10.073
with us today.

00:59:10.073 --> 00:59:12.280
We'll have time for a
book signing afterwards.

00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.230
So thank you for stopping by.
