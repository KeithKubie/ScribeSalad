Bitcoin system works through a

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
Bitcoin system works through a
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.530
Bitcoin system works through a
peer-to-peer computer network which

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
peer-to-peer computer network which
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.269
peer-to-peer computer network which
means that when you're running Bitcoin

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
means that when you're running Bitcoin
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.770
means that when you're running Bitcoin
software on your computer you're

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780
software on your computer you're
 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.570
software on your computer you're
connected to all the other computers in

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
connected to all the other computers in
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.260
connected to all the other computers in
the network

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
the network
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.330
the network
every time you buy bitcoins or use them

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
every time you buy bitcoins or use them
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.310
every time you buy bitcoins or use them
to buy something the whole network gets

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
to buy something the whole network gets
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500
to buy something the whole network gets
updated with that information these

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
updated with that information these
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.480
updated with that information these
transaction records eventually formed

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
transaction records eventually formed
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550

blocks long chains of data that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
blocks long chains of data that
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.189
blocks long chains of data that
computers can hack or solve the process

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199
computers can hack or solve the process
 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.750
computers can hack or solve the process
of solving these blocks creates more

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
of solving these blocks creates more
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479
of solving these blocks creates more
bitcoins and is called mining so the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489
bitcoins and is called mining so the
 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250
bitcoins and is called mining so the
more Bitcoin transactions there are the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
more Bitcoin transactions there are the
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.259
more Bitcoin transactions there are the
more blocks that are created more blocks

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269
more blocks that are created more blocks
 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.119
more blocks that are created more blocks
means more chances for computers to mine

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
means more chances for computers to mine
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.309
means more chances for computers to mine
bitcoins the system is kind of

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:46.319
bitcoins the system is kind of
 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:48.680
bitcoins the system is kind of
self-reinforcing genies but it's also

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
self-reinforcing genies but it's also
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.779
self-reinforcing genies but it's also
self limiting blocks actually become

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
self limiting blocks actually become
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.789
self limiting blocks actually become
harder and harder to mine over time so

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799
harder and harder to mine over time so
 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.009
harder and harder to mine over time so
that there can only ever be 21 million

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019
that there can only ever be 21 million
 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.559
that there can only ever be 21 million
bitcoins total so far there are 12

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:57.569
bitcoins total so far there are 12
 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:00.889
