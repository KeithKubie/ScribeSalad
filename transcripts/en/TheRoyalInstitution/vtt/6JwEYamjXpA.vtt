00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:11.900
Yeah!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.400
Huh?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.580
Oh, calm down.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.440
Thank you all very
much for coming along

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.340
for an exciting
evening of mathematics.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.760
My name is Matt Parker.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.540
I used to be a
maths teacher, which

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.760
is why I know that person is on
their phone while I'm talking.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.500
Honestly.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.330
Unbelievable.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.030
Once a teacher,
always a teacher.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.860
So can you all hear
me adequately loud,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.540
amplified through
the microphone?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.072
Excellent.

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:42.530
People at the top,
we're all happy?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.030
Marvellous.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.910
Right, so the plan
for tonight, as Peter

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.040
very kindly said in
his introduction--

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.970
and then went home.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.470
Oh, that's a big vote of
confidence in tonight's talk.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.810
As he very kindly
said, I do a wide range

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.720
of things involving
promoting mathematics or just

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.200
generally trying to
get more people more

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
excited about maths.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.490
And I do things
like YouTube videos,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.890
which is where I suspect
the vast majority

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.870
of the young people
know me from.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.630
And I do BBC Radio 4,
which is the rest of you.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.560
So I cover the whole spectrum.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.400
And so I recently wrote
a book, Humble Pi.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.830
And I'd written one
book previously called

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.818
Things to Make and Do in
the Fourth Dimension, which,

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:28.360
as was mentioned in
the introduction,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.950
is currently the second most
viewed video on the RI channel,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.670
despite the fact it's
all abstract mathematics.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.320
And I figure tonight, with
some applied mathematics,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.640
I'm taking number one.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.590
So I wrote the first book.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.750
And Penguin, the publishers,
were like, would you

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.250
like to write a second book?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.000
And the problem with
Things to Make and Do

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.583
in the Fourth Dimension is, even
though I was incredibly proud

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.540
of it, and even though it sold
very well for a maths book,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.600
it sold average for a book,
which is great, right?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.780
Average is I'm
above 50% of books.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.430
I'm very happy with that.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.860
But Penguin don't care
what's in the book.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.843
They could publish another
celebrity cookbook or anything.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:07.510
I mean, that's the
one option, actually.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.510
And so I had to convince
them it was a good decision

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.850
to publish a book
about mathematics.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.060
And so I suggested to them I
could write a book all about

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.700
my favourite
mathematics mistakes,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.290
which is where Humble Pi--

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.840
A Comedy of Maths
Errors came about.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
And they liked that, because
people like tales of disaster.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.660
They like stories of
things going wrong.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.340
They enjoy laughing
at other people.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.200
I've made a career of being
on the receiving end of that.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.700
And they said, yes,
write that book.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.242
That's great.

00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:42.460
People who aren't
specifically maths

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.920
nerds, which is their
polite way of describing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.783
my target demographic--

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:48.700
people will still enjoy
reading these stories.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.780
And my ulterior motive was, by
showing examples of where maths

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.430
goes wrong in everything
from finance, engineering,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.010
statistics, medicine,
you name it,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
I can show-- it's an excuse
to talk about the maths that's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.970
required for these areas
of our modern society.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.310
And so obviously, maths
works pretty flawlessly

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.530
most of the time, so
much so that most people

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.050
have no idea how dependent
we are on mathematics.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.300
And people often don't
value maths for that reason.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.190
So I thought, this
is a great excuse

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.230
to just talk about
all the places maths

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.820
is used, but by using things
going wrong as my way in.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.367
And actually, because I
used to be a maths teacher--

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:30.450
actually, give me a cheer.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.857
Any maths teachers in?

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:34.990
[WEAK CHEER]

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.020
Hiding at the top,
not sounding exciting.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.520
It's the end of
half term, isn't it?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.840
Right, OK, there you are.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.910
So I used to be a
maths teacher, just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.310
like the fine people cowering
at the top of the room.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.210
And then I left teaching.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.938
But I still remembered how a lot
of young people-- because when

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:54.230
you were at school, you were
forced to do maths, right?

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.060
When you're forced to
do it, a other people

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.520
perceive mathematics
as the subject

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.020
where you have to get it right.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.150
Getting the right
answer is everything.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.430
It's the be all, end
all of mathematics.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.560
And as a teacher, you
know that that's not

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.640
always strictly true, right?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.947
Maths is about trying
something and getting it wrong,

00:04:09.947 --> 00:04:11.530
and then trying it
again and hopefully

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.190
getting it less wrong,
and then more wrong.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.500
And hopefully it converges
in on the minimal amount

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.510
of wrong possible.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.540
But it's a long, slow process
of not understanding it and not

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.350
doing it well.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.150
And it's always
very disappointing

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.230
when students, or
even people in--

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.010
standard-issue humans are afraid
to try some maths because they

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.810
think if they don't
get the right answer,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.287
they haven't done it correctly.

00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:37.120
And that's not true.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.870
If you get the wrong
answer, you may still

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.632
be correct in your
trying it, right?

00:04:41.632 --> 00:04:43.840
Mathematics is about learning
and teaching your brain

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.382
how to think.

00:04:44.382 --> 00:04:47.560
And so I thought, how can I
bring that approach to what

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.243
will otherwise just be a random
collection of maths mistakes

00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:52.660
that haven't got
any real meaning?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.380
And I started with an
inspirational poster

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.290
that I had when I was a teacher.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.530
And inspirational
posters are the staple

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.447
of the teaching world.

00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:05.238
It's what you decorate
your classroom with.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:07.110
And this was one of my
absolute favourites.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.070
They you are--
education works best

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.620
when all the parts are working.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.350
Now, let me just break
this down for you.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.900
So you've got cogs representing
students, teachers,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.432
and parents.

00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.390
The trouble is, when that
big cog on the right,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.540
which represents
students-- if that rotates,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.020
let's say, clockwise, because
it meshes with teachers,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.480
teachers have to
rotate anti-clockwise.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.560
That's all very nice.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.185
But neither of them
are going anywhere,

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.250
because parents are jamming
up the whole system.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.880
[LAUGHS]

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.460
Surprisingly more applause from
the teachers than the parents.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.310
Surprisingly accurate poster,
in my humble experience.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.990
And then obviously,
people just haven't

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.510
thought through the geometry
of this situation, right?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.950
If you have cogs,
they have to go

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.680
clockwise, anti-clockwise,
clockwise, anti-clockwise.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.310
So when Manchester were
unveiling their new approach

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.330
to public transport, they went
with the classic three-cog

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.540
making the city work together,
although people did point

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.800
out and proceed to render
in 3D that that's just

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.820
this one point of view.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.285
Possibly, from the
side, it's fine.

00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:16.620
It's like, well played.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.130
Well played.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.910
If all you see is this, you
don't-- look, that's deep.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.750
They were thinking-- they
were several steps ahead,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.920
until I saw an article where
President Trump in the United

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.710
States was negotiating the North
American Free Trade Agreement.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.020
And when that was
put in the newspapers

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.200
to show how all the working
parts of North America

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.060
should be moving
in unison, papers

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.390
used this illustration,
where you've already used

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.582
your third dimension, right?

00:06:43.582 --> 00:06:44.790
You're not getting that back.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.730
So I paid money, I paid good
money to licence that image

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.730
to put it in my book just
so I could use the caption,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.253
"Making Cogs Great Again,"
so totally worth it.

00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:01.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.830
And finally, two-pound coins--

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.538
when the two-pound coin came
out to celebrate the millennium,

00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:10.080
there was a competition
to design it.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.610
This was the winning entry.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.650
And it's got different
concentric, I guess,

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.360
circles, bits, where it shows
different stages of UK history.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.870
And the middle one, your
kind of mechanical age here,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.570
is a series of cogs.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.697
And because if a cog goes
clockwise, the one next to it

00:07:26.697 --> 00:07:29.280
has to go anti-clockwise, then
clockwise, then anti-clockwise,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.100
you have to have an even number
of cogs as you go around.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.280
The two-pound coin has
an odd number of cogs.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.660
It would not work.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.490
People on the internet
were unimpressed and smug

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.570
in equal measure.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.450
And the Royal Mint put
out a statement saying

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.020
that it doesn't matter, right?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.080
It's just, what are
you going on about?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.178
It's just meant to
represent that age.

00:07:51.178 --> 00:07:52.470
And I was like, that's curious.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.210
But I wonder, because
there's a 50-50--

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.960
I don't know what would
be a great example

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.910
to simulate a 50-50 chance.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.940
Imagine flipping
something, right?

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.370
It could go either way.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.005
If you do it at
random, you get an odd

00:08:07.005 --> 00:08:08.370
or an even number of cogs.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.730
And so I looked up the person
who designed this coin,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.350
a guy called Bruce Russian.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.450
He's an art teacher in Norfolk.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.270
And on his website, he's
got his original design,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.520
which would have worked.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.190
It's an even number of cogs.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.520
The actual coin that was
made, these three cogs

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.190
were removed, which meant
that it wouldn't work.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.330
I was like, wow.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.789
He had it right, and
the Royal Mint broke it.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.289
But was that deliberate?

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.490
So I sent him an email.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.929
I said, hey, I'm really sorry.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.700
I'm sure people have
pointed this out

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm just curious, because
I noticed you got it right.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.169
Was that deliberate?

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.159
Did you think about it?

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.160
Was it a concern?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.743
What happened?

00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:47.410
I'm writing a book
about maths mistakes.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.620
I'm curious to know, what
was your thought process?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.220
And he replied to say that he
didn't think, as an artist,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.080
it should have to be correct.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.640
He thought it was
representative,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.600
a bunch of cogs.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.510
It doesn't make a difference
to the artistic worth

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.380
of the design.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.790
And to be honest, I
kind of agree with him.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.100
He then said that he decided
to make it work anyway,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.700
because otherwise, he would
get loads of annoying emails

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.330
from pedants.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.370
I don't know why that was
in bold, but there you go.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.870
And so yeah, so he
just thought, ah,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.770
people are going to complain.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.395
They're going to go
on and on about it.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.108
And now, this is the
unfortunate edge,

00:09:24.108 --> 00:09:26.400
because when I was writing
a book about maths mistakes,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.068
I didn't want it to
be all about niche,

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.360
theoretical maths problems,
of which there are things--

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.100
people thought they had proved
something, and they hadn't.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.470
And that's interesting
to a small demographic

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.970
that includes this guy.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.220
But then there's also the kind
of pedantic, ah, you're wrong,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.190
I'm right, which
is the opposite of,

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.960
it's fine to make
mistakes, which

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.780
is one of the things
I want to get across.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.910
And a lot of mistakes
don't really matter.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.250
So I hunted down a
copy of this book.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.650
I remembered this from years
and years and years ago.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.780
I didn't have as a child.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.140
I must've seen some--

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.990
I mean, a lot of my
friends procreate.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.920
And I saw somewhere this book.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.470
This is a Sesame Street book.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.450
This is Ernie expressing his
dislike of the possibility

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.060
of being forced to live on the
moon, which feels like a niche

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.350
concern, but there you go.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.945
And I hunted down a
copy of this book.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.070
I found it on the internet.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.470
And there's one thing about
this which really bothers me.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.370
It's not important.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.530
It's not a major issue.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.330
Does anyone, apart
from the child

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.400
who had a very loud
epiphany over there,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.140
like to tell me
what's wrong with it?

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.850
There's stars where
the moon should be.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.920
There's stars where
the moon should be.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.660
You are 100% correct.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.270
What are these?

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.690
There's not a hole in the moon.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.390
As far as I'm aware, in
the extended Sesame Street

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.360
universe, there are
not Muppet bases

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.520
that we can see twinkling
on the moon, right?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.710
And so you often
see a crescent moon.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.900
And then you see stars
shining through it.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.630
And no, the moon is, well,
from our point of view, a disc,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.170
right?

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.250
And it's always there.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.270
It blocks out the stars.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.550
We do see different bits,
depending on how it's lit.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.740
And that's an artistic
version of that.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.870
Bizarrely, I'm fine
with that, right?

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.380
But I'm like, ugh, they
shouldn't show stars

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.760
through the crescent
moon, right?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.518
Come on, bit of
astronomy, everybody.

00:11:08.518 --> 00:11:10.560
And then I was looking
around for other examples.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.990
And actually, Sesame Street
have done this more than once.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:18.300
And I was looking at,
separately, the licence plates

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.860
from the state of Texas.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.980
So this is a plate from Texas.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.295
And as you can see, it's
celebrating the fact

00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:26.920
that the shuttle was
involved in Texas.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920
And there's the shuttle.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.595
That's not a bad
angle, actually,

00:11:29.595 --> 00:11:30.720
for the shuttle taking off.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.940
That's surprisingly--
it hasn't got any

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.830
of its boosters or anything.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.850
Maybe that's it landing.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:36.392
I don't know.

00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:40.170
I was distracted by
over here, that star.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.040
That star is dangerously
close to that--

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.870
but the only way I
could know for sure

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:51.400
would be to somehow buy some
licence plates from Texas.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.090
So I did that.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.260
And they arrived in the post.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.420
There we are.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.340
This is actually genuinely--

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.280
I scanned it so I could get
a high-resolution version,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.620
because all the ones
online were too low-res.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.230
And if you zoom
right in, and you

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.270
fill in the rest of the moon--

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.350
Texas, undone by a lone star.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.180
Oh, people have
since pointed out

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.360
that maybe it's marking where
the first Apollo landing

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.390
site was.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.140
And it's very close.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.420
I might give them that,
to be entirely honest.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.360
But these problems--
they're not--

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.730
OK, if we're just
talking about, are there

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.710
practical implications
for the problems?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.418
In this case, I mean,
don't get me wrong.

00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:39.100
I'm a big fan of
getting maths correct,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.460
and good maths PR, and
mass being important.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.160
But just practically,
are they important?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.180
And sadly, in those cases, not
really, not really important.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.060
But sometimes, the
maths can be important.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.770
So you may have noticed,
I am dancing around

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.100
a very large Jenga tower.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.370
And I thought I would have
this set up during my show

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.940
to artificially increase
the amount of suspense

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.670
for narrative purposes.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.790
No.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.320
So this is to show a fantastic
effect about resonance.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.065
So this is a building.

00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:16.690
And we're going to
show you in a second

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.530
how a building resonates,
hopefully, to destruction.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.450
We will see how lucky we get--

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.110
or unlucky, depending on what
I'm trying to do at the time.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.090
Normally, you will hear
resonance discussed

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.500
when it comes to bridges.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.875
And so there are
a lot of bridges

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.100
which have had resonance
problems, dating back into--

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.830
I think the earliest one I've
come across was in the 1800s,

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.838
up near Manchester,
where Salford is now.

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:40.630
There was a bridge.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.797
And there were some troops
marching over the bridge.

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:44.350
Because they were
all in step, they

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.190
hit a resonance
frequency of the bridge.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.380
And the bridge start to
move, which, apparently,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.860
they thought was kind of fun.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.890
So they started
singing a tune to match

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.100
the bouncing bridge, really
got involved, and it collapsed.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.470
And no one died.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.610
No one died.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.230
It's OK.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.730
It's difficult
writing-- because you

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.980
know when you cover engineering
and medical mistakes,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.522
when I was putting
the book together,

00:14:07.522 --> 00:14:11.110
I'm like, every second
story, everybody dies.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.200
I can't have a comedy book
about maths, and every second--

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.200
every couple pages, and
then everybody died.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.720
So I think, in all the
engineering examples

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.670
I'm going to give you,
nobody died, I think.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.060
And all the aviation stories
in the book, nobody died.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.560
Don't get me wrong, people do
die in aviation problems, just

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.060
not the ones I put in the book.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.900
So that was the problem with
the bridge up near Manchester.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.650
In London, you've still
got this one here.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.970
This is the Albert Bridge.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.970
All troops must break step
when marching over this bridge.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.920
That sign is still there.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.930
They must break step.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.427
Interestingly, though,
they must not break dance--

00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:44.260
very different rule.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.350
And when I mention
this, a lot of

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.350
you are now thinking of
one of two famous bridges--

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.230
Tacoma Narrows Bridge--
this was a bridge

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.990
in the US, art deco bridge,
absolutely phenomenal,

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.150
incredible amount of twist.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.850
Now, that's not your
standard resonance

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.180
from just people marching on
it, or even bursts of wind,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.310
as you will occasionally
read online.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.540
This is resonating.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.620
But this is flutter.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.710
This is aerodynamic flutter
from the wind coming up

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.970
the valley where it was.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.830
And the flutter basically caused
this runaway feedback loop

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.260
where, as bridge came up,
more wind pushed it higher up.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.960
When it finally bounced back and
down, more wind pushed it down.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.060
And you got this feedback, which
led it to go more and more.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.390
Someone finally decided maybe
they should leave their car.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.690
Also, you've got the
Millennium Bridge in London.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.420
This was opened
in the year 2000.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.283
And it was only open
for a couple of days

00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.450
before they had to close it.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.370
They looked at the footage.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.770
Now, if everyone's
walking randomly,

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.020
it should be fine,
because they're not all

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.910
going to match one
particular frequency.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.202
But they looked at the footage.

00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:52.810
About 20% of the pedestrians--
admittedly, it's quite crowded.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:55.810
But 20% of them were
all marching in sync.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.830
The bridge is moving about 7
and 1/2 centimetres either way,

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.960
which is about 7
and 1/2 too many.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.140
And so they had to close it and
do all sorts of crazy things

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.970
to damp it, because
what was happening was,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.410
the bridge was moving a bit.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.748
And people were moving with it.

00:16:09.748 --> 00:16:12.040
And so they were then stepping
in time with the bridge.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.225
So the bridge moving was causing
the pedestrians to synchronise.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.600
And the pedestrians
synchronising

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.892
was causing the bridge to move.

00:16:17.892 --> 00:16:19.340
And you get this feedback loop.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:25.170
The official wording was, it was
synchronous lateral excitation.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.140
It was a feedback.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.970
Energy was going in,
and it was matching

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.650
the resonant
frequency, which is,

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.062
of course, totally terrifying.

00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:33.270
I'm more interested, though--

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.440
I've become obsessed with--
the bridges are one thing.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.315
They're easy to move.

00:16:36.315 --> 00:16:37.960
And we kind of-- for
the most part now,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.460
we get-- which is
why the Millennium

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.420
Bridge was so amazing.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.150
For the most part now
bridges, work fine.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.590
Buildings, less so.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:48.760
So there was a building
in South Korea in 2011,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.250
which is disturbingly recently.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.540
Anything within a decade,
I find terrifying.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.370
It was a 39-story building.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.790
And one day, in 2011, the
people on the 38th floor

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.290
evacuated because
they thought there

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.400
was an earthquake or something.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.483
It was shaking like crazy.

00:17:01.483 --> 00:17:02.552
They left the building.

00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:04.510
No one else knew what
they were going on about.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.979
The building was fine.

00:17:05.979 --> 00:17:07.069
They were like, what?

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.500
They did an investigation.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.069
And they recreated this,
so this is genuinely true.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:17.079
It turns out, on the 12th
floor was an exercise class.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.810
And about 20 people
decided to exercise

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.119
to a different song that day.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:27.790
They exercised to Snap's
"I've Got the Power."

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.745
If you're unfamiliar with
Snap's "I've Got the Power"--

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.040
That would be better if
it was a dramatic, uh--

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.000
if you're unfamiliar with
Snap's "I've Got the Power"--

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.940
[MUSIC PLAYS BRIEFLY]

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.000
And that's as much as I can play
without the Royal Institution

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.260
getting a copyright
strike on their channel.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.372
So they danced to that song.

00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:49.330
The song happened to
match a resonant frequency

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:49.997
of the building.

00:17:49.997 --> 00:17:53.200
And the 38th floor moved
10 times more than normal--

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.220
absolutely incredible.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.990
So when people design
buildings, they

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.400
have to try and factor this in.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.010
And it is a big problem, which
is what-- this is actually

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.283
kind of a teaching
aid for learning

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:04.450
about resonance in building.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.310
And I've borrowed this
off a friend of mine

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.040
who is an engineer.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.790
And they've actually
come along to give me

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.270
a hand, because I am not
qualified to run this,

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.440
and see what it can
show us about resonance.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.440
So can you please
welcome to the stage,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.697
from the University of
Bath, Paul Shepherd.

00:18:19.697 --> 00:18:20.551
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:23.620
There he is.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.680
Welcome, welcome.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.850
Thank you.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.730
I haven't seen you since
we put this back together.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.640
OK, it's been minutes.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.907
So don't pick that up.

00:18:33.907 --> 00:18:34.740
Yeah, I get nervous.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.550
OK, so first of all, what do you
do at the University of Bath?

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.540
I teach mathematics
to civil engineers.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.060
I research how we
can use computers

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.200
to design better buildings.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.510
And I've also got a role in
our Institute of Mathematical

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.540
Innovation, helping companies
with their maths problems.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.210
Fantastic.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.080
Notice how he started and ended
with maths to keep me happy.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.560
So you use this in your
lectures, I believe.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.400
Yes.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.750
And just talk us through,
what is this bit of kit?

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.390
Literally, it's a
washing machine motor.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.680
But let's not go there, right?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.290
It really is.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.470
This is a washing
machine motor in a box.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.150
There's some magic in the box.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.470
It causes the base to move
back and forth, vibrate.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.020
And I have here a button that
you're not qualified to press--

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.645
That's the one.

00:19:22.645 --> 00:19:26.910
--and a dial to make
it go faster or slower.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.320
Is there like a safe slow?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.055
Can we--

00:19:29.055 --> 00:19:30.010
We can do it really--

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.770
Or do you want to leave it?

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.560
What do you want to do?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:31.860
No, no, no, it's fine.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.550
OK, here we go.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:32.850
OK, so--

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:33.490
I can do it slow.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.510
--we'll show it in action.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.160
See if it still works.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.535
I'll catch it if
it goes to fall.

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:37.470
Really slow, yeah?

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.340
Like, you know--

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.330
Oh, that is fantastically slow.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.830
If anyone starts watching the
video right now, they're like,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.205
it is playing at
the wrong speed.

00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:47.387
Anyone still awake?

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:48.220
So that's it, right?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.210
And on top of this, we've
built a Jenga tower.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.560
Yeah.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.935
And what we wanted
to demonstrate

00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:54.640
with this is that if you hit the
resonant frequency of the Jenga

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.110
tower, it will fall over.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.350
But to make it a
challenge, first we're

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.500
going to start with a frequency
where it won't fall over.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.610
So we think we've found one.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.650
We're unconvinced.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.200
We put it back together
and went, oh, now it's

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.568
suddenly different.

00:20:09.568 --> 00:20:11.860
And we'll have a slightly
different resonant frequency.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.340
But let's give it a go.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.760
Let's give it a go.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.398
So shall we slam
straight into the--

00:20:14.398 --> 00:20:15.190
Straight into the--

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.240
Oh, my goodness.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.890
--right.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.520
You're--

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.670
Yeah, yeah, I'm
going to catch it--

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.030
Can I move out of the way?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.928
--just in case we get unlucky.

00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.470
If you get unlucky,
it goes that way.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.690
Oh, yeah.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.280
If I get unlucky, it
goes-- right, here we go.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:24.610
Here we go.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.318
Here we go, yeah.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.480
It's fine.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.500
Look at it.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.621
I would happily live
in that building.

00:20:32.621 --> 00:20:35.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.950
So we've got it moving
at quite a frequency.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.240
It's shaking--
don't get me wrong.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.698
It's shaking it
all over the place.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:42.080
But it's not falling over.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.580
What we're going
to do now is, we're

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.950
going to keep the
amplitude the same,

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.373
because we can't adjust it.

00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:49.040
And we're going to
reduce the frequency,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.165
so we're shaking it less.

00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:51.790
So do you want to
reduce the frequency?

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.980
Slowly, slow, yeah.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.540
We'll slowly bring
the frequency down.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.623
I'm going to move as well.

00:20:54.623 --> 00:20:56.710
So now you can stand back.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.900
There's now less shaking.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.580
Sorry.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.860
Wow, now I feel confident.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.790
Less shaking.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.550
And in theory, even though
we're shaking it less,

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.670
if we hit a resonant
frequency, it will fall over.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.780
I think we're near one.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.970
Oh.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.401
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:19.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.850
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.630
As we're shaking
it slower, we're

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.620
putting less energy into it.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.640
We were just putting the energy
in at just the right time

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.380
to build and accumulate in the
system rather than cancelling

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:36.880
out.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.200
And so what-- so you showed
this to what, civil engineering

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.640
students?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.570
Yes.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.960
I mean, we don't want that
to happen to buildings.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.100
And there's a certain
number of things

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.030
we can change to the
building to make sure

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.130
that the frequency at
which it would do that

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.960
is different from
the frequencies

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.860
that it would see
in its daily life.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.360
OK.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:57.860
So we--

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.960
And you can kind of tune
the building away from--

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.460
And you don't test it by
putting models on this.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:03.960
No.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.335
You run simulations
or something.

00:22:05.335 --> 00:22:07.600
We do maths on it, obviously.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.100
Ah, yes.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.870
Correct answer, Paul.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.850
And are there any
buildings-- can you

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.220
give us examples of buildings
you've done this on,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.820
or you are under a lot of
nondisclosure agreements?

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.903
Not anymore.

00:22:18.903 --> 00:22:20.310
Hey!

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.390
You're an academic now.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:26.400
Well, I was working
on a bridge at--

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.750
I won't say which one--

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.763
at the same time as the wobbly
bridge across the Thames

00:22:30.763 --> 00:22:31.305
had problems.

00:22:31.305 --> 00:22:31.890
Oh, really?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.600
So we were working--

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.720
I was working for, let's
say, a different company.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.295
And of course, we watched that
and thought, well, we better

00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:41.670
make trebly sure that's we're
not going to fall for this.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.120
You're like, whoops.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.412
Glad it happened to them first.

00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:46.420
I mean, it did take the
world of engineering

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.400
a little bit by surprise that
it had happened so seriously.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.590
So yeah, we can now
understand-- it was the person

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.150
element that we--
we knew the maths,

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.250
but we didn't quite understand
how people synchronised.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.460
They're the unpredictable ones.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.800
And now, in the two decades
since, when people design

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.122
bridges, do you--
or any building,

00:23:07.122 --> 00:23:09.330
I guess-- do you have to
now factor in human movement

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.410
as well?

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.040
Yeah.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.200
After that happened,
a lot of people

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.540
did a lot of
experiments and research

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.540
to work out how it happens
and to quantify it.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.430
And now, that sort
of new research

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.800
is taken into account when
we design bridges today.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.400
Oh, fantastic.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.120
Excellent.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.412
Can we have a huge round of
applause for Paul Shepherd?

00:23:26.412 --> 00:23:27.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.710
All right.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:36.105
I mean, he's literally
just sat over there now.

00:23:36.105 --> 00:23:37.480
But his mike has
been turned off.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.782
OK, right so I
think this is great,

00:23:39.782 --> 00:23:41.240
because the thing
about engineering

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.070
is, we're often building
things beyond our current full

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.450
mathematical understanding.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.917
We use maths to build things
which no longer make sense

00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:53.000
intuitively, because if
you look at something like

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.260
the Millennium Bridge,
you can't just go,

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.552
that will wobble or that won't.

00:23:55.552 --> 00:23:58.310
Or indeed, most of the
perfectly stable buildings,

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.320
before we had computers
and advanced maths,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.150
we built them out of
massive bits of rocks,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.800
where you can look
at it and go, yep,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.560
that's not going anywhere,
whereas now, we need computers

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.670
and mathematics to check.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.320
And occasionally,
things go wrong.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.240
We will forget about a factor.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.090
Or there's a new bit of
mathematical behaviour will

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.870
emerge.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.810
And then the engineering
industry learns, improves,

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.490
and the maths is
developed, and we

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.130
carry on building more and
more ridiculous things.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.410
OK, so I'm going to leave
these here and continue

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.560
to carefully dance around them.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.990
What I thought I
would do, because I've

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.240
got one more guest at the
end who's brought something

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.198
else along to show you.

00:24:33.198 --> 00:24:35.762
But between now and then,
I had so many stories,

00:24:35.762 --> 00:24:37.970
because this-- like, I just
had hundreds and hundreds

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.470
of stories, of which a couple
hundred made it into the book.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.920
And I couldn't decide
which ones I was

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.020
going to show you here today.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.450
So what I thought I would
do is pick them at random.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.650
So I have here a spinning wheel.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.150
And so what we can do
is, if we spin the wheel,

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.315
it will settle on
one of the colours.

00:24:58.315 --> 00:24:58.940
This is not it.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.420
We'll do it again in a second.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.580
So we get a colour.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.840
And up here, I've got a
breakdown of what the colours

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.340
mean.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:09.890
So we would do a story
about programming, right?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:10.923
Boom, programming story.

00:25:10.923 --> 00:25:12.590
I get a programming
story on the laptop.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.950
We do it.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:13.670
We have a great time.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.780
We do this a few times.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.730
Then we bring on the final
guest-- very straightforward.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.740
So I'm going to get
some volunteers to come

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.650
down and-- no, not yet.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.902
You haven't heard all the rules.

00:25:23.902 --> 00:25:25.610
I think I'm going to
do this three times.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.818
That's my guess, three times.

00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:29.750
And so my plan is, if we have
three different volunteers,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.180
we will start with a
very young volunteer.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.570
We will then have more of a
teenage, high school volunteer.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.400
And then we'll have
an adult volunteer.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.100
So if people watch this
quickly, or they just--

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.610
or it's edited down, it will
look like the one volunteer

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.610
ageing rapidly--

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.580
--throughout the talk.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.463
OK, so are there any--

00:25:51.463 --> 00:25:52.880
wait for the end
of the sentence--

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.230
any young volunteers would
like to come down and be first?

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.520
Over there, over at the back.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.477
Give me a wave.

00:25:59.477 --> 00:26:00.560
You get round of applause.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.321
Come on down.

00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:04.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.536
Hi.

00:26:05.536 --> 00:26:07.200
It's very nice to meet you.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.020
What's your name?

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.520
Maria.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.360
Maria, nice to meet you.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.440
Would you like to
come over here, Maria?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.790
So you can see I've
got my spinner here.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.650
What I want you to do
is to grab one of these

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:14.858
and just give it a real spin.

00:26:14.858 --> 00:26:18.210
And we'll see which of any
of the colours it ends up on.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.070
Off you go.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.640
Good spin.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.070
Whatever colour it is, just
say the category nice and loud.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.020
Ooh, it's just in green.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:31.770
What's green?

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.497
Probability.

00:26:32.497 --> 00:26:33.330
Thank you very much.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.809
Give her a round of applause.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:38.721
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.260
Give me a second to find
my probability slides.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.450
There we go.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.780
OK, so we're going to start
with a tale about probability

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.552
and how humans are
bad at probability.

00:26:50.552 --> 00:26:52.260
And this is one of my
favourite examples,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.940
where we can try to
scam someone, right?

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.580
We can try and trick someone
into thinking it's a fair game,

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.980
when actually, it's not.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.260
So for this, I need a volunteer.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.482
However, I'm going to take one
from someone right at the top.

00:27:10.482 --> 00:27:11.940
Is there anyone--
because you don't

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.410
have to come down for this.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.650
You remain completely in situ.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.220
Let's go with the person over
there, leaning on the rail,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:20.760
at the back.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.850
Yep, give me a wave.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.350
Excellent.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.210
What's your name, very loud?

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.605
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:24.510
Yeah, we can't hear you.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.020
OK, so--

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.110
So what we're going to do--

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.060
we're going to flip
a coin down here.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.160
It's going to be
heads or tails, right?

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.850
And you're going to try and
predict if it's heads or tails.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.933
Has anyone down here got
a coin, any of the adults

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:41.210
got a coin they're
prepared to flip for me?

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.712
Sir, are you happy to
be our coin flipper?

00:27:43.712 --> 00:27:44.670
OK, you can stay there.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.900
You flip the coin--
very straightforward.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.350
OK, right.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.510
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to flip the coin.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.170
You're going to predict it.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.854
Would you like heads or tails?

00:27:50.854 --> 00:27:52.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:56.566
You feel like this is going
to be a double-sided coin.

00:27:56.566 --> 00:27:59.450
I feel like we're having more of
a conversation than I expected.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.520
Let's have a--
give you the coin.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.930
Oh, my goodness.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:06.680
OK, ready?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.770
No, I'm not throwing it.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.670
Who would you like
to verify the coin?

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.060
Pick a human.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.620
The one next to you.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.180
Pick a human who's
closer to me than you.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.680
It's OK.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.513
I've got a solution.

00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:22.030
Don't worry.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.620
Would anyone like to know--

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.250
OK, OK.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.090
Who-- there?

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.250
There.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.750
That one.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.710
OK.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.510
Can you have a look at that?

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.003
Is it a head on both sides?

00:28:33.003 --> 00:28:33.710
No.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.920
No.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.000
Is it tails on one side?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.810
Yeah.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.920
Excellent.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.050
Wow.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.900
That was anticlimactic.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.140
Here you are.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.030
You are now deemed trustworthy.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.760
By simply saying either the
word "heads" or the word

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.050
"tails," what do you
think it's going to be?

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:55.550
Tails.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.162
Tails, OK.

00:28:56.162 --> 00:28:57.620
Everyone, in your
own minds, decide

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.060
what you think it's going
to be, heads or tails,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.810
in your own minds.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.983
OK, flip it, and then
call it out nice and loud,

00:29:01.983 --> 00:29:02.900
so we can all hear it.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.150
Good flip, solid flip.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.950
What is it?

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.770
Tails.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:07.370
Tails.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.060
Who's right?

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.680
Hands up if you're right.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.610
OK, half of you.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.090
Hands up if you're wrong.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.200
OK, OK, slightly more, because,
you know, adorable kid.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.400
OK.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.957
So was that fair, though?

00:29:19.957 --> 00:29:21.540
And by the way, it's
not a trick coin.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.620
There's nothing fancy going on.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.940
It's not because there's
more metal on one

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.065
side than the other, right?

00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:26.790
Assuming that is a
perfectly fair coin,

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.230
everyone should be happy.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.370
That was a perfectly
fair challenge.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.880
In fact, if we were to bet
money, which, young people,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.170
you shouldn't, right?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.690
But were you to do
such a thing, you

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.470
would have a 50-50 chance
of winning versus losing.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.240
And if you played it
over and over again,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.620
you would win as
often as you lose.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.037
If you played the
same person, you

00:29:45.037 --> 00:29:47.700
would end up passing money back
pretty much at random, right?

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.440
No one has an
advantage in that game.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.690
We could make the game
slightly more exciting

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.510
by having more than one flip.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:59.010
So if, instead of asking
you what one flip would be,

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.760
I could say, we're
going to flip it--

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760
we'll do two flips.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.160
So you can choose
heads-heads, or heads-tails,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.500
or tails-heads, or tails-tails.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.300
What would you like, actually?

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.103
What would you like?

00:30:08.103 --> 00:30:08.603
Tails-tails.

00:30:08.603 --> 00:30:09.840
Tails-tails, all right.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.280
And everyone here could
think of their own one

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.870
that they want to have.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.960
And if we flipped it,
you've all got a 1

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.550
in 4 chance of being right.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.967
Or if we're playing two of us,
if we don't get it straight

00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:25.740
away, we could keep
flipping it until one of us

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.270
has our run come up first.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.640
Still a fair coin,
must be still fair.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.280
What if we did three?

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.110
In fact, everyone,
in your own minds,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.290
decide what three flips in
a row-- heads-tails-heads,

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.140
heads-tails-tails,
heads-tails-tails--

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.080
in your own minds, decide what
you think it's going to be.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.690
What did you decide up there?

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.570
Tails-tails.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.290
Tails-tails.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.410
You get one more.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.590
Heads.

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.090
Heads.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.215
Tails-tails-heads, right?

00:30:54.215 --> 00:30:55.340
In fact, here they all are.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340
There's all the options.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.910
So you may have
picked one of those.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.030
And they're all equally likely.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.710
I'm now going to bet all of
you simultaneously that mine

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.050
will come up before yours.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.090
So I want you to
have a look at this.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:14.103
And I want you to choose
which one is yours.

00:31:14.103 --> 00:31:15.770
Make sure you choose
which one is yours.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:21.380
And then I'm going to add my
predictions next to yours.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.800
So if you predicted
heads-heads-tails,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.870
I predict tails-heads-heads,
because I'm

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.430
playing you all individually.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:31.580
If you pick tails-tails-heads,
I've picked heads-tails-tails.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.810
I have different predictions.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.227
I mean, some of
them are the same.

00:31:34.227 --> 00:31:36.530
But I mix up the predictions
based on what you said.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.050
So everyone, make sure you're
happy-- which one is yours,

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.090
and my prediction next to it.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.790
Have you all got that?

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:41.450
OK.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.033
So what we're going
to do now is we're

00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:47.630
going to start flipping the coin
until either you win or I win.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:52.340
And we'll keep going until
every single game is finished.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.380
So first one up, flip the coin.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.120
What have you got?

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.980
Heads.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.480
Heads.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.260
Second one.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:02.760
Heads.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.690
Ooh.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.534
Third one.

00:32:05.534 --> 00:32:06.510
Tails.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.070
Tails.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.190
So a lot of people are now
happy they've just won.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.580
If you said heads-heads-tails,
you have just beaten me.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.550
I said tails-heads-heads,
which has not come up.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.470
But some people,
yours isn't here yet.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.562
So, Todd, can you flip it again?

00:32:22.562 --> 00:32:23.270
Great, I love it.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.910
You're being more
enthusiastic each time.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:26.420
Tails.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.560
Tails.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.400
So now, can you see?

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.070
The last three are
now heads-tails-tails.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.040
So if you had heads-tails-tails,
you have now won.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.500
If I had heads-tails-tails,
I've now won.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.480
Or if I had heads-heads-tails
against yours, I've now won.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.870
You need to keep track
who wins first, you or me.

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.010
So if either I beat you
with heads-heads-tails

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.760
or I've beaten you
with heads-tails-tails,

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.718
just bear that in mind.

00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:49.868
OK, give us another flip.

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:50.860
Heads.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.410
Heads.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.620
So the next one up
his tails-tails-heads,

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.790
tails-tails-heads.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.786
Up next?

00:32:56.786 --> 00:32:58.150
Tails.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:01.930
Tails-heads-tails,
tails-heads-tails,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:02.800
tails-heads-tails.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.892
OK.

00:33:04.892 --> 00:33:06.270
Tails.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.940
Heads-tails-tails,
heads-tails-tails.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.498
Is anyone still in the game?

00:33:11.498 --> 00:33:12.540
What are you thinking of?

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.415
Which ones are yours?

00:33:13.415 --> 00:33:14.310
Heads-heads-heads.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.720
Heads-heads-heads.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.220
And what did I
predict against that?

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:17.970
Tails-heads-heads.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.175
That hasn't come up.

00:33:19.175 --> 00:33:19.800
Oh my goodness.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.842
OK, let's keep going, eh?

00:33:20.842 --> 00:33:21.400
Next one.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.764
Who's going to win?

00:33:23.764 --> 00:33:24.730
Heads.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.600
Heads.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.950
Tails-tails-heads.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.180
Tails.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.517
Tails-heads-tails.

00:33:32.517 --> 00:33:34.100
They're still both
in the competition.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.058
Someone else has either
won or gone out, right?

00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:36.588
Yep.

00:33:36.588 --> 00:33:37.950
Heads.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.370
Heads-tails-heads.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.890
That's the beginning
of your run.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.450
Here we go.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.990
Heads.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.137
Oh, but you were about to win.

00:33:47.137 --> 00:33:47.637
Aw.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.970
Is anyone still in the game?

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.536
What were you on?

00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:57.430
Heads-tails-heads.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.980
Heads-tails-heads, I
predicted heads-heads-tails,

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.300
which was the first one out.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.200
So it's fine.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:02.700
Don't worry.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.670
We'll edit this
out of the video.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.045
(WHISPERING) We're not going
to edit it out of the video.

00:34:06.045 --> 00:34:07.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.610
So very quickly,
before, when it was

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.500
heads or tails, roughly
half the audience,

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.060
roughly, got it correct.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.286
Put your hand up if I
won the game against you.

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:19.989
That's the vast majority of you.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.060
And hands up if you won.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.440
Oh, a few people.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.280
OK, what did you--

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.197
the people who picked
me, what did you go for?

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.060
Heads-heads-tails.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.310
Heads-heads-tails, which was
straight out of the gate,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.810
right?

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.080
So 1 in 8 of you will win
straight out of the gate.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.659
If you play this
game over and over,

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:39.320
and the person you're playing
against picks randomly,

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.340
I will win 74% of the time.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.449
Roughly 3/4 of a time,
the one I've put in white

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.130
will beat the one in
orange next to it.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.210
And the reason this works,
and the reason it's not fair,

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.410
is we don't flip the coin three
times and then start again.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.660
If we did it three times,
start again, three times,

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.820
start again, it would
be perfectly fair.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.310
Because they're overlapping,
they're no longer

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.230
independent probabilities.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.660
They're now dependent
probabilities.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:12.110
And if you look at
mine, all of mine will--

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.300
mine all end in what your
prediction starts with.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.910
I'm trying to make
mine happen right

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.180
before yours, which is why
I got yours, because I knew,

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.880
if you've got heads-heads-heads,
unless the first three

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.550
flips are heads-heads-heads,
I'm going to win,

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.290
because tails-heads-heads
will always come first.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.500
So let's say we've been
flipping the coin for ages.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.080
And someone picked all
tails, the opposite of you,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.160
and someone picked--

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.610
I picked heads-tails-tails.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.610
If the coins being flip,
flip, flip, flip, flip,

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:39.320
and you're like, ah,
here we go at last,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.940
it's going to be
tails-tails-tails,

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.690
as soon as you get the first two
in the run, I've already won.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.470
Unless the first three
flips are tails-tails-tails

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.050
or heads-heads-heads,
you cannot win.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.030
So there's a 1 and 8
chance you will win.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.048
And there's a 7 in
8 chance I will win.

00:35:55.048 --> 00:35:56.840
And the other ones are
different variations

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.632
on that theme with
different probabilities.

00:35:58.632 --> 00:36:01.880
And if you average them
all, you get the 74% figure.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.100
And people don't really
think through when

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.280
you get these unusual
probabilities combining.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.592
I actually-- I carry with
me a set of dice, which

00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:15.050
I thought I'd get out if we
have probability on the spinner

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.620
wheel.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.790
These are called Grime Dice.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.600
And they have unusual
numbers on them.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.120
And I appreciate you
can't really see them.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.162
So I've got-- I'll show
it up on the screen here.

00:36:25.162 --> 00:36:27.960
So the yellow one, you
can see there, has got--

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.815
it's got an eight.

00:36:28.815 --> 00:36:29.690
It's got some threes.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.240
The green has got a zero.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.750
What's going on there?

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:34.490
They've got crazy
numbers on them.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.780
They're not one to six.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.300
And the game you play
is, choose a dice.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.437
So you pick one colour.

00:36:39.437 --> 00:36:40.520
I pick a different colour.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.570
We roll them together.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:42.680
Highest number wins.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.180
Very straightforward, right?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.227
Except they're not all
equally likely to win,

00:36:46.227 --> 00:36:47.810
because they've got
different numbers.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.500
But it's very hard to tell at a
glance which is the best dice.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.420
I can now reveal
to you that if you

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.760
roll the red one
versus the blue one,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.920
the red one will win more
often than the blue--

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.870
not all the time,
but more often.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.217
It's above 50%.

00:37:01.217 --> 00:37:03.050
The blue one wins more
often than the green.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:04.800
The green wins more
often than the yellow.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.770
Yellow wins more
often than magenta.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.690
And so you get this
fantastic ordering

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:11.540
from the best dice, which is
the red, down to the worst dice,

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.450
which is the magenta,
or so you would think.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.610
If you play magenta
versus red, the magenta

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.430
wins more often
than the red one.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.950
There's no best dice.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.790
If you remember this cycle, and
the person you're playing picks

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:28.220
first, you can
always pick a dice

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.950
which has a higher probability
of winning than they do, same

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.853
as the dice game, penny ante.

00:37:32.853 --> 00:37:34.520
As long as the other
person picks first,

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.000
you can always pick one that's
better, which feels weird.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.617
But it's the same as
rock paper scissors.

00:37:40.617 --> 00:37:42.200
It's like playing
rock paper scissors,

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.810
but going, you go first,
and then I'll choose.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.355
There's no best option.

00:37:47.355 --> 00:37:48.980
But each one's better
than another one.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.380
And each one loses to
another one-- same deal

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.970
on a higher scale.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.733
If you do play this, though,
it gets a bit terrifying,

00:37:55.733 --> 00:37:57.650
because if people realise
you're beating them,

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.760
they will make you
tell them the secret.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.260
And then you say,
oh, I can't do it.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.450
I'll teach you the secret.

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.400
And now we'll play
two dice together.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.510
Why not?

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.520
What they won't realise
is, if you play two dice

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.770
simultaneously, it
reverses the order.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.220
So they will now--
you will pick first.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.290
And they will then
deliberately pick the one that

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.320
loses, because you've got two.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.150
So that's the single dice game.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.710
That's the double dice game.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.120
If you're wondering what
on earth is going on here,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.400
I've got a quick equation.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.342
There you go.

00:38:27.342 --> 00:38:27.842
Huh?

00:38:27.842 --> 00:38:29.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.230
It's also got more
than one cycle,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.350
because there's another
internal cycle of five

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.030
in a different order.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:42.490
And if you double the dice, the
internal cycle doesn't reverse.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.800
All it does is, the
top one becomes even.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.260
So there's the double dice.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.610
There's the single dice.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.170
And so the outside
one's flipping,

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.940
but the inside one isn't.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.710
If you're wondering
what's going on there,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.752
there's the new equation.

00:38:54.752 --> 00:38:55.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.130
And I absolutely love them.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.550
If you want some details,
they-- the colours--

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.810
I'm came up with the colours.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.450
Friend of mine, guy called
James Grime, did the numbers.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:05.380
I did the colours.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.890
I'm helping, because I said,
if they're these colours,

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:13.940
then the length of the colour
goes up by one letter as you go

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.840
around the outside cycle,
which is why that's magenta,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.450
not purple.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:19.617
Purple has insufficient letters.

00:39:19.617 --> 00:39:21.700
And then James was like,
well, if we make this one

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.430
olive instead of
green, the inner cycle

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.160
is now alphabetical order.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.465
So you can now remember
both cycles by looking

00:39:30.465 --> 00:39:31.090
at the colours.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.520
If you want all the stats,
here are your advantages

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.350
for any given pairing.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.153
The inner cycle is
actually slightly stronger.

00:39:38.153 --> 00:39:39.820
The other one-- here's
all your numbers.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.460
Every single one is
above 50%, apart from--

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.310
we couldn't quite get
this one up to 50.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.590
It's just below,
because sadly, there's

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.890
nothing magical
about these dice.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.880
There's no incredible
maths property.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.900
It's just that when you
put numbers on dice,

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.440
it's very hard to tell if they
form a non-transitive cycle

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.610
or a transitive cycle.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.950
And non-transitive just means--

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.260
like, numbers are
transitive, because if 3--

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.470
let's say 7 is bigger than
3, and 3 is bigger than 1,

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.150
then 7 is bigger than 1.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.910
It's a transitive property
that passes down the chain.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.000
Just because red beats
blue and blue beats green

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.643
doesn't mean red
beats green, right?

00:40:17.643 --> 00:40:19.810
It's not a property that
gets passed down the chain.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.380
And it's things like
this which throw humans,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.540
when we think we
understand probability,

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.580
but then it's just
a little bit off.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.910
So I think we've got time
for another quick spin

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.750
of the wheel.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.450
I need a teenager this time.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.980
Anyone prepared to come
down and give me a hand?

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.605
You look very keen
right in the centre.

00:40:37.605 --> 00:40:39.563
Would you like to come
down and spin the wheel?

00:40:39.563 --> 00:40:42.150
You get the applause once you
get to the aisle, not before.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.650
[CLAP]

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:43.190
No.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.040
It gets awkward.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.490
It gets awkward.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.950
Otherwise, we're just applauding
other people awkwardly moving.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.533
It's not good.

00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:51.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:51.876 --> 00:40:55.292
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:58.214 --> 00:40:59.006
What was your name?

00:40:59.006 --> 00:40:59.620
Sasha.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.120
Sasha.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.050
Very nice to meet you, Sasha.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.200
So you saw how this goes.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:02.700
You grab it.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.650
You give it a spin.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.490
Whatever colour it ends up on,
you say very loudly what it

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:06.990
was.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.086
OK, off you go.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.370
OK, and we're going
to be talking about--

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.820
OK, probability.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.320
Excellent.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.487
Round of applause for Sasha.

00:41:16.487 --> 00:41:19.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:19.790
Wow.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.250
What are the chances?

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.390
So probability-- I think
I've got a second probability

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.930
thing here.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.638
Give me a second.

00:41:29.638 --> 00:41:32.200
Give me a-- oh, yeah, no,
OK, this is kind of fun.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.910
This is an old classic.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:39.040
So way back in the
distant past, 2010,

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.540
I saw a newspaper story about
someone who had analysed

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:48.520
the locations of the ancient
monolithic sites in the UK.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.220
And they realised that
they formed patterns.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.110
Specifically, if you took the
1,500 main monolithic ancient

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.065
sites-- these are
prehistoric sites--

00:41:58.065 --> 00:41:59.440
and you analysed
their positions,

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.470
they formed triangles.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:08.320
More than that, they formed
very precise triangles,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.073
isosceles triangles where
two sides are exactly

00:42:11.073 --> 00:42:11.740
the same length.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:14.365
And they were within like half
a percent, incredible precision.

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.470
And the person who found
this put out a press release.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:18.880
It was in all the papers.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.880
They claimed it was some
kind of ancient sat nav

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.720
and that they used these
geometric arrangements

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.980
of monolithic sites to navigate
across the United Kingdom.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.880
And the researchers said that
the results were so precise,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.640
they could not have
happened by accident.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.510
In fact, they couldn't rule
out extraterrestrial help.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.930
So I thought I would check.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.175
So I went and also
got some ancient sites

00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:48.550
and started plotting them on
a map of the United Kingdom.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.700
And the first three I came
across around Birmingham

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.220
formed a perfect
equilateral triangle

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.110
within the required
half a percent.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.948
And then, I forgot, I
added in more triangles.

00:42:58.948 --> 00:43:01.240
You've also got two isosceles
triangles on either side,

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.073
both within the half a
percent, another pair

00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:05.470
of isosceles triangles,
both within the required

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.430
half a percent.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.690
The base and the
perpendicular bisector

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.715
go through four new locations.

00:43:10.715 --> 00:43:13.090
The location in Conaway is
within 12 metres of this line.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.670
It then goes over 170 miles
across the United Kingdom,

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.500
right through the
base of the triangle,

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.400
hits Luton, where it's within
nine metres of that spot--

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.170
incredibly precise patterns.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.290
I was like, wow, this can't
have happened by accident,

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.370
except I wasn't analysing
ancient monolithic sites.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.430
I had looked up the ancient
Woolworth's stores--

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.720
--who had gone bankrupt
slightly before.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.990
And we had already forgotten
how the people of 2008 lived.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.438
I mean, how did they buy
discount plastic goods

00:43:44.438 --> 00:43:44.980
and clothing?

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.570
We just don't know.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:48.070
And for the young
people who aren't

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.903
familiar with Woolworth's,
they had a business model

00:43:50.903 --> 00:43:53.320
where they were like, let's
just get all the confectionery

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.500
and put it in open containers,
let people help themselves,

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.610
and assume nothing will go
wrong with that business model.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:00.910
So they went out of business.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:06.010
I found the 800 Woolworth's
locations around the UK.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.120
And I analysed them.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.140
And I found the same patterns
to the same level of precision

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.000
as the other person
who had found

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.430
who was claiming
either ancient wisdom,

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.490
or aliens, or all
these things, right?

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.090
So I put out my findings
as a press release

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.510
about how we could learn
about the ancient Woolworth's

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.250
civilisation.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.560
The Guardian went with
"Aliens Found Woolworth's

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.450
Civilization," which
was pretty funny.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.220
It turns out, there
are just lots and lots

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.600
of stores to choose from.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.670
So specifically,
here are the ones

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:37.870
I had with their postcodes.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.120
They're all legitimate stores.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.390
You can fact check this.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:43.120
But here are all
the stores, right?

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.070
If you've got-- I
checked the numbers.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.610
If you have 800
Woolworth's stores,

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:53.320
there are 85 million
possible triangles.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.990
If you have 85
million triangles,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.810
it would be more amazing if none
of them were isosceles, right?

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.610
There are so many options.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.530
If you look hard enough,
you will definitely

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.710
find this pattern
or any pattern.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.570
Mathematically,
we can state, you

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.930
can find any pattern you want
to any level of precision

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:15.290
you want if you're prepared
to ignore enough data.

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:18.580
The 1,500 stores the
other person had used

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.470
gave them 561 million triangles.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.350
Of course, in 561
million triangles,

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.360
there are going to be a
few that line up, right?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.550
We're just ignoring
loads of data and cherry

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:32.350
picking the little
bits which confirm

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:34.240
whatever our bias may be.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.950
And every so often, this person
would put out more findings.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.170
And I would put out other
ridiculous press releases,

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.690
up to and including a
programme-- a friend of mine,

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.960
a guy called Tom Scott,
programmed a website based

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.620
on the Woolworth's thing,
except he used monolithic sites

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:51.820
and postcodes.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:56.260
So he found, for every single
postcode in the United Kingdom,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.890
there are three ley lines that
go through it by joining up

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.390
other monolithic sites.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:04.060
And one of them
will be Stonehenge--

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.300
every single postcode.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.830
I can guarantee you can now
tell everyone your house,

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.580
your postcode, is definitely at
the centre of three ley lines,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.200
one of which go
through Stonehenge,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.710
because it's true of everywhere
on the United Kingdom.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.770
Just a lot of old things
are lying around, right?

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.970
And I get so annoyed
when people go,

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:26.210
this data confirms
whatever my theory is.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.150
And they're not asking how
much data didn't confirm it.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.740
You always want
to know, if you're

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.590
doing good, proper science,
how much you're ignoring,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:37.130
what your method was, how you
can falsify what you believe,

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.280
and then honestly and rigorously
checking that, and then getting

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.810
other people to check it.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.240
Don't leave it to people
like me to make fun of you

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.710
in the newspaper.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.280
OK, I think we
got time for one--

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.285
let's do one quick
last spin of the wheel.

00:46:51.285 --> 00:46:52.910
And then I'll bring
on our final guest.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.670
So for this one, I need an adult
who's prepared to come down.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.440
Is there anyone
who's prepared to--

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.730
I mean, you're
practically here already.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.740
Give them around of applause.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.365
Here they come!

00:47:00.365 --> 00:47:02.535
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:02.535 --> 00:47:03.988
I'm Matt.

00:47:03.988 --> 00:47:04.780
What was your name?

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.480
Matthew.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:05.980
Matthew.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.980
That's easy to remember.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.280
OK, so Matthew, we're
going to spin the wheel.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.840
Whatever it lands on, we're
going to talk about it.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.360
Off you go.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:19.840
Oh, is that just in probability?

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.935
Yes!

00:47:20.935 --> 00:47:22.630
A round of applause for Matthew!

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.498
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:30.663 --> 00:47:32.080
No, it does land
on other colours.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:32.860
Oh well.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.423
OK, so I'm very quickly going
to talk about-- wow, three--

00:47:36.423 --> 00:47:37.840
I didn't have a
third probability?

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.840
Oh, I have got one here.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.150
Let me get that.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.880
I'm going to show
you my all-time--

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.000
stay with me, everyone-- my
all-time favourite photo.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.220
This is my absolute
favourite photo.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.030
And this was taken in 1980.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.320
That is Donna.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.700
She was on a holiday--

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.440
oh, a vacation--
she's North American--

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.710
going to one of the
Disney World or Lands.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.910
And when she was there, she got
this photo taken with a Smee.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.170
This is Smee, right?

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.470
And the probability-- the
amazing thing about this is not

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.930
that someone actually wanted
a photograph with Smee,

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.590
but what was happening
in the background,

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:19.840
because many years later, she
met her fiancé, Alex, right?

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.280
They obviously got engaged.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.260
And one day, she
was showing Alex

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.270
the photographs
from her childhood,

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.460
showed him this photograph.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.730
And he went, oh, that's odd.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:32.040
That looks like my dad.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:35.460
Wait, that's me.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.710
She was accidentally
photographed

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.540
with the person she
would later go on

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:43.650
to marry decades before
they actually met, right?

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.050
And that's amazing.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.220
Like, the media
lost their minds.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.420
Like, imagine imagine
being in a photo as a kid,

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.700
and someone just wheels
your future spouse

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.450
into the background.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.670
It's incredible.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.160
But I was like,
no, it's not fate.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.180
It's not romance.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.230
It's statistics, because
how likely is the--

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.698
OK, this is unlikely to
happen to any one given human,

00:49:07.698 --> 00:49:09.240
because over the
course of your life,

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.090
particularly now there are
cameras absolutely everywhere,

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.340
you'll be photographed
with, I don't know,

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.292
1,000 or so random people
in backgrounds of photos.

00:49:17.292 --> 00:49:18.000
Who knows, right?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.350
Let's say about 1,000.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:22.350
And it's reasonably
unlikely that you will go on

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.150
to have a significant
relationship with any

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.812
of those random people.

00:49:25.812 --> 00:49:27.270
There's possibly
billions of people

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.562
that you could go on to have
relationships with, right?

00:49:29.562 --> 00:49:31.140
And so 1,000 out of billions--

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.880
I mean, obviously, it
depends how big a-- you know,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.755
how much mixing in the
populations you're in.

00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:35.760
There are other factors.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.740
But it's very
unlikely, except it

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.168
can happen to a lot of people.

00:49:40.168 --> 00:49:41.460
It couldn't just happen to you.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.630
It could happen to everyone.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.570
It could happen to those
billions of people.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:48.770
I would argue the
population size cancels out.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.850
There should be
thousands of photographs

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.350
like this out there, right?

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.910
This is not amazing.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.230
We expect it to happen.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.730
We just don't expect it to
happen to anyone specific.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.710
We wouldn't know who
Donna and Alex are.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.590
They're just some
random North Americans.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:05.840
We would have no idea, right?

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.590
It's only because the
photograph happened.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:09.810
It's a bit like
winning the lottery.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.400
It's amazing if you
win the lottery.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.410
That's incredible.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.740
It's not amazing if
someone wins the lottery.

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.110
You don't see the
newspaper, oh my goodness!

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.480
Someone won the lottery again.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.800
Just keeps happening.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.030
Well, yes.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.880
Millions of people play
the lottery, right?

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.380
People forget about how many
opportunities these things

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:29.880
have.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.048
And I went on tour a
couple of years ago

00:50:32.048 --> 00:50:33.590
and did a show called
"Number Ninja."

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:37.080
And when I was on tour,
I showed this photograph

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.870
and talked about how
likely I thought it was.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.660
And sure enough, in one
show, somebody came up to me

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.660
and said, oh, this happened
to some friends of mine.

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.840
A friend of mine, Kate, she
met someone called Chris

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.520
in Sheffield in 1993.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.540
And they got engaged.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.070
And they went on a world tour
to celebrate their engagement.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.987
And as they were travelling
around the planet,

00:50:55.987 --> 00:50:58.500
they went to visit some
distant, distant relatives

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:01.030
of Kate's in Outback,
Western Australia,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.210
which really is the middle
of nowhere, all right?

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.590
I've been there, right?

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.840
And they were visiting
one particular family

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.980
on one particular farm.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:10.830
And the wife in
that family said,

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.720
oh, it's so great you're here.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.580
My husband and I, we went to the
UK once years ago, once, right?

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.080
And we took a whole
bunch of photos.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.410
And we got one photo,
one specific photo,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.970
that we don't know
where we took it.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:24.990
All the other
ones, we've written

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.032
the location on the back.

00:51:26.032 --> 00:51:27.270
This one, we have no idea.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.395
And they were like, oh, OK.

00:51:28.395 --> 00:51:29.707
Well, let's have a look, right?

00:51:29.707 --> 00:51:30.540
And so they went in.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.080
They got the photo.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.010
They pulled it out.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.770
And Chris looked at it and
went, oh, that looks like--

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.330
oh, that's Trafalgar
Square, right?

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.670
You're feeding the pigeons
in Trafalgar Square.

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.810
Wait a minute.

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:40.620
That's me!

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.660
Imagine travelling halfway
around the world to be reminded

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.550
of how much denim
you wore as a kid.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.050
I mean, that's-- wow.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:53.430
And it was like the one time
as a kid his family went down

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.740
to London, happened
to be photographed

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:59.370
by a distant relative of the
person he would go on to marry.

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.475
And then it was
the one photograph

00:52:01.475 --> 00:52:02.850
that they wanted
to show you when

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:04.440
you happened to
visit in this other--

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.775
it's just insane, right?

00:52:05.775 --> 00:52:07.650
And again, they showed
this at their wedding,

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:11.903
about how incredible it was
that they had this photo.

00:52:11.903 --> 00:52:12.570
And that's true.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:13.830
It is incredible for them.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.240
It's just not incredible
that it happens.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.823
Always, you just got to remember
how many opportunities things

00:52:17.823 --> 00:52:19.020
have to happen.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.920
In fact, you can
kind of exploit that.

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.470
So I've got a-- this is an
old-school one-pound coin,

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.970
the old circular ones,
before they got rid of them.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.050
I'm going to flip it so it
lands on its edge, right?

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:35.010
So flip the coin,
land, edge, OK?

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:35.640
OK, here we go.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:35.930
Ready?

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:36.430
Ready?

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:41.340
That's dangerously close.

00:52:47.749 --> 00:52:49.870
Oh!

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:50.890
That's so close.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:52.300
Wouldn't that have been amazing?

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.870
I mean, I thought I was just
going to have to stand here,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.560
doing the same thing over
and over again, but no.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.850
No, actually, that was--

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.130
the pound coin, I think,
is the most likely thing

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:00.970
to land on its edge.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:02.290
And just so you know,
that doesn't always

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:03.230
happen, by the way.

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.150
There's not an edge.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:06.250
I happened to get lucky
on the first flip, right?

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:07.840
It genuinely does happen.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:11.560
I could actually-- I could sit
here for-- ooh, that was close.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.020
I could sit here and flip
it thousands of times.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.860
Eventually, it would land
on its edge, which I know,

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.660
because I did.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:24.400
So this was me flipping a coin
until it lands on its edge.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.910
I wanted to see how
many edges I could get.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.410
And some of them, I wasn't sure
if they should count or not.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.000
So I want your
opinion on this one.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.625
OK, here we go.

00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:35.177
This is me flipping a coin
so it lands on its edge.

00:53:35.177 --> 00:53:38.590
Flip the coin.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.660
Look at that!

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.622
Wait, wait.

00:53:43.622 --> 00:53:46.510
Oh no.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.160
Aw.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.610
Does that count?

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:53.180
Vote if you think that counts.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.760
Vote if you think it doesn't.

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.430
You're right.

00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:57.140
It does not.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:57.920
I kept going.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:04.820
I flipped this specific
coin 10,000 times.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.430
Oh, I haven't put
the video out yet.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:08.142
So people watching
this, spoiler.

00:54:08.142 --> 00:54:09.100
Don't tell anyone else.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.330
That video will be out soon.

00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.430
I flipped it-- because I did,
like, funny videos like, here's

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.347
how you flip a coin till
it lands on its edge.

00:54:14.347 --> 00:54:15.840
Boom, thanks, right?

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.958
There's a video.

00:54:16.958 --> 00:54:18.250
And I kept going, going, going.

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:21.880
14-- 14 edges out
of 10,000 flips.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.560
I believe the old circular
pound coin is the most likely to

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.180
land on its edge
of all the coins.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.800
That's my theory.

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.180
And it seems pretty likely.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.690
I couldn't believe I
almost got an edge just--

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:37.030
aw.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.550
Right?

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:40.370
And so if you ever want
to pass, in my experience,

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:44.150
three days of your
life, get involved.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:51.050
OK, so I think we've done enough
ridiculous bits of probability.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:54.290
We'll go back to the show
as I originally planned.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.670
Oh, and to be honest,
I am quite glad.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:02.090
It's great example
of probability.

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:03.650
If you do something
often enough,

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:04.692
weird things will happen.

00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:07.067
I like the fact that we got
three probabilities in a row.

00:55:07.067 --> 00:55:08.810
I think that's
actually quite a good--

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.450
quite a good message,
although the bizarre thing

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:14.000
is, this is the first
time I have ever done

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:14.810
this talk, right?

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:17.280
And it happened straight away.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.100
And for those of you
watching the video,

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.630
it's because we
sat here and kept

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:23.725
spinning it until we got
probability every single time.

00:55:23.725 --> 00:55:25.100
This is the most
patient audience

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.990
I've had for some time.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:29.360
And this is a lesson
in not believing

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.610
things you see on the internet.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.015
So good moral.

00:55:34.015 --> 00:55:37.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.365
Man, the second
one took forever.

00:55:43.365 --> 00:55:45.490
OK, yeah, that's not the
actual moral of the story.

00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.313
OK, I'm going to bring
up my final guest

00:55:47.313 --> 00:55:48.480
and show you one more thing.

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.200
And then I'll wrap up.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.658
And as was mentioned
the beginning,

00:55:50.658 --> 00:55:53.310
there are books
available on the way out.

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.980
I'm also doing a show at the
Edinburgh Fringe coming up.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.690
And I'm doing a book
tour afterwards,

00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:59.410
which is completely
different to this.

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.680
So if you watch this, or
you watch this online,

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.815
I'm doing shows afterwards
about Humble Pi.

00:56:03.815 --> 00:56:05.940
But I've deliberately made
this a special show just

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.770
for the Royal Institution,
because I'm not

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.322
doing that again.

00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:12.783
And so if you see
me on tour, it'll

00:56:12.783 --> 00:56:13.950
be a totally different show.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.035
And it'll be great to
see some of the shows.

00:56:16.035 --> 00:56:18.160
Right, so the very last
thing I'm going to show you

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.010
is a problem, once
again, with engineering.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:24.210
So we did structural,
like civil engineering.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.710
We're now going
to look at, well,

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:30.030
engineering that
brought down a rocket.

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:33.300
There was a rocket,
the Ariane 5 rocket,

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.160
which was being launched by ESA.

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:39.000
And 40 seconds after it
took off, it exploded.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.920
Thankfully, it was
unstaffed, right?

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.630
There were no humans onboard.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.870
It was just payload
of other spacecraft.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.393
But of course, someone had
built those spacecraft.

00:56:48.393 --> 00:56:50.310
And they were obviously
very attached to them.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:55.740
And a simple mathematical error
caused the rocket to explode.

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.840
And the spacecraft rained
down on the swamp underneath.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.990
And I will explain what the
maths mistake was in a second.

00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:06.660
But the bits of
spacecraft, they then

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.330
sent them back to the
people who had made them

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.640
and were waiting to
send them into space.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:16.500
And to show us the mangled bits
of spacecraft from the Mullard

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.230
Space Science Laboratory at
UCL, please welcome Lucy Green.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:23.175
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:23.175 --> 00:57:24.300
Do you want to go get them?

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:24.870
Yeah.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:25.453
I'll get them.

00:57:25.453 --> 00:57:26.200
I'll get them.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.070
I say welcome.

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:29.650
She's going to arrive, and then
go away again, and then come

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.150
back.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.330
So I asked Lucy very kindly
if she could go and find

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:35.550
the bits of spacecraft.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:36.280
Do you want to--

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:39.340
very carefully-- we'll
wheel it out the front here.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.670
So these are-- so what
spacecraft was this?

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.630
So these are bits of
instruments that we

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.510
flew on the Cluster spacecraft.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.742
So there's four of them,
actually, so four of them--

00:57:50.742 --> 00:57:51.700
All on the same rocket?

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.560
All on the same rocket, yeah.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.300
That was a big mistake.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.440
And they posted them
back to the lab?

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:57.940
Yes.

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.230
So when the rocket obviously
came down, as you said,

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:04.510
not that long after launch,
it fell into the swamp

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.010
in French Guiana.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.350
And so the European
Space Agency had

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:10.240
people who could go out
and rescue the rocket

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.890
and get the pieces back.

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:15.190
So we then got our
instruments sent back.

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.410
And apparently, I wasn't
there at the time,

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.090
but the story goes
that we got the box.

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:20.007
And they opened it up.

00:58:20.007 --> 00:58:21.640
And there was still
bits of swamp in it

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.810
and bits of our instrument, too.

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:27.320
So this is one of
the brains of one

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.570
of the instruments on Cluster.

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:31.120
So we built the instrument
that measures-- well, we

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.620
can talk about what
the mission did.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.920
But it was sent up to
study the environment

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.132
around the Earth, so the
magnetic field of the Earth

00:58:38.132 --> 00:58:39.340
and the particle environment.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.007
And this is the brains
of the instrument

00:58:41.007 --> 00:58:43.390
that measured the electrons
in the environment

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:44.350
around the Earth.

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.680
And what research do you do?

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.180
You're on--

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:48.190
So my research is
really related.

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:49.600
I study the Sun.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.170
And I'm interested in how
the Sun's activity impacts

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:54.670
the Earth's magnetic
field, creating

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.050
something called space weather.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:58.420
And this Cluster
mission was designed

00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.650
to study space weather.

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.570
So one of the
things that did was

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:04.150
look at the physical processes
behind the generation

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:06.250
of the aurora, the
northern lights.

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:10.270
And the aurora are
generated by solar activity.

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.260
That sounds useful.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.218
I mean, I say what do
you do like I don't know.

00:59:13.218 --> 00:59:15.992
I'm actually married to
Lucy, just so we're--

00:59:15.992 --> 00:59:17.200
because otherwise, that was--

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.617
I thought it was
quite convincing.

00:59:18.617 --> 00:59:21.340
If your parents are watching,
they're like, he never asked.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:24.440
So we've got meteorite rings.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:24.940
Look at us.

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.667
Ah, nerds.

00:59:26.667 --> 00:59:27.250
No, it's fine.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:27.470
It's fine.

00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.690
I assume you're wearing it.

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:29.810
I'm wearing it.

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:31.810
You're wearing the gloves,
by the way, because--

00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:33.685
why do you have to wear
gloves handling this?

00:59:33.685 --> 00:59:36.100
Well, because we
think it's probably

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.820
still covered in rocket fuel.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.320
So--

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.130
And that's not good for you.

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:39.700
It's not good for you.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:40.840
And I don't want
to get on my hands

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.050
and then go and eat
my dinner later.

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.230
But I mean, it's pretty
cool to see these bits that

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:45.790
are completely mangled up.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.640
And normally, our
instruments don't come back.

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.130
So these bits were built
in our laboratories.

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:53.073
And now we've got
them back again.

00:59:53.073 --> 00:59:54.490
I think, on one
of them, there was

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:57.640
a little tag that said
UCL's Mullard Space Science

00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.290
Laboratory.

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:00.760
So someone was like, you
know, if found, please send it

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.840
home to us.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.240
They figured that would
take millions of years

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.190
and be some distant
civilization.

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.890
But no, it was within our--

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.910
Yeah, so you can see.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.482
And so when you arrived--
you started working there

01:00:12.482 --> 01:00:13.690
just after this had happened.

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:14.930
Just after this had happened.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.583
So when we launched the
spacecraft, of course,

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:19.750
we want to have a big party.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.250
Everyone gets
together to celebrate.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.700
And they'd bought champagne
to drink after the launch.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.740
And I arrived about
two years later.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.157
And that champagne was still
there, sadly, undrunk, yeah.

01:00:30.157 --> 01:00:32.240
But I mean, we could talk
about the success story,

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.713
because we did go on to
rebuild these instruments.

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:36.880
So they were launched again.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.410
They were launched again, yes.

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:40.840
So the European Space
Agency gave us the money

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.230
to rebuild the instruments.

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:43.650
And it took much less time.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:47.257
So within four years, they had
been rebuilt and relaunched.

01:00:47.257 --> 01:00:48.340
And they're still running.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.423
And they're still running.

01:00:49.423 --> 01:00:50.950
So we launched in 2000.

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:51.790
And what are we now?

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.243
2019.

01:00:53.243 --> 01:00:54.910
The ones that are in
space now are still

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:55.660
operating successfully.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.035
Wow, because this
blew up in '96.

01:00:57.035 --> 01:00:57.550
'96.

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.140
So they really did turn
around quite quick.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:00:59.360
Yeah.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:00:59.840
That's amazing.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.340
Yeah.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.913
And so we actually-- we were
chatting to a friend of yours.

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:03.830
And we didn't realise.

01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.020
This was literally last night.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:05.800
We were chatting to a friend.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.020
And she was like, oh, I was
watching the live stream,

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:11.360
because my PhD was
going to be on Cluster.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.090
And so she was a
first-year PhD student

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.680
watching the live stream.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.210
And we were like, what happened?

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.780
And she was like,
the room was silent.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.780
And then everybody left.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.160
Wow.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.006
And she was like, well,
different PhD, I guess.

01:01:26.006 --> 01:01:28.080
And so where do these live now?

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.600
So these live in my department.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.520
We have some on display,
because as I said,

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.990
we built four instruments.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:37.590
So we've got quite a lot
of this mangled hardware.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:39.300
And we, yeah, we keep them out.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.540
We talk to people about the
mission, talk about what we did

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.070
successfully to launch again.

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.020
And I think it just
serves as a reminder

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.300
that it doesn't always work.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.940
No.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:54.660
OK, so we'll wheel these off
before I actually touch them.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.075
They're broken already.

01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:56.700
They're broken.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.200
That's OK.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.344
Round of applause for
Professor Lucy Green.

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:02.732
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.100
It's all right.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.770
People spend so long
working on a spacecraft.

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.780
Like, a mission is
decades to get it to work.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:15.290
And they have some of them out
in the coffee room at the lab,

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:17.270
just like in the glass
case, so a reminder

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:19.340
for the next generation
of space scientists

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.340
that your decades of
work may disappear

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:25.820
in a fraction of a second
and land in a swamp.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.910
And what happened
with that was, there

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:35.000
was one sensor in the navigation
part of the Ariane 5 rocket

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.420
which-- well, so this
part of the rocket

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.700
took input from several sensors.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.250
It took the raw data coming
in from those sensors,

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:46.280
converted it into meaningful
navigation information,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.380
and then sent that to
the main processor that

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:51.500
was kind of driving the
rocket, if you will.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.360
And when the numbers
were coming in,

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.790
they had to work out how
big they were going to be,

01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:59.030
because you have to allocate
a certain amount of memory.

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:03.530
And they tended to allocate
just 16 bits, 16 ones and zeros,

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.030
for a value coming in.

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:06.540
But some of them
might be bigger.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.540
They could be up to 64.

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.588
And so what they did, because
they could have just written

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.130
something in the
programme which was,

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:17.000
for every input that comes in,
check how big it is before you

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.680
try and send it into the memory.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.590
But that's quite
processor intensive.

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:24.050
And they had quite strict
limitations on how much power

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.280
they were allowed to use.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.620
And so instead of checking
every single sensor,

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.660
they looked for all
the sensors which

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.770
could give a number bigger
than 16 binary digits.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:37.280
And they would check those
to avoid any problems.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.500
And the ones that never
could be that big,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.690
they didn't bother checking.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.190
And they could save
some processing.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:46.760
And that all worked really,
really well on the Ariane 4.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.940
They then copied
it to the Ariane 5

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.740
without double checking.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.010
And because of a different
take-off trajectory

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:55.850
and because of the way
the sensors worked,

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:57.440
one of the sensors
that previously

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.500
wasn't being checked, well,
continued to not be checked,

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.240
but now should
have been checked.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.220
And it actually
didn't have to be on.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.590
They just left it
on after launch.

01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:10.640
It was a prelaunch sensor,
because if there was ever a go

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.010
to launch, and then they
aborted before takeoff,

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.258
and then they reset, it
took forever to reset.

01:04:15.258 --> 01:04:17.050
So they didn't turn
them off straight away.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.700
They let them run for a while
and then turned them off

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.950
once they were sure it
was definitely safe.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.430
However, it continued
to run as it took off.

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:26.990
It got a value that was too big.

01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.030
It didn't fit in the
memory it put it in.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:31.310
It rolled over to the
memory next to it.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.690
And the whole thing crashed,
which, in and of itself,

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:39.230
wouldn't have been the worst
thing, because it could have

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.570
restarted or something,
except it was designed

01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.400
to give a crash report.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.040
So like the stereotypical,
someone's like, ah,

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.410
tell my spouse I love
them, but this is like,

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:52.220
ah, tell my debugger the
following crash context

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.570
information.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:57.770
And so it sent the debug
message up the same link

01:04:57.770 --> 01:05:00.650
to the main processor, which
didn't know that could happen.

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.402
It thought it was
navigation data,

01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:04.610
thought the rocket had
suddenly gone off to one side,

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.280
tried to correct, except it
hadn't gone off to one side.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.310
And the correction threw
it off to one side.

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:11.300
It tore it apart.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.980
The self-destruct
sequence kicked in.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.070
And because a
64-digit number was

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:19.370
tried to put in
a 16-digit space,

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.920
this whole rocket exploded.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.830
And possibly-- because the
spacecraft weren't insured,

01:05:24.830 --> 01:05:25.970
which is amazing--

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.450
however, ESA did decide
to refund it, right?

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:32.970
So one slight maths error can
have phenomenal implications.

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:36.840
And that is pretty
much it from me.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.455
I guess, in conclusion, I
started with the theory of,

01:05:39.455 --> 01:05:41.150
are mistakes important?

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:43.730
And in some cases, yes.

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:45.333
We have to get the maths right.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.000
I mean, we'll get it
wrong occasionally.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.890
But we have to get
it right in a lot

01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:50.150
of these critical situations.

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:53.360
And that means we need
people who are good at maths

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.540
and are prepared to put the
effort in, because with maths,

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.270
we can do more than our brains
were originally built to do,

01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.770
right?

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.480
We can go beyond our intuition,
which I think is incredible.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.253
But ironically, to get
mathematicians and people who

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.670
are prepared to put the effort
in, and work hard, and more

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:09.045
importantly, come
up with systems

01:06:09.045 --> 01:06:11.300
that accept that humans
will make mistakes,

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.400
and we can use our
same mathematical logic

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.440
to have robust
systems where mistakes

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.450
don't become disasters--

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.040
to have all of
that, we need people

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.990
who weren't afraid to make
mistakes to learn mathematics,

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.490
right?

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.830
So I guess the other
goal of my book,

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:27.230
as well as showing people
all the incredible critical

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.930
mathematics that underpins
our modern society,

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:32.300
I also wanted to encourage
people to have a go.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:36.170
Maths is difficult. But
the people who enjoy maths

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:37.910
are not the people
who find it easy.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:40.250
They're the people who
enjoy how difficult it is.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.240
It's hard work.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.260
You get it wrong.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.555
But gradually, it will teach
your brain how to think.

01:06:44.555 --> 01:06:46.430
And gradually, you will
get better and better

01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:47.780
at mathematics.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:51.170
So I will be around
physically here signing books

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:52.695
if you want to get
one afterwards.

01:06:52.695 --> 01:06:54.320
This video will end
up on the internet.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.903
If you're watching
it on the internet,

01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:57.470
you can order it from--

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.210
that is not a
mistake in the URL.

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.870
It only works if you put
the dot in the wrong spot,

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:06.290
because I think I am hilarious.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.010
Actually, Penguin
were like, but it

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:10.440
doesn't work if you put the--

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.640
and umble-pi.com doesn't work.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.948
And I'm like, yeah, people
have to earn the book.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.490
And they're like, we don't think
you've understood marketing,

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:18.600
Matt.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.500
So I will also be around
signing books and calculators.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.910
At this point,
though, I am done.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:25.410
Thank you so much
for your patience.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:26.600
Thank you so much
for making that work.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.500
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.050
Bye-bye.
