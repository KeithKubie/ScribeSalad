NICOLAI MUNK PETERSEN:
Unity is a game engine that

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.620
works on multiple platforms.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.590
Unity is a great way to build
both 2D and 3D experiences,

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.410
and we have created
a Unity package

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.990
for Project Tango and Android.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.630
My name is Nicolai,
and in this video,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.430
I'll show you how
hard-- well, actually,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.170
how easy it is to integrate
motion tracking in Unity.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.880
Project Tango packages
a set of new computer

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.710
vision-enabled features
for mobile devices.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.430
It takes the sensor readings
from multiple sensors

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.550
and fuses them
together on the fly.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.270
Based on that
description, you might

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.790
think that it's going to be
a lot of work to integrate.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.370
If you are new to Unity,
check out the developer videos

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.490
and download the Unity
development environment.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.421
It's pretty big, so you
might want to do that now.

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:57.410
To use this new package you need
Unity, the Project Tango SDK,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.090
and a Project Tango
enabled device.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.370
Let's get started.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.150
Hi, [? Jared ?].

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.679
Do you mind helping us out?

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:05.720
[? JARED: Hi, ?] Nicolai.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.440
Of course.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.620
Let's do this.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.910
To save some time, let's
start with a project

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.750
that I've already
built in Unity.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.870
This project does not
use Project Tango,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.820
and we will add
motion tracking to it.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.070
Currently, I can use
the keyboard and mouse

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.000
to move the camera
around, and I want

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.710
to change that to
use Project Tango.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.860
To work with Unity
and Project Tango,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.830
you need the most
up-to-date Unity package

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.520
from the developer website.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.520
If you don't already have
that, go ahead and get it now.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.470
With Unity set up
and updated, I'm

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.630
going to import the
latest Unity package

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.970
right into my project now.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.870
Now that the Project Tango
SDK is part of my project,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.460
I need to place the
Tango Manager prefab.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.530
You'll find this prefab,
along with other Project Tango

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.514
prefabs, in the
Tango Prefabs folder

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:01.680
at the root of your project.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.960
Let's place it.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.810
In the Tango Manager
prefab, you're

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.230
going to choose how to use
Project Tango in your scene.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.180
I want to use motion
tracking, so I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.180
need to check Enable
Motion Tracking.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.960
You can enable
other options here

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.830
for using other parts of Project
Tango, such as Enable Depth,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.550
for depth sensing,
and the UX library,

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.640
for displaying the
initial connection.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000
You can check out the
documentation linked at the end

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.120
to learn more.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.420
OK, that's it for configuring.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.870
Now, let's replace the
current camera with one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.470
controlled by Project Tango.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.800
We will use the Tango
Delta Camera prefab.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.100
I'll place that
prefab in my scene

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.290
at the same position
as the existing camera.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.770
And then I have to disable
the existing camera.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.230
This camera is
called a Delta camera

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.150
because it calculates the
change of position and rotation

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.770
for the device.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.480
The camera follows the motion
of the device precisely,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.010
but, of course, we don't want
anyone walking through walls.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.990
So, it uses the Unity
character controller

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.980
to keep everybody safe.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.460
And as an added
benefit, this makes

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.430
it easy to replace cameras in
existing games with the Delta

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.940
camera.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.790
Of course, your own
game may not fit

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.630
into the default shoebox,
which is why you can customize

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.360
the Tango Delta camera.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.520
For example, it is
straightforward to change

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.160
the camera view to a top-down,
or third person view.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.730
Select the multi-camera child,
and change the mode here

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.180
to third person, or top-down.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.860
But let's stick with
first person for now.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.490
By default, this prefab
shows a motion trail.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.840
I can hide the trail
of where I've been

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.970
by disabling this trail child.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.780
Actually, I'm going
to do that right now.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.720
It's a cleaner look.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.360
Finally, let's get this
running on my tablet.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.050
In order to build and run
this project on my tablet,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.555
I have to build it on Android.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:17.529
So I go to the Build settings.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.829
I'm already set up for Android.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.945
So now I'll build and
run it on my device.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.190
It's all done.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.080
Let's try it out.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.264
Pretty awesome.

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:43.180
NICOLAI MUNK PETERSEN:
Thank you, [? Jared. ?]

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.320
As you can see, it's
pretty straightforward

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.650
to integrate motion tracking
with your experience

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.220
to control the
camera perspective.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.810
In addition to
controlling the camera,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.750
you can use motion tracking to
directly control your avatars.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.700
Watch the user experience
videos to learn

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.250
how to take full advantage
of motion tracking,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.700
avoid the pitfalls, and
create stunning motion

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.780
enabled experiences.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.910
And don't forget to visit our
Google+ community and join us

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.010
on our journey.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.686
We are excited to see what you
will build a Project Tango.

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:17.520
