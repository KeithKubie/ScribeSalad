[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.990
<v 1>joining me today is the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University,</v>

3
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:09.760
the author of not a daycare,

4
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:13.690
the devastating consequences of abandoning truth and a staunch defender of

5
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:17.800
intellectual freedom on campus.
Dr Every Piper,
welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.960
I'll thank you for having me.
I'm honored to join you today.

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm glad to have you because you are writing about and talking about and living

8
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.610
many of the ideas that obviously I focus on here.

9
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.210
Before we get to any of that though,
your other book,
your first book,

10
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.940
I want to get the title exactly right cause it's just perfect.

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.110
The title is why I'm a liberal and other conservative ideas.

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.680
One of the things that I've been saying lately is that defending my liberal

13
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:46.681
principles is becoming a conservative position and I think that probably sort of

14
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:50.860
puts us in a similar spot.
W what is liberalism mean to you?
Why?

15
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:52.810
Why do you consider yourself a liberal?

16
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.410
<v 0>Well,
I would argue that what you're doing right now,</v>

17
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:59.460
his is the historic definition of classical liberalism.

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.390
Let's go back to the founding of the Liberal Arts Institution.

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.240
Let's just say Oxford 1000 years ago.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.200
Why was a liberal Arts Academy established?

21
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:14.040
It was to educate a free man or free woman,
a free culture,
a free church,

22
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.910
a free people.

23
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.770
It was an education in liberty and education and freedom.

24
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:24.771
So the classical definition of a liberal was somebody who argued for and

25
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:30.060
defended human liberty.
And it was in the context of that education,

26
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.070
a liberal arts education that Chesterton told us some 100 years ago that without

27
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.480
fences you don't have freedom enough without honoring the big laws,

28
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:40.660
you don't have liberty.

29
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:45.661
So it's this tension within the Liberal Arts Academy of pursuing truth with a

30
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.160
capital t that actually has the paradox of releasing you for the greatest

31
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:54.450
measure of human liberty,
human freedom in the course of human history.

32
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.100
So a classical liberal liberal as somebody who understands the conservation,

33
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.340
you're a conservationist,

34
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.600
you're conserving those time tested trues that actually work to provide human

35
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
liberty.

36
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
<v 1>So you ended on the word work there.
What,</v>

37
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.270
what happened to liberalism?
I mean if you look at it,

38
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:16.720
if especially through an American context today,

39
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.580
the people that call themselves liberals,

40
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.940
and I'm not really talking about the classical liberals anymore who have far

41
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.100
more in common,
we say Libertarians.

42
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:26.800
Then progressive's what happened to liberalism?

43
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.390
Because I believe as I think you do,

44
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.560
this is the right set of ideas that the ideas that I'm constantly talking about

45
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
about the individual and laissez faire economics and limited government or the

46
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:38.230
light touch of government.

47
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:41.710
I think these are really the right ideas to move a free society forward,

48
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.760
and yet what modern liberalism is has almost nothing to do with that.

49
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.970
<v 0>Let's go back to Richard Weaver in 1948 why did he write his seminal work?</v>

50
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.710
Ideas have consequences.

51
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.490
We hardly even need to crack the cover to understand what he's saying.

52
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.460
Ideas have consequences.
They matter.
Good ideas,
good culture,
good kids,

53
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.700
good community,
good country,
good fruit,
good ideas,

54
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.760
bear good fruit and bad ideas have the opposite effect.
Now,

55
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.520
why is 1948 critical in this analogy?

56
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.840
In my answer to you is because weaver was writing to his culture a handful of

57
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.260
years after what the Nazi Holocaust and he was saying,

58
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.580
we should've seen this coming.

59
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.820
We imbibed terrible ideas for decades and we bore the consequences they're in.

60
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.000
So we need to attend to the ideas that have been tested by time,

61
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.100
defended by reason,
proven by experience.

62
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.700
And I would argue as a Christian given by revelation,

63
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.650
it's those permanent ideas.

64
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.651
It's the conservation of those ideas that are big rather than dumbing down the

65
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:44.920
conversation to the million ideas that are small.
Again,

66
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:48.280
Chesterton get rid of the big laws and you don't get liberty.

67
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.660
You rather get thousands and thousands of little laws that rush in to fill the

68
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.570
vacuum.
And if him,
if that isn't the definition of our culture today,

69
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.190
I don't know what is.
Yes,

70
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.810
we are overregulated and everyone thinks that there's just another answer that

71
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.450
lies in a law somewhere.
And usually it does.

72
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.800
And so then what do you consider yourself a conservative now then?

73
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.040
Or do these labels even matter to you that much?
Well,

74
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.190
I would say a conservative as somebody who conserves,
okay.

75
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.580
I believe in conserving and I own a tree and clean water and clean air.

76
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.240
But I also believe in conserving something,
perhaps even more important.

77
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:26.680
And that's ideas,
ideas that work.
Uh,
the Wesleyan quadrilateral,

78
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.450
and it's actually actually Augustinian too.

79
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.930
But let's go back to John and Charles Wesley other misses out 17 hundreds.

80
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.650
They had something they called the quad,
the quadrilateral,

81
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.380
and it was a worldview.

82
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.390
It was the four things that you should sift any idea through as you evaluated

83
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.390
some veracity,
tradition,
reason,

84
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.290
experience,
and scripture.
Revelation,
if you will,

85
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.510
if you want to get outside of the bounds of a Christian Wang,

86
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.400
which we'll call it revelation,
natural law.
Common Sense.
All right,

87
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:02.020
so tradition,
history,
grandma and grandpa might have actually known something.

88
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:06.490
The old ideas as cs Lewis said,
are often better than the new ideas.

89
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.800
If you want to read a new book,
fine,
go ahead.
Said Louis.

90
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.880
But you might want to consider reading,
oh,
a dozen or so old ones first.

91
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.700
Why you mean grandma?
Grandpa weren't automatically backwards.

92
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.820
They weren't automatically stupid.
In fact,

93
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.010
and I use that obviously as an analogy,

94
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.910
the old ideas that have been around for a while may be there,

95
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:25.900
but not necessarily,

96
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:30.160
but they may be there because they've proven themselves over time.
So history,

97
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:34.290
tradition,
experience,
it's the Dr Phil Question.
How's that one working for you?

98
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.830
We should always respond to ourselves as we're evaluating our own ideas and our

99
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.040
own worldview as well as our adversary,
or even those that agree with us and say,

100
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.060
how is it working for us?
Is there a pragmatic value to this?

101
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.680
Does it work over time for social health,
personal health,
physical health,

102
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:54.310
whatever?
Does it work?
So tradition and experience,
reason you've got a brain,

103
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:57.560
use it.
The rationality,
facts,
feeling.

104
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.400
We're in a culture right now that's dumb down everything to feelings rather than

105
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.700
facts.
Facts be damned.
Yeah,
we're not pro science any longer.

106
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.840
We ignore science for the sake of a political popular agenda.

107
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.510
We're gonna to find to plenty of that.
And then finally,

108
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.920
the fourth component of the quad,
the quadrilateral is revelation.

109
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.350
Those things that are true and it doesn't have to be tested in to,
for example,

110
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.460
uh,
the empiricists,
the materialist would say if he can't taste it,
touch it,

111
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.200
feel it,
see it.
It just isn't.
So,

112
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:30.110
and I would disagree with that and I can prove it just by asking a simple

113
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.080
question.
Do you believe that rape is wrong?

114
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.990
Do you believe the Holocaust was a bad thing?

115
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.040
Was antebellum slavery something that should have been reviled?

116
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.880
And the answer we all hold if we're decent human beings is yes,

117
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.730
all of those are objectively wrong.
Well,

118
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:48.680
how do we know you can't put it in a test tube?

119
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.490
We know because it's a revelation of the apostle Paul,

120
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.430
one of the greatest philosophers in human history,
I would argue,

121
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.700
suggested in Romans that this is the truth of God laid on every human heart.

122
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.490
Others have argued the Catholic Church and whatnot,
that it's natural law,

123
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.030
common sense,
the revelation that causes both of us to agree,

124
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.500
both of us to agree it's slavery is a bad thing.
No,
it's not open for debate.

125
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.860
We don't have to test it in a tube.
We know slavery should be reviled.

126
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.060
<v 1>All right?
There's a lot there.
That's a,</v>

127
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.220
that's bouncing around some of the ideas that I talk about here.

128
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.090
So basically without that,
that bedrock,
let's,
we'll do these backwards.

129
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:28.990
So we'll start with the fourth without that bedrock that everything then would

130
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.100
be left to some sort of subjective nature,
right?
That that's the crux of that.

131
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.380
<v 0>Well,
so [inaudible] digresses to power.
Yeah.</v>

132
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.960
If you don't have a principal and enduring permanent,
immutable principal,

133
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.560
it all digresses to power and we see that it's proven in human history.

134
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.250
I'm fond of telling my students at Oklahoma Wesleyan University,
in fact,

135
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:52.000
I often give the commencement address in May.
It's often very short.

136
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.000
I'd give them a gift.
It's a guaranteed standing ovation,
by the way,

137
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:59.320
to tell everybody before the speech starts that this'll be five minutes Max,

138
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.310
a five minute commenced by all.
Yes,
yes.
Go.
Now they're listened to me.

139
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:05.770
They want to celebrate,
but what I tell them often,

140
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:08.380
and it's a repeat almost every year today,

141
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.230
I'm not going to celebrate your opinion.
In fact today,

142
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:15.010
I don't care what your opinion is and you shouldn't care about my opinion.

143
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.800
I'm not going to patch on the back.
When you cry,

144
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.110
when you walk across the stage and approach me and you're funny,

145
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:21.760
cap and gown and me standing there in mind,

146
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.430
I'm not going to hand you a diploma and say,
congratulations.

147
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.460
You've got a degree in opinions.
That's absurd.

148
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.560
I hope you paid $35,000 a year to learn something.
That's right.

149
00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:34.510
And Justin real and true.
True.

150
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.710
Something closer to the truth of your discipline than what you knew,
knew,

151
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.370
knew when you came in as an 18 year old four years ago,
and the proof to that,

152
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.670
you know,
some people may say,
well,
that's just your opinion on education.

153
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.870
Good for you.
Well,
I'll say this,
opinions always enslave,

154
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.880
but truth sets you free.
Pol Pot had an opinion.
Mao had an opinion,

155
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.820
ropes here and Chavez and Hitler and Mussolini,

156
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:01.170
all the despots of history had opinions and it didn't end well for millions of

157
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:03.840
people,
but Christ said,

158
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:06.450
you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.

159
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.430
There's power in the immutable,

160
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:13.431
unchangeable truths that set us free and there's always bondage in the opinion.

161
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.580
<v 1>So what do you make then of sort of what I would say are the well intended</v>

162
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.600
progressive's and I'm not,
I think there are some people without good intentions,

163
00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:23.530
maybe at the top of that,

164
00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:26.830
but I think the average young person that you're probably encountering as a

165
00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:31.030
freshman,
uh,
that has been sort of indoctrinated with these ideas

166
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.833
<v 0>that</v>

167
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.800
<v 1>follows through with them.
Like what,
what are the ways that you've been able to,</v>

168
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:40.450
to sort of wake them up to why this is wrong?
Why,

169
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:45.360
why opinion based learning is wrong,
why they're actually are facts,

170
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.660
why,
why that matters?

171
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.020
<v 0>Well,</v>

172
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.130
I find the progressive mind and the progressive agenda is so easy to knock down

173
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.200
by a rhetorical question.
In fact,
uh,
again,

174
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.810
obviously in this interview thus far I've showed my cards.

175
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.310
I'm a committed Christian.
Yeah.
I believe the words of Christ make a difference.

176
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.350
In fact,
George McDonald wants say,

177
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:09.700
and my sister once said in my attempt to obey the words recorded as his,

178
00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:13.750
I have found grandeur beyond the realm of any human invention and therefore I

179
00:10:13.751 --> 00:10:17.410
cast my lot with those of the crucified.
That's good stuff.

180
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.570
So what do I do?
Well,

181
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.380
what if I believe that this guy named Jesus was actually who he claimed to be?

182
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.910
I'd have to kind of conclude that he's probably the smartest guy that ever

183
00:10:27.911 --> 00:10:31.630
walked the face of the earth.
He knew the answer,
he knew how to win the debate.

184
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.470
But often this guy that millions,

185
00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:39.670
if not billions of people have claimed to be God incarnate that walked among us,

186
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.440
didn't engage in an argument.

187
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.170
I mean you read the story of Christ and he almost never argued with his
opponent.

188
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.860
He could have won the debate.
He knew how he could have crushed them.

189
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.100
I would conclude but he never argued.
What did he do?

190
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.940
He asked a simple question,
which one of you wants to throw the first stone?

191
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.640
Why do you call me Lord?
Whose faces on this coin?

192
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:09.220
And then he shuts up and he lets the worldview of his adversary implode as they

193
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.670
dropped their stones and they walk away.
So what do you do with the post modern?

194
00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.520
The progressive question from a 20 year old,
well,

195
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:20.380
can you tolerate my intolerance?
Do you hate hateful people?

196
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.590
Are you sure that nothing is?
Sure.

197
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.390
Do you know that nothing can be known and are you absolutely confident there are

198
00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.820
no absolutes and then just shut up and listen.

199
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.610
They don't have an answer.

200
00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:38.170
They saw off the branch upon which they sit and it comes tumbling down and it's

201
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:42.340
at that point I think you can rebuild the argument with some common sense rather

202
00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:47.341
than this nihilism and nonsense literal nonsense because it makes no sense for

203
00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:49.690
you or me to look and adversary in the eye and say,

204
00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:50.950
I can't tolerate your intolerance.

205
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:53.320
It makes you the very thing that you find intolerable.

206
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.023
<v 1>It's self shooting.</v>

207
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.630
I feel like you're a sort of like a college administrator from the future.

208
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:00.010
This is sort of like the terminator.

209
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.650
You've come back to warn us about what's going on,

210
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.500
what's going to happen in the future here.
So let's,
let's back up a little bit,

211
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:08.970
just tell me a little bit more about how you got interested in these ideas.
Were,

212
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.550
were you always sort of political?
Did,

213
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.170
did freedom and liberty and ideas always matter to you?

214
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:15.370
Was that something you were taught?

215
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:16.363
<v 0>Oh,</v>

216
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.250
well you can now you've asked a question that could take way too long to answer.

217
00:12:19.251 --> 00:12:23.060
So let me try to discipline myself to be brief.
I was a blue collar kid.

218
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.360
My mom and dad didn't graduate from high school.
My Dad was a truck driver.

219
00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:30.950
My mom was a nurse's aide and a stay at home mom,
odd jobs here and there.
Uh,

220
00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:35.490
we were lower middle class where it was paid to paycheck to paycheck.
Uh,

221
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.250
when I graduated from high school,

222
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.880
I went to work in an apple orchard with some migrant workers and I also worked

223
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:44.410
in a local factory.
I did two jobs and uh,

224
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.130
working third shift lunch,
which,
what time is third shift for a,

225
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.470
I think that's three o'clock in the morning or something.
Like that.
Uh,

226
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:55.310
I sat down for lunch one night and this gentleman who was working two jobs,

227
00:12:55.311 --> 00:12:57.710
he was a private business owner.
He had a flower shop,

228
00:12:57.711 --> 00:12:59.960
so he was working the factory to help make payroll.
Wow.

229
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.670
But he had a master's degree in international politics or affairs or something

230
00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:06.140
like that.
Esoteric degree.

231
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.770
And he looked at me over the picnic table and the factor and he said,

232
00:13:09.771 --> 00:13:12.590
why are you here?
And I said,
to make money like you,
and he still,

233
00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:13.580
why don't you go to college?

234
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.440
So I washed off the grease and I got in my expensive factory rat car that I

235
00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:20.060
could afford as an 18 year old kid.

236
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.920
And I drove up the road a half hour and enrolled at a a Christian Liberal Arts

237
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:27.770
college that,
uh,
I was aware of.
And the rest is history.

238
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.210
Those doors opened up for me to be able to do things like,

239
00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:36.950
be on this show and challenge one another with some reasonable debate and good

240
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.080
thinking.
Those doors.
Oh.

241
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.880
But opened up because of a classical liberal education,
not a progressive one,

242
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.020
not a left,
just one,

243
00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:49.940
but a classical liberal education that liberated me to move into various

244
00:13:49.941 --> 00:13:52.580
different venues of life that I never would have met,
able to do otherwise.

245
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.860
<v 1>So as it stands now,</v>

246
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:59.861
are you kind of shocked at the state of what's going on with young people at

247
00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:03.550
colleges?
I mean,
the whole,
the whole purpose of your book,
right?

248
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.960
That it's become daycare sort of,

249
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.230
or some basic training session for students or things that they should have

250
00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:15.320
learned a long time before that.
Not that you should know everything today.

251
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:17.600
You walk into college because of course you're supposed to learn,

252
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.190
but that they've missed a series of extremely important ideas before they've

253
00:14:22.191 --> 00:14:25.670
even got there.
He is that,
was that when you first realized that was happening?
A,

254
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:27.590
when was that?
And B,
were you shocked?

255
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.580
<v 0>No,
I'm not shocked because I've been seeing it coming for decades.
And you're,</v>

256
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.240
you're,
you're accused of being an alarmist.
When you warn people of these things,

257
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.600
I'll,
that'll never happen.
Well,
where are we right now?

258
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.310
<v 1>So when did you first see sentences?</v>

259
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.680
<v 0>I've been a college president for 16 years.
I would say about the time,</v>

260
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.820
maybe 20 years ago when I was a vice president and various different,
uh,

261
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.650
various different segments within the academy.

262
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:54.620
I could see the shutting down before closed mind.
The,
uh,

263
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.760
unwillingness to entertain anything that might challenge you and move you out of

264
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:01.400
your comfort zone.
Which way was it coming from?
Where's it coming from?

265
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.150
The students?
Or was it coming from faculty or was it coming from administration?

266
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:08.180
Was it coming in every direction?
And I think it's a,
I think it comes,

267
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:10.370
we've created our own monster.
In fact,

268
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.860
when I originally confronted this daycare thing,
um,
it's interesting,
um,

269
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.660
if I may set the context for the daycare story,
is that fair segue?

270
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.570
Let's do it.
Um,
I like the guest that sets up their own segues.
Nice.

271
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.350
Okay.
So what's the daycare thing about?
So at Oklahoma Wesleyan University,

272
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:32.930
we still have required chapel every Wednesday and Friday.

273
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:36.550
All the students and the faculty are in Chapel.
Uh,

274
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.700
this particular day it was,
uh,
three years ago,
thanksgiving week,

275
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.770
thanksgiving week.
So just before the break,

276
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:48.340
one of my vice presidents was the speaker in chapel and I know this particular

277
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:51.080
guy very well obviously,
and I know he always speaks from a script.

278
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.940
He never had lips,
so it's always a 1520 minute homily at best.

279
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.300
And he's done and it's from a script will after he was done,

280
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:01.580
I wasn't in chapel that day,
I was working or something.
So anyway,

281
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:03.770
he called me after he was done and he said,
hey doctor Piper,

282
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:05.000
I need you to give you a heads up.

283
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.420
I had one of our own students today play the victimization card.

284
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:13.010
He came up to me after I was done with my chapel talk and he pointed his finger

285
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:14.750
in my chest and he said,
you offended me,

286
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.400
you singled me out and you single my peers out and I'll like it.

287
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.170
And I said to Kyle,
the VP that was calling me to give me this warning.
I said,

288
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:28.010
well,
what was your talk about?
I was wondering it,
was it political?

289
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:30.560
Was there sarcasm?
What was going on?
He said,
you won't believe this.

290
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:34.280
First Corinthians 13 now for those that don't remember,

291
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:37.460
first Corinthians 13 is the quintessential love chapter of the Bible.

292
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.840
Love is patient.
Love is kind.

293
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.760
You've probably heard it read at a thousand weddings.
Okay,
so I said what?

294
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.940
He said,
yeah,
I know I spoke on love today.
I'm a monster.

295
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.350
And we had one of our students that was offended by it and I said,

296
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:53.240
send me a copy of your speech.
Again,

297
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:57.470
knowing that he talks from a script or speaks from his grip and doesn't add Lib

298
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.620
I the new,
if I read it,
I'd find if there was anything offensive in it.

299
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.210
Did he throw in a joke?
Was there some off putting humor or sarcasm?

300
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.040
I read it.
Nothing.

301
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.750
First Corinthians 13 love is patient love is kind of 15 minute.

302
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.250
I'm only on love and I've got one of my kids offended by it.

303
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.930
So I wrote this article.

304
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:20.870
I've been writing for the local newspaper for the last 15 years or so,

305
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:23.510
and usually when I write for the Bartlesville examiner enterprise,

306
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:27.580
five people read it through people care on this week.
I wrote a little different.

307
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.580
This one on this one,

308
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:32.540
I was a little frustrated so I popped off my op Ed and I basically said young

309
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:36.050
man,
that feeling of discomfort you had when you heard that sermon,

310
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:39.740
it's called your conscience and you might want to attend to it.

311
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.730
And if you came here expecting us to coddle you rather than confront you,

312
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.390
if you think we're going to comfort you rather than challenge your character,

313
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.100
you're in the wrong place.

314
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.820
And then I went on for another 700 words or so and I concluded by saying my
land,

315
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:57.930
this is a university,
it's not a daycare.
We expect you to grow up.

316
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.190
And that article,
by the end of a week we can and a half,
three,

317
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:03.980
I had three and a half a million hits.
Yeah,

318
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.720
we're going to link to the article down below cause people,

319
00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.080
people should read it.
Yeah,
no.

320
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.800
Here's the point and I don't know if I'm off task and I'll shut up and let show

321
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:15.300
you're doing your own segway.
[inaudible] I'm with you.
But here's the point.

322
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:18.120
When I wrote that three and a half million people paid attention to it.

323
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:18.690
By the way,

324
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.690
NBC today cited it as one of the top 10 news stories of 2015 it went nuts.

325
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.890
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
Oxford,
England,
uh,

326
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.520
drudge and Dreher and Limbaugh and Beck and conservatives and liberals and

327
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:34.110
procrastinates all covered it.

328
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.930
But college president that called out his students and said,

329
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:40.380
this is not a daycare.
Grow Up.
Why is this important?

330
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.350
What Graeme,
what Grandpa or dad or mom has hasn't said that to their kids.

331
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.770
I mean,
this was not rocket science.
This was not high scholarship.

332
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.290
I basically said what everybody was thinking.

333
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.590
So why did three and a half million care,
three and a half million people care?

334
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.453
Well,
here's,

335
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.490
we did a statistical analysis analysis internally out of the all the comments on

336
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.560
those three and a half million views.
What,

337
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.750
how many were positive and how many were negative?
97% were positive.

338
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.440
And this was on the Internet?
Yes.
Yeah.

339
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:20.040
97% were positive in 3% were negative.
The poster child for the positive.

340
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.500
Um,
the atheist from a very well known university in Florida.

341
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.920
Fulbright scholar writes me a letter and said,
Piper,

342
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.590
I read you're not a daycare thing,
period.

343
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.180
I went to your website to figure out who you are,
period.
As an atheist,

344
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:40.110
I can easily dismiss your religion and your politics and I do,

345
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.660
period.
But on this issue,
thank you.
Kudos.
It needed to be said,
please carry on.

346
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.470
That guy knew he,
that we had created a monster.
It was our fault.

347
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.480
Our industry's fault.
The Academy,

348
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:55.890
the ivory tower has created this mess and he understood it and the monsters

349
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:58.560
turning around to consume him and he knows it.

350
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.240
You know who the poster child of the negative was?
The church.
Wow.

351
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.410
The church.
I'll show you.
Offended the poor kid.

352
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.790
You hurt his feelings.
So what,
what was the offense taken though?
Specifically?

353
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.720
You tell me.
He felt so uncomfortable.
Right?
But he never addressed that.

354
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:18.600
A specific,
no way.
He felt uncomfortable.

355
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:23.220
He felt that sermon was directed toward him.
Well,

356
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:24.480
maybe it was,

357
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.080
there was a time that where the church was supposed to confront those things

358
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:32.100
that are selfish and narcissistic and the self focus was supposed to be

359
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:36.090
corrected by selflessness and confession.
I actually said in my article,

360
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.330
I'm not going to start issuing trigger warnings before altar calls.

361
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.850
A good sermon is supposed to wake you up.

362
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.660
A good sermon is supposed to perhaps instill some guilt.

363
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.830
So he was offended because he felt guilty for not showing enough love.

364
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.490
<v 1>So,
all right,
there's a lot there.
So let's,</v>

365
00:20:52.491 --> 00:20:56.360
let's talk about first this atheist professor in Florida for a moment.

366
00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.520
What do you make of someone that can take a principled stand like that,

367
00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:04.520
that in your view of the way they look at the world,

368
00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:06.590
is missing sort of a critical piece,

369
00:21:06.591 --> 00:21:10.700
or let's say one of those four quadrants that you discussed before.

370
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.580
What do you make of someone like that?
I assume,
uh,

371
00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.740
and I've had a lot of discussions like this on a micro level.

372
00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:18.440
You probably think he's,
I don't want to lead you too much here,

373
00:21:18.441 --> 00:21:21.740
but you probably think he's a perfectly decent person who may be living a very

374
00:21:21.741 --> 00:21:26.630
moral good life,
but at a macro level you see more of a societal problem.
Is that,

375
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.520
is that a Ferris?

376
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.440
<v 0>Well,
I think ideas have consequences again,</v>

377
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.540
and I would in no way suggest to people that disagree with my religion are all

378
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:35.980
immoral people.
I mean,

379
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.030
it doesn't take five minutes of research to prove to the contrary.
In fact,
um,

380
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.550
um,
these,
uh,

381
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:50.790
folks that agreed with me in my article that when I say this atheist from the

382
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.120
University of x,
Y,Z ,
Florida agreed with me and was the poster child of that.

383
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.500
It's interesting.

384
00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.010
Many within the secular community rather than the sacred community.

385
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:01.660
If you want to draw that distinction.

386
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.400
We're all about this message in my speaking until they figured out I was a

387
00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:11.080
Christian and then it kind of went cold because Canadian broadcasting,

388
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.060
I could tell when they figured out that I thought the solution was to return to

389
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:20.260
what Chesterton called big laws that would give us the maximum amount of free

390
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.240
human freedom.
Whether you're Christian or whether you're not really,

391
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:25.060
you're agnostic angle kind of atheist or Buddhist or baptist.

392
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:25.960
It doesn't make a difference.

393
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:29.320
But these ideas that Chesterton defined as the big laws,

394
00:22:29.321 --> 00:22:31.720
the simple laws and others,
likewise,

395
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:36.721
I would argue Adams and Jefferson and Washington would agree that these big laws

396
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.820
were contextualized to give everybody freedom,

397
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:42.640
not just those folks that went to church on the weekend.

398
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.820
And I would argue that history has proven that proven that true.

399
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.140
Even Martin Luther King Jr proved it in his letter from the Birmingham jail.

400
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.610
The context for the fight for freedom and justice was what?

401
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.650
The natural,
irrefutable,
common sense,
natural law of God.

402
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.020
That's what Mlk told us.

403
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.830
So we see these examples time and time again in our march for freedom.

404
00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:10.150
You can't have freedom without offense.
Said gesture ton.
In fact,
Chesterton said,

405
00:23:10.151 --> 00:23:12.790
if you want to bid,
build the biggest playground in the world.

406
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.450
This was one of his analogies.
Let's,
let's assume that this community,

407
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:18.400
this near neighborhood wants the biggest,

408
00:23:18.401 --> 00:23:21.430
the best playground in all of the United States,

409
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.610
and you spend all of the money to create the bells and the whistles and all the

410
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:28.360
toys,
and you want the kids in this community to enjoy that playground.

411
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:32.410
Chesterton said,
build a fence because if you don't,

412
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.880
what'll happen one of two things.

413
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.520
Either you'll start policing these poor kids and haranguing them and yelling at

414
00:23:39.521 --> 00:23:43.510
them and creating all these little rules to control them so that they are safe

415
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:48.500
within the playground or they'll run out into the highway and get killed.

416
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.550
So either way,

417
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:54.200
the kids will be restricted or hurt if you don't build a fence around the

418
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:57.470
playground.
It's the paradox of freedom and fences of liberty in law.

419
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.540
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean there's a lot of current analogies there with,
you know,</v>

420
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.020
obviously there's a debate in the country about having a physical wall at the

421
00:24:04.021 --> 00:24:04.920
border right now.

422
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.070
And you can make an interesting analogy to what's happening in the digital space

423
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:09.090
where we were all,

424
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.290
we all had free access to all of these platforms and then they start censoring

425
00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:15.690
different people.
And because there are no fences,

426
00:24:15.691 --> 00:24:19.080
they put imaginary fences all over the place depending on who you are.

427
00:24:19.081 --> 00:24:23.400
But you mentioned something really interesting there,
which is that he,
uh,

428
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.200
thought or that some of the people thought that your ideas were good until they

429
00:24:28.201 --> 00:24:30.900
figure out that there's a link back to religion.

430
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.700
How much of that has been a struggle for you in sort of the more secular

431
00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:38.610
academic world generally?
Maybe not at your university,

432
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.560
but when you talk to other academics who usually probably shy away from religion

433
00:24:43.561 --> 00:24:45.090
or scripture,
that sort of thing.

434
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.340
<v 0>Well,
it's always a challenge,
but I,
uh,
let's have a debate.</v>

435
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.930
Are you really a classical liberal?
Are you an open mind?
My mind did academic,

436
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.480
do you want to pursue truth or do you want to construct it?

437
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.510
Do you want to protect your opinions?
Is that more important to you?

438
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.590
Then understanding what the answer is.
At the end of the day,

439
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.420
are we going to trust a referee on the game and if we don't trust the referee,

440
00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:11.960
if we don't define the boundaries,
if we don't have some rules for the game,

441
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.260
it's chaos.
You can't play basketball without boundaries.

442
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.320
You can't play soccer without somebody blowing the whistle.

443
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.490
It's the paradox again of liberty in law.
If you're a musician,
you know this.

444
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.200
If you don't learn the rules of rhyme and rhythm and cadence,

445
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.190
you're not performing a concerto.
It's chaos and if you're an athlete,

446
00:25:31.191 --> 00:25:34.340
if you don't discipline yourself to the rigor of the sport,

447
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.820
if you don't memorize the place,
if you don't attend to the rules,

448
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.990
if you don't pay attention to the coach,
if you don't go day in and day out,

449
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:44.030
even though you may not be that good yet,

450
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.350
you will never be able to be free to actually perform in the game.

451
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.530
And that paradox is relevant.

452
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:55.280
When we're having an academic or an intellectual or a political or theological

453
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.140
or whatever discussion and debate,

454
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.380
what are the higher standards for the discussion so that we can actually be free

455
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.770
to do this.

456
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.830
<v 1>How much of this do you think boils down to what seems to be a degradation in</v>

457
00:26:10.411 --> 00:26:13.530
personal responsibility amongst young people in the last,

458
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.360
let's say 20 some odd years that there's more of an uh,
you know,

459
00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:21.870
people are spending more time say playing video games and I say this is someone

460
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:25.140
that like I tried to get you to play playstation and a half hour ago.
Uh,

461
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.400
you know that I like video games,

462
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.460
but that people are spending all sorts of time doing things that are,

463
00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:34.380
that are almost the,
the obvious success of a society that we have everything.

464
00:26:34.381 --> 00:26:36.000
We really just have everything.

465
00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.100
It doesn't mean that every individual has everything they want,

466
00:26:38.101 --> 00:26:41.160
but you have the world at your fingertips all the time with the phone in your

467
00:26:41.161 --> 00:26:44.850
pocket.
And that because of access to everything,

468
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.290
the personal responsibility part,
the part that says,
I got to go get that job.

469
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:52.590
And at three in the morning having third lunch and all of these things that that

470
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.820
has sort of just disappeared.

471
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.870
<v 0>Well,
uh,
there are a variety of,</v>

472
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.750
you could claim that the church is responsible for its own demise.

473
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.290
The schools are responsible for educating their own monster that's consuming

474
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.124
them right now.

475
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.700
You could also lay blame at the feet of parents that are helicopter parents and

476
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:12.840
they don't allow their kid to feel or sense or experience any adversity in life.

477
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.210
We're going to coddle,
we're going to come comfort.

478
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.280
We're never going to confront and build character.

479
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:19.710
We're just going to make life easy for our kids.

480
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.920
And I see that over and over again.

481
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.740
When the parents drop their kids off at my campus,

482
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:28.020
I can tell you in five minutes where the kid's going to be a problem or not

483
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.300
based on how the parent is behaving.

484
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.880
Is Mom angry because doesn't like the drapes and the dorm?

485
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:37.560
Um,

486
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.540
do they attend to every single desire that the kid has?

487
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:47.880
If the kid ever has any conflict or with a roommate,
I want,
I want it.

488
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:52.140
I want it changed now rather than forcing their son or daughter to deal with

489
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:55.410
relational conflict conflict and become a more mature human being.
As a result,

490
00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:00.060
the helicopter parenting is greatly responsible for a lot of the softness of the

491
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:04.770
soul and softness of our culture.
If um,
uh,

492
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.050
it's called the agon agony steeze the reg wrestling match,

493
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:14.100
if there's no ag on,
if there's no agonist,
if there's no wrestling match,

494
00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:16.680
if there's no agony,
that's where we get the word.

495
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.720
Then you're going to be soft as iron sharpens iron.
One man sharpens another.

496
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:26.721
There is testing by fire is as we become adults in life and if that testing

497
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:29.520
hasn't taken place,
you're not going to perform on the field.

498
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.830
You're not going to perform in the band or in the orchestra.

499
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:35.460
You're not going to perform in a variety of venues in life because you expect

500
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:36.870
everything to be comfortable.
Yeah.

501
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.890
<v 1>Or in the intellectual battle.
Yeah.
I mean,
I mean that's the point that,</v>

502
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.130
well that's why I try,
I do try to link this back to personal responsibility,

503
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.940
whether ultimately it's from helicopter parenting or a poor education system

504
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:48.710
where a series of things,
because if you've,

505
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.870
if you've seeded that personal responsibility,
then all of the offerings that,

506
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.670
that say the left offers now have free this free that take from some give to

507
00:28:58.671 --> 00:28:59.271
others.
They all,

508
00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:02.780
it all sounds really great because you've already abdicated your responsibility

509
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.943
as a human.

510
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.180
So that seems to me to be the core issue if we could just get these young people

511
00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:11.150
to wake up.
So okay,
so a kid walks in to your school,

512
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.090
moms complaining about the drapes,
the kid doesn't like his roommate,

513
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.880
whatever the other series of things are.
Um,

514
00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.300
are you actually personally involved at any point in this?

515
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.660
Or tell me just a little bit about how the structure of the university works so

516
00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:25.520
that you can get some of these ideas across.

517
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.620
<v 0>Oklahoma Wesleyan is a small institution or about 1500 total.</v>

518
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:33.970
All in that's healthy for us.
You know that's a financially healthy institution,

519
00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.550
but it's got the magic of community.

520
00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:39.640
You're not lost as a number and you actually engage with the phd.

521
00:29:39.641 --> 00:29:43.300
You don't just get an education in classroom of 800 to 2000 students.

522
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:46.540
Who are you being taught by the graduate assistant that doesn't care.

523
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.400
We've got a ratio of one to 15 one to 16 and you're actually learning from the

524
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:52.234
scholar,

525
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.570
which I would argue as good education as opposed to somehow inferior education

526
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:59.740
just because you're smaller than the big guy down the street.

527
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.170
I think we've lost the power of education as we've started worshiping this altar

528
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:09.580
of size and the behemoth and the football program and whatnot,

529
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:13.780
that somehow is better education than actually learning like this.
Come on.

530
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.720
That's ridiculous.
In fact,
if you go to Oxford now,

531
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.760
all of the various different ancient colleges are really not much bigger than

532
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.460
Oklahoma Westland.
They've just been around for a thousand years.

533
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.850
<v 1>Yeah,
there is.
It's pretty incredible.</v>

534
00:30:25.851 --> 00:30:28.070
I've been there twice in the last year I spoke there,

535
00:30:28.071 --> 00:30:30.650
which was probably the biggest honor I've ever had professionally.

536
00:30:30.651 --> 00:30:33.680
And then I went back with a Jordan Peter's in a couple months ago.
Exactly.

537
00:30:33.681 --> 00:30:36.960
And it's shocking when you see that these small colleges,
the way they say it's,

538
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.840
it's so brilliant actually,

539
00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:42.410
that they set it up with all of these small colleges in this,
in this truly,

540
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.780
I mean,
it feels magical.
It feels like a Harry Potter book,

541
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.300
this magical little place.
It's just incredible.

542
00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:47.661
<v 0>Well,</v>

543
00:30:47.661 --> 00:30:52.580
and it's good education because you're being taught by somebody who has wrestled

544
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.940
being agon for years and years and years,

545
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:58.520
and he may disagree with you vehemently,

546
00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:03.521
but that Socratic method draws the conversation to a close where if you're going

547
00:31:04.131 --> 00:31:05.420
to disagree with the scholar,

548
00:31:05.421 --> 00:31:08.600
you better know apply and you'd better be able to defend it.
Otherwise,

549
00:31:08.601 --> 00:31:12.410
he will challenge you,
tear you down,

550
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.910
and send you back to do your homework so that you can come again another day to

551
00:31:16.911 --> 00:31:21.320
carry on the battle.
That's good education.
It's not soft education,

552
00:31:21.321 --> 00:31:25.400
it's not coddling education at elevates the value of confrontation.

553
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.640
It elevates the goal of actually being a responsible human being at the end of

554
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:30.801
the day.

555
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:35.090
That actually has character more than just wanting a career in the United
States.

556
00:31:35.091 --> 00:31:38.660
We think that somehow good education is one that just gives you the ability to

557
00:31:38.661 --> 00:31:42.410
get a career.
I don't disparage that you should be able to get a good job,

558
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.940
but really is that where we are in the United States where information is more

559
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:51.200
important than ethics and money is more important than morality.

560
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.840
And getting a career is more important than character.

561
00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:58.310
There was a time not that long ago where all of those things were important in a

562
00:31:58.311 --> 00:32:01.750
liberal education because we wouldn't be free as a culture without.

563
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.780
<v 1>So what went wrong there?
W when,
when did that go wrong?</v>

564
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.910
<v 0>Well,
you could argue that it preceded weavers work in 1948.</v>

565
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.460
I would argue it goes back to duty.
Do we?

566
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.600
And the model of education that prevailed at that time where we stopped caring

567
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.150
about the,
uh,
uh,

568
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.900
the Socratic logic and the facts of education.

569
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:26.920
We started caring more about the feelings that come with education and the

570
00:32:26.921 --> 00:32:27.880
common core debate.

571
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.210
And I'll really get people stirred up with this common core as a joke.

572
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.200
Why in the world would we want to dumb down education to the common,

573
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.640
to the average?

574
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.240
Don't we believe that education should pursue what's excellent and exceptional?

575
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.880
Common core puts everything at the,
uh,
at the,
uh,

576
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:51.170
at a level,
a level table of average,
of common.

577
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.700
That's why it's called that.

578
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:57.500
It doesn't release my faculty and others to do what they know how to do best.

579
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.790
I don't need the government telling my faculty how to build a syllabus.

580
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:06.260
I just don't need that.
If I have hired a math professor that doesn't know,

581
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:08.510
two plus two is four,
there's a solution.

582
00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:13.780
I fire him and I go get somebody who knows how to come to the right conclusion.

583
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.160
I don't need someone else trying to intrude and govern that discussion.

584
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.730
And Oklahoma Wesleyan faculty has been ranked by CBS News Money Watch as having

585
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:30.731
the best faculty in the nation for three successive years by student review,

586
00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.870
by student review.

587
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.990
So why in the world with the Fed thinks they need to tell me how to structure

588
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:41.480
education.
So what's the structure?
We do it small,

589
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.780
we can engage as a faculty and as an administrative body to develop a curriculum

590
00:33:47.301 --> 00:33:51.290
that works because I hire scholars and educators that know what they're doing

591
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.670
and we have dialogue and relationships with the students as we get them to

592
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:59.870
pursue truth.
That's one of the cornerstones of our mission statement.

593
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.550
You pursue truth,

594
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.360
you don't construct it and at the end of the day you practice wisdom,

595
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.800
you practice what you preach,

596
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:08.900
you just don't have the cognitive and the intellectual.

597
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:13.460
You actually develop into a person of character that engages culture with

598
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:14.600
integrity.

599
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:18.550
<v 1>Do you find that you get other administrators,</v>

600
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:22.660
other school presidents and board members and probably donors,

601
00:34:22.661 --> 00:34:26.350
all sorts of things from other schools that are reaching out to you going,

602
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.670
how do we fix this mess?
Because I find now that it's people ask,

603
00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.500
I mean this has come up on the show many times.

604
00:34:32.501 --> 00:34:33.910
It's like how do you fix this thing?

605
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:39.070
And it seems like it really can't come from the academics because they been sort

606
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:40.420
of in it too long.
And uh,

607
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.400
you mentioned to me briefly before we started how they're,

608
00:34:42.401 --> 00:34:45.010
they're often not brave and we should explore that a little bit,

609
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.940
but that it really has to come from the donors that only when the money starts

610
00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:53.230
getting cut off,
will the schools be willing to do the right thing?

611
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.140
But I assume people look at you and see what's going on and go,

612
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.880
that's what we should be replicating.

613
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.770
<v 0>Well,
some do,
but not any industry protects its own.</v>

614
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:06.820
And until there's a huge crisis,
people are never forced to change.

615
00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.160
And I'm not sure we've reached that point of crises in the educational industry

616
00:35:12.161 --> 00:35:13.690
in the United States yet.
We will.

617
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.810
<v 1>Yeah.
Do you know,
what do you think that would look like?
Actually,</v>

618
00:35:15.811 --> 00:35:17.280
because I think a lot of people are watching this going,

619
00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.930
we're in the midst of it.
The crisis is here.

620
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.770
<v 0>It is here intellectually.
It is here morally it,</v>

621
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.620
I mean you see it in the snowflake rebellion.

622
00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.690
This is education where they're going to protest.

623
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:29.680
Ben Shapiro at Berkeley and Berkeley supposed to be the birthplace of the free

624
00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:30.514
speech movement.

625
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.970
<v 1>Basically protesting the guy who,</v>

626
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.920
who says the same things that Ronald Reagan said that were mainstream

627
00:35:34.921 --> 00:35:38.100
conservative ideas.
They're protesting a Jew and

628
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.030
<v 0>calling him a Nazi.</v>

629
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:43.530
This is an upside down claim that makes no sense and anybody with half a brain

630
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.640
can figure that out,

631
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:49.641
but yet Berkeley Silences Ben Shapiro and others because of what they don't

632
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.480
like,
his ideas.
That's not the birthplace of free speech.

633
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.980
That's ideological fascism that is not academic freedom.
In fact,

634
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.540
where do we get the word fascism?
It comes from the root word fast east.

635
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.140
A fascist was a Roman bundle of sticks that was bound together so tightly that

636
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:08.160
it could not be broken.

637
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.070
You see it in a lot of the freeze work in the sculptures in the United States,

638
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:14.420
the Supreme Court,
and in our capital.
You see a fascist,

639
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.830
which often has a hatchet head in the top of it.
What does it,

640
00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.200
what does it represent?
The power of the bond,
the common bond,

641
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.760
which isn't necessarily bad,

642
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.620
but it's from that we get the word fascism that you must be one of us.

643
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.220
You must look like us.
You must think like us.
You must walk like us.

644
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:36.120
You must talk like us or your verboten.
You will be expelled.

645
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:39.270
We will crush you.
Berkeley,
Ben Shapiro.

646
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.800
We will crush you with the fascist.
It's intellectual.

647
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.950
It's ideological fascism that is not academic freedom.

648
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:51.740
It's the antithesis of a classical,
the liberal.
Hmm.
So I'm curious,

649
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:54.050
uh,
Peter Boghossian,
who you may know,

650
00:36:54.051 --> 00:36:56.740
he's a professor up at Portland state who I've had on the show a few times and

651
00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.320
just did these fo academic papers.
We have him on again in a couple of weeks.

652
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.590
He calls this postmodern set of ideas a secular religion because it has all the

653
00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:09.440
markings of a religion,
but there's no redemption narrative.

654
00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:13.010
And certainly if you're a white,
cisgendered,
heterosexual Christian male,

655
00:37:13.011 --> 00:37:16.630
you better bow forever and never challenge it because you,

656
00:37:16.631 --> 00:37:19.280
you have original sin basically.
Um,

657
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.020
I don't know that you've thought about that specifically,

658
00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:24.320
but do you like that as someone that comes from a religious perspective?

659
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.320
Do you like that framing of this that it has the markings of religion in,

660
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.700
in a negative sense?
Let's say,

661
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.140
I would argue every worldview has the marketing software religion,

662
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.770
either positive or negative.
Um,

663
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.980
I don't think there's any way you can get outside of the box of a religious

664
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:46.100
discussion.
You and I might disagree on that at another time,
another place.

665
00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:49.820
But I think everything is going to boil down to these key questions.

666
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.200
Origin of man,
nature of Man,
redemption of man and responsibility of man.

667
00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.040
And all of those are religious questions.
Where do we come from?

668
00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.160
What is our nature,
what of,
what does our redemption,
how do you fix the problem?

669
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.480
And then what is our responsibility at the end of the day,
that's another quad,

670
00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:05.961
if you will.

671
00:38:05.961 --> 00:38:10.961
Quadral lateral for things through which every human being sifts his worldview

672
00:38:11.841 --> 00:38:16.280
in terms of trying to resolve how to function with one another and within life.

673
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.930
Postmodernity um,
I'm going to butcher this.
Historically,

674
00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:24.350
anybody out there that's a good historian is going to just fingernails on a

675
00:38:24.351 --> 00:38:25.131
chalkboard.
Don't worry.

676
00:38:25.131 --> 00:38:27.970
We've got youtube commenters and they'll gladly teach here.

677
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.500
I'm sure you're doing,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Um,

678
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.060
I'm gonna separate human history into three simple categories.
Premodern,

679
00:38:36.061 --> 00:38:37.240
modern and postmodern.

680
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.490
What's premodern supernatural in pre modern,

681
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.510
there was this idea that truth could be experienced.
This is real.

682
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.040
This table is empirically verifiable.
I can touch it,
I can see it,

683
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:54.060
I can feel it.
But there were other things in pre modernity,

684
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:58.420
there were also real and those were revealed truths.

685
00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.980
Mosaic Law for example,

686
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.940
there was a revelation that gave truth too,
man.

687
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.910
So premodern was supernatural.

688
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:09.850
Maternity comes along and it became what?

689
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:14.590
Simply natural premodern supernatural maternity.

690
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.520
Simply natural.
If you can't taste it,
touch it,
see it,
feel it,

691
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:21.880
then it just isn't so pre modern,
modern.

692
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.560
So what's post maternity?

693
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.830
If prematurity is supernatural and modernity is simply natural,

694
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:32.200
what's post maternity superman?

695
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.460
The ubermensch we shall rise up.
We will decide,

696
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:40.540
we will define,
we will declare ourselves to be as God.

697
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.370
The original sin is defined in genesis.

698
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.390
We don't need anybody telling us what to do.
Now,

699
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:51.130
whenever humanity comes to that point,
what always happens?
Good power.

700
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.680
Yeah.
Power crushes,
descent.

701
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.750
Premodern supernatural modernity.
Simply natural.

702
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:01.180
Postmodernity the Ubermensch Superman.

703
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.090
And I would argue that's where we are right now.
So how

704
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.970
<v 1>dangerous,
uh,
or precarious,
let's say,</v>

705
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:10.300
of a position do you think we're actually in,
in the United States right now?

706
00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:12.730
We're just,
let's say the West in general,

707
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.800
because this idea is growing.
We're fighting it back there.
It's,
you know,

708
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:22.090
there's,
there's definitely some push back online.
But if you look at academia,

709
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:25.540
if you look at the political establishment,
uh,
if you look at the media,

710
00:40:25.541 --> 00:40:27.730
these ideas are gaining and gaining strength.

711
00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:32.620
If you look at the way the media treats the ideas of Alexandria,
Ocozzio Cortez,

712
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:35.680
they're making it seem like these are all the hot right ideas.

713
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:39.270
These are pretty radical socialist ideas.
Uh,

714
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.070
but they have incredible amount of momentum right now.

715
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.790
What kind of position do you think we're actually in right now at the beginning

716
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:46.630
of 2019?

717
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.560
<v 0>Well,
I'm an optimist.
I,
I believe,
I know the end of the story and we,</v>

718
00:40:50.561 --> 00:40:54.310
when truth will prevail at the end of the day,
what happens between now and then?

719
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.490
Uh,
that's a matter of discussion.
In fact,
I had an old boss,

720
00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:01.210
he was the president of my Alma Mater.
I worked for him as a vice president and,

721
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:05.380
uh,
he was afraid of flying.
And one day I pulled Dr. Chapman aside and I said,

722
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:08.830
what is the deal?
I said,
you're a Christian.
You're deeply committed.
Uh,

723
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.640
why are you so afraid of flying?
You know what the end of the story is?
He says,

724
00:41:12.641 --> 00:41:14.110
I'm not afraid of the end of the story.

725
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:17.560
I'm just afraid of what happens between 30,000 feet in one.

726
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.630
I don't relish that two minutes.

727
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:22.750
So what's going to happen in that two minute gap of history?
I don't know.

728
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:23.561
I'm not a prophet,

729
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:27.670
but what I can say is these ideas are dangerous and they're nothing to just

730
00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:32.200
dismiss.
And if you're a classical liberal that disagrees with my religion and my

731
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:36.290
politics,
if you're a classical liberal that wants liberty at the end of the day,

732
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:40.940
you better pay attention to this debate because you have things that I just

733
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:44.600
looked at this morning on the news before I came here where Nancy Pelosi is

734
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:49.040
proposing that laws should be in play,

735
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:54.041
that if parents are parenting improperly as defined by her and her party,

736
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.940
that the government should actually have the right to take the child away.

737
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.960
So if I've got a 10 year old boy and the way he's behaving sexually is something

738
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.400
that I think is unhealthy for him,

739
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.350
should I have the right as a parent to pursue council for him or should the

740
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:14.420
government be able to intrude and tell me no,

741
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:19.750
you don't have the latitude to parent that 10 year old boy the way you want to.

742
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.690
Those discussions are in play right now.
And again,

743
00:42:23.691 --> 00:42:25.730
if you disagree with my religion and my politics,

744
00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:30.020
that should bother you because religion and politics will change.

745
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.730
The power base will change and what's popular today won't be popular tomorrow

746
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.380
and then you'll be on the losing end.

747
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.100
You better care about something more permanent and enduring.

748
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:44.720
Immunable true.
The devastating consequences of abandoning truth.

749
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.750
Truth will set you free,
not Nancy Pelosi.

750
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.300
<v 1>Huh.
Well,
I think that we got the Promo for this episode.
I right there.
Um,</v>

751
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:56.260
how enthused to you that these discussions are happening also outside of the

752
00:42:56.261 --> 00:42:58.870
academic world right now?
You mentioned that Jordan Peterson,

753
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.200
you reference him in your book that would,
that this guy's on this world tour.

754
00:43:02.201 --> 00:43:06.010
I happened to be on it with him.
Uh,
but that these conversations,

755
00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:08.200
even with some guys that maybe you don't agree with on a,

756
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:12.520
on a believer side of things,
say a Sam Harris or the rest of this,
this crew,

757
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.480
um,

758
00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.920
that people really care about these discussions where I would say five years ago

759
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.610
people online were,
you know,
people were watching cat videos and people be in,

760
00:43:21.611 --> 00:43:24.190
you know,
kicked in the nuts and a couple of other things,

761
00:43:24.191 --> 00:43:26.790
but they weren't really having the discussions and now they're,

762
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.140
they're on fire online.
So that,
that's pretty helpful.

763
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.550
<v 0>Well,
I do think it's helpful and again,
if you trust truth,</v>

764
00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.660
if you trust the referee,
if you trust the whistle,
then play,

765
00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.000
throw elbows,
rebound,
knock people over,
do what she need to do.

766
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.790
Trusting that the game can be played.

767
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.660
And I think that's the magic of the conservative Worldview,

768
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:52.050
the conservation of those big ideas that allow you to engage.

769
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.440
That's the beauty of the traditional Liberal Arts Academy Trust truth to win.

770
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:03.180
The irony here.
I had somebody,
when Milo hit his a snafu a couple of years ago,

771
00:44:03.181 --> 00:44:05.910
somebody called me up and said,
are you going to have milo at your campus?

772
00:44:05.911 --> 00:44:09.120
Because he had been dismissed from Berkeley or wherever it was?
And I said,
no,

773
00:44:09.121 --> 00:44:13.470
because I don't agree with Milo on so much that I don't want to lead anybody to

774
00:44:13.471 --> 00:44:17.280
conclude that somehow I'm elevating his ideas to some level of acceptability

775
00:44:17.281 --> 00:44:19.530
within our culture.
I said,
how are you?

776
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.430
<v 1>Let me pause here.
So if a student,</v>

777
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.980
if the student group on campus had invited him,

778
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.080
would you have allowed that to proceed?

779
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:29.530
If that's a little bit different than someone asking you,
will you have him?

780
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.200
<v 0>If a student or a student group wanted to discuss his ideas,</v>

781
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:35.850
I let's go at it.

782
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:40.260
Those ideas can be discussed robustly and you'll engage with our faculty and the

783
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:44.340
rest of the community and vetting those ideas.
Who's right,
who's wrong?

784
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.940
There are some times when,
here's an example.

785
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:50.310
Let's get off mile for a second for me to answer this question.

786
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.020
I had another gentleman who's very well known and very popular across the nation

787
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.980
who,
um,
wanted to speak at our,
at my commencement,

788
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.120
but he's of a different religion
now.

789
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.470
Had he accepted my invitation,
which I,
uh,

790
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.720
issued to be part of a day of cold belligerence Francis Schaffer,

791
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.600
where he and an evangelical,

792
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:20.601
a Catholic conservative Jew would have come to the table to have a discussion in

793
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.810
front of the students in terms of how to be co belligerent for a common good of

794
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:28.830
common sense and common morality.
Pick a topic,
uh,

795
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.240
the preservation of the sanctity of human life.
That would've been a great thing.

796
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.080
But putting somebody that disagrees so much with the core tenants of my

797
00:45:37.081 --> 00:45:41.160
institution at my pulpit,
at my podium on the key event of the year,

798
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:45.360
commencement is something that I guard because it sends a signal to everybody.

799
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.670
Um,
so I didn't,
I didn't invite him to the commencement.

800
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:53.340
I invited him to a day of cold belligerence.
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

801
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.860
<v 1>yeah.
So on,
let's get,
you know,
I'll defend your right as a,</v>

802
00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:58.650
as a private institution to do what you think is best.

803
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.090
<v 0>But let's get back to Milo.
Would I put Milo at the podium at the pulpit?</v>

804
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:08.580
I think I have to guard the message of what we stand for.
Missionally right.

805
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.450
But would I put him in a different venue where there would be debate and

806
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:16.440
disagreement and I'm good exchange.
Uh,
that's a different question.

807
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.910
If that answers you.

808
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.200
<v 1>And I suspect the answer is yes to that.</v>

809
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.320
<v 0>Yes,
yes.
Yeah,
possibly.
I mean,
I'm going to make a decision.</v>

810
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.520
There are some people I'm not going to because they're so far outside the pail.

811
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.950
Uh,
I'm not going to put a white supremacist on my podium because I think it's

812
00:46:29.951 --> 00:46:31.960
offensive to,
I mean,

813
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.520
we were birthed out of the civil rights movement.
We were actually birthed,

814
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.390
the Wesleyan church was an abolitionist church.
We took a stand against slavery.

815
00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:45.100
So our history,
our mission is human equality.
And it's,

816
00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:49.780
uh,
it's,
uh,
we stood in the face of the civil war and said,
no,

817
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:51.970
we will not do this.
And it's out of that.

818
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:54.460
We birthed ourselves out of the episcopal Methodist church and became the

819
00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:56.620
Wesleyan church because orange gotten,
Luther.

820
00:46:56.621 --> 00:47:01.450
Lee believed that it was wrong to call a human being less than a human being.

821
00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.231
The definition,

822
00:47:02.231 --> 00:47:05.380
the Tamago Day of what it meant to be human was something that they would not

823
00:47:05.381 --> 00:47:08.620
prefer that ne for fit.
And they held on tenaciously to that definition,

824
00:47:08.621 --> 00:47:09.940
thus the Wesleyan church.

825
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:15.340
So am I going to put somebody at my podium that refutes all of that?
Uh,
I'll,

826
00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.240
it's a judgment call

827
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:20.120
<v 1>that I have,
so,
right.
Interesting.</v>

828
00:47:20.121 --> 00:47:23.420
Do you think that universities,

829
00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:27.110
you probably don't want to say this as a,
as an administrator,

830
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.110
but that perhaps the way learning relative to people watching videos on youtube

831
00:47:32.111 --> 00:47:36.310
and conversing online and all of these things that the way young people are

832
00:47:36.311 --> 00:47:40.330
learning is changing so rapidly that 10 years from now or 20 years from now,

833
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:44.950
that the university system is going to be either completely different.

834
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.280
I think that's a foregone conclusion perhaps,
but not just different,

835
00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.960
but far less relevant that you will have figured out ways to learn in many other

836
00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:56.200
ways.
I mean,
I say this all the time now.
It's like if you just watch this show,

837
00:47:56.201 --> 00:47:59.020
not that it's a complete version of what you should get in college,
obviously,

838
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:01.510
but you can have,
you know,
uh,

839
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.720
behavioral scientists and evolutionary biologists and clergyman and a wide set

840
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.580
of people from different walks of life.
You can learn from them.

841
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.300
And if you want,
you can get a pretty damn good education that way.

842
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.850
That's not the complete piece of why you should be a college.

843
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.850
But do you sense that that's really

844
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:24.830
<v 0>changing?
Oh,
there's no question.
I mean,
you've got micro Glenn back.</v>

845
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.493
Um,

846
00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:33.410
Tucker Carlson all have been very aggressive in the last six months on advising

847
00:48:33.411 --> 00:48:37.280
parents not to send their kids to college because of the flaws of the academy.

848
00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.580
This daycare,
not in sense the lack of robust debate,

849
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.000
the debt that you're incurring to get a terrible education.

850
00:48:44.001 --> 00:48:48.020
That's basically indoctrination rather than intellectual half-ton inquiry.

851
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:51.680
And I don't necessarily disagree with them.

852
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.700
I think there are a handful of institutions left that care,
but literally,

853
00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.900
I'm not sure it's much greater than a handful.
So yes,
education would change.

854
00:48:59.901 --> 00:49:01.340
But here's the shame of it.

855
00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:06.850
When it changes and becomes more online and I'm technologically driven,

856
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.610
you're going to lose this,
and if you lose this,

857
00:49:10.611 --> 00:49:12.500
you lose half of what education is about.

858
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:17.840
If these same ideas were expressed from a distance in an email exchange or an a

859
00:49:17.841 --> 00:49:22.550
text exchange,
or if you saw me speaking,
uh,
online,

860
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.070
you might think that guy's a jackass because we haven't had that.

861
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.370
Maybe you think that anything we haven't had the opportunity to actually develop

862
00:49:31.371 --> 00:49:32.151
a relationship.

863
00:49:32.151 --> 00:49:35.780
Relationships are part of the core and the soul of good education.

864
00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:40.810
That's what causes you to become part of the human community.

865
00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:44.690
Part of being a human being as the relationship and if all we're going to do is

866
00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:50.020
transfer information through the internet rather than engage in a relationship

867
00:49:51.171 --> 00:49:55.730
that actually builds to common understanding of those revealed truths that

868
00:49:55.731 --> 00:49:56.390
matter,

869
00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:01.390
we've lost the core of what it means to be an educated person in a liberally

870
00:50:01.461 --> 00:50:02.510
educated human being.

871
00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.480
<v 1>Yeah.
You know,
it's funny,</v>

872
00:50:03.481 --> 00:50:06.060
I'm so intimately aware of that because in the last year,

873
00:50:06.061 --> 00:50:07.770
especially where I've been on the road so much,

874
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:12.480
I see one set of ideas online and a certain amount of hate and anger and

875
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:16.380
resentment and all,
all of that.
And then everywhere I go,

876
00:50:16.381 --> 00:50:20.850
and I mean this without exception,
I meet great people just like this.

877
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:25.560
And you,
you talk to somebody and it's,
it's so much more powerful than the,

878
00:50:25.561 --> 00:50:27.980
the conversation online.
So even though I'm so

879
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 0>enthused about people getting ideas from these conversations and things like</v>

880
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:34.540
that,
yeah.
The other part of that and,

881
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:39.020
and maybe colleges will shift and learn to integrate some of that.
I hope.

882
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:42.530
I suspect financial pressures,
pressures are huge right now.
Uh,

883
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:45.750
I think Forbes put out an article less than a month ago that caught,

884
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.400
that suggested that 50% of all colleges and universities in the nation will

885
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:51.980
close in the next 10 years because of the financial pressures.

886
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.060
And as a college president,
I understand why Forbes is predicting that.

887
00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.530
I would argue that the handful that will succeed are those that are clear and

888
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:05.150
bold and distinct.
The marshmallow,
the Mush,
the vanilla will fail.

889
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.780
Now,
you may disagree with my Christian paradigm.

890
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.900
You may disagree with the four pillars of Oklahoma Wesleyan University,

891
00:51:11.901 --> 00:51:15.770
which are the primacy of Christ,
the priority of scripture,
the pursuit of truth,

892
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.410
and the practice of wisdom.
That's who we are.

893
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.440
We have a center for capitalism,

894
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:24.050
free enterprise and constitutional liberty.

895
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.340
We are pro life where the only university in the nation that operates a mobile

896
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.510
ultrasound clinic,

897
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.470
free of charge to women in our 102 hundred mile radius.

898
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.790
We've saved over 200 lives as a result of doing that.
Now,

899
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:40.160
how many college presidents are you going to hear the story from?

900
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.110
Very few and people listening right now may say,
I don't want that.

901
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:48.710
Fine.
Go get what you want.
It's a free market,

902
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.530
but those that are listening right now that like it,

903
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.590
they're not going to find any place else and they'll knock down my door to buy

904
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:56.450
it.
Nobody wants vanilla ice cream.

905
00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.380
If you sell a flavor that's bold and distinct and clear and different,

906
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.510
the people that want it,
we'll buy it.

907
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.860
Missional clarity is critical for any industry,
any business,

908
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:11.180
and especially for the academy right now because if we're all just vanilla mush,

909
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:16.330
then why would you pay twice what you need to to get an education from me when

910
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:19.850
you could go down the road to the junior college and get the exact same thing.

911
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.480
It makes no sense.
You've got to be distinct,
otherwise you fail.

912
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.440
Can you talk a little bit about how the uh,

913
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.190
sort of the new studies say gender studies and women's studies and things like

914
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:34.310
that have kind of infiltrated the,
the,
uh,

915
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:38.360
more traditional disciplines that,
that seems to be a big word lately.
Okay.

916
00:52:38.361 --> 00:52:43.180
Now you're pushing me here.
So,
um,
uh,
I'm going to answer clearly.

917
00:52:43.181 --> 00:52:48.020
I'll let you do your own segways for awhile.
So
I'm going to answer clearly.

918
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:52.220
Uh,
it's a compromise of the dignity of the woman,
pure and simple,

919
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:56.630
who's losing right now in the academic discussion?
Women,

920
00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.150
why do I say that?
Okay.

921
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.640
Title Nine is a 1972 law that was established to give women equal access to the

922
00:53:05.711 --> 00:53:09.980
field,
to the shower,
to the scholarship,
to the bathroom,
to the sport.

923
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.390
Good.
Right.
Okay.
We've complied with that started good.

924
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:19.160
We've complied with that since day one.
Now,
under Obama,

925
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:23.630
I receive a letter like every single college prison in nation received demanding

926
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.610
through a bureaucratic Fiat,
not through legislation.

927
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.990
That's a different discussion that we immediately start providing transgender

928
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:35.890
accommodations on our campus.
I responded and I said,

929
00:53:35.891 --> 00:53:37.780
no,
no.
Why did I do that?

930
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:42.160
Because I'm not sympathetic to those that are wrestling with that just for you

931
00:53:42.161 --> 00:53:46.480
or that particular issue of life.
Now I'm not.
That's not why I said no.

932
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.990
I responded because I said this and I actually put it in writing.

933
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:55.530
How can I possibly comply with title nine which you doe and OCR telling me I

934
00:53:55.631 --> 00:54:00.631
have to do if I now deny the biological fact of the female and start pretending

935
00:54:02.081 --> 00:54:04.330
that women aren't an objective reality,

936
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.840
but rather a social construct?

937
00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:13.690
Who's going to lose?
If I do this,
Mr Doe and Mister OCR women are going to lose.

938
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.150
They're going to lose their scholarship,
lose their sport,

939
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:21.360
lose their competitive advantage because they're going to be supplanted by men

940
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.020
who take it away from them.

941
00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.810
<v 1>And by the way,
we see this now in sports all the time,
every,</v>

942
00:54:25.811 --> 00:54:28.060
every witness is not hypothetical,
is another wrestler,

943
00:54:28.061 --> 00:54:32.050
Trans woman wrestler that's beating a biological woman.

944
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.870
And people are cheering this as if this is the way it's supposed to.

945
00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:38.340
<v 0>And how was that fair and how is that pro woman?</v>

946
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.440
The irony again is as a conservative,

947
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:44.910
I'm the classical feminist now because I'm acknowledging the feminine and I'm

948
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:48.090
saying that women are real,
they're not a social construct.

949
00:54:48.091 --> 00:54:49.410
There are biological fact,

950
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:53.910
and they should have the protections that title nine afforded to them back in

951
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:57.000
1972 and I refuse to compromise that.

952
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:01.980
So I sent a letter back to the doe and the LCR and I said,
no,
told them why.

953
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.670
And I received a letter back saying,
you're exempt.
Wow.

954
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:10.440
At which point I got criticized robustly as you can imagine from anybody that

955
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:14.910
disagreed with my particular defense of the dignity of the woman.

956
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.710
<v 1>But you got the exemption.
I did for now.
Well,
now both.</v>

957
00:55:21.711 --> 00:55:25.870
Now title nine has changed because of the Trump administration.
So each title,

958
00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:30.920
<v 0>they're just enforcing it and the more pure way rather than trying to manipulate</v>

959
00:55:30.921 --> 00:55:34.850
it through bureaucratic Fiat.
Yeah.
Um,

960
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:40.130
the same thing was true on a affordable care act.
Oklahoma Wesleyan,

961
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:41.313
um,

962
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:45.200
stood with the little sisters of the poor on the steps of the Supreme Court in

963
00:55:45.201 --> 00:55:50.030
defending the right of a bunch of nuns to not have to buy contraception.

964
00:55:50.031 --> 00:55:52.730
They're celibate.
Why do they need any stop and think?

965
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.933
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

966
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.410
<v 0>why should they have to buy any contraception?</v>

967
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:03.670
And how does it possibly pro woman for the federal government or anybody to tell

968
00:56:03.671 --> 00:56:06.970
these women what kind of products they have to purchase them,

969
00:56:06.971 --> 00:56:10.390
their health care package.
When they don't want them,
they won't use them.

970
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.990
They don't need them.
And by the way,
they're Catholic,
they're prolife.

971
00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:18.100
So the Fed intrudes into all of that and says,
you've got to do this.

972
00:56:18.101 --> 00:56:21.070
You've got to buy this product.
By the way,
Oklahoma Wesleyan,
by definition,

973
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:25.810
hires only prolife faculty and staff.
So the women at Oak who are pro life too,

974
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:26.531
they're not Catholic,

975
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:31.531
but they're pro life who can possibly claim to be pro woman and ignore the

976
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:38.170
wisdom and the intelligence and the right to choose that these women should have

977
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.520
in their health care.

978
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:44.500
We were the ones that defended that we were the only university in the nation to

979
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.660
challenge the,
um,

980
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:52.020
a bureaucratic Fiat that suggested on sexual harassment that you have to convene

981
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:54.910
a kangaroo court on your campus,

982
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:59.890
that you've now are required by law to circumvent the local legal channels and

983
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:05.670
persecute the accused on your campus by not allowing him to be adjudicated by

984
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.260
people that actually know what they're doing.

985
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.000
Local law professionals in the courts,

986
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:12.700
and it also compromise the rights of the woman,

987
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.890
the rights of the accuser because you drunk,

988
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:19.480
you were then required to drag her before a committee of her peers and go

989
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:20.180
through the whole thing again.

990
00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.450
<v 1>It's,
it's just completely bananas.
I mean,
we're,</v>

991
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:25.490
we're eliminating due process or that's exactly,
exactly.

992
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.370
<v 0>Oklahoma Wesleyan was the only university in the nation of Christian</v>

993
00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:31.940
conservative institution stood up and said,
no,
we will not do that.

994
00:57:31.941 --> 00:57:36.030
Fire actually represented us and I was thrown out and we prevailed.
Hmm.
Okay.

995
00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:38.240
<v 1>All right,
I got one more for Ya.
Okay.</v>

996
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:43.270
There is a 1617 year old watching this right now thinking about what college

997
00:57:44.421 --> 00:57:48.020
they're going to go to.
I think you've done a pretty solid sales job already,

998
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:52.100
but give them the final sales job of why they should attend Oklahoma Wesleyan.

999
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:57.060
<v 0>We'll decide what you want.
Okay,
so first of all,
what product do you want?</v>

1000
00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.020
Do you want a career?
Do you want technical training?
Do you want,

1001
00:58:01.021 --> 00:58:03.210
I'm an apprenticeship.

1002
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:07.890
Then you might not want to go to Oklahoma Wesleyan if those are the only things

1003
00:58:07.891 --> 00:58:08.790
that you're interested in.

1004
00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.350
If you also want to wrestle with the big ideas,

1005
00:58:13.351 --> 00:58:17.760
if you also want to do it robustly within the 100 year tradition of a classical

1006
00:58:17.761 --> 00:58:20.850
liberal arts education,
which is not progressive and leftist,

1007
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.130
but grounded in those time tested trues,

1008
00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:26.880
you might want to consider coming here and again,
I've got to throw this in.

1009
00:58:26.881 --> 00:58:28.830
I can't ignore this.
We are Christian.

1010
00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.250
If you want those four things that I described,

1011
00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.900
the primacy of Christ because we believe he is who he claimed to be the prior of

1012
00:58:36.901 --> 00:58:40.440
scripture.
We believe that the Bible is more than just an interesting dusty book.

1013
00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.400
Okay?

1014
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.300
We believe that it contains the revelation of those truths that actually give us

1015
00:58:45.301 --> 00:58:48.150
the ability to do this.
The pursuit of truth.

1016
00:58:48.151 --> 00:58:51.450
Truth is an objective reality rather than just a postmodern construct.

1017
00:58:51.451 --> 00:58:53.250
I'm not going to give you a diplomate and opinions.

1018
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.400
I'm going to give you a diploma that demonstrates you learn something.

1019
00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:00.840
And then finally,
the practice of wisdom.
The practice of what you preach.

1020
00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:05.100
We're integrationists head and heart fact and faith,
belief and behavior.

1021
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.450
Personal Life and public life are integrated.
We're not segregationists.

1022
00:59:09.451 --> 00:59:11.550
We don't separate things that should be United.

1023
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.200
I'm the president of a university.
I'm not the president of I die.

1024
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:20.410
Versiti and there's a reason for that.
The unity of Vera tasks,

1025
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:23.570
the unity virtue,
the unity of the verities,

1026
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:28.571
the Yuna versity is historically something that celebrated us coming together in

1027
00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:32.690
unity,
bound together by truth with a capital t.

1028
00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.670
It didn't degrade and vulcanized culture and humanity into division.

1029
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:43.670
We should be teaching virtue and Veritas not victimization and when you teach

1030
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.820
victimization,
you get advice and you get vengeance and you get violence.

1031
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.850
That's what you see in the protests in the streets right now.

1032
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.990
The solution to anybody that's listening to me is get an education in the

1033
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:58.610
virtues in Veritas.
In truth,
it's more than a career.

1034
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.280
It's about something that actually builds your character.

1035
01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.190
<v 1>This is the first interview I've ever done where I wish I had to get into the</v>

1036
01:00:05.191 --> 01:00:09.740
intellectual dark web card that I could just hand you right now because it's,

1037
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.600
this has been a pleasure just sitting with someone with a complete set of ideas

1038
01:00:12.601 --> 01:00:15.160
that that knows what they think and is a master at it.
I've,

1039
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.470
I've thoroughly enjoyed this.

1040
01:00:16.471 --> 01:00:19.350
I hope you have as well and for more on Doctor Piper,

1041
01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:22.890
you can follow him on Twitter.
Yeah.
He's on Twitter for better or worse,

1042
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.870
it's Dr. Everett Piper.
