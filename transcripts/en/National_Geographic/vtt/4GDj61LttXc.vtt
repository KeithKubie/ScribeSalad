00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.967
You ready?

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:02.767
Get ready.

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:03.633
Are you ready?

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:05.433
Yeah.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:07.200
NARRATOR: Barbara
Bollard-Breen and her team

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.066
are here to create
a virtual version

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.700
of a historic hut
that's over 100 years

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.400
old, in order to
help protect it.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.767
Here we go.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:20.900
NARRATOR: And she's about to
step inside for the first time.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.600
Oh my god.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.300
Wow.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.066
I don't even know what
I was expecting, but--

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.633
It's so beautifully preserved.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.667
It's unbelievable.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.834
And this is how
they left it when

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.633
they headed out to the pole.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.233
It's as if
they're just waiting

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.233
for everyone to come back.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.967
NARRATOR: On October 24, 1911,
British explorer Robert Falcon

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:52.567
Scott and 16 men left
this hut on an expedition

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:54.533
to the South Pole.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.033
They were the second group
ever to make it there,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.834
but on their way back they
were caught in a blizzard

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:02.333
that lasted nine days.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.066
On March 29th, Scott
wrote in his journal,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.000
"We shall stick
it out to the end,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.033
but we are getting
weaker, of course,

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.066
and the end cannot be far.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:16.266
It seems a pity, but I do
not think I can write more."

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.600
Months later, the
party was found

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.200
frozen to death, over
100 miles from the safety

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.900
of this shelter.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.133
Amazing.

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.266
It's stunning.

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.300
It's preserved so well, I feel
like we're the first people

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.567
to discover it.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.100
God, everywhere
you look, there

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.633
is just something unbelievable.

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.133
The boots, and
hats on the shelves.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.033
It's amazing.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.467
You can almost feel their
presence here, can't you?

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.100
You can.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.166
You can just imagine it
with people in the bunks.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.800
Sitting around the
table, sharing a meal.

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:13.667
Working in the kitchen.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.033
The dishes are there!

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:23.066
Sugar, cocoa.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.400
Oh my god.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.500
the Illustrated London News.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Saturday, February 29th, 1908.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
Wow.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.400
It cost sixpence.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.333
Isn't that something?

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.066
NARRATOR: The hut is
25 feet by 50 feet,

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.367
and Barbara's team has
just a few hours inside it

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:46.066
to complete their mission.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.700
Time to get to work.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.934
How about you go down the
center, I'll comb this way,

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:53.600
and see how we go?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.834
OK.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.467
We're making a virtual
reality mosaic of the inside

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:01.133
of this hut by having multiple
cameras at multiple angles,

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.800
and multiple heights.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.333
When we process them
on a computer later,

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:10.500
we can get a 3D
image of the hut.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.166
We take thousands
of images, and then I

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:18.066
stitch those images together
to create 3D orthomosaics.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:20.800
We actually have to
make every second count,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.533
because we've only got a
limited amount of time here.

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.300
It's a very remote location.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.533
We've got one shot at this,
so it's a little bit nerve

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.300
wracking, but we want to
do it right, because we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300
can't come back again.
