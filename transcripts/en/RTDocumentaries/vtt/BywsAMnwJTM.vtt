00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400
Life made Anton became a blogger.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
He lives in a water-company
 housing compound miles from anywhere,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
in a tiny village that doesn’t even have a name.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.900
But he’s convinced that soon,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.400
all that will change.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Every day of the week,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.300
the Khoroshevs are up at 6 am to milk the cows.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.300
Anton’s mother isn’t just a crypto-currency expert.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.300
After some convincing she’s become a kind of a technical expert for the blog.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600
Her specialist areas are how to
help cows when they’re calving,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
or choosing the best plants for your garden.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.300
And this is Anton's muse and collaborator,
 his wife, Alevtina.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.900
A few recent comments on the blog suggested

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.900
that Alevtina doesn’t always wear 
particularly elegant clothing!

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
That’s the price of publicity.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.900
They need to post at least two new videos 
every week to ensure

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.900
that the blog doesn’t lose subscribers.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.640
That means filming something every day.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.960
You might wonder where news comes

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.280
from in the country!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.780
After all, there are only 4 houses in the village,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.780
and nothing ever happens.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.700
But the young couple is determined to move.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.000
That’s why they started the blog,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.040
to raise enough for a new house because 
they could never start

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240
a farm here in this temporary home.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.200
Even though they never studied public relations,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.400
Anton and Alevtina intuitively 
knew never to ignore subscriber questions.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400
Despite being exhausted,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.800
at night they shoot videos to answer their viewers.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.800
Half the population of the unnamed village works

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800
at the sewage plant.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.600
And they’ve all been called in to work

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.600
because of a night-time accident.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.580
Neighbours find it hard to understand 
what makes the Khoroshevs’

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.620
so special that people all over the country

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.620
and the world want to watch videos about them.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.620
But when there was an emergency,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.620
it wasn’t the police or TV news they called,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.040
but Anton, to discuss the problem in his blog.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.040
But the Khoroshevs are edging closer to their dream.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.180
The blog now makes around 
a thousand dollars a month,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.780
and that means they can start 
saving for the house they want.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.200
The Village Family vlog already has more 
than 150,000 worldwide subscribers.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.320
The new technology changed village life.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.320
Mobile phone is still awful,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.160
but a Wi-Fi is available even in the cowshed.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.640
Six months have passed
 and we’re back with the Khoroshevs.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.680
They’ve finally bought the house of their dreams,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.240
and soon, the long awaited move will at last take place.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.840
They found two suitable houses with enough land for a shared farm in Volgograd area,

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.480
but the Khoroshevs still unsure if they’d can start a farm with the Germans who,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.480
moved to Russia after watching the blog.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.600
Everyone’s busy making their own decisions

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.120
but the biggest challenge is still to come:

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.880
moving with all the cattle and starting a farm in a new location.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.400
But Anton’s mother has refused to swap Stavropol Area

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.400
for Volgograd region.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.400
The family will have to split up.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.480
They’re about to leave

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.680
and all that remains is to get the cows into the truck,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.480
an operation that looks a lot like a rodeo.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.960
They might be exhausted after the trip

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.480
but the blog still needs updating with new videos,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.000
because now, a new dream
 has appeared on the horizon:

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.040
a real farm,

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.040
and they need to earn more money to buy it.
