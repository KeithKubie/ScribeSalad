00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.349
A toaster that burns the daily weather forecast
onto your toast, and Rocky Mountain Oyster

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.679
Stout Beer is made with real roasted bull
testicles.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.780
Vsauce, Kevin here.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.580
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.660
Digits is a hands-free 3-D motion capture
sensor you wear on your wrist and it creates

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.710
a model of your hand that responds with fingertip
precision.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.930
Microsoft Research developed this gloveless
system which uses an infrared camera, a motion

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.829
sensing chip, a laser line, and software to
detect fingertips and follow the movement

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.589
of finger joints, allowing you to control
video games, translate sign language, or interact

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.920
with a computer.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.899
If you prefer a more tactile controller there's
this smart ball.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.109
Palla is a wireless device that can be held
or rolled and precisely tracks movement with

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.429
an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer,
and a barometer that senses the variations

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.400
in altitude within 10 centimeters.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.540
There are no buttons, it just uses pressure
and proximity sensors, and it provides feedback

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.920
with LEDs and vibration.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.020
Chinese Hospitals have introduced this device,
and I'm just gonna let you guess what it does.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.250
Say hello to Pegomastax - a miniature, plant-eating,
newly discovered dinosaur with a parrotlike

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.560
beak, fangs, and quills.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.100
It's a member of the heterodontosaurus genus
and probably weighed less than a small house

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.140
cat.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.829
It turns out ants are like the internet.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.689
The way they communicate with their colony
is quite similar to the Transmission Control

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.299
Protocol used to keep data traveling the internet
from bogging down.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.840
Basically, food for ants is like bandwidth:
The more food there is, the more ants that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.140
leave and return to the colony; the less food,
the less movement, and the ants adjust their

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.360
movements based on this flow of traffic.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.409
Like the internet.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.409
Anternet.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.650
Nest is a learning thermostat designed to
save energy and money.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.649
It learns your schedule and helps optimize
the temperature of your home, all while programming

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.679
itself.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.800
A small leaf appears to indicate energy saving,
and simply changing one degree can cut energy

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.030
use up to 5%.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.069
Its adjustable while you're away with a smart
phone, and gives you a breakdown of how, and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.530
when, you're using the most energy.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.760
Meat Shot Glasses.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.450
Hop is hands-free luggage that follows you
around.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.120
It connects to your smartphone and if the
signal is lost it locks itself and notifies

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.470
the user.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.360
This is just a prototype, but I mostly just
like the idea of a little R2D2 bag following

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.760
me around.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.950
If you need a fire-fighting robot friend there's
Octavia.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.010
Developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory
this robot recognizes individuals using facial

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.819
and vocal identifiers, it understands commands
with a speech recognizer, it understands gestures,

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.790
and extinguishes fires by aiming the hose
at the brightest spots.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.209
Finally, RainRoom is an art installation using
pressure regulators, hydraulics, and 3D tracking

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:22.630
cameras to allow you to walk through the rain
without getting wet.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:04:04.849
I'm gonna leave you with a superhydrophobic
knife cutting a water droplet in half...

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.560
We've recently launched Vsauce3 which is all
about video games.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.000
So go over there, check it out, make sure
that you subscribe and, as always, thanks

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:27.940
for watching.
