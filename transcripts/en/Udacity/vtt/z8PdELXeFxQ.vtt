00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.900
An alternative view of a use case to that provided by a sequence diagram,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.780
would be a communication diagram. In the communication diagram, it looks like

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.940
a class model diagram. That is, there are rectangles corresponding to classes,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.150
and there's lines between them. However, in this case the lines correspond to

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.800
instances of communication, likely operation calls.
