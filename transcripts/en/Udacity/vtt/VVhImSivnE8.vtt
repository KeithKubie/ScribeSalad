00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.740
Alright Charles you want to help us kind of work through this example?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.780
&gt;&gt; Sure. So ,we multiply x1 times w1 so that gives us a half

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.583
&gt;&gt; Um-huh.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:13.538
&gt;&gt; We multiply zero times three fifth which would get a zero.

00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:14.311
&gt;&gt; Um-huh.

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.380
&gt;&gt; And we multiply minus one point five times one. Which will

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.040
give us minus three halves. And so, the answers negative. Whatever it is.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; It is right, so it's, this was negative ahead, negative one and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.820
a half plus a half, so it should be negative one.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.540
&gt;&gt; And, but that's not the output that we should actually

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.340
produce, right? That's the activation. What do we do with the activation?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.120
&gt;&gt; Well we see if the activation is above our threshold fata, which in

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.510
this case is zero, and it is not So the output should be zero.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.870
&gt;&gt; Good.
