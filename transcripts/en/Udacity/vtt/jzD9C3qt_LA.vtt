00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.575
The specific objectives
of this lesson are,

00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:05.697
one, we will really learn how to
generate a panorama, building on

00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:09.020
the ingredients that we have actually
spent a lot of time on until now.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.120
We will actually revisit
the concepts of image re-projection.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.570
We will learn about homography
between the two images.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.420
Basically, looking at two images and
how we can compute the homography.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.070
They'll let us do both the alignment
of images and registration and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.240
also kind of learn about how
we combine those images.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.400
We will also learn about things like
how do we actually find points and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.360
reliably detect them as
inliers versus outliers.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.280
And then finally, I'll actually discuss
some of the, specific aspects of how we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.560
construct panoramas and
our ideas of different types of things.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.010
Again, something we've touched on.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.030
So again, the goal here is to bring
all of those concepts together and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.640
show you how we can actually do
something like panorama building.
