[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.220
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.970
- The black men of the
community could not

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.300
play hockey with the white
hockey teams in the area.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.707
They were just segregated.

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:18.290
- We've got some
season ticket holders

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.792
that are complaining
about bringing you here.

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.670
- I had to endure everything,
all the name calling,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.915
the n-word, I heard it all.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:29.540
- He got death threats.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.434
You're playing the
white man's game.

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:36.290
- You know you can
compete with the best.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.620
But you're the wrong color.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.740
- For 12 years we've
been coming to hockey,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.145
and he's only the second
one we've ever seen.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.870
- Was there a
discrimination issue,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.730
or was it simply
the fact that he

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.590
was too proud to go
to the minor leagues?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.593
And you can find good
arguments on both sides.

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:53.676
- There was racial slurs
coming from every corner.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.428
- Only way to get back
at them is to win.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:07.050
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.970
- Race, like so many other
things, serve as a distraction.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.000
And the minute you allow
it to distract you,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320
you'll never reach
your destination.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.820
- Doesn't matter
what color you are.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.536
If you want to do
something, you go and do it.

00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:21.410
And don't let anybody
tell you can't do that.

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:25.590
- Why wouldn't you
play basketball,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.425
or why wouldn't
you play football?

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:29.295
And I'm like, why
can't I play hockey?

00:01:29.295 --> 00:01:30.170
What's wrong with it?

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:40.605
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.800
- I didn't realize this at that
time that I had broke barriers

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.780
and opened doors.

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:50.100
- Our job is to keep building.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.530
You've got guys like Wayne
Simmons and Chris Stewart

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.310
and PK.

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.550
- He had a dream to
be a hockey player,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.850
and he wasn't going
to let anybody

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.284
take that away from him.

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:11.970
- They made it so much
easier for us to come up

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.480
and to play and to not think
about color as a factor,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.650
just based on our skill
and not on our color.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.284
- Hockey has given me
so many opportunities.

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:24.450
And the only reason why I
even have that opportunity

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.630
is because of them.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.274
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.440
- You owe it to yourself,
if you're playing a sport,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.314
to know your history.

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.877
Especially if you're black.

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:40.460
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.270
NELSON BOYCE: Wow.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.127
All right.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.730
So I can't begin to tell you how
excited I am to be moderating

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.450
this panel today.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.780
We've got an esteemed group of
panelists on the stage today.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.085
And I'd like to briefly
introduce each of them to you.

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.210
And I'm sure each of them
will have the opportunity

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.930
to give you all a little bit
more color into who they are.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.390
But on the very
far end we've got

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.362
Kwame Mason, who is the director
and producer of "Soul on Ice".

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.570
KWAME DAMON MASON: Thank you.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.230
NELSON BOYCE: We
have living history

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.680
right next to him,
Mr. Willie O'Ree, who

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.460
was the first black
player in the NHL.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.540
We have Anson Carter,
who is a former NHL

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
player, including many teams
like the Capitals, Bruins,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.247
Rangers.

00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:31.080
ANSON CARTER: Local.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.500
NELSON BOYCE: Yes.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.999
Yep.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.520
Yep.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.980
And last but not least,
we have Jessica Berman

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.450
who's VP of Special Projects
and Corporate Social

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.010
Responsibility for the NHL.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.614
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:46.280
So amongst other
things, certainly we're

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.988
going to talk about
"Soul on Ince" today.

00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:50.780
But we're also going to talk
about the evolution of the NHL,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.270
particularly as it
relates to black folks.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.600
And I will tell you, in full
transparency and honesty,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.330
I'm not the biggest hockey
fan that sits in front of you.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.690
I'm a fan of sports overall.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.040
And I will tell you
without hesitation

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.660
that this documentary,
this film opened up

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.200
an entire new world for me
in not only understanding

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.620
the sport, but understanding
the evolution of the sport

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.519
and understanding the
culture within the sport.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.110
But even more so, the
many things that the NHL

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.150
is doing in terms of
diversity and continuing

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.067
to grow the sport overall.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.900
So let's go ahead and
start with you, Kwame.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.540
And talk a little bit more
about your background.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.832
But what was the inspiration
for creating this film?

00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:37.040
KWAME DAMON MASON: All right.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.623
Well, first of all I just wanted
to thank Google for having us

00:04:39.623 --> 00:04:40.160
here.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.810
It's a real honor,
and I'm really

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.880
pleased to be here
with these great people

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.640
who I've gotten to know over
the last couple of years

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.600
to just talk about
hockey and what we're

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.850
trying to do to grow the game.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.480
For myself, I was a radio
announcer for 14 years.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.900
And in 2005 I ended up working
in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.440
And over there, it's like--
that's just a bed of hockey.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.764
And I was really fortunate
to meet and hang out

00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:17.180
with a lot of the
Edmonton Oilers,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.920
and they would send
me to a lot of games.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.120
And sitting in the
audience there,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.700
just how beautiful that game is.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.490
For those who haven't been
to a live hockey game,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.790
you have to go and see one, man,
because it's just incredible.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.030
And looking at that, and looking
at the speed, the athleticism

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.870
and all that, and getting to
know a lot of the guys off ice.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.370
The first thing
that came to my mind

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.870
was something that
I used to think

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.430
about when I was
a child, which was

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.860
how come there's still not a
lot of black athletes playing

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.521
hockey?

00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.730
And in that thinking,
I thought to myself,

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.090
there are-- or I was seeing--
a lot of young guys coming up.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.290
I was watching Anson Carter.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.820
I mean, I remember sitting
in my room watching

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.890
an Olympic games and Anson
scoring the winning goal.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.480
I remember how long it
took to get the referee

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.230
to call the goal.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.420
And I was just sitting
there by myself, and just

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.950
so happy for him.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.460
And I would go on my computer
and I would Google black hockey

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.220
players.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.830
And I would get
this list of guys,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.510
and I'd be reading
these stories.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.360
And then one day I found
out about the Colored Hockey

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.980
League of Nova Scotia.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.680
And I was in my
30s at this time,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.410
and that really bothered
me because here I am,

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.070
a black Canadian, and hockey
is our second language,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.850
and nobody taught me about this.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.380
So I started to gather a lot of
information and I put it aside,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.880
and I said to myself,
you know, this

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.910
would be a really cool
documentary one day to talk

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.850
about black history and hockey.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.930
And so we fast forward to 2011,
and something really tragic

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.530
in my life happened
where my mom had cancer.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.280
And I remember sitting on
her bed in the hospital

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.247
and talking about what I was
going to do in the future

00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:06.080
because as a mother,
she was very concerned.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.700
And I said, you
know, I got this idea

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.740
to do this documentary
about hockey players.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.920
And she just told me
the best advice ever,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.790
and she said, just go for it.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.890
So after she passed,
I put my head down,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.460
and I started gathering
information, making some phone

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.330
calls, and trying to do the
best I could to kind of put

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.540
something like this together.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.700
And so fast forward to 2011,
I sought my first interview.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.200
And from then on it
just kind of snowballed.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.270
And it was a long road.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.520
NELSON BOYCE: Let's talk
about that a little bit more.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.060
I mean, first time filmmaker.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.160
You know, I watched
the documentary,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.774
and you're flying
to a bunch of-- you

00:07:45.774 --> 00:07:47.690
must have been in a
number of different cities

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.160
to have gotten all this done.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.350
Was there funding behind this?

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.630
How did you make this happen?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.369
KWAME DAMON MASON: Well, funding
was me selling my condominium.

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:00.410
NELSON BOYCE: Dedication.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:01.410
KWAME DAMON MASON: Yeah.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.740
I wouldn't advise that for
any filmmakers out there.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.220
But I'm so passionate
about the sport.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.340
I'm so passionate
about black history.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.570
And it just was a great mesh.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.150
And if no one was
going to invest in me,

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.540
I figured I had to invest
in myself because I thought

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.560
nobody was telling that story.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.310
So if I just said, well, I
don't have money right now,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.127
might as well just wait,
I don't know how long I

00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:26.210
was going to have to wait.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.960
And I had already quit my job.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.000
So I had to do something.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.390
So I had some capital and I had
great family back in Toronto.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.140
And they just said,
do what you got to do.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.289
So I sold my condominium
and used that money

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:47.350
to just kind of help fund
going to different places.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.600
NELSON BOYCE: And again,
being a first time filmmaker,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.100
not necessarily
having a name that's

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.210
a household name, getting
the likes of Mr. O'Ree

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.910
and some others to participate.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.780
KWAME DAMON MASON: Wasn't easy.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.650
Wasn't easy.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.749
I think at the end of the
day, for me, it was trust.

00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:05.290
You know, I remember
talking to Anson

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.050
on the phone in the early
stages and telling him

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.640
what I wanted to do.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.030
And George Laraque
was a great guy

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.520
that I had known in Edmonton.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.459
So he was the first person,
one of the first NHL guys

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:19.500
that I was able to shoot.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.600
And I already had shot
Mr. Herb Carnegie.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.300
And from there I think
guys started to trust--

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.890
and I was just a pest, man.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.940
I just pestered.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.160
I just called and I
called and I called.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.850
And I mean, the first
time I met Willie--

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.201
ANSON CARTER: I
can attest to that.

00:09:35.201 --> 00:09:36.742
KWAME DAMON MASON:
I just pestered---

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.970
Anson can tell you, man.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.570
I just kind of, hey,
listen, can I interview you?

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.650
Hey, can I interview you?

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.130
Where you going to be?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.060
I'll interview you.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.250
And you know, I literally
rolled up on Mr. O'Ree

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.000
and I said, I'm going
to come to San Diego

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.180
and I'm going to interview you.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.221
And the day I went to San
Diego to interview him,

00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:53.140
he wasn't even at home.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.440
His wife was at home and
she didn't answer the door.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.210
And she's calling,
there's some young guy

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.740
with camera equipment outside.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.250
And he came home and
we did the interview.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.980
But it's just
perseverance, which

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.390
is, to me, the theme
of the film, which is

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.925
perseverance through adversity.

00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:12.040
The adversity for me was,
as a first time filmmaker,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.300
know nobody was going to
give me money for this.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.390
Nobody was going to just
let me into their homes.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.800
I had to keep persevering.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.410
I had to keep telling
them that this

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.060
is something very important.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.490
And I think Anson and those
guys can probably say that.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.650
They saw how serious I was.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.660
So they let me have their time.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.100
NELSON BOYCE: And to stay on
that theme of perseverance

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.391
for a moment-- and we're
going to go deep dive with Mr.

00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:35.110
O'Ree in just a moment-- but can
you give a little bit of color

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.950
around--

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.600
there were many narratives
in the documentary.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.590
But talk a little bit more
about Jaden Lindo and kind

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.092
of how that was kind of a
bit of an anchor in the--

00:10:46.092 --> 00:10:47.800
and he went through
some things, clearly.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800
KWAME DAMON MASON: Yeah.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.090
Well, you know, I wanted
to show a young man that

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.200
was going through his
last year of the OHL,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.420
just his draft year.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.330
And there's a couple other
guys I could have really gone--

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.170
Josh Ho-Sang was slated
to go in the first round,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.640
so that was a big name.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.200
That would be a great story.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.060
But I really wanted
to show somebody

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.940
that I felt was kind of
like an underdog that

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.680
was kind of under
the radar, and just

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.570
to see what would
happen with him.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.781
And Jaden comes from a really
well-established family.

00:11:19.781 --> 00:11:21.280
And one of the
things I wanted to do

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.960
was I wanted to show the black
family unit, mother, father,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.510
and supporting a young kid,
because so many times when

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.210
we see film narratives, you
always have the broken home.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.920
I wanted to show
a complete home,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.710
and I wanted to show that
hockey is something that

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.820
is a very family-oriented sport,
and you need your family there.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.860
So I thought that their
family was a great unit

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.540
and had a great story to tell.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.030
And Jaden was a great kid that
when I first met up with him,

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.460
he was a shy kid.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.300
And just throughout the year
that I kind of worked with him,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.380
his confidence grew.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.709
And unfortunately he
had a knee injury,

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.000
but it didn't stop him from
getting drafted at the end.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.896
And he was able to hear
his name being called.

00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:02.770
And I thought that was
very important to show

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.150
these young kids that you don't
have to be the superstar guy.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.740
But as long as you
work hard, somebody

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.790
is going to recognize that.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.420
NELSON BOYCE: That's right.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.380
That's right.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.190
Perseverance.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.870
KWAME DAMON MASON:
Perseverance through adversity.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.630
NELSON BOYCE: So let's
stay on that theme,

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:20.080
and we're going to transition a
bit over and speak to a living

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.180
legend, Mr. O'Ree,
who in 1958 became

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.670
the first black NHL player.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.214
Mr. O'Ree, clearly you
were featured in the film.

00:12:32.214 --> 00:12:33.880
Tell us a little bit
about your journey.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.100
You're largely and
widely recognized

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.635
as being the Jackie Robinson
of ice hockey, if you will.

00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.010
Tell us a bit
about your journey.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.384
And then talk a little bit
about that comparison and what

00:12:44.384 --> 00:12:46.660
that kind of means to you,
and whether or not you

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.225
are in agreement
with that or not.

00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:49.600
WILLIE O'REE:
Well, first of all,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.780
I had met Jackie Robinson
on two occasions.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.580
I met him in 1949 and then
I met him again in 1962.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.060
But again, I was the
youngest of 13 children.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.290
And I was born in
Fredericton, New Brunswick.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.440
And there were only
my older brother

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.930
and myself that played hockey.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.350
My sisters were into basketball
and some other sports.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:20.230
But at the age of three, I
started skating in my backyard,

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.900
and I started playing organized
hockey at the age of five.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.990
And like all Canadian
boys and girls,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.880
there's ice all over the place.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.860
And I had a rink in my backyard.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.440
I used to skate to school.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.860
And then when I was
14 years of age,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.790
I decided I wanted to become
a professional hockey player.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.260
And thanks to my
older brother, who

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.170
was not only my brother and my
friend, but he was my mentor.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.450
And when he found
out that I wanted

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.230
to play hockey, and hopefully
play professional, and then

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.170
hopefully one day playing in
the National Hockey League,

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.260
he gave me all the support
that a brother could give.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.280
So I left my hometown
at 17, went up to Quebec

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.090
to play my first year junior
with the Quebec Frontenacs.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.240
Coach Phil Watson
was the instructor

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.720
who played with the New York
Rangers back in the 40s.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.160
That was my first year.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.020
My second year I spent in
Kitchener, Ontario, Canada,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:24.410
Coach Black Jack Stewart
was the second coach.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.090
And back then,
none of the players

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.640
wore any helmets,
no face shields.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.910
Goalies didn't wear any masks,
so your face and head was

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.220
exposed to pucks and sticks
and everything else that

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.440
was flying around on the ice.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.160
And an unfortunate accident.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.709
I'm in front of the net,
a slapshot ricocheted.

00:14:40.709 --> 00:14:43.250
The puck come up and struck me
in the right eye, hit me flat,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.720
broke my nose, part of my cheek.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.480
And I remember dropping
down to the ice,

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.480
and the next thing I know I'm
being placed in an ambulance

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.210
and taken to the hospital.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.310
I'm in my hospital bed.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.080
Dr. Henderson was the surgeon,
come in and stood by my bedside

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.780
in my recovery room,
and said Mr. O'Ree,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.640
he says, I'm sorry
to inform you,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.480
he says, the impact of the puck
completely shattered the retina

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.230
in your right eye.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.730
And he says you're
going to be blind

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.500
and you'll never
play hockey again.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.460
Well, I'm 19 years of age,
and the goals and dreams

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.900
that I had set for myself
of playing professional,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.066
and hopefully playing in
the National Hockey League,

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:20.930
were gone.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.610
So I laid in my hospital bed.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.820
And I get out of the hospital
in the next three days.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.000
Within the next 10 days
I'm back on the ice

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.580
practicing and playing.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.920
The only difference
I felt about myself,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.990
I just couldn't see
out of my right eye.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.990
Now imagine being a left hand
shot and playing left wing.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.945
So to compensate, I
had to turn my head

00:15:40.945 --> 00:15:43.070
all the way around to the
right to pick the puck up

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.820
with my left eye.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.430
And I was over skating the
puck and missing the net.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.382
And I said, Willie,
what's wrong?

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:50.340
So I just said, forget
about what you can't see

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.550
and concentrate on
what you can see.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.110
So my game started to pick up.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.460
I started scoring some goals.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.010
And now the season's over.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.220
And I either have to
turn pro the next season

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.540
or play amateur.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.040
And I was keeping
my fingers crossed

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.190
that I would be contacted
by a professional team.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.260
So I returned home
to my hometown.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.140
And Punch Imlach, who was
the coach and general manager

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.010
of the Quebec Aces, the
professional team up in Quebec,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.897
contacted me and
said, Willie, he says,

00:16:17.897 --> 00:16:19.730
I watched you play the
last couple of years,

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.310
he said, I'd like to invite
you to training camp.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.711
So I went to training
camp and I made the team.

00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:26.960
But I didn't disclose the
fact that I couldn't see out

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.626
of my right eye.

00:16:27.626 --> 00:16:28.900
I never took my eye exam.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.525
So I said, if you're good enough
to make the team with one eye,

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:33.620
I said, don't worry about it.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.180
So I made the team.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.980
We won the
championship that year.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.230
That's what gave me the extra
confidence that I needed

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.555
to go on and play pro hockey.

00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:44.930
NELSON BOYCE: That
is incredible.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:53.220
So not only you had the kind
of weight of being pulled up

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.790
with the Bruins after
they had some injuries,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.480
being the first black
player in the NHL,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.630
you had sight only in one
eye this entire time, which

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.869
was an additional load on
top of you at the same time.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:07.619
WILLIE O'REE: Yes.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.250
I went to the Bruins training
camp on two occasions,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.510
in 1957 and '58.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.219
And they didn't
take any eye exams.

00:17:14.219 --> 00:17:16.510
They were more concerned
about your physical condition.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.302
And I always kept
myself in good shape.

00:17:19.302 --> 00:17:21.510
I worked out in the summertime
and worked in the gym.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.400
So when I went to
training camp, I

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.210
was probably one or two pounds
away from my playing weight.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.140
So when they called me
up on January 18, 1958

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.590
to play two games against
the Montreal Canadiens,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.780
when I stepped on
the ice that Saturday

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.446
night in Montreal against
the Montreal Canadiens

00:17:40.446 --> 00:17:41.820
and became the
first black player

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.550
to play in the
National Hockey League,

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.510
it was just a thrill for me.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.410
I was no stranger
to the Montreal fans

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.410
because I had played against
the Montreal Junior Canadians

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.050
in the Forum and played
against the Montreal Royals,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.070
the professional
team in the Forum.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.480
When I skated on the
ice that evening,

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.760
I was just Willie O'Ree
with the Bruins Jersey on.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.600
And I could see fans pointing
in my direction and wondering,

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.335
oh, he's just a black player up
with the Bruins with number 22.

00:18:12.335 --> 00:18:13.710
ANSON CARTER: And
I can tell you,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.168
it's hard enough to play with
two good eyes in the National

00:18:16.168 --> 00:18:17.190
Hockey League.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.709
So to be able to do it
with one is impressive.

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:20.750
NELSON BOYCE: No, listen.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.000
I'm trying to put it all
together in my head about how

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.810
that worked out.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.101
KWAME DAMON MASON: You almost
have to, like, pick a day

00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:28.720
and just walk around like
this and see how hard that is,

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.470
and then imagine--

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.400
ANSON CARTER: A day?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:30.900
An hour.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.299
It's not a day.

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.090
NELSON BOYCE: Yeah.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.580
With flying projectiles at
60 some odd miles an hour.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.310
When you look back on your
professional career, Mr. O'Ree,

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.730
can you recall one particular
moment that was a highlight,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.230
and maybe one
particular moment that

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.910
was a low light for
whatever reason?

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.130
WILLIE O'REE:
Well, the highlight

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.370
was when I first scored my goal
in the National Hockey League.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.880
It was January the first,
New Year's night in Boston

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.640
against the Montreal Canadians.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.180
We're warming up.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.940
One of my teammates,
Bronco Horvath,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.210
said Willie, if you ever get
in on Hodge, keep the puck low.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.590
He's weak on low shots.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.360
Keep it away from his club.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.760
Jacques Plante, who was the
number one goalie, was out,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.170
and Charlie Hodge was
the backup goalie.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.400
So we're skating around and he
says, remember now, if you get

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.410
in low, low on him.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.970
So it was the
third period, and I

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.580
remember I had just
broken away from my check.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.160
And I'm busting
down the left wing.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.530
And Leo Boivin, one
of my defensemen,

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.030
just hit me with a perfect pass.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.680
I didn't have to break stride.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.020
So I'm going in
on the defenseman,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.500
and I go get the
defensemen out of position.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.630
Now I'm going in on Hodge,
and I got my head up,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.990
and all of a sudden I can
hear this, low, Willie, low.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.400
So I go in and shoot the puck.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.229
And it either was right along
the ice or just was off the ice

00:19:50.229 --> 00:19:52.020
and hit the inside of
the post and went in.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.030
That made it three to
one for the Bruins.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.470
And then about
seven minutes later,

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.120
Andre the Pocket Rocket
scored the second goal

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.770
and made it three to two.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.470
But the goal that I scored
was the winning goal.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.730
And the Bruin fans gave me a
two-minute standing ovation.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.880
I'll never forget it.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.980
It was quite an evening.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.730
NELSON BOYCE: That's phenomenal.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.870
And perhaps one low
light, if there is one?

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.600
WILLIE O'REE: A low light?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.880
Yes, a low light.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.440
It was my first
trip into Chicago.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.620
One of the original teams
in the original six.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.559
I was warming up.

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.100
And I won't mention
his name, but one

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.260
of the players,
big right-hander,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.180
came around and gave
me a two-hander right

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.430
across the ankles
as we're warming up.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.877
And he looks up and he's jawin',
and he made a racial remark,

00:20:41.877 --> 00:20:42.960
but that didn't bother me.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.630
So anyway, the warmup's over.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.870
We come out first period.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.352
It's about six minutes
into the first period.

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:51.060
I'm in behind the net
and I got the puck,

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.130
and I dump it out to my winger.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.779
And this player come in, and
he caught me on my blind side.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:57.570
I couldn't see him.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.528
And he stuck about six
inches out on his stick,

00:20:59.528 --> 00:21:03.630
and he hit me and split my nose,
knocked my two front teeth out.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.600
And my teeth just
dropped down on the ice.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.310
And now he's just
standing there.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.360
And he made a racial remark,
but that isn't what set me off.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.470
He just stood there and smiled.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.900
Now he was about six three, and
I was five eight, five nine.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.280
So I took my stick and I hit
him right over the head with it.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.470
And I cut him for a
number of stitches.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.107
And then my stick broke.

00:21:27.107 --> 00:21:28.440
Now I know we're going to fight.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.700
So I dropped my gloves
and he grabbed me.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.000
Much bigger, and he hit
me a couple of times,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.682
and we go back up
against the screen.

00:21:34.682 --> 00:21:36.390
And the first thing
I said, just hold on,

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.640
Willie, just hold onto
him so he can't hit.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.152
Meanwhile the both
benches emptied.

00:21:40.152 --> 00:21:41.610
All the Chicago
Blackhawks come out

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.220
of their bench, all the Bruins
come out of their bench.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.740
was there was 92
minutes in penalties

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.720
assessed on the players.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.200
Now I go into the room, and they
stitch me up and plug my nose.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.300
And at least I want
to come back and sit

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.440
on the bench with the team.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.060
But coach Emile Schmidt
said Willie, he said,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.420
these fans became so
violent that I'm worried

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.160
about you getting bodily harm.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.544
So I had to stay in
the dressing room,

00:22:07.544 --> 00:22:09.960
and they had two police officers
outside the dressing room

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.650
the entire game.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.350
Now this was six minutes
into the first period.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.890
And I stayed in there,
and the first thing I did

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.540
is I just turned the lights out.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.700
And I sat there and
I kind of meditated

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.501
for a couple of minutes.

00:22:22.501 --> 00:22:24.000
And then I turned
the lights back on

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.920
and I said, no, Willie,
I says, if you're

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.740
going to leave the
league, it's not

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.410
because some joker is
trying to get you out.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.240
You have the skills
and ability to play

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.450
in the league at that time.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.800
So basically that was
about the worst one.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.610
The next trip in,
it was not as bad.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.730
But I finally gained
the respect of not

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.320
only the players
on the opposition,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.700
but fans in the stands.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.210
NELSON BOYCE: That's right.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.585
KWAME DAMON MASON: But you
did meet him later on in life.

00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:53.110
WILLIE O'REE: I met
him 30 years later.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.990
KWAME DAMON MASON:
Did you give him one?

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.060
WILLIE O'REE: I met him.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.390
The NHL All-Star
game was in Chicago.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.730
I got an invitation
to the hockey club,

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.560
and then they called
me on the phone.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.644
And I said, well, why are you
inviting me 30 years after I

00:23:07.644 --> 00:23:08.310
left the league?

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.560
Why didn't you invite me
five years or 10 years?

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.960
They said, well, we realize
that you broke the color barrier

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.120
and we'd like you
to come to Chicago.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.140
So my wife and I
went to Chicago.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.380
And I had reunited
with the players

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.060
that I hadn't seen in 30 years.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.610
So we're sitting at a
table seated for ten,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.160
and my wife wanted
a glass of wine.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.610
And there wasn't
any on the table.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.060
So I said, well, I'll go
to the bar and get one.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.290
So I walk out to the bar.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.530
And the bar was
about 30 feet long.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.790
And I walk up and I ask the
bartender, a glass of red wine,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.540
please.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.390
Now who comes beside
me is this gentleman--

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.220
I was just about to say his
name-- but this gentleman I

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.570
had the altercation with.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.660
And he's tall and he looks
down and he says, hello,

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.470
Willie, what's going on?

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.250
Not too bad.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.666
And I said, well,
let's get it on,

00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:01.530
because I was ready
to go after 30 years.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.010
I had his number and I
said, let's get it on here.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.340
But he went this way
and I went that way,

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.630
and we never met again.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.785
But that was about
the only time.

00:24:11.785 --> 00:24:13.410
NELSON BOYCE: Well,
that's good to hear

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.826
because under the
circumstances, I

00:24:14.826 --> 00:24:17.149
can imagine that, over
the course of time,

00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:19.690
you could have had a number of
different incidents like that.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.040
And so this is a story,
certainly, of perseverance,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.874
patience, and evolution.

00:24:25.874 --> 00:24:28.290
And as a function of that,
let's kind of move on and speak

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.090
to Anson for a little bit.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.570
Interestingly enough, there
wasn't another black hockey

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.620
player after Mr.
O'Ree until 1974.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.210
That's quite a bit of time.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.730
And certainly you didn't
start playing in 1974,

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.504
ANSON CARTER: I was born in '74.

00:24:43.504 --> 00:24:44.420
Just goes to show you.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.480
NELSON BOYCE: Want to get your
perspective as a black hockey

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.830
player who had a successful
career, in listening

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.310
to those types of stories, how
the league, from your eyes,

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.260
may have kind of
evolved over time,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.420
and what your
experience in the league

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.766
was like in juxtaposition
to that, and maybe

00:25:02.766 --> 00:25:04.140
some of the things
you've noticed

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.360
as it's evolved over time.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.110
ANSON CARTER: And it's
definitely evolved.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.680
I mean, I know from when
Willie played to when I played,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.790
it's come a long way.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.680
Society in general
has come a long way,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.490
and I would say that sports
mirrors society and vice versa.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.556
But when I was coming up and
playing the National Hockey

00:25:19.556 --> 00:25:21.430
League, there wasn't
very many of us playing.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.160
I mean, it's fortunate.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.220
Kwame was talking about
Edmonton, our team in Edmonton.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.470
We had a lot of black players
on our team in Edmonton.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.430
We had Sean Brown, Joaquin
Gage, myself, George Laraque.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.020
And that's kind
of how I was used

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.620
to playing hockey in Toronto
because I'm from Toronto.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.310
And everyone plays
hockey as a kid.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.900
It doesn't matter
what color you are

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.650
or where your background is.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.400
My parents are
Bajan, from Barbados.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.096
So it was hard
enough to convince

00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:44.220
them to let me play hockey.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.303
My parents, you know, ice?

00:25:45.303 --> 00:25:45.980
What?

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.200
You find ice in your drinks.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.860
That's where you find
ice, not playing hockey.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.990
So that's what I had
to overcome to allow

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.380
them to let me play hockey.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.970
But I was another
black player playing

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.050
on my team in minor hockey.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.180
So it wasn't a big deal
until I went to high school.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.888
And then I went to
high school and hockey

00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:04.320
became a quote,
unquote white sport,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.795
which blew my mind,
because I play basketball,

00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:08.670
I played baseball, I
played every other sport

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:09.180
under the sun.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.555
I actually want
to Michigan State

00:26:10.555 --> 00:26:11.760
to play hockey and baseball.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.870
And I played everything
under the sun.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.930
But I got to high
school and hockey wasn't

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.000
cool again for my black friends.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And it didn't really
register with me

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.010
because I guess my
parents say I'm stubborn.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.260
And I don't really care what
people say, people think.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.320
So I just kept it moving.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.740
I didn't really listen to
what my friends were saying.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.260
And I went to Michigan
State, and a reporter

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.670
said to me one
time, he was like,

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.540
Anson, how does it feel
being a black hockey player?

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540
I sat and looked at him.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.714
I was like, well, I don't
know how it would feel

00:26:36.714 --> 00:26:37.880
to be a white hockey player.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.760
So I couldn't tell.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.840
That's who I am.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.530
That's me.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.837
And I've never thought
about it any differently.

00:26:43.837 --> 00:26:45.420
But coming to the
league, there really

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.530
wasn't, for myself
personally, there

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.970
wasn't any situations
where I had

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.940
any differences with my fellow
teammates because I was black

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.110
and they were white.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.650
Like when my best friend
Janne Niinimaa, Finnish guy,

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.100
couldn't look totally more
different than myself.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.349
Finnish, he's from the north.

00:26:59.349 --> 00:27:00.390
My parents are Caribbean.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.180
I'm from Toronto.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.680
I'm black.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.760
He's white.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.170
And he loves heavy metal.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.557
I love dance hall reggae
music and hip hop.

00:27:06.557 --> 00:27:08.640
And we would always argue
in the drive to the rink

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.010
all the time in Edmonton
because he'd have his Metallica

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.210
blaring, and I'd come and I'd
try to change the station.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.584
And he'd come into
my truck, I've

00:27:14.584 --> 00:27:20.350
got Buju Banton playing, or Jay
Z, or Tupac or someone playing.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.710
But eventually, as we
developed our friendship,

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.064
we became to appreciate
each other's differences.

00:27:26.064 --> 00:27:28.230
So there's times now, there's
like Metallica playing

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.188
in my car, and I'll turn
it up, and my kids are

00:27:30.188 --> 00:27:32.580
like, what in the world are
you listening to, Daddy?

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.690
That's what Ghost
used to listen to,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.490
so I listen to it now,
too, and I appreciate it.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.350
He sends me text messages
all the time saying, well,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.800
hey, listen, I was
listening to a reggae song.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.008
I was like, we're in Finland?

00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:41.970
They play reggae on Sirius?

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.140
But that was the cool
thing about playing hockey.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.662
We all had our differences.

00:27:45.662 --> 00:27:48.120
We might not have interacted
with each other on that level.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.360
Or we might not
have, if we never

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.859
played the game of
hockey, but to be

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:53.560
able to come together and play
at the highest level, I mean,

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.290
it's a beautiful thing.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.230
NELSON BOYCE: Let's talk
about that a little bit more

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.780
for a second.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.400
So having played in the league,
but somebody who was clearly

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.761
talented in other sports.

00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:04.260
And we see a lot of times these
days are athletes that could

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.480
easily play a number
of different--

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.430
what would be your pitch for a
young brother coming up who was

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.680
trying to figure out whether
he wanted to go baseball,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.790
football--

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.110
just making it up, right--

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.280
or hockey.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.244
Like, what would your
pitch to say, join NHL.

00:28:19.244 --> 00:28:20.910
ANSON CARTER: I think
Kwame said it best

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.701
when he was like, you
have to go to a game.

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.240
You need to go
there and experience

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.030
it live to see the size,
the speed, the skill,

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.460
the athleticism, the
hand-eye coordination

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.220
that players need to
play, the reflexes to play

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.990
the game at that level.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.610
That's what will draw you in.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:36.810
I loved playing basketball.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.790
There's no better feeling
than dunking on somebody

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.831
when I played basketball.

00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:40.730
I loved it.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.500
But scoring a goal had
that same exact emotion,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.596
that same feeling of raw energy.

00:28:45.596 --> 00:28:47.970
Hitting a baseball out of the
park, I loved that feeling.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.594
But you score a goal,
same exact thing,

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:52.620
jumping into the glass,
that is pure emotion.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.771
I couldn't find that
in any other sport.

00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:58.020
So I would tell people, and
I tell kids in particular,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.637
go to a game and watch a game.

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:01.470
Once you go to a hockey
game, you're hooked.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.097
I mean, now you've
got HDTV, so it's

00:29:04.097 --> 00:29:06.180
way better than standard
def so you could find out

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.929
where the puck is.

00:29:06.929 --> 00:29:10.180
And I tell hockey fans all the
time, don't follow the puck.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.580
Follow the flow of game.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.240
When you follow the
flow of the game,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.324
the puck's gonna find you.

00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:15.365
NELSON BOYCE: Absolutely.

00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:16.590
And that's a great answer.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.230
And a question for the
three of you, and then we'll

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.810
transition to Jessica here.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.990
But having been most recently
in the league, Anson,

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.870
can you please explain
to folks what a line is?

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.080
And beyond that, kind of
your prediction on when there

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.677
may be a first all black line?

00:29:33.677 --> 00:29:35.760
ANSON CARTER: So we almost
came close in Edmonton.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.310
When it was myself
and Big George,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.590
we would always
petition our coach.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.040
And Craig MacTavish
was our coach,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.420
and I would say, Mac,
let us play together.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.960
We have Brownie, Sean
Brown on defense.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.584
Let Brownie play
forward this one shift

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:48.050
so we can have the
all brother line.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.050
And speaking of brother
line, I was in Vancouver

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.517
a few years ago when I played
my last couple of years

00:29:52.517 --> 00:29:53.100
in the league.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.167
And I had myself
in the Sedin twins.

00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:57.000
And that was our nickname,
the Brother Line,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.210
because Danny and
Hank Sedin and myself.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.254
But I think you're going
to see it eventually.

00:30:02.254 --> 00:30:04.170
I mean, there's going
to be a time when you're

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.440
gonna see enough players
playing on a team

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.210
where they're going to
come together and form

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.230
an all black line.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.090
I think it's only a matter of
time when you see that coming.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.240
Once the numbers start to--

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.350
NELSON BOYCE: Three
years, five years?

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.141
ANSON CARTER: I would
say five years or so.

00:30:16.141 --> 00:30:18.186
It has to start more
at the grassroots level

00:30:18.186 --> 00:30:19.560
that we're seeing
that right now.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.870
You're seeing kids coming up
now playing grassroots hockey.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.578
And once those numbers
start to increase,

00:30:23.578 --> 00:30:26.450
your base increases because when
you're playing at NHL levels,

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.620
it's a pyramid, so you have
the best of the best playing.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.550
But if your base is a lot
wider, than that pyramid up top

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.780
gets a little wider as well.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.649
NELSON BOYCE: Right.

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:36.940
That's a great segue, actually,
to talking with Jessica

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.060
and finding out
a little bit more

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.360
about what the NHL is doing
as it relates to this.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:48.180
NHL, full transparency, one of
the later professional leagues

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.920
to integrate.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.020
But in doing some of
the research for this,

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.250
I was pleasantly surprised
at just the amount

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.610
of operational work that
has gone into diversity

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.340
within the league and continues.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.320
I mean, I read a
little bit about there

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.300
being kind of a mandatory
diversity training

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.540
preseason for folks that
come into the league.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.950
And certainly the work that
you're doing with hockey

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.250
is for everyone.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.010
And having been from growing
up in Flatbush, Brooklyn,

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.490
I am sure that
you've grown up in

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.640
and are aware of
very diverse places

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.140
and have been in
diverse situations.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.450
And clearly your job at
the National Hockey League

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.190
continues to perpetuate that.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.580
Can you tell us a little bit
about the why you guys are

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.200
doing the things
that you're doing,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.930
and give us a sense of how--

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.110
by the way, yes,
Black History Month

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.725
is a time frame that we can
shine the light on the things

00:31:38.725 --> 00:31:40.560
that you're doing, but
how these things are

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.585
happening year round.

00:31:41.585 --> 00:31:42.460
JESSICA BERMAN: Sure.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.060
Thank you.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.950
And on behalf of the NHL,
thank you for hosting this.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.740
We talk a lot about
reaching new audiences.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.490
And so this is a great
opportunity for us.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:51.920
And really appreciate it.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.890
Before I answer your
question, I just have to say,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.180
hearing Anson's story
really hits home for me.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.140
It's the reason
that I do what I do.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.160
It's the reason that I always
wanted to work in sports.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.280
The idea and the platform
that sports brings people

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.370
together is what inspired me
to want to work in sports.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:15.650
From my 16-year-old
birthday, my family

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.904
took me to a hockey game.

00:32:16.904 --> 00:32:18.320
I had never been
to a hockey game.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.930
My brother was a
football player.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.500
I was a cheerleader for
basketball and football games

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.470
and grew up in a very
diverse community.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.610
I went to public school.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:31.640
And there was a
moment at this game

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.700
where the magic of
the game really took

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.490
over, and the energy in the
stands but also on the ice.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.080
And the Islanders scored.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.610
And we were sitting right
behind two gentlemen.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.650
It was a kind of the story
you were just saying,

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.730
a black and a white person who
seemed to not know each other.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.910
And the Islanders scored
and they embraced,

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.850
and they embraced
enthusiastically.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.490
And for those who know me
know I'm quite inquisitive.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.670
And I'm not shy.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.180
So I tapped them on the shoulder
after the moment passed and I

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.250
said, do you guys
know each other?

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.300
And they said no.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.270
Are you season ticket holders?

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.460
Nope.

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.820
Please help me
understand this moment.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.940
I watched you embrace and
cheer and hug and high

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.600
fiving each other's families.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.250
And they said, the moment of
that goal brought us together.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.570
And at that moment, I turned
to my parents, who were with me

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.580
and said, I need
to work in hockey.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.530
And that could have
probably happened

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.580
in other venues
and other contexts.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.520
But having grown
up in a place that

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.030
was challenged
with racial issues,

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.020
I was always very interested
in how to bridge gaps

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.530
in our community, in Brooklyn.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.030
And that moment was like, well,
this is the path to do that.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.030
This creates that unification,
that platform where

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.920
all of the differences
strip away,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.590
and the pure passion
that exists just

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.780
brings them together instantly.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.170
And what I was always wondering
is if those two people saw

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.002
each other outside of that
venue, is there carryover?

00:34:09.002 --> 00:34:11.210
That was the thing that
always sort of fascinated me,

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.060
and still fascinates me when I
work on diversity initiatives,

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.159
and the idea that
sports is a place where

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.364
we can model that behavior.

00:34:17.364 --> 00:34:18.739
And your story
with your teammate

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.070
really hits home for me.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.030
And is there carry over
beyond that person?

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.940
So do you look at--

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.440
and does he look
at-- people who are

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.260
different from him
in a different way,

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.760
through a different lens, after
having that experience where

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.497
your mind was
opened to his world,

00:34:34.497 --> 00:34:36.080
and his mind was
opened to your world?

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.489
So that's just--

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:39.496
I had to share that
because I'd never

00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:40.579
heard that story from you.

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:40.940
NELSON BOYCE: No,
that's important.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.360
It's great foundationally.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.996
JESSICA BERMAN:
And that's really

00:34:42.996 --> 00:34:44.120
what draws me to what I do.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.194
But to answer your
question, the NHL has been--

00:34:48.194 --> 00:34:49.610
and probably a lot
of people don't

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.639
know it-- has been working on
diversity initiatives for more

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:53.989
than 20 years.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:58.820
We hired Willie in 1998 as
our diversity ambassador.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:02.450
He has been traveling
from city to city,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:07.250
market to market, inspiring
the next generation of people,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.330
but also hockey players, to give
our sport a try, whether you're

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.100
a fan or a player.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.700
And when we think
about why we do that,

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.000
and we challenge
ourselves as to the why,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.050
I think there's
really three reasons.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.056
The first is that--

00:35:24.056 --> 00:35:25.680
and the commissioner
always says this--

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.660
it's the right thing to do.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.110
We believe in equality.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.110
And we believe that
everybody should have access

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.350
to our sport.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.620
And so we always do it because
it's the right thing to do.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.630
And the values of our sport
really perpetuate that

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.040
and make that authentic.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.050
You see it in the people
who have played our sport,

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.690
and you hear Anson
and you hear Willie.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.817
And really, if you
know hockey players,

00:35:47.817 --> 00:35:49.650
whether they're playing
at the highest level

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.860
or even in a grassroots
program, hockey players

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:58.740
are unique in that they
have these values that

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.280
are all about teamwork and
humility and resilience

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.190
and hard work and
sacrifice and dedication.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.310
And it really creates
an environment

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:15.060
where we say with our partners,
if you can play, you can play.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.420
If you can contribute
as a member of our team,

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.950
we want you on our team.

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.270
And we were actually
talking earlier,

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.210
and both Willie
and Anson have both

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.350
said although they experienced
racial slurs from fans

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.660
and definitely from
opposing players,

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.530
among their teammates they
didn't experience that.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.330
And that's because
our sport is really

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.460
all about what you
bring to the table, so

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.290
the culture of our sport.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.410
The second thing
is that we know--

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.950
particularly today, more
than ever before and even

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.630
for the last five or 10 years--

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.720
there's a demographic shift
happening in North America.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.760
And we want to be relevant.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.970
We want to bring new
audiences into our game.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:59.460
And so from a Hockey is
for Everyone perspective,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.812
this is, in addition to being
Black History Month, also

00:37:01.812 --> 00:37:03.270
Hockey is for
Everyone month, which

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.320
is a month where we shine a
light on all of the diversity

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.350
inclusion, activities,
initiatives, partnerships,

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.720
community engagement that all
of our teams and the league do.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.430
Of course, they
do that year round

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.400
through grassroots programming
and Boys and Girls Club

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.310
support, and all kinds
of other outreach

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:24.720
into diverse communities.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.780
But February is a time
where we celebrate that.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.810
So again, the second
reason is really just

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.910
to introduce our game
to new audiences.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.090
And then the third
is kind of going back

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.040
to what everyone was
just talking about,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.300
which is we need to increase
the diversity and the pipeline

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.440
into our game.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.860
And so we have 26 Hockey
is for Everyone programs

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.850
across North America that
bring tens of thousands of kids

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.270
into our game.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:56.670
We're working on strategies
to help them to transition

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.100
into competitive
hockey because playing

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.460
the game at a recreational
level is really important,

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.380
and we want people to be able
to do it on a casual basis.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.770
But if we want to change
the demographic of who's

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.180
playing on the NHL on our stage,
and we all know the saying,

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.580
you have to see it
to want to be it,

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.190
we need to find ways to
help people to transition

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.140
to elite hockey
who look different

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.950
from our traditional
population of players.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:26.370
So I would say those are kind
of the three reasons of the why.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.800
NELSON BOYCE: That's great
reasons, great reasons.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.216
And it really shines a light
on the uniqueness of the sport

00:38:32.216 --> 00:38:33.340
and what you all are doing.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:39.060
And these stories really
give context around all of it

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.590
and make it real.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.840
And for me personally, Kwame,
the work that you've done

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.950
has really opened up my
world to the sport in a way

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.140
that I could have
never imagined,

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.419
and has gotten me interested.

00:38:53.419 --> 00:38:54.960
I mean, I've been
to one hockey game.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.160
I will tell you the truth.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.870
I've been to one professional
hockey game and it's everything

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.536
you said it was.

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:05.170
I mean, very large individuals
who have grace and talent.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.800
And there's a lot of beauty
in the sport when you really

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.600
get the opportunity
to view it live.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.550
And now to really
kind of understand

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.100
the framework and the
tapestry that is behind it

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.417
all really makes it so
much more meaningful.

00:39:20.417 --> 00:39:22.500
So I thank you, Kwame, for
bringing that to light.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.290
And please, in our
last minute or so

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.660
before we open it up the
questions on the floor,

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.570
very interested in understanding
what might be next from you

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:31.515
in this realm.

00:39:31.515 --> 00:39:33.140
KWAME DAMON MASON:
You know, I really--

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.100
it's weird.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.600
Not to say I don't
know what's next.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:44.250
But I know my passion lies
in hockey and seeing it grow.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.230
I've been very fortunate.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.260
You've got to understand,
when I left my job in radio,

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.000
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.940
I had no source of income.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.260
I just felt like I needed
to be with these people.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.060
I need to be with this
group of people from the NHL

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.780
to help grow the game.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.730
And I kind of--

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.190
I figured, I was like, OK, well,
how do you put in a resume?

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:11.554
Why don't you make a film?

00:40:11.554 --> 00:40:13.970
Why don't you show them that
you want to be a part of this

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.178
and you want to help it grow?

00:40:15.178 --> 00:40:19.210
And I've just been fortunate
to work with Jessica.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.390
Last year they had me on
the road showing the film

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.140
and talking about it.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.280
And what I want to
do next is I want

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.120
to help grow the game by telling
stories and doing whatever

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.800
I can to get people in the
stands because like we say,

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.650
get them into the arena.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.780
I always sit back
and think, what

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.330
if Shaquille O'Neal's
parents said, play hockey?

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.330
What if Kobe Bryant's
parents said, play hockey?

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.760
What if LeBron James'
parents said, play hockey?

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.280
And those kids are
out there right now.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.610
And for the black community,
I feel we sometimes

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.350
put ourselves in a box.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.080
We say, this is what we do
and this is what we don't do.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.200
When I grew up, hockey
was the white boy sport.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.080
And I was one of those kids
who put myself in a box.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.780
And because my friends
were predominantly black

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.670
and they listened to hip hop,
I just did what they did.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.430
But I loved this
game of hockey, but I

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:14.200
felt like, oh well,
I guess that's what

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.052
the white boys play.

00:41:15.052 --> 00:41:17.510
Then the white friends I had
said, well, blacks don't play.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.370
It's too cold.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.590
Or your ankles are
too short or small.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:24.340
All these idiotic stereotypes.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.090
And I was just like, OK, and
you have to argue with them.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.560
But I just had no context.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.820
I didn't have that ammunition to
say, no, there's Willie O'Ree.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.737
There's Herb Carnegie.

00:41:33.737 --> 00:41:35.194
There was the
Colored Hockey League

00:41:35.194 --> 00:41:37.060
of Nova Scotia that was
around in the 1800s.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.330
The first professional sports
organization for blacks

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:41.180
was hockey.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.570
It wasn't basketball, it
wasn't football, it was hockey.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.250
Why are we not celebrating that?

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.920
And so putting that
film together is--

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.030
because of people like you
that didn't think twice

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.660
of the game--

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.450
but if I showed it to you,
put some nice little hip hop

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:56.032
in there--

00:41:56.032 --> 00:41:58.198
NELSON BOYCE: That did not
go unnoticed, by the way.

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:02.620
KWAME DAMON MASON: I thought
that it would make someone

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.144
go, oh, wait a second.

00:42:04.144 --> 00:42:05.560
NELSON BOYCE: Yeah,
you caught me.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.600
You caught me.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.189
Well, listen, folks, we've got
about eight or so minutes left.

00:42:11.189 --> 00:42:12.730
I want to make sure
that we open this

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.700
up to Googlers who are
in the audience who

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.900
would like to ask some
questions to the esteemed panel.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.910
We've got mics on both sides.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:28.750
So if folks have questions,
please let's get into it.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:32.479
We'll start on this side and
we'll just go back and forth.

00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:34.020
AUDIENCE: Everyone,
my name is Chris.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.895
Thanks so much for coming out
and speaking to us all today.

00:42:36.895 --> 00:42:39.160
It's been really
awesome to hear.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.374
So one of my questions is
around kind of like the grass

00:42:42.374 --> 00:42:44.290
roots, and Anson, like
you were talking about,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.560
kind of like the triangle
and expanding that base.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.780
It's great to hear about
the grassroots efforts.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.080
But playing hockey
myself, a massive part

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.410
of trying to go pro is kind of
facing that point when you're

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.980
maybe 15, 16, 17 years old,
you're going to leave home,

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.990
you're going to go to
a city, play for a team

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.310
where you don't
really know anyone,

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.750
you maybe don't have
a support system,

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.250
you've got to go
play juniors to try

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.440
to get to that next
level, or private school,

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.470
for that matter.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:14.320
So my thought is what is
being done at those areas

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.140
to kind of offer that
support system for, maybe,

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:22.630
the one kid of color who
is now out of his comfort

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.154
zone for the first time and
maybe facing some adversity

00:43:26.154 --> 00:43:27.070
when it comes to that?

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.400
Are there thoughts of
support in the junior ranks

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.941
to try to progress people?

00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:34.440
ANSON CARTER: You want to handle
that or should I take that?

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:34.780
JESSICA BERMAN: You can start.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.972
I'll piggy back on you.

00:43:35.972 --> 00:43:38.180
ANSON CARTER: So I'm not
sure about the junior ranks.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.830
I just know with myself, what
I do on a day to day basis.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.780
A lot of times people
reach out to me

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.550
when they hear
there's a black hockey

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:46.690
player playing somewhere.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.650
And they say, hey, Anson, do
you mind talking to him or her,

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:52.084
and give them words of wisdom?

00:43:52.084 --> 00:43:54.250
Kind of let them know exactly
what you went through,

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.900
because a lot of times
what I went through

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.025
was probably similar to
what they are going through

00:43:58.025 --> 00:44:00.130
or they're going
to probably deal

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:02.000
with at some point
in their career.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.512
So I'm not afraid to reach
out to different players.

00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:05.720
And it doesn't really matter.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.479
Like Kwame, for example, passed
me Joshua Ho-Sang's number when

00:44:09.479 --> 00:44:11.020
he played for the
New York Islanders,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.228
and he's been in the minors
back and forth right now.

00:44:13.228 --> 00:44:15.599
And Josh was professional,
not a junior kid,

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.140
but he went through
some tough things

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.270
during training camp
there with the Islanders.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.780
And he slept in.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.272
He was getting this bad rap.

00:44:22.272 --> 00:44:24.480
I think part of it was
because he was a black player,

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.230
you're looked at a
little bit differently.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.670
So I picked up the phone
and I made a phone call.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.700
Ii was like, hey, Josh,
we never met before,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.020
but you're messing up.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.810
And I didn't use
that exact language,

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:36.370
but because we're here and--

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.912
NELSON BOYCE: We
appreciate that too.

00:44:37.912 --> 00:44:40.203
ANSON CARTER: You're messing
up, and I'll tell you why.

00:44:40.203 --> 00:44:42.010
I didn't go through
what I went through,

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.676
or Willie didn't go through what
he went through for you to come

00:44:44.676 --> 00:44:46.710
next and set us all back.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.650
You know what I mean?

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.000
So we're not to the point
now where you could screw up

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.700
and everyone's going
to think it's OK.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.230
You're still a
black hockey player

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.790
and we're still the
minority in the sport,

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.456
and there isn't that
many of us playing.

00:44:56.456 --> 00:44:59.050
So you've got to to make sure
you do things properly to set

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.230
the next guy up the right way.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.540
And I thought it went through
one ear and went out the other.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.390
I didn't hear from the
kid at all for a year.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:09.930
And then I'm with
Kwame and Willie

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.240
at a Hockey in Harlem
event last year.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.920
And this lady walks up to
me and she starts crying.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.430
And brunette, she was
white, just to let you know,

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.530
just put it in context for you.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.360
And she's like crying
and she's bawling.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.440
I was like, what's up?

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.150
And she's like, I
want to thank you.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.470
I said thank me for what?

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.595
She goes, because you
change someone's life.

00:45:30.595 --> 00:45:31.910
I go, changed someone's life?

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:34.118
And I'm there with the Deputy
Commissioner Bill Daly,

00:45:34.118 --> 00:45:36.720
and Bill Daly was like,
is this lady like--

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.220
this lady.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.830
And I was like,
have we met before?

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:41.660
And she's like we
haven't met before.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.720
I was like, so put
this together for me.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.060
And she's like,
I'm Josh's mother.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.430
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.470
And she's like, he
didn't call me back.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.056
I know that.

00:45:52.056 --> 00:45:54.180
But what you said to him
really made a huge impact.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.846
And you didn't have
to reach out to him,

00:45:55.846 --> 00:45:58.140
but we appreciate you
reaching out and passing

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.390
on what you had to say to him.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.089
And now he gets it.

00:46:01.089 --> 00:46:03.380
So I think it's a responsibility
for people like myself

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.450
and people that are still
involved in the game

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.904
that we see Willie doing on a
day to day basis with Hockey

00:46:07.904 --> 00:46:08.570
is for Everyone.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.944
He travels around, he reaches
out and touches these kids.

00:46:10.944 --> 00:46:14.030
And I think my responsibility
as a former pro,

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.250
now on national
TV with NBC or MSG

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.440
to reach out to these people
and these kids as well

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.260
and let them know
what I see to make

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.610
their life a little bit easier.

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:23.840
NELSON BOYCE: And
Jessica, do you have any--

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.464
KWAME DAMON MASON:
So just to piggyback

00:46:25.464 --> 00:46:31.040
on what he said, one of the
things, like with Jaden,

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.486
when he was in
that draft year, I

00:46:33.486 --> 00:46:36.110
would take him when I was doing
interviews and stuff like that,

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.276
I would take him to meet
these guys because I always

00:46:38.276 --> 00:46:40.794
thought that that's what they
need, that support system.

00:46:40.794 --> 00:46:42.710
Mike Marsden, who was
the second black athlete

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:45.020
to play in the
NHL, got in there.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.210
And he was 18 years
old and he was

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.550
told to be that
black superstar that

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.890
was going to come out there,
play in Washington, DC,

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.530
because Washington, DC at that
time was predominantly black.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.130
But it didn't go the
way we all wanted it.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.984
And he just kept going down
and going down, gaining weight.

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.900
And the one thing he
used to tell me was there

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.090
was no support system for me.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.977
So if he had other
black athletes that he

00:47:06.977 --> 00:47:08.060
could talk to and lean on.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.476
He only had one
other black player

00:47:09.476 --> 00:47:11.030
that played with
him, Bill Riley,

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.450
but it was just the two of them.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.760
But if he had that
support system,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.176
things would have
changed for him.

00:47:15.176 --> 00:47:16.760
So I think that's
one of the things

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.880
that Anson and Kevin
Weeks do, and I

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.960
hope that the league will
encourage more of them

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.990
to do, which is to reach
out to these young guys

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.010
and just say hello,
how are you doing?

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.296
How's your game going?

00:47:30.296 --> 00:47:31.420
What are you going through?

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.128
What do you need?

00:47:32.128 --> 00:47:33.020
Let's talk.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.580
Because that's
the way it's going

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.220
to grow because sometimes
these young black players

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.590
in these small areas,
they feel alone.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:44.000
And lastly, when the film
debuted on the NHL Network,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.740
I got messages, text messages,
tweets from parents saying

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.080
that they sat down with
the kids to watch the film,

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.925
and their kid wanted
to get back out there

00:47:52.925 --> 00:47:54.980
and play because they
thought they were alone.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.020
They thought they were going
through this on their own.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.478
But when they saw
the film and they

00:47:58.478 --> 00:48:00.620
saw what Anson and
William and all these guys

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.501
went through, they said,
OK, they persevered,

00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:04.250
I can persevere through
adversity as well.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.590
NELSON BOYCE: And then
quickly, Jessica, from an NHL

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:08.090
institutional perspective?

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.820
We'll take a couple
more questions.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.528
I think we've got a
little bit more time.

00:48:11.528 --> 00:48:13.500
JESSICA BERMAN: I'll be brief.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.900
I think there's extra challenges
for minority groups for sure.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.250
But the challenges that
you are identifying

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:20.690
are challenges for everyone.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.780
I mean, it's hard for everybody
to leave home, definitely

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.880
more so when you're from
a minority population

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.250
and you feel that
extra pressure.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.600
I'll just say from an NHL
institutional perspective,

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.660
we've been meeting for
the last three years

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.120
with all the governing
bodies to talk about ways

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.060
to open up pathways to the NHL.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.920
So hopefully they'll
be more to come.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.630
We actually announced
in September

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:44.300
our Declaration of
Principles as a product

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.150
of those conversations, which
is a stake in the ground value

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.290
statement that 17 leading hockey
organizations signed on to.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:54.680
It's kind of like our mission
statement, which is that hockey

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.920
is more than a game.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.700
And the benefit
hockey gives you is

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.470
to build character, life skills,
and all about breaking down

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.970
barriers.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.640
So those discussions
kind of range

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.260
from grassroots all
the way up through

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.980
juniors all the way up to
minors, NHL, international.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.860
So hopefully there'll
be more to come on ways

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.721
that we can increase all
those pathways to the NHL.

00:49:15.721 --> 00:49:16.720
NELSON BOYCE: Fantastic.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.970
I want to get everybody in.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:19.550
I think we started
just a little bit late,

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.966
so maybe they'll
grant us a couple

00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:22.400
more minutes to get through.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.858
But we'll go over here, and
then we'll come back over here,

00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:25.910
and then we'll wrap up.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:26.451
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:26.451 --> 00:49:28.377
Thank you all so much
for coming again.

00:49:28.377 --> 00:49:29.960
In addition to growing
our player base

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.790
in terms of diversity,
I think we also,

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:34.779
as hockey fans, want to grow our
fan base in terms of diversity.

00:49:34.779 --> 00:49:37.070
And so I'd be interested in
hearing the panel's opinion

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.800
on what things we should
be doing as hockey fans

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.700
and as a hockey community
to make ourselves a more

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.032
open environment for them.

00:49:46.032 --> 00:49:47.990
KWAME DAMON MASON: I
think if you know somebody

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.150
in the minority community
that's never been,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.910
encourage them to go to a game.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.347
I think that's one of
the best things to do

00:49:54.347 --> 00:49:56.930
is to say, hey, come to a game
with me and just give it a try.

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:58.730
They might be like,
oh, it's too cold,

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.880
or I don't have-- just be
like, listen, put on a jacket.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.880
Let's go.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.046
And just get them into an
arena and just expose them

00:50:05.046 --> 00:50:05.800
to the game.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.758
It doesn't even have to
be a professional game.

00:50:07.758 --> 00:50:10.110
It could be a minor league
game because games are games,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:12.084
and they're just fun to watch.

00:50:12.084 --> 00:50:14.250
JESSICA BERMAN: I'll say,
from a policy perspective,

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.350
we talk a lot at
the league level

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:18.190
about creating an
inclusive environment.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:22.140
So I think part of that is us
making sure we have proper fan

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.720
code of conduct and
that everybody's

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.460
on board as to what is and
isn't appropriate behavior.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.130
But I always say it's
also the fans' job

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.100
to create a peer to
peer accountability.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.280
So when I'm in the stands,
even with my family,

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.780
and I hear
inappropriate language,

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.670
I'll say something
to them, like we

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.800
don't want that in our arena.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.999
And you can even see
NHL teams during Hockey

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:45.790
is for Everyone month--
actually yesterday,

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:49.530
the Pittsburgh Penguins
responded to some negative

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:53.220
on social and said, we
don't want that in our game.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:57.780
And so the louder and more
engaged the positive message

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:02.260
is, the more those people
who are negative and creating

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.880
a non-inclusive environment
will quiet down and go away.

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.650
And that'll open up
the pathways for more

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.400
nontraditional audience
to enjoy our game.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.950
AUDIENCE: So I think it's really
outrageous that Willie is not

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.450
in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.279
What can we do to change that?

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.320
ANSON CARTER: Hear, hear.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.444
You're of late to the fight
right now because we've

00:51:25.444 --> 00:51:27.050
been [INAUDIBLE] already.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.400
We're kind of working
behind the scenes.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.830
I know several
different guys that

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:34.187
are on the panel that
decides who gets in.

00:51:34.187 --> 00:51:35.770
I put the bug in Luc
Robitaille's ear,

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:37.570
Bob McKenzie, David Poile.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:41.120
I'm all over these guys
nonstop because Willie

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.450
is a living legend.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:44.990
And I know not only what
he's done for my career

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.190
to allow me to play in the
National Hockey League,

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.110
but also other players.

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.318
You see these other superstars
from around the world.

00:51:49.318 --> 00:51:51.452
Alex Ovechkin will
embrace Willie O'Ree.

00:51:51.452 --> 00:51:53.160
And we talk about
hockey is for everyone.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.451
It's not just minority players.

00:51:54.451 --> 00:51:56.990
It's European players, Finnish
players, Swedish players,

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.680
Russian players.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.360
There was a time when European
players weren't accepted

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.610
in the National Hockey League.

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:04.220
You heard terms like
Chicken Swede, or Russians,

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.642
you can't count
on them, or Finns

00:52:05.642 --> 00:52:07.850
have no clue what they're
doing out there on the ice.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:10.621
But part of what Willie does
in breaking down barriers

00:52:10.621 --> 00:52:12.870
is letting people know that
we can all play this game.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.510
So absolutely he
can be a builder.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.800
Since 1998, Hockey for Everyone,
over 120,000 kids Willie's

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.397
been engaged with and
had conversations with,

00:52:22.397 --> 00:52:24.980
encouraging them to play hockey
and the life lessons that come

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.210
around with playing hockey.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.439
If that's not a builder,
I don't know what is.

00:52:28.439 --> 00:52:29.230
AUDIENCE: I'm sold.

00:52:33.761 --> 00:52:35.510
NELSON BOYCE: We'll
take one more question

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.979
and then we'll wrap up.

00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:38.520
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.340
Thank you all so much
for coming to speak here.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.220
So this Wednesday
I went to a talk

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.100
on the future of
skating in New York.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:50.420
And someone there
asked a question

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:54.050
about why, in New York
City, the home of three NHL

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.270
franchises and the NHL
itself, that the state

00:52:57.270 --> 00:53:01.460
of skating and playing hockey
in general is so dismal.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.950
You know, part of why it's
so hard to get into hockey

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.170
is that it's
hideously expensive,

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.150
and it's hard to get ice time.

00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:12.290
And people in New York
who want to play hockey,

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.896
if they get serious
about it, they leave.

00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:18.907
I was just wondering what you
all have to say about that.

00:53:18.907 --> 00:53:20.990
KWAME DAMON MASON: New
York is a basketball state.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.780
I'm not sure what the different
communities are doing,

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:30.090
but I think you have to
look at it in stages.

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.810
And I think you have to
go into these communities,

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:38.210
get them interested in something
as basic as street hockey

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.300
and ball hockey.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.910
And once you start to attract
kids in the communities

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.430
and to see how much
fun that is, it

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:48.470
will transition to
wanting to skate.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:51.350
And then parents and
families in these communities

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:55.310
are going to try to petition
to get these arenas going.

00:53:55.310 --> 00:53:57.770
So I think that's
one way of doing it.

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.907
And hopefully it will grow.

00:53:58.907 --> 00:54:00.990
ANSON CARTER: You're seeing
a lot of organizations

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.802
now, too, building arenas
in prospective cities.

00:54:04.802 --> 00:54:05.510
That's important.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.510
That will come with lowering
the costs of playing hockey.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:11.750
Being from Toronto,
there's a rink every block,

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.220
like Starbucks here, basically.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.440
Hockey's not that expensive.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.494
But I hear you're saying
about the limited ice time

00:54:18.494 --> 00:54:19.410
here in New York City.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:21.080
I think everything in New
York in general is expensive,

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.890
period.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:24.800
But having additional rinks,
and a lot of these organizations

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.540
are doing that right now.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.450
And you're asking about trying
to get nontraditional fans

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:30.572
to get engaged.

00:54:30.572 --> 00:54:32.780
Kwame is talking about maybe
have them come to games,

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.320
but also just get
them to try skating.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.361
And just try skating, and
seeing how difficult it

00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:37.670
is to get up and down the ice.

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:39.296
And I've got two
daughters nine and 11.

00:54:39.296 --> 00:54:41.753
And they can skate now, but
the first time they figured out

00:54:41.753 --> 00:54:44.050
how to skate and not
actually fall on their butts,

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.502
they're like wow,
this is amazing.

00:54:45.502 --> 00:54:47.210
And then I brought
them to a hockey game,

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:48.300
and that took it a
whole different level,

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.420
because they're like,
well, OK, skating is tough,

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.370
but now these guys
are doing this

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.820
on the ice while someone
trying to take their head off

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.530
at the same time?

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:56.970
This is out of control.

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:59.510
So I think the combination
of all those things.

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:00.929
You're seeing Adidas now.

00:55:00.929 --> 00:55:01.970
They're getting involved.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:03.553
Kwame was talking
about street hockey.

00:55:03.553 --> 00:55:05.000
I think that's
probably the lowest

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.980
level that we start
looking at trying to get

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.420
the stick in kids' hands.

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.500
Stick and a ball.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.730
And once you have that
feeling of playing the game,

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.480
then you want to take
it to the next level

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.890
because I didn't start playing
hockey as an ice skater.

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.350
I started as a
ball hockey player.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:19.766
I played street
hockey in Toronto.

00:55:19.766 --> 00:55:21.120
I was a street hockey wizard.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.196
All my friends were like,
oh, you can't skate.

00:55:23.196 --> 00:55:24.320
And I had no comeback then.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.380
I was like, you're right.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.260
It's true, you're right.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.760
But then I figured
out how to skate,

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.040
and then I could
start chirping back.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.470
So I learned from a young
age how important skating is.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.230
So I think skating and
just playing ball hockey

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:40.430
are probably one of the
keys to that entry level way

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.649
into figuring out if you want to
play the game of hockey or not.

00:55:43.649 --> 00:55:45.440
JESSICA BERMAN: I'll
just share two things.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.290
First, you'd be surprised at
how many NHL players didn't

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:50.090
start playing ice hockey.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:52.970
They played street
hockey, roller hockey.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:57.860
It's actually quite staggering
when you look at it.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.900
I think in addition
to providing access

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.480
to alternative
forms of the game,

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.230
there needs to be a
culture shift in terms

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:06.800
of allowing those players who
are not playing ice hockey

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.870
and not playing elite
hockey to define themselves

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:09.720
as hockey players.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.900
So if you play street
hockey and someone says,

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:14.870
do you play hockey, I want those
people say, yeah, I play hockey

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:16.700
because hockey is hockey.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.490
And so I think we're trying
to do a lot more in terms

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:22.250
of inclusive
messaging on everyone

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.980
who plays hockey is part
of the hockey family so

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.770
that those people who are
asked, do you play hockey,

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:30.770
are you a hockey fan, and
they play in their garage

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.750
or in their driveway, can say
yeah, I'm a hockey player.

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:36.710
I think the second thing,
in terms of access to ice,

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:40.395
is that the NHL has invested
a lot of resources in intro

00:56:40.395 --> 00:56:43.520
to the game, learn to play
programs for ages five to nine

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.697
with the idea that there's a
little bit of a chicken and egg

00:56:46.697 --> 00:56:49.280
scenario where if you do it--
we were just talking about it up

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.690
there, about building rinks.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:53.600
Well, who's going to play in
them, because our program's

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.910
oversubscribed,
supply and demand,

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.620
from an economic
perspective, and you're

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.140
talking about public
private partnerships.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.730
What are they
going to invest in?

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.700
They want to benefit
their communities,

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.430
so we need to show the demand.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.190
And in order to
show the demand, we

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.750
need to expand the
funnel at the bottom.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:13.730
And so we're really doubling
down on that five to nine

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.900
age range so that we can show
that demand in the community

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:18.770
at a young age.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:21.920
And that, hopefully,
will spur more investment

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.230
in facilities, which will
help break down barriers

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:27.254
from an infrastructure
perspective.

00:57:27.254 --> 00:57:28.670
NELSON BOYCE: Well,
listen, folks.

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:31.790
I hope that all of you
are as enlightened as I

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:33.440
am after today's discussion.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.410
And certainly after having seen
the documentary, if you haven't

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:38.630
seen it, make sure that you do.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:41.899
It's been great to have
you all take the time

00:57:41.899 --> 00:57:43.940
so that we could share in
your experiences, which

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.389
have been very meaningful
and heartfelt to me.

00:57:46.389 --> 00:57:47.930
And certainly from
an NHL standpoint,

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:49.880
really giving us a
window and transparency

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.560
into all the great things
that you guys are doing that

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.480
continue to grow and
diversify the sport.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.710
JESSICA BERMAN: Are
you a hockey fan now?

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:55.790
NELSON BOYCE: I am
a hockey fan now.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:57.540
I promise I'm gonna
be going to see games.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.480
Let's thank all
of our panelists.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.625
Thank you all very much.

00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:03.124
Thank you.

00:58:03.124 --> 00:58:04.910
Really appreciate it.

00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:07.100
Thanks, everyone, for coming.
