00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:19.770
PIA SORENSEN: So, welcome.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.000
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
Who is here for the first time?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.260
I love that.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.760
Wonderful!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.500
Welcome.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.380
So this is the Science of
Cooking Public Lecture Series,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.345
and we do this every Monday at 7:00 PM.

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.080
And very soon, I'm about to
introduce Sandor Katz, who

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.320
is going to talk to us about
all things fermentation.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.510
But first I just want to
put this into context.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.760
So who was here last week?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.720
Wonderful.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.090
So for those of you who are
new, you know that we're

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.081
playing a little game every week?

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:51.580
Yeah?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.150
Do you know?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.490
So if you paid very
careful attention to what

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.610
happened last week when Chef
Lydia Bastianich was here,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.250
you had the chance to win prizes.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.390
And in order to do that, you
have to answer a question.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:12.310
The prize is these aprons, which I'm
going to try to do with one hand--

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.246
aprons with equations.

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:16.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.580
So we clap for equations.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100
So Lydia made risotto.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.540
And she said it's very important
to make risotto in a wide saucepan

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.910
rather than in a deep saucepan.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.650
Why is that?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.224
Yes.

00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:38.423
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.840
The increased area of the saucepan
allows all the greens to cook evenly.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.550
Anything else you may want to add?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.940
Yeah.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.500
Good.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.360
There's more area for
liquid to evaporate.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.130
OK.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.810
Next question.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.540
As Chef Lydia slowly cooked
the rise for the risotto,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.830
a component that contributes to
that creamy base of the risotto

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.580
was pulled out of the
rice and into the sauce.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.930
What is the name of this component,
and what kind of macromolecule is it?

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.120
That's two questions.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.540
But you get an apron.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.130
Anyone?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.122
Yeah.

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:31.924
AUDIENCE: A starch and a carbohydrate?

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:34.340
PIA SORENSEN: Do you know the
name of the specific starch?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.220
Anyone?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.226
Yeah?

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:39.200
AUDIENCE: Amylopectin.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.144
PIA SORENSEN: Amylopectin.

00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:44.096
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.890
OK, I think this one is easier.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.800
So Chef Lydia claims that it is very
important that the stock is hot.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.780
So she had a pot of
risotto, and then she

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.640
had a stock which she was adding to
the risotto just one little at a time.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.810
And she claimed that it's very important
that this stock is also kept hot.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.200
It can't be at room temperature.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.580
Is it true that it has to be hot?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.950
OK, raise your hand.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.470
Yes.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.910
It is important.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.455
I could have asked you to show me why.

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:35.370
So if you were here, you remember the
equation of the week, which was this.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.220
And if you were a student in
this class, on your homework--

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.360
which is actually due tomorrow,
so please don't spread the word--

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.050
you would have calculated how much this
affects the temperature of the stock.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.670
So if you add, early
in the cooking process,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.900
you add one ladle stock to it-- you
don't have to pay attention to this--

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.400
the final temperature, after you've
added a ladle of stock to your risotto,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.990
is 72 degrees Celsius if you do
it early in the cooking process.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.250
If you do it late in the
cooking process, it's about 82.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.490
So yes, adding that
ladle of stock actually

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.200
does bring the temperature down by like
20 or 10 degrees, which you can imagine

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.940
is enough to actually not really keep
the risotto at the right temperature.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.160
So these equations
are useful, sometimes.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.230
OK, so that's it for aprons.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.930
So last week, we cooked with heat.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.600
Lydia added all kinds
of things to water,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.750
but basically what she did, from
a scientific standpoint, was

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.050
she added grains to water
and then she added heat.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.550
And then she waited.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.780
That was basically it.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.290
This week, we're going
to cook with microbes.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.240
So you would think at first glance
that these are kind of opposite ways

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.800
to cook.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.050
Most of you know that
adding heat to food

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.770
is what sanitizes food,
is what kills microbes.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.650
And when we cook with microbes,
as Sandor will tell us,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.740
you really want to make sure that you
keep those microbes not just surviving

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.630
but happy, thriving, dividing, doing
their thing so they add flavor,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.690
preserve the food, do their thing.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.700
So that's kind of our goal for today.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.360
And the reason for this is that
microbes are busily banks of enzymes.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.270
Enzymes are basically proteins.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.050
Usually when we cook food,
we mess with proteins, right?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.870
If you cook a steak, you're
messing with the proteins.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.890
If you're whipping egg white, you're
actually messing with the proteins.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.010
If you are cooking an egg,
you're denaturing the proteins.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.670
You're messing with the proteins.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.480
Now if you messed with the proteins
inside these cute little yeast,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.600
you would be messing with all of
these enzymes and the yeast would die.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.740
So you don't want to do that.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.760
So they may seem opposite, but
they have actually a lot in common.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.790
So one of the things that cooking
with heat and cooking with microbes

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.810
have in common is it's something
humans have been doing for millennia.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.850
So I guess the most
current number for how long

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.390
we've been doing this is fish
found in Sweden, actually--

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:39.010
that is 7000 BC, so 19 years old
is some of the earliest evidence.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.570
Our second earliest evidence
is similarly about 7,000 B.C.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.910
is beer, ancient beer recipes in China.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.810
So this is something how
humans have manipulated foods

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.630
in this way for way, way, way back.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.040
The other thing that cooking with
heat and cooking with microbes

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.110
have in common is that
they're really simple recipes.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.790
I mean, cooking pasta--

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.340
you add pasta, water, heat, done.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:16.060
Here is sauerkraut-- add sauerkraut,
a little salt, time, wait, wait.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.040
But then you're done--
eventually you're done.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.200
So simple-- really simple recipes.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.965
You know, often when
we think of cooking,

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:23.340
we think of these complex things.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.215
You add this, you do
this, it's very complex.

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:27.850
You have to have a lot
of skill and training--

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.070
not necessarily that hard.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.250
The other thing that cooking with
heat and cooking with microbes

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.310
have in common is they
break down larger molecules.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.650
So the large molecules of food, the
proteins, the carbohydrates, the fats--

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.900
you break those down when
you cook, say, a steak.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.320
So the delicious molecules
on top of a brown steak--

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.770
it's due to the breaking
down of the proteins.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.010
And similarly, when
you ferment, say, milk,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.290
you're basically breaking down the
long carbohydrates in the milk,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.760
adding lots of microbes.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.200
And over time, you're getting
these beautiful flavors,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.920
but they come from that milk.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.510
They come from the long, big molecules.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:16.900
It's the breaking down of them that
creates this beautiful, new flavor.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.780
So very quickly-- so microbes
are good at what they

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.330
do because they divide really fast.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.290
And I like this.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.470
I usually do this.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.150
So if you have one bacteria, it
divides and makes two bacteria.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.799
Then the first one dies, and each of
these create two new ones, blah, blah,

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.299
blaH.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.419
They keep doing this.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.204
And over time, you get
something like this.

00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:42.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:43.850
Good, good, good.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.020
So you can put all this
together in an equation.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.740
The equation looks like
this, and it basically

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.150
says that if this much time elapsed
and if the time of a generation

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.440
is this long--

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.130
so the time of a human
generation is like 30 years--

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.670
microbes, 20 minutes, 30
minutes, an hour to two hours.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.540
You plug it in.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.550
You can basically find
out how many there'll

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.610
be after a certain amount of time.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.400
So as I thought we should do an
experiment, do a little calculation.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.540
So question number seven--

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.390
this is an old homework problem.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.110
E. coli divide every 20 minutes.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.320
If the spinach you had
for dinner at six--

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.050
that's an hour ago--

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.730
and there was one bacteria
on it, how many extra E. coli

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.820
do you currently have in your body now?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.170
It's seven.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.050
And how many do you have
tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.970
So you can do your
exponentials in your head.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.902
I'm sure you're good at that.

00:09:43.902 --> 00:09:45.110
But I can also just show you.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.250
So after an hour--

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.160
so two-- after an hour we have 60
minutes, the time per generation

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.240
is 20 minutes.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.460
So now you have about eight
E. coli in your stomach.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.760
It's OK.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:05.840
Tomorrow morning-- that's about 15
hours later, an hour is 60 minutes,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.430
over 20 minutes, lots
and lots, 10 to the 13.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.300
And if every E. coli weights
ten to the negative 10 grams,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.350
that means you would have three
kilograms of E. coli in your belly

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.480
tomorrow morning.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.130
That's a lot.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.660
That's why exponentials are amazing.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.020
You produce all lot of microbes.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.570
Is that true?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.160
Is that going to happen?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.980
Yes or no?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.191
Why Stomach acid?

00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.350
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.640
The early generations die.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.590
They run out of nutrients.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.180
Yes, exactly.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.110
In order for them to divide
and build that biomass,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.039
they would have to eat
stuff in your stomach.

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:57.580
And so they would have to eat of you.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.290
So they run out of nutrients,
and they can't divide that much.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.240
You'll still have some
E. coli, and you still

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.590
may get sick, but maybe not as sick.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.330
OK so things to think about
as we go into this lecture.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:19.360
So it is a great honor for me, huge
honor for me, to introduce Sandor Katz.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.970
Sandor Katz is one of the great
fermentation experts of our time,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:31.450
and we go way back, by like
two years, because Sandor

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.150
has Skyped into my classes and
talked to my students for years.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.450
And so it's super exciting for me
and many of the people on the staff

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.580
to finally have him here.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.099
So please welcome Sandar Katz.

00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:48.564
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:56.790
SANDOR KATZ: All right, well, thank you.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.010
Can everybody hear?

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.150
OK, great.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.630
No more equations.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.430
So OK, what I want to start with is
just addressing the question, what

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.970
is fermentation anyway.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.860
But first, I want to do a little poll.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.330
How many people here would
say that they have eaten

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.020
or drunk something fermented
in the course of this day?

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.180
OK, I'm seeing a lot of
hands, maybe most hands.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.920
But I would bet that most of the people
who didn't raise their hands actually

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.330
have eaten something
fermented already today.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:40.040
Almost every individual in
almost every part of the world

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.130
eats and drinks products
of fermentation every day.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:52.305
So if you're here in Cambridge and sort
of eating a standard American diet,

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.930
maybe you had some coffee this morning.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.460
Coffee is fermented.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.730
Maybe you ate some bread.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.160
Bread is fermented.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.870
Maybe you had some cheese on that breed.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.220
Cheese is fermented.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.040
Maybe you had salami or some
other kind of cured meat

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.930
on that bread, which is fermented.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.090
Maybe you had a salad
with salad dressing

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.390
that included vinegar,
which is fermented.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.730
Maybe you ate some chocolate,
which is fermented.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.300
Maybe something with vanilla
in it, which is fermented.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.710
But an incredibly diverse range
of everyday foods and beverages

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.310
are products of fermentation.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:31.040
And what is it that unites
all of these disparate foods.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.940
They're all produced by
the transformative action

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.940
of microorganisms.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.966
And from a food and
beverage perspective,

00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:41.840
that's how I would define
fermentation-- it's

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.060
the transformative
action of microorganisms.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.820
Now I imagine we have some
biologists in the house,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.380
and the biologists are already shaking
their heads because, for a biologist,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.480
fermentation means
something a little bit

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.200
different than that-- something
that's both more specific, and also

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.760
a little bit broader.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.610
For biologists, fermentation describes
anaerobic metabolism, the production

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.700
of energy without oxygen.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.670
And in fact, the cells of our
bodies are capable of fermentation.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.630
And mostly we operate with respiration.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.050
And the most efficient way that our
cells produce energy is with oxygen,

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.990
and we have this elaborate
system to distribute oxygen

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.850
to each of the cells of our bodies.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:29.000
But if we exert ourselves in ways
that sort of demand energy beyond what

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.020
that oxygen can
facilitate, then our cells

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:38.240
revert to this fermentive mode of energy
production, which is less efficient.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.640
It produces this byproduct
with lactic acid,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.730
which can be responsible for
giving us that feeling of a muscle

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.910
burn when we exert ourselves.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.160
Now how does this relate to
these foods and beverages?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.570
Most of the foods in beverages
that we describe as fermented

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.700
meet the biologist's definition.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.470
They are anaerobic.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:02.630
When we turn this bowl of
cabbage and other vegetables

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.260
into sauerkraut, that's an
anaerobic process that does not

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.180
require oxygen. When we take milk
and fermented into yogurt, that's

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.270
an anaerobic process that
does not require oxygen.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.710
When we take grape juice
and ferment it into wine,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.950
that's an anaerobic process
that does not require oxygen.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.730
The reason why I typically depart
from the biologist's definition

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:31.040
of fermentation is that there are a
large handful of microbial transformed

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.350
foods and beverages that do
require oxygen. So if any of you

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:43.610
like to drink kombucha, a kombucha
is an example of an aerobic ferment,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.420
call it an oxymoronic
ferment because it's

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.030
a microbial transformation
that requires oxygen.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.940
But everybody thinks of it as fermented.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.380
Similarly, vinegar
requires oxygen. Similarly,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:05.330
many types of cheese require oxygen.
The Indonesian soy ferment tofu--

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.820
I'm sorry, tempeh requires oxygen.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.470
So because there are all of
these microbally transformed

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:19.820
foods that don't meet the biologist's
definition of fermentation,

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.380
I like to work with this
broader lay definition

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.360
that fermentation is the transformative
action of microorganisms.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.980
However, not every transformative action
of microorganisms results in something

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.490
delicious that we're ready
to put into our mouths.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:39.860
And for most people,
our primary awareness

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:45.140
of the microbial transformation of food
comes when we clean the refrigerator.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.500
In the deep recesses
of the refrigerator,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.320
you find decomposed vegetables and
things that have begun to mold.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.720
And that's also the transformative
action of microorganisms.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.190
But we don't call that fermented.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.240
We have a different
vocabulary to describe that.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.089
We call that rotten.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.220
We call that spoiled.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:13.940
And we reserve the word fermentation
to describe intentional or desirable

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.089
microbial transformations.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:22.569
But I think the fact that
we all inevitably experience

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.859
food decomposition maybe
can give us some insight

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:33.320
into the inevitability of microbial
transformation of our food.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.030
Now in terms of science and
cooking, one of the things

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.750
that's most fascinating
to me about fermentation

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.560
is that people have been
practicing this for 10,000 years--

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:49.090
I would argue longer, that what the
archaeological record really as is

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.380
finding is it's telling us
about the history of pottery.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.590
And that's when pottery emerged and
that the earlier vessels were all

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.650
biodegradable.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.070
So we're not finding remains of them.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.960
But anyway, who knows?

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.160
But the people who figured
out fermentation techniques,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.490
they didn't have the
benefit of microbiology.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.340
They didn't know about microorganisms.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.560
And what we now understand is that all
of the plants and all of the animal

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.290
products that make up
our food are populated

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.680
by these elaborate
communities of microorganisms.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.920
So the question is, are
these microorganisms going

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.840
to decompose our food
into something disgusting

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.200
that nobody would ever
put into their mouths,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:43.030
are these microorganisms going to
create toxic byproducts or make us sick,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:47.170
or are these microorganisms
going to somehow elevate the food

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:52.920
and make it more delicious,
more stable, more digestible,

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.990
or improve the food in some way.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:01.090
And without knowing about the
existence of microorganisms,

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:07.040
people in every part of the world
figured out through observation,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.900
through trial and error,
through happy accidents,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:16.780
who knows how they figured it out how
to guide the microbial transformation

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.380
of the food.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.330
And really what the practice
of fermentation amounts to

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.150
are manipulations of
environmental conditions

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:31.030
that determine which of the multitude of
organisms that are present on anything

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.320
that makes up our food are
going to develop and in what way

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.700
they will be transformed.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.440
So a head of cabbage--

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.320
here, I'll be referring to this
repeatedly through the evening.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.810
But if we just left a
bowl of cabbage like this

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.950
sitting on the counter for
two weeks or two months,

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.580
it is not going to turn
itself into sauerkraut.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.130
And it's really quite predictable
what's going to happen.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.920
And some of us have seen
the early stages of this--

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.070
like maybe you had a piece
of cabbage like this leftover

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.610
from something you cooked.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.670
And let's just say there was no
room in your fermentation slowing

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.864
device, your refrigerator, and
you left it on the counter,

00:20:12.864 --> 00:20:16.030
and you didn't get back to it the next
day, and it sat there for a few days.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.780
Has anyone ever seen like
a little film of a mold

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.484
develop on those cut surfaces?

00:20:21.484 --> 00:20:22.900
And you can still use the cabbage.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.080
You just sliced those away.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.710
But where the carbohydrates are
losing out in the presence of oxygen,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.240
mold is going to grow.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.341
So it's possible to have a bowl of
cabbage turned into a cloud-- oh, here,

00:20:36.341 --> 00:20:37.716
you're not gonna see where it's--

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.770
it's possible to have a bowl of
shredded cabbage turn into kind

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.040
of a cloud of mold that
could literally reduce

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.330
that cabbage into a
puddle of slime that bears

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.576
no resemblance to delicious,
tangy, crunchy sauerkraut.

00:20:56.576 --> 00:20:58.450
Also, I mean not to
scare anyone about eating

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:04.030
cabbages or other raw
vegetables, but the bacteria that

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:11.710
produces the scariest food
poisoning pathogen that we know of,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.930
Clostridium botulinum, which
produces a toxin called botulism,

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.050
it's such a common soil bacteria
that probably none of us

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.480
have ever eaten a vegetable
in our lives that didn't

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.120
have cells of Clostridium botulinum.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.580
But we really only ever hear about
botulism in the context of canning.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.200
So if you sterilize
food in a jar in order

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.240
to preserve it but you
fail to use adequate heat,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.570
Clostridium botulinum can survive
higher than boiling temperatures.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:49.180
So what you do is you sort
of kill everything else

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.770
and leave that as the sole survivor
in the very contrived environment

00:21:53.770 --> 00:22:00.820
where it can thrive in the
total absence of oxygen--

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.020
obligate anaerobic.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.570
It can only function in
the absence of oxygen.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.860
We don't really spend much of our time
in a totally anaerobic environment.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.670
So when you chop up cabbage to make a
coleslaw or to ferment into sauerkraut

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.940
or to make a stir fry, you don't
have to worry about the botulism.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.620
It's only if you put it in that
specific environment where it can grow.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.090
So there's a lot of potential ways
that a cabbage or a glass of milk

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.080
or a glass of grape juice or
anything that we could eat--

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.130
there's a lot of different ways
that it can microbially transform.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.850
And which of the microbes that
are on it are going to develop

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.100
is entirely an environmental question.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.230
And so fermentation is all
about manipulating environments

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.560
to encourage the growth of
certain kinds of organisms

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.220
while simultaneously discouraging the
growth of other kinds of organisms.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.260
So I mean, what we'll be doing
eventually with this bowl of cabbage

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.740
is we're going to get the vegetables
submerged under their own juices.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.900
And that just protects them
from the free flow of oxygen.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.570
So the molds can't grow.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.340
It's not totally anaerobic.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.290
There's dissolved oxygen in the water.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.520
So the Clostridium botulinum
can't grow, and in that sort

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:21.220
of protected environment the lactic
acid bacteria, which are generally

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.140
believed to be present on all plants
growing out of soil on planet Earth,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.390
they can thrive and flourish.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.810
And as they acidify
the environment, they

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.770
kill off most of the other
organisms that are present.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:44.140
And that's part of what enables the
food to be so effectively preserved.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.930
So fermentation is the transformative
action of microorganisms.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.830
There is no food that
cannot be fermented.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:56.710
It doesn't mean every food has equally
prominent traditions of fermentation.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.770
Avocados are like an
example of a food that, I

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:02.260
don't think that there's
much tradition of fermenting.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.860
But I've put avocado in sauerkraut.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860
It works great.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:13.240
And nothing that we could possibly
eat could not be fermented.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.080
And then a related issue is
fermentation is practiced everywhere.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.450
I definitely do not possess encyclopedic
knowledge of culinary traditions

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.980
everywhere in the world.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.470
But I've been looking really
hard for counter-examples

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.560
for more than 20 years,
and every time someone

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:35.050
has proposed I'm a part of the world
where they believe that fermentation

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.840
is not practiced, I've
been able to learn

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.990
about a fermented food or beverage
from that part of the world.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:50.600
So I think it would be conceptually
possible for hunter-gatherer people

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.360
to live without fermentation.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.500
If you're going to spend each day
procuring the food resources that

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.250
are going to get you
through that day, you

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.490
don't really have to think too
much about the dynamics of how

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.680
food fares over time.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.010
But as people in different
parts of the world

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:13.550
transitioned from hunter-gatherer
societies into agricultural societies,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.870
if you're going to invest
your energy and your resources

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.070
into crops that are ready at
a certain moment of the year,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:28.670
then that is only feasible
as a strategy for survival

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.610
if you have some
strategies in mind for how

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:40.160
you're going to preserve the harvest to
get you through the rest of the year.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.640
So I would argue that
agriculture itself would not

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.900
be possible without fermentation.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:51.440
It's not the fermentation is the
only ancient method of preservation,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.560
but most of the ways that
we preserve food today

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.100
just hadn't existed in the past.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.320
I mean, OK, we can't even imagine
how you live without a refrigerator.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.840
And if we were sitting
here just 100 years ago,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.700
nobody would have a refrigerator.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.570
And bear in mind that most
households on planet Earth in 2017

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.920
do not have a refrigerator.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.200
Refrigeration is not
universally available.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.260
And so people use other
techniques for preserving food.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.120
Then, we might think about canning.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.400
Some of us might think of canning as
an old time preservation technique

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.210
because we mostly associate it with
a grandparent or great grandparents

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.650
or something like that.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.940
Canning is a 200-year-old technology.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.770
It was patented in France in 1812,
where it's called up appertization

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.520
because they remember
the name of Nicholas

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.180
Appert, the clever Frenchman who
invented the process of sterilizing

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.780
food in a jar.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.122
So if you take away refrigerators
and freezers and canning,

00:26:52.122 --> 00:26:54.330
there aren't that many other
methods of preservation.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.340
There's drying food.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.770
Drying food preserves food
basically by depriving

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.950
the microorganisms that are
on the food of the water

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.600
that they need in order to function.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.630
So dried foods are not sterilized
in the way that canned foods are.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.100
The microbes are present, but
they're in a state of dormancy

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.190
because they lack the water that
they need in order to function.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.940
And certain foods are just
dry when they're mature.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:29.510
That's their nature-- any kind of grain,
any kind of bean, any kind of nut.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.490
They're just dry when they're mature.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:39.590
Other foods can be dried, like fish
or meat or fruit or vegetables.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.180
Really any food could be dried.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.490
And then beyond that, fermentation
has been just a major way

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.740
that people have preserved food.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:55.200
Sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles--
these are all strategies for people

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.220
in temperate parts of the
world to preserve vegetables

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.480
from the limited season when
they can be grown to get people

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.050
through the rest of the year.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.890
Cheese, we mostly think about
cheese as something that's tasty

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.830
and something that you
walk into a gourmet store,

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.720
and there's all these different choices
and exciting flavors and textures

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.290
and all that.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.580
But I mean, really what
cheese is preserved milk.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.930
Cheese and yogurt and kefir and
other forms of fermented milk

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.350
really are strategies for
extending the life of this,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:37.690
or the usefulness of this you
know extremely perishable food.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.850
Salami-- you walk into a
delicatessen, and the salami

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.300
is just like hanging from
a string in the ceiling.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.120
I mean, that's preserved meat.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.560
You take this animal that
you've been feeding for months,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.570
and you know it weighs 300 pounds.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.490
And you can't eat it all at one sitting.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:00.280
So you have to have strategies to
preserve the meat so you can eat it

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.790
over a longer period of time.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.900
And that's what all cured meats are.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.760
So preservation has been just an
incredibly, incredibly important reason

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.510
why people ferment.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.810
I wish I could say that I got
interested in fermentation for something

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.220
as high minded as that.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.060
But what first made me start
thinking about fermentation

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.490
was the flavors of
fermentation, and fermentation

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.230
creates compelling flavors.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.950
And if you walk into a
gourmet food store anywhere,

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:36.070
most of what you're going to see and
smell are products of fermentation.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.580
And most of the world's
greatest delicacies

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.080
are products of fermentation.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.960
And fermentation creates strong flavors.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.970
Of course with strong
flavors, not everybody

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.260
loves every flavor of fermentation.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.990
And I think cheese
illustrates this so well.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.480
So as my taste has evolved--

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.770
and I wasn't born like this-- but
like I love stinky, stinky cheese.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.580
And if I can smell it
from hundreds of it away,

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.390
it-- just catches my attention,
and I'm dying to try it.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.780
And I'm so sure not
everyone in here would share

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.420
my passion for stinky cheeses and.

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.860
Whenever I have a really very
ripe, sticky piece of cheese

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.250
and I invite some friends over
to share it with me, inevitably

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.180
somebody gets to the door and
just makes this awful face.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.090
And they're thinking, did
something die in here.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.090
And they would never ever
think about putting something

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.080
that smelled like that into their
mouths, and the world of fermentation

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.770
is just full of these strong flavored.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.900
They're what we would
call acquired tastes.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.520
You're not born loving a stinky cheese.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:54.730
You're not born loving surstromming,
the Swedish low salt fermented Herring.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.650
Just the stronger
flavors of fermentation,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:02.050
people learn to like through exposure,
through seeing other people get excited

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:07.870
about them, through being willing to
taste them a second and a third time.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:17.922
So flavor is a very important
aspect of fermentation.

00:31:17.922 --> 00:31:19.630
What's getting a lot
of people interested

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.140
in fermentation at the present
moment is perceived health benefits.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.360
So I want to just address
that a little bit.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.770
It's not like all of these foods
have precisely the same qualities.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:41.470
It's not like coffee and bread and
cheese and kimchi are all the same.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.810
They're all different.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.060
They're all based on different
foods that have different qualities,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.490
the fermentations are
different, every food is unique.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.100
But the process of fermentation
transforms nutrients

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.340
in some very clear patterns of ways.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.720
The first way Pia referred
to in her introduction,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.390
and that is what I would call
pre-digestion and the idea

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:07.120
that, while the food is fermenting,
the bacteria or the fungi that

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:14.980
are fermenting it are breaking down
nutrients into more elemental forms.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.750
And frequently these simpler
forms are easier for us to access.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.680
I would say that the most dramatic
example of this is soybeans.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.030
The reason why the vegetarian
subcultures of the West

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.720
became so interested in soybeans
and they became almost a singular

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.570
replacement for meat and
milk is that soybeans

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:39.140
are considered to be the plant food
with the most concentrated protein.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.320
But you really never
hear about people just

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.960
you eating a plate of
soybeans for dinner the way

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:48.370
they might with lentils or chickpeas.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.900
And the reason for this is that
our human digestive systems are not

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.440
capable of breaking down
the protein in soybeans.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.610
And it won't kill you if you eat
a plate of soybeans for dinner,

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.230
but it'll make you really gassy.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.630
It'll give you terrible
indigestion, and you're not

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.810
going to get the protein
out of the soybeans.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:13.300
And so somehow thousands of
years ago, the Asian cultures

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.480
that pioneered soy
agriculture recognized

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.030
the indigestibility of
the soybeans and figured

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.900
out how to make soybeans digestible.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.440
And we have this whole range
of fermented soy foods.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.730
There's soy sauce.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.930
There's miso.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.040
There's tempeh.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.500
There's natto.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.740
There's really like dozens
of other variations.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.220
The four that I mentioned
are very different in flavor,

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.430
they're different in texture, they're
different and fermentation processes,

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.400
they're different in the
organisms that ferment them.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.640
But what they all have in
common is that that protein

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:55.600
gets broken down into amino acids,
the building blocks of proteins.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.580
Similarly, when you
ferment milk, lactose--

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.960
the milk sugar that so many people have
a hard time digesting-- breaks down.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.179
And many people who can't drink a glass
of milk have a fine time eating yogurt.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:13.060
But of course, it's not
a question of yes or no.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.179
It's a matter of degree,
and most commercial yogurt

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.389
that's available I mean the assumption,
at least in the United States,

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:23.790
is that people want their
yogurt minimally sour.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.290
And so most commercial
yogurt in the United States

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.420
is fermented for about
2 and 1/2 hours, which

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:34.929
is enough to just set the yogurt
but without making it too sour.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:39.580
But what the sourness is is lactic
acid, and that's with the lactose

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.679
is being transformed into.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.730
So the more sour it is,
the less lactose there is.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.460
So if you make yogurt
yourself at home, instead

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.380
of fermenting it for 2 and 1/2 hours,
you can fermented for eight hours.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.030
You can fermented for 12 hours.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.170
You can fermented for 24 hours, and
you'll have a different product.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.590
It'll be more sour, but there
will be less lactose to it.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.240
That's pre-indigestion.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:12.280
Even gluten, the notorious wheat
protein that so many people

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.670
have a hard time digesting, can
be broken down by fermentation--

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:20.410
not by yeast, but by bacteria.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:29.590
And yeast you can go
to any store and buy.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:35.560
Yeast has been present
with us forever, and people

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.800
have been making bread for something
like 10,000 years and using yeast.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.390
But until Louis Pasteur isolated
yeast in the 19th century,

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.130
yeast was never alone.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.250
Yeast has always been
used with the bacteria

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:58.450
that it travels with-- so on the wheat
itself, like on grapes or on barley.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.100
The yeast is there, but it's not alone.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.860
It's with lactic acid bacteria.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.700
So what we now call sourdough,
which is natural leavening--

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:12.560
which is really how bread for
the first 1900 years was made.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.780
The fermentation included
not only yeast but bacteria,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.000
and those bacteria
can break down gluten.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.560
So there's a much lower level of gluten
in bacterially fermented bread or bread

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.420
made with natural leavening
or a mixed culture.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.180
And this question of mixed cultures
is really kind of essential

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:40.180
because until the emergence
of the science of microbiology

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.120
there was no such thing as
singular microorganisms.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.560
Microorganisms are everywhere,
but they're never alone.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.910
They always exist in communities
and in pretty elaborate communities.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:55.720
And we've all been reading a
lot about the human microbiome

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.770
over the last couple of
decades, and more and more

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.300
is known and understood about that.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:08.620
And each of us is host to something like
a trillion bacteria, many more bacteria

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.325
than we have human cells
with our own unique DNA.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.280
I mean, the carrot and the
cabbage also have a microbiomes.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.490
Every living thing has a microbiome,
has its sort of simbiance

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.050
that they live with.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.000
But there are always these
elaborate communities.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.050
It's never one singular micro-organism.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.810
Pre-digestion-- OK, I got
off on a little tangent.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.850
A flip side of
pre-digestion is in addition

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:53.780
to breaking down nutritious
compounds, fermentation

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.760
can break down toxic compounds.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:03.326
So there's all kinds of toxic
compounds in different kinds of plants

00:38:03.326 --> 00:38:04.700
that fermentation can break down.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.630
And some of them are dramatic,
like cyanide in cassava.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.900
Cassava in certain parts of the world
grows with these extraordinarily high

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.370
levels of cyanide.

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.230
And if people were to eat
unprocessed cassava roots,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.000
they would literally kill them.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.120
And yet it's this very
important source of nutrients

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.680
for about a billion people around
the equatorial regions of the world.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.730
And so in the parts of
the world where cassava

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.310
grows with high levels of cyanide, one
of the major strategies for removing

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.660
the cyanide is fermenting it.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.740
And it's very simple.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.460
You peel it.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.840
You coarsely chop it, put it
in a vessel filled with water

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.590
that initiates a fermentation.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.480
And it breaks down the cyanide
compounds into benign forms.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.210
A lot of food toxins are not
quite as dramatic as that.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:56.140
Oxalic acid found in a lot of
vegetables breaks down by fermentation.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:05.010
Phytic acid, which is found in
the outer layers of seed foods,

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.600
breaks down through fermentation.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:13.440
There's even some evidence showing that
residues of organophosphate pesticides

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.030
can be broken down through fermentation.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.330
So all kinds of toxic
compounds and foods

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.640
can be broken down by fermentation.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.190
Then another interesting
aspect that's really

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:29.610
just beginning to be investigated
are the metabolic byproducts

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.390
of fermentation.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:37.350
And a lot of them are turning out to
have interesting therapeutic potential.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.080
So for instance, in sauerkraut
and other fermented vegetables,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.040
there are these compounds
called isothiocynates which

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.850
are regarded as anti-carcinogenic.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.850
And they're not found in the
vegetables you begin with.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.760
They're generated by
the lactic acid bacteria

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.460
over the course of the fermentation.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.480
Natto, the Japanese soy ferment--
that's never really caught

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:06.090
on in our part of the world
because it's got a slimy texture

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.910
and it's an example of
an alkaline ferment.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:13.311
So it sort of smells a
little bit like ammonia.

00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:13.810
I know.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:15.850
I'm making it sound very appealing.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.210
But it's actually incredibly delicious.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:22.390
And in that slimy coating
that develops on the soybeans

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.180
is this compound called
nattokinase, and you could go in

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.950
and any vitamin supplement store in
North America and buy nattokinase

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.890
that's been extracted from
natto because so many people

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.430
are taking it because it's
been found to dissolve fibrin.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.980
Fibrin-- when you hear about people
with clogged arteries, the fibers that

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.060
build up inside of our blood
vessels, that's fibrin.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:49.590
And this compound that's a metabolic
byproduct of bacillus subtilis

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:55.930
as it ferments soybeans actually
can break that fiber down.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.762
And so a lot of people are
taking it in therapeutic ways.

00:40:59.762 --> 00:41:01.470
Then finally, what I
would consider to be

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:04.980
the greatest potential
benefit of fermentation

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.040
would be the bacteria themselves.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:11.130
So I talked a little bit
about the microbiology.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:17.400
I mean, all of us older people here
who grew up through the 20th century,

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.540
we were brainwashed with this idea
that bacteria are our enemies,

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.370
bacteria need to be avoided.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.780
And when they are encountered
bacteria need to be destroyed by any

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.320
means necessary.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:36.450
And science is actually telling a
much more nuanced story these days.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.430
Bacteria are the matrix of all life.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.360
There's an emerging consensus
in evolutionary biology

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.050
that all life is
descended from bacteria.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.500
The flip side of this is that
no multicellular form of life

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.970
lives without bacteria.

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:55.590
And just as we're dependent on
these trillion microorganisms that

00:41:55.590 --> 00:42:03.090
are part of us, so too is the cabbage
and the carrot and the cow and the pig.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:08.810
And really everything we
eat has its own microbiome.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:13.050
And yet we're still in this
war on bacteria mentality,

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.640
and we all have chemical
exposure to compounds

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.660
that are designed to kill bacteria,
whether it's antibiotic drugs,

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.440
whether it's anti-bacterial
cleansing products, whether it's

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.080
the chlorine that's on all of
our municipal water systems.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.300
But we all have exposure
every day to these compounds

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.280
that are designed to kill bacteria.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.600
And luckily none of
them kill all bacteria.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.180
But what they do is they
diminish biodiversity.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.290
And we think a lot about biodiversity in
terms of the oceans and the rainforest,

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:54.480
but biodiversity is a concept that
applies inside our bodies as well.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.360
And as we learn about the incredible
range of our functionality

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.920
that involves bacteria,
we're also learning

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:10.620
ways in which we are hurting ourselves
through this chemical exposure that

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.930
diminishes our biodiversity.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:18.744
So I mean, bacteria in our bodies do
way more than enable us to digest food.

00:43:18.744 --> 00:43:20.910
I mean, that's a very
important thing, that bacteria

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.205
enable us to effectively digest food
and assimilate nutrients from food.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:30.440
What we call our immune
systems are largely

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.130
the work of bacteria in our intestines.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.680
In the last few years has been
incredible groundbreaking work

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:43.610
demonstrating that serotonin and
other compounds that determine

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.900
our neurological function--
how we think, how we feel--

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.140
are regulated by bacteria
in our intestines.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.570
And it turns out that nearly
every process in our bodies

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:02.130
involves these bacteria, and yet
we continue killing them all.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.980
And so this has given rise
to what is called probiotics.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:10.050
It's the antidote to
antibiotics to ingest bacteria.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:14.450
And there's a huge industry of you
know little capsules that you can buy,

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.220
probiotics.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.440
And each of these capsules
is saying, oh, this

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.140
is a billion cells in
this little capsule.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.660
Well, it's a billion
copies of one or two

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:30.020
or three different bacteria which
has limited impact on biodiversity.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.400
The current contrast to that would
be traditional fermented foods, none

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.710
of which involve singular bacteria.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:40.130
They all involve these elaborate
communities of bacteria.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.830
And so when we ingest
living fermented foods,

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:49.790
I mean we are promoting
biodiversity in our gut.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.680
And we don't fully understand it at all.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.540
I mean, there are elaborate interactions
between the bacteria we ingest

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.000
and the bacteria in
residence in our intestines.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.920
The earliest articulations of the idea
of probiotics Elie Metchnikoff writing

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.110
110 years ago.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:13.460
I mean, his vision of it was you eat the
yogurt, and the bacteria of the yogurt

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.550
just take over the intestine
and make everything better.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.490
And it's a highly competitive
environment in there.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.470
It's not like the bacteria in
residence in our intestines

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:28.130
just sort of move over and
make room for the new bacteria

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:32.870
in the yogurt to take up residence,
but there is an elaborate interaction.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:36.830
And part of that interaction
is a genetic interaction.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.590
And one of the most fascinating
things about bacteria

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.220
is their genetic flexibility.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:46.580
So in contrast to us and
animals and plants and fungi--

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:54.230
which all have fixed genetics
for the course of our lives--

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.510
bacteria aren't constrained in that way.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.610
Bacteria are extremely
genetically flexible.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.400
They can exchange genetic information.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.900
They can pick up genetic
information from the environment.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.816
They can get rid of
genetic information that's

00:46:05.816 --> 00:46:09.240
no longer relevant to their existence.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.125
And so part of that interaction
is a genetic interaction.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.550
All of that said, I think that
fermented foods are very important.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.720
I think there's also a lot
of unsubstantiated hype.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.770
There are web sites telling people
that, if they drink kombucha everyday,

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:34.970
their diabetes will go away,
your hair will never get gray,

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.350
you'll reverse aging.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.830
I mean, there's a lot of ridiculous
things that the people are saying.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.890
But I mean I think that
the underlying idea

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:48.860
that there is great potential when we
ingest bacterially rich food to improve

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.640
digestion, improve immune
function, potentially improve

00:46:52.640 --> 00:47:01.460
mental health and other systems of the
body without any risk, is significant.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.510
OK, now let me talk a little bit
about some fermentation concept.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.045
So the first book that I wrote about
fermentation-- my books are up there.

00:47:09.045 --> 00:47:10.920
I'm going to do a little
book signing after--

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.470
was called Wild Fermentation.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:13.880
I didn't make up this expression.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.963
It's found throughout the literature,
and it describes something specific.

00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:21.980
While fermentation is fermentation
that is based on the organisms that

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.560
are present on the food
like nobody-- well,

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.530
I won't say nobody uses
starters to make sauerkraut

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.900
because people are selling
starkers to make sauerkraut.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.370
But I mean it's totally unnecessary.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.610
Lactic acid bacteria are
present on all plants.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:41.060
There's no reason to add a
starter because you'll find

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.000
the bacteria you need on all plants.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.590
You don't need yeast
to make wine either.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:55.060
I mean, nobody had used to make wine you
know until Louis Pasteur did his work.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.470
I mean, you crush the grapes.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:03.100
The yeast and bacteria are
on the skins of the grapes.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:11.200
They initiate the fermentation, and
they transform the sugars into alcohol.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.740
And then if you don't protect it from
oxygen, other bacteria that are there

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.330
will transform alcohol into acetic acid.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.880
But that's wild fermentation.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.150
It's just sort of basing your
fermentation on the organisms that

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.770
are spontaneously present.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.740
The contrasting style of
fermentation, no less wonderful,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.390
is when you introduce
some sort of a starter.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:36.220
There's basically three different
categories of starters I would say.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.040
I reference the packet of yeast.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:45.040
That's something that Louis Pasteur and
the emerging science of microbiology

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.610
made possible, isolating
singular microorganisms.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.310
Yeast is the most common one.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:57.130
If you wanted to make Camembert
cheese here in Cambridge,

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.300
initially it was done as a
wild fermentation with raw milk

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.970
in a certain cave system in France.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:08.050
But if you could simulate
the temperature and humidity

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.870
conditions of those caves,
you can go on the internet

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.810
and you could buy the right
bacteria and the right fungus

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.640
and follow procedures
that have been outlined,

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.190
and you could sort of simulate the
conditions of the caves of France.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:26.260
And you could produce Camembert
cheese in your apartment in Cambridge.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:32.590
I make koji, which is a Japanese
rice with a fungus grown

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:35.710
on it that's the starter for
making soy sauce, for making miso,

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:40.650
for making Sake, for making
Amazake and many other foods.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:48.929
And so I buy imported from Japan
a fungal starter to make my koji.

00:49:48.929 --> 00:49:51.220
But what's important to
understand about these singular

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.120
microorganisms is they are brand
new in the scheme of things.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.710
They're 20th century technology
of isolating organisms,

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.890
and an incredible range
of starters are available.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.940
But they're new in the scheme of things.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:11.380
The ancient form of a starter is what
I would describe as backslopping.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.390
And that's basically,
you take the old batch

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.890
and you put some into the new batch.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.772
This, is how people make yogurt.

00:50:16.772 --> 00:50:19.480
The way you make yogurt is you
save a little bit of the old batch

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.120
and you put it into a
fresh batch of milk.

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.790
And there's some temperature
manipulation involved in there too,

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.930
but the source of the bacteria is
typically the last batch of yogurt.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:30.580
This is what a sourdough is.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:34.300
I mean, generally a sourdough is
started as a wild fermentation

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:40.750
because really all of those use and
bacteria are present on the wheat

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.320
or on any other grain.

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.330
But once you have a nice vigorous
sourdough with a good flavor

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:51.130
and a good lifting action for your
bread, you never bake the whole thing.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.320
You always save a little
bit to perpetuate it,

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.360
to introduce into some
fresh flour and water.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.480
And I've met people who have sourdoughs
that are hundreds of years old

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.615
that's been passed down in
their families for generations.

00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:10.240
And you can do lots of things this way.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.670
I mean, before pure yeast was
available a lot of breweries

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.010
made beer by saving a
little bit of the last batch

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.140
to introduce into the next batch.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.347
This is the way a lot of
traditional salami making

00:51:22.347 --> 00:51:24.430
has been done-- save a
little bit of the old batch

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:26.450
to introduce into the next batch.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.220
So that's really the
ancient form of a starter.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:34.630
And then the third form of a starter
are what we would describe generically

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:39.300
as scobies, S-C-O-B-Y, which is an
acronym which stands for Symbiotic

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.920
Communities Of Bacteria and Yeast.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.700
And so there's really
just a handful of these.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.170
The most famous example right
now would become kombucha.

00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:52.270
The scoby is the mother of kombucha.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:58.990
It looks like a rubbery pancake, and
it floats on top of the sweetened tea.

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:03.310
And that community of organisms
that are part of the rubbery pancake

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:07.090
grow into the sweet tea
and digest carbohydrates

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:10.630
and transform it into kombucha.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:15.010
Another example of this would
be kefir, grains of kefir--

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.930
very different appearance from kombucha.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.990
They look more like little
florets of cauliflower.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:23.110
And embedded in those
florets of cauliflower

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:29.860
is an incredibly complex community with
more than 30 distinct organisms that

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.610
have been identified that somehow
coordinate their reproductions,

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:39.280
spin this skin that they share,
and ferment milk in the process.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.660
There's a handful of other ones.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:45.640
There's one called tibicos, also known
as water kefir, which comes from Mexico

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.310
and looks more like little
crystalline structures.

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:52.940
And you put them in any kind
of carbohydrate rich liquid,

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:57.800
and they'll ferment the carbohydrates
into acids and a little bit of alcohol.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.620
And you can make delicious
beverages with them.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.930
Now I mean, conceptually
all of these starters

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:05.135
had to start as a wild fermentation.

00:53:05.135 --> 00:53:07.010
I mean, where did the
first yogurt come from?

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:10.800
I mean, it's a little bit of
a chicken or an egg problem.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.480
But I mean, in my mind
it's very clear that it

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.940
was a happy accident in some
very warm place on a hot day,

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:23.510
and somebody sort of realized that the
temperature had something to do with it

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:28.580
and figured out a technique for,
through backslopping, reproducing

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.960
their results.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.650
But the questions of origins are,
with anything, and certainly with any

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:40.490
of these foods is very, very
murky and highly speculative.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:43.790
And there's a huge literature
that's addresses the question,

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:48.600
how did humans discover
or invent fermentation.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.520
And I mean, my perspective is totally
that humans didn't invent or discover

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.600
fermentation, that we
evolved already knowing it.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.560
There's a lot of great documentation
of different kinds of animals

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:10.630
gorging themselves on fermented
fruit, including primates.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:15.080
And it just so happens that we evolved
with enzymes that can digest alcohol.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.610
Interesting.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.250
So I mean, humans didn't invent alcohol.

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.560
I mean, alcohol is a natural phenomenon.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:25.940
If you ever pick a lot of berries,
you'll note some of them are fermented.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:32.590
And it's a natural phenomenon that
our clever ancestors figured out

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:38.870
how to make happen, and we
developed a lot of technology.

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:43.220
I referred to pottery earlier, but
we developed lots of technology

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:49.160
to enable ourselves to sort
of your master techniques

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.830
for making these foods and beverages.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.420
OK, let me just talk about
the cabbage a little bit.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:58.490
And then we're going to leave some time
for questions, which hopefully there

00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.130
are some.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:07.130
So this is cabbage, some green cabbage,
some red cabbage, some carrots,

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:12.030
some onions-- sauerkraut does
not just have to be sauerkraut.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:13.610
It doesn't have to just be cabbage.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:17.790
Like literally you could
ferment any vegetable you want.

00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:24.950
We cut the kernels off of
an ear of corn into here.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:27.830
Know we could put ocra in here.

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.920
Any vegetable you want
you could put it here.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.290
I lightly salted them.

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.770
OK, for the sauerkraut method,
the dry salting method,

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.450
you have to chop up the vegetables.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:43.100
If you leave the vegetables whole, then
you need to mix up a brine solution

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.880
and ferment it in the brine solution.

00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.870
But when you shred your
vegetables, then you

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.120
can have a more concentrated
flavor because you're not

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.670
diluting the flavor with water.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:56.060
But remember, at the beginning
I said that our objective here

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.670
is to get the vegetables
submerged under liquid.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:01.430
So we have to get some
juice out of the vegetables.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:07.760
And so earlier when we shredded the
vegetables, we lightly salted them,

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.700
lightly salted them because
it's easier to add salt

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.290
than it is to subtract salt. So at some
point I'll taste it and I'll evaluate--

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:16.550
does it need more salt.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:20.510
What I'm doing right now is
I'm squeezing the vegetables.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.790
I'm massaging the vegetables.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.070
And really what I'm doing
is I'm breaking down

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.160
cell walls to release juice.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:32.510
In larger scale production,
families or villages

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.090
that would get together
in northern Europe

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:40.100
and make big barrels of sauerkraut,
they weren't usually doing it like this.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.370
They had some kind of a
big, blunt, heavy tool,

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.440
and they were smashing
down on the vegetables.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.650
Or a story I hear over and over again--

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:52.010
generally people my age or older
who grew up in Eastern Europe

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.650
is memories of having
their feet scrubbed

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:58.160
and being put inside the
barrel so that they'd

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:02.280
have their kids jump up and down.

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.850
Whether you're going to jump up and
down or smash it with the heavy tool

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:08.734
or, on a small scale, do this and
just squeeze it with your hands,

00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:09.900
you're doing the same thing.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.910
You're breaking down
cell walls-- oh, OK.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.062
And you're releasing juice.

00:57:18.062 --> 00:57:19.770
I'm going to keep
doing this for a couple

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:22.880
more minutes while I talk
about some of other issues.

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.120
OK, first of all, let's talk
about salt. A lot of people

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.760
imagine sauerkraut has
to be extremely salty.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:35.770
Sauerkraut definitely does not
have to be extremely salty.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:40.560
I'm going to add a little bit more
salt. But I mean, I'm just doing that.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.580
That's just to taste.

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:46.360
If we had five different versions,
one at a half a percent salt,

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.650
1% salt 1 and 1/2% salt,
2% salt, 2 1/2% salt,

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:54.130
we wouldn't all agree about
which one tasted the best.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:58.030
I mean, we would probably
have people thinking

00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.880
each one of them tasted the best.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.510
And if you follow a recipe
in the Joy Of Cooking which

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:09.040
by the way is where I first
learned how to make sauerkraut--

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.500
if you follow a recipe for lentil soup,
it will never tell you how much salt.

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.970
It'll say salt to taste.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:21.190
And people imagine that
that fermentation somehow

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:29.302
requires more precision than that, that
you need a scale to weigh your salt.

00:58:29.302 --> 00:58:31.510
I mean, if you're going to
have a commercial business

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.400
and you want to make
a consistent product,

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.130
then you need a scale to weigh your
salt so that it tastes consistent.

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:41.530
But if you're just making it for
your own personal pleasure at home,

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:46.240
there's no need to measure the salt.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.860
The reason why many of us have the
idea that it needs to be very salty

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.510
is that this was a survival food.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.600
If these were the last vegetables we
were going to see for the next six

00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.840
months, we have an incentive to use
more salt. If on the other hand,

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.600
we're trying to make something that
we're going to enjoy eating, that's

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.990
going to support our
continued good health,

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.990
then there's just no reason
to make it extremely salty.

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:13.060
I mean, I get emails
every week from people

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:17.170
who say like, oh, I really
want to eat sauerkraut

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.860
but my doctor told me I can't
eat heavily salty foods.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:22.090
It does not need to be heavily salty.

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:23.660
This is not rocket science.

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:28.660
It doesn't need to be a precise
proportion of salt. In fact, you

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.700
can make it with no salt at all.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:35.260
I mean, it doesn't taste very good, and
it has or it has a really soft texture.

00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.820
The salt does very helpful things.

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.760
So the first thing the
salt does is it starts

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.980
to pull juice out of the vegetables--

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.450
osmosis.

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:48.280
The second thing the salt does is, what
makes vegetables crispy are pectins,

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.480
and salt hardens the pectin.

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.380
So it makes the vegetables crispier.

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.830
The third thing is, if you
from vegetables for a long time

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:00.760
or in a warm environment
or certain vegetables--

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.440
mostly watery, summer vegetables
like cucumbers and zucchini,

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.490
they'll get very soft, very
quickly when you ferment them.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.172
What makes the vegetables soft--

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:13.880
and it'll happen with sauerkraut
too if you do it for a long time

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.250
or in a warm environment.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.220
What makes the vegetables
get soft are a class

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.970
of enzymes called pectinase enzymes
that break down the pectins,

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:26.740
and salt slows down
the pectinase enzymes.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.100
It also slows down the
lactic acid bacteria.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:33.220
And when your objective is
preservation, slowing down the process

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.040
is actually very helpful.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.660
So salt does all these wonderful things.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.360
But you don't need a lot of salt.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.585
So, OK, I squeeze the vegetables until--

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.677
oh, you can't really
get it on the camera.

01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:50.260
What if I go--

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.970
no.

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:52.506
Oh.

01:00:52.506 --> 01:00:56.910
[LAUGH] OK.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:02.740
Can you see that, when I'm squeezing
the vegetables, it's like a wet sponge

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.390
and all this juice is coming out.

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:09.580
That's when you know that it's juicy
enough to get the vegetables submerged.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:15.160
You could measure the salt.
The generic proportion

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:20.860
that is repeated over and over again
in the literature is 2% salt by weight.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.780
But you don't need to.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.470
Just lightly salt it.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.580
It's always easier to add salt
than it is to subtract salt.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.159
As for a vessel, a
glass is perfect, a jar.

01:01:31.159 --> 01:01:33.700
Wide mouth is a little bit easier
to deal with than something

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.720
with a narrower neck.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:40.450
But you can do it in a mayonnaise
jar, and it would be totally fine.

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:42.850
You can use ceramic crocks.

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:44.680
You can use wooden barrels.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.350
You can use plastic buckets.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:50.500
The material you really
want to avoid is metal

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:56.305
because we're using salt as we cultivate
bacteria that are producing acids.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.720
And both salt and acids
can corrode metal.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.710
And while stainless steel
theoretically resists corrosion,

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.860
it turns out that household
grade stainless steel just

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.800
has a thin coating that's stainless.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:18.240
And anywhere where it gets
scratched, it'll start to corrode.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.780
Then the million dollar
question in fermentation

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.180
is how long do you ferment it.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.080
And there's just there's
no straightforward

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.100
answer to that question.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.650
The acids accumulate over time.

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:32.470
As a survival food, people
in a temperate environment

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:38.960
might make this in September, October,
November, depending on where they live

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.780
and keep eating it through the next
spring when there's fresh vegetables.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:47.770
It doesn't mean you have to
wait for six months to eat it.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:51.370
It means it's still
good after six months,

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:55.330
particularly if you have a nice
cool place where you can store it.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.572
So you just fill the jar,
then fill it some more.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:59.530
You don't want to fill
it to the very, very top

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:04.150
because it's going to produce carbon
dioxide and expand a little bit,

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:05.920
and we don't want it to all spill out.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:12.010
You can see, as I press
down, the juice is rising up.

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:13.520
I chopped up too much.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.210
It takes about two pounds of
vegetables to fill a quart

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:22.500
sized jar, a kilo for a liter.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.180
So now the vegetables are
submerged under liquid.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.770
There'll be more liquid tomorrow.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.560
No matter how much liquid
there is, the vegetables

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.800
are going to want to float to the
top, like our bodies in the ocean.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.200
So what I like to do is--

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.660
I mean, there's all kinds of
gadgets people are making.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.790
Somebody just gave me
pickled pebbles that

01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:46.550
are like these little glass disks that
go in the jar and hold everything down.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:49.740
A ceramicist friend of
mine made me some little

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.370
ceramic disks to do the same thing.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:55.850
But the good old-fashioned
improvisational method

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:59.840
is to take one of the outer leaves of
the cabbage that has a strong spine,

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.910
use that almost like a
spring, stuffing it in,

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:12.160
get the little spines stuck
under the shoulders of the jar,

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.050
and let it hold everything down.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:19.420
And then if it peeks up, it
can be sort of sacrificial.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:25.090
I say sacrificial because we're
protecting it from oxygen,

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:26.680
and there's a surface.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.660
There's a place where
it's meeting the oxygen.

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.980
There are all kinds of
clever vessel designs

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.210
that are engineered to protect
the surface from oxygen.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:41.580
But OK, how many people here
have ever fermented vegetables?

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.824
How many of you have ever had
any funky surface growth develop?

01:04:44.824 --> 01:04:46.115
Oh, look, it's the same people.

01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:51.920
So I mean the vulnerable
place is the surface.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:56.150
That's where your protected
environment meets the oxygen.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:05:00.140
And where the oxygen is all these
other forms of life can develop,

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.750
most prominently molds.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:09.440
So the funky surface growth can be
a combination of yeasts and molds.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.120
Almost always the molds are
white molds that will get darker

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.760
as they mature and sporulate.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.400
I don't want anyone to go
home thinking they heard

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.760
me say it's OK to eat any kind of mold.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:28.130
But because there are definitely molds
that are extremely, extremely toxic

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:32.060
and you definitely don't want to
touch any like bright colored mold,

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.630
but molds that start out white
and stay in a monochromatic range

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.250
are generally regarded as safe.

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:39.440
Everybody scrapes them off the top.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.250
Remove any discolored or
softened vegetables near the top.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.040
And what's underneath it is fine.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.990
And this is sort of like repeated
throughout the literature.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:53.870
And I mean, just the fact that
I've been doing this for 15 years

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:57.680
and never had anybody say
I followed your advice

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.045
and then my friend with extreme
mold sensitivity has had a reaction.

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:04.640
It just makes me feel
increasingly confident that they

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.910
were totally, totally harmless.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:14.830
And just everybody who does
this has this experience,

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.840
and it's not a problem.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.412
OK, I could go on and on
and maybe I will but--

01:06:20.412 --> 01:06:23.120
PIA SORENSEN: But how about we--
thank you all of you for coming,

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.510
and thank you, Sandor.
