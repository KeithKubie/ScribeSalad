00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.840
So, we've explained matter.
We've explained the universe out there.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.910
Well, not quite.
We've explained between about 1 and 10% of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.440
it.
There's a little bit, you know, the majority

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.020
of it,
is some mysterious stuff called dark matter.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.490
Now this is very odd.
There's stars or stuff out there that we cannot

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.960
see yet we know that it's there.
Now how on earth do we know that?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.329
Let me show you a picture.
This is a picture of a spiral galaxy.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.449
It's just like a Catherine wheel going around
on firework night.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.989
You can get the feeling of the thing whirling
around like this.

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.739
It's not just a feeling of it whirling around,
it actually is.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.170
How do we know that?
Well we go and look at the lights being emitted

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.670
from the stars.
Remember, when we were whirling around,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.840
and you heard the pitch going up and down
as it came toward you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.739
and went away from you?
Same thing with this.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.850
You look at the light from the stars on the
edge of this spiral galaxy.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.070
And you find some have been shifted towards
the blue,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.560
as if they're coming towards you, and some
have gone to the red,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.200
as they go away.
So from this you get the feeling that this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.400
whole galaxy is swirling around.
And you can measure the speed that it's swirling

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.690
around.
We can also weigh it.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.740
And what we find is that when you weight the
galaxy

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.240
and compare it with the speed it's whirling
around, the sums don't add up.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.710
Let me show you what I mean.
I asked Bryson to make a galaxy for us and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.670
he's obliged.
And this is what happens with a spiral galaxy.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.450
The thing is rotating around and there's some
stars sitting there quite happily.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.300
But what's supposed to happen according to
our sums, is the following thing -

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.030
If the sums are right, the stars should just
fly off because it's going around so fast.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.890
Yet they don't.
Let's just look at this picture again.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.240
So we see these stars whirling around and
staying in the galaxy.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.260
Yet when we look at all the matter in the
middle,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.560
the amount of gravitational tug that it can
provide to hold them on the trail, isn't enough.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.480
Those stars have no right to stay there, they
should just fly off the wheel

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.550
like in Bryson's demonstration.
How do they stay in place?

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.390
There must be a much bigger tug going on to
hold them there.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.610
Provided by stars that we can't see.
Dark matter.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.150
Now, it's not just this one galaxy that's
got this problem,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.030
there are many, many like this.
And not just individual galaxies. We see galaxies

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.210
and galaxies rotating around each other.
And we begin to find that the sums don't quite

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.400
balance.
It really does look as if there's this dark

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.370
matter in the universe, maybe 90% of it.
Now how on Earth do we go and look for dark

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.170
matter?
Well one way is by analogy with H.G. Wells

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.550
story about the invisible man.
You didn't see him directly, but when he bumped

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.370
in to things,
you were aware of his presence indirectly.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.190
That's the sort of thing we're doing here.
Now what is really exciting is that as I was

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.090
preparing these lectures,
the first news came out that perhaps the first

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.620
sightings of dark matter have been made.
And this is shown in these pictures that were

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.020
published just a month or two ago.
Some astronomers were looking at some stars.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.520
And it's been processed through the computer.
You can see these little pixels to show the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.450
stars.
I want you to focus on this star in the middle,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.790
and we're going to play in a moment
we'll show what happened over a period of

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.690
weeks.
So this was at the beginning of a period of

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.560
time.
Now a few weeks later this had happened.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.950
Suddenly it was brighter in the middle.
And then a bit later still it had dimmed away

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.320
again.
So there you are on Earth, looking out at

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.980
a star in the distant heavens.
And suddenly it gets brighter and goes away.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.450
Now what's going on?
The idea is that a dark star has become between

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.950
you and it.
Sounds very odd. Let's just look at this again,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.230
fast,
to convince ourselves that it is brightening

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:23.600
and going away again.
So that's what was seen.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.341
How on Earth can it be that a dark star has
come

00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:29.630
between you eyes and that distant star and
made it brighter.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.730
You'd think that it would block it out.
No!

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.320
Another of Bryson's amazing replications of
the universe here

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.910
will show us how this really works.
Now this might look to you like just a sheet

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.350
of latex rubber.
In actual fact this is the universe.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.680
And at this end, we have got the astronomer
who's going to be looking out at a distant

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.230
star.
And at this end we have the star.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.580
Now can I have a volunteer to send me some
light beams from the star?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.750
Would you like to have a go?
Right, what's your name?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.180
Hello, Paul.
Now could you just roll a couple of balls

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.220
from here.
First of all just roll one straight so we

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.470
can get the idea across the flat plane.
So you see this would just come straight in

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.280
to the telescope waiting to receive it.
Now let's see what happens when I put the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.210
dark star in the middle.
Fire one straight at it again. See what happens.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.091
It hits, you see. You don't see that one.
But let's see what happens to a light beam

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.140
that goes slightly to the side.
You want to move that slightly to the side,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.000
that's right.
Now let's see what happens with this.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.900
You pick it up, you detect it. It's got bent.
Let's try with a light beam on the other side.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.510
Fire it a light beam.
That also got bent.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.040
So suddenly you are seeing more than you would
have done before.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.750
Thanks very much.
