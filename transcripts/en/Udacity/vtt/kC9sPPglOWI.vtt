00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.830
So, where are we now?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.130
&gt;&gt; We're in a Asana, and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.360
this list over here is everything that I wanted to cover in this course.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so arrays in JavaScript are just like lists.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.610
In this case, the zero item is Intro, after that, we have GitHub and so on.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.170
&gt;&gt; I'm really glad you said zeroing because JavaScript arrays are zero index.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they sure are.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.020
Let's take a look.

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.930
Arrays are just lists of values and they behave the same as lists in Python.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.200
We start lists with the same syntax as before, with var and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.980
then the name of the array, followed by an equals sign.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.960
The array will be defined by these square brackets with items inside,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.060
separated by commas.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.030
Let's make an array of skills, this could be really useful on our resumes later.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.580
So I'll go ahead and start with var skills and then I'll start with awesomeness.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.200
&gt;&gt; That's not a skill, dude.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.550
&gt;&gt; It actually is if you check my LinkedIn profile.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.880
Then I've got programming, teaching and JavaScript, all separated by commas.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.700
I'll go ahead and append the skills to the page, save it,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.270
come over here, hit Refresh and we can see it on the page.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.470
It's not separated by any commas or spaces here, because we

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.420
didn't have any commas or spaces within the strings, in our skills array.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.570
And we can see that we have now,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.950
just awesomeness added to the end, of our array.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.680
Let's say I just wanted to append the first item,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.980
awesomeness, to the page instead.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.260
I'll start by commenting out this line, and then using bracket notation

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.790
I'll append the zeroth item of the skills array to the main div on the page.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330
I'll go ahead and save this, come over to the browser and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.740
hit Refresh, and we can see that we just have awesomeness on

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.860
the page now because we used bracket notation.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.390
&gt;&gt; Nice, one cool thing is that JavaScript gives us a way of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.320
accessing properties about the array.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.360
In fact, you should give it a try, let's take a quiz.
