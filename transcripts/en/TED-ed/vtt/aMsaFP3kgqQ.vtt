00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.656
This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.856
has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.096
But why?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.096
It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right?

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.336
Wrong!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.016
Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.176
I know how to calculate
the area of a circle.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.376
I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.856
I also know how to take
the area of a square.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.656
I multiply the base by itself.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.856
But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.256
This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle"

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.416
that was first proposed
in the ancient world.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.416
And like many ideas of the ancient world,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.576
it was given new life
during the Renaissance.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.056
As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.456
because of the nature of pi,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.856
but that's another story.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.096
Leonardo's sketch,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.416
which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.416
places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.456
Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.896
and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.256
a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.256
Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.936
have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.776
thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.536
Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.216
to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.440
using mankind as the area for both shapes.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.616
Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.416
There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.016
This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.656
developed by Plato and Aristotle,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.456
called "The Great Chain of Being."

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.896
This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.296
and that chain starts at the top with God,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.016
then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.256
before ending with demons and devils.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.096
Early in this philosophic movement,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.696
it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.296
Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.656
we divide the universe nicely in half.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.735
Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.416
a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.216
He pried mankind off the chain

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.376
and claimed that humans
have a unique ability

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.936
to take any position they want.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.936
Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.856
the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.696
This led to the creation of mankind,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.856
which he placed
at the center of the universe

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.336
with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.256
Mankind, according to Pico,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.736
could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.136
or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.496
it's our choice.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.856
Looking back at the sketch,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.336
we can see that by changing
the position of the man,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.296
he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.936
If geometry is the language
the universe is written in,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.136
then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.816
Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.336
and philosophically as well.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.736
In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.776
the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.576
and artistic skill of his age.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.640
No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.
